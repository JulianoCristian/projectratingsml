tXPORT CROPS PROJ2CT
(LOAN 2414-JM)
PREFACE
1.        This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Export Crops
Project in Jamaica, for which Loan 2414-JM in the amount of US$15.1 million
was approved on Zjay 17. 1984. TITe Loan was closed on September 30, 1989 on
schedule.  Overall, 99% of the Loan was dlsbursed (US$14.93 million) and
US$169,413.09 was cancelled effectiv- February 28. 1990. Final disbursement
took place on July 19, 1989.
25        The PCR was jointly prepared by the Agriculture Sector Operations
Division of Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
3.        Preparation of the PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in October 1989, and is based. inter alfa,
on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Project Agreements; Supervision
Reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
JAMAICA
EXPORT CROPS PROJECT
(LOAN 2414-Jl)
EVALUATIO03 SUMMAf.Y
Obiectives
1.    The overall objectives of the project were to expand production and
promote marketing of export crops by providing credit, support services
(technical assistance, training, adaptive research and market studies), and
infrastructure for the banana and cigar tobacco subsectors (parr.. 3.01).
Implementation Experience
2.    The Loan became effective on September 5, 1984 and the Closing Date was
September 30, 1989, both as planned. Of the potential risks identified by the
appraisal mission (para. 5.02), the weather was the only significant factor
impacting on the project, i.e., severe floods during 1986 and Hurricane
Gilbert's devastation of the island in September 1988. The project suffered
from insufficient counterpart funds during the first two years, which slowed
the initial pace of project execution. At appraisal it was anticipated that
the Government of Jamaica (GOJ).would finance 50% of the investment credit
needs and 35% of the civil works costs. However, due to GOJ's fiscal
constraints, the Bank agreed, in November 1986, to amend the Loan Agreement to
increase the disbursement percentages against subloans to 80% from 35% and to
60% from 35% for civil works. Also a Special Account was established to help
expedite the project. These actions increased the rate of disbursements and
greatly improved the pace of project implementation (paras. 5.03, 6.05 and
8.01).
Results
3.    Total project cost was US$23.2 million, 57% of the appraisal estimate,
due largely to the Bank's disbursement of a higher percentage than anticipated
at appraisal. Overall, 992 of Bank funds were disbursed (i.e.,
US$14.9 million versus US$15.1 million) (para. 6.13). Credit Component. The
Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB), a new credit institution at the time the
project was initiated, was the executing agency for this component. The ACB
was to channel the credit funds to approved financial intermediaries (API) for
onlending to sub-borrowers (para. 6.01). By project closing, about
US$10.2 million equivalent of credit had been.provided. This was only about
46% of the level anticipated at appraisal, due to sub-borrowers' investing
higher percentage of total investment costs. Part II (Borrower's perspective)
shows US$19.9 million were costs for credit component. This figure includes



- iv -
costs in addition to counterpart funds and Bank disbursements. Such costs
include expenditures for rehabilitation after the hurricane of 1988. Parts I
and III do not include such additional costa. About orns-third of the credit
went for financing sugarcane, while other important crops financad were
citrus, export quality coffee, tobacco, banana, vegetables, ornamental plants,
and coconuts (pars. 6.02, Table 6). During the early part of the project,
delays occurred in ACB's disbursement to sub-borrowers due to problemo such as
tho requirewant for joint subloan appraisals with financial intermediaries and
the excessive time involved in appraisal And processing of *ubloan
applications (para. 6.03). Howevor, these problems lessoned when an investment
advisor was hired by the ACB (para. 6.05). Also, on the positive side, the
above joint subproject review contributed to the sound evaluation of
investment proposals (para. 6.03). Infrastructure Component. The
construction of export facilities were completed, but with a two-year delay
due to the GOJ's severe fiscal constraints and repair work required after
Hurricane Gilbert. In November 1986, when the Bank increased the rate of
disbursement for civil works from 352 to 60%, construction of the facilities
was accelerated. Unf3rtunately, the facilities became fully operational only
at project closing (para. 6.06).
4.    Technical Assistance and Trainina Component.  Project-financed
technical assistance (315 man-months of foreign experts) was provided by the
Food and Agriculture Organization (PAO). In general, the performance of the
experts was satisfactory, although delays in recruiting some staff, combined
with lack of counterpart staff, diminished the effectivoness of the tachnical
assistance (para. 6.07). A training program was initiated during 1985 and
about 1,000 persons participated in tachnical courses, seminars, and field
days (para. 6.08).  Adaotive Research Component. Tha implementation of this
component took more time than anticipated due to frequent administrative
changes in the Research Division of the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAG). The
research infrastructure was complatad by project closing (para. 6.09), too
lata for technical assistance under the projoct to be helpful in getting it
operational. Although some studi4l were carried out, most of them wera
financed by sources othor than tho Bank. Sevaral studies related to packaging
and plant protection for bananas and pricing and marketing for tobacco and
coconuts were canceled due to the privatiwation of the banana and tobacco
subsectors, and to the financing of coconut studies by the Coconut Industry
Board (para. 6.10, Table 7). Tho project also financed vehicles and equipment
through an emergency flood assistance yrogram, which was set up by means of a
loan amendment after the sevors floods of 1986. The performance of this
cumponent was judged to bo satisfactory (para. 6.11).
5.    The internal rate of return calculated for four crops (irrigated banana,
planted citrus, Blue Mountain coffee and sugarcane) ranging betweon 82 and
502, and the project's economic rate of return of 352 compare favorably with
appraisal estimates of 13 to 272 for tho internal rates of return and 212 for
the economic rate of return (para. 6.15).



Sustainability
6.    There are good prospects for sustainability of benefits.  Indeed, both
the trade regime and the financial sector have been the subj.ct of
considerable reforms aimed at improving the economic efficiency of th.
agricultural sector, in connection with the recently approved Agriculture
Sector Adjustment Loan (3174-JM). Credit funds for export crops have also
been provided through a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
A follow-up project, now under preparation by the Bank, will give particular
attention to improving the extension services supporting small-scale farmers
(para. 7.01).
Lessons Learned
7.    The main lessons from this project that may be relevant to other Bank-
financed projects in Jamaica are:
(i)     The fiscal constraints of Government need to be given very careful
consideration in designing investment projec s. Use of a project
account, with a balance sufficient to permit two to three months of
project implementation, could have helped in overcoming counterpart
funding problems. In this project, the lack of timely counterpart
funds delayed completion of the project infastructure by two years.
Likewise, the technical assistance program Lad to be extended, and
lack of funding for counterparts reduced the effectiveness of the
assistance (paras. 5.03 and 9.02).
(ii)    The improvements that came from having an "investment advisor"'
suggest that, in similar projects, this type of technical assistance
can be very useful. Indeed this experience has been replicated in a
similar project in Grenada (Cr. 1558-GRD), and is now planned for
Barbados (Ln. 2782-BAR). Such assistance has been very valuable in
contacting 1.,tential sub-borrowers and in developing credit
operation manuals, covering subloan appraisal requirements, as well
as procedural steps designed to accelerate subloan processing. In
this project, the hiring of the ACB's investment advisor
contributed to improved mobilization of credit funds to farmers
(paras. 6.03, 6.05 and 9.02).
(iii)   Greater attention should be given to ensuring that prior to project
implementation (say, as conditions of Board Presentation, or at
least effectiveness) basic requirements for the project's
implementation are in place. In this project, several essential
details, such as staffing and organization of the ACB, acquisition
of land title for building construction, and the establishment of
mechanisms for monitoring and supervision of enterprises financed
with project subloans, were left to be resolved during
implementation 6f the project, causing considerable delays
(paras. 6.03, 9.01 and 9.02).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.        Pro1ect Identity
Project Name:        Export Crops Project
Loan No.:            2414-JM
RVP Unit:            Latin America and the Caribbean Region
Country:             Jamaica
Sector:              Agriculture
Subsector:           Export Crops
2.        Background
2.01      An important objective of the agricultural public sector has been to
increase the volume and value of agricultural exports, as vell as to
substitute some food imports to help decrease the balance of trade deficit of
the agricultural sector   In the context of its overall structural adjustment
program, which emphasizes the deregulation of the economy, greater private
sector participation and improved incentives for xports, the Government of
Jamaica (GOJ) has been attempting to bring about recovery and rapid expansion
in export agriculture. The GO has also taken a number of steps to streamline
and diminish the role of the GOJ in the agricultural sector and rehabilitate
the traditional export crous of sugar and bananas. The project was designed
to respond to sector objectives of export expansion and intensive export crop
production. It was designed to complement the reform programs supported under
SAL I (Loan 2105-3M) and SAL I1 (Loan 2315-1M).
3.        Prolect Obiectives and DescriDtion
3.01      The overall objectives of the project were to expand production and
promote marketing of export crops by providing credit, necessary support
services, and infrastructure. These objectives were to be achieved by
components designed to provide: (a) medium- and long-term farm credit to
export crop growers; (b) infrastructure, including upgrading and improving
boxing plants and port facilities for banana shipping, shed and storage
facilities in airports, plant protection facilities, and production and
processing facilities for cigar tobacco; (c) technical assistance to
strengthen research and extension activities, to build up a plant protection
advisory unit, and to strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAG), the
Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB) and the External Marketing Organizations
(EMOs); (d) market studies, promotion and feasibility studies for export

crops, and adaptive research on problems af ecting export crop productions and
(a) training of agricultural managers, technicians, and professionals.
4.        Proiect Desian and Oreanization
4.01      The project was carefully defined in scope and understood by all
relevant parties. It took two years to finalize the preparation stage, duo
mainly to a shortage of qualified local technicians and the problems related
to project organization and staffing of the Project Management Unit (PMU) and
the ACS.   The determination of the roles and responsibilities of the
institutions involved, especially for the RHO. and the ACB, were the most time
consuming. Clearly, the newness of the ACB influenced tho slow process of
preparation. Issues, such as defining credit demand, financial
intermediaries' pirticipation, and defining the GOJ's land divestment
policies, were of concern during project preparation.
5.        Prolect Implgmentation
5.01      Effectiveness and Closina Date. The Loan became effective on
September 5, 1984, as planned.  The Closing Date was September 30, 1989, also
as planned.
5.02      Prolect Risks.  Of the potential risks identified by the appraisal
mission (such as weather, pests, and diseases; c-chnological and production
risks from shortage of basic farm inputs; institutional risks from
inefficiencies of some agencies; and unforeseen changes iu international
.markets), the weather was the only significant factor impacting on the
project, i.e., severe floods during 1986 and Hurricane Gilbart's devastation
of the island on September 12, 1988.
5.03      Factors that Affected Project Implementation.  The factor that most
affected project implementation was the insufficient and unreliable flow of
counterpart funds. In retrompect, Bank expectation that the Government of
Jamaica (OJ) would provide local counterpart financing of about SO of the
investment credit and 352 of the civil works, wa too optimistic in the light
of COJ's severe fiscal constraints at the time. After the second year of
project implementation, the Bank agreed, on November 17, 1986, to emend the
Loan Agreaemnt for purposes of increasing the disburs.  nt parcentagos for the
provision of subloans and civil works, and for setting _,, of a Special Account
to finance local as well as foreign exchange expenditures (paras. 6.05, 6.06
and 8.01).
6.        Progect Results
6.01      Credit Comon-nt.  The major component under the project was the
provision of medium- and long-term credit to sub-borrowers for expanding farm
production of crops for export or import substitution. The executing agency
for the agricultural credit component of the project was the AC'B whose
function was to wholesale funds to approved financial intermadiaries (API) in
Jamaica for onlanding to sub-borrowers. Ten financial intermediaries
participated. This component provided the only source of long-term financing



-3-
for agriculture in the country and was directed principally at farmers with
medium- and large-size farms.
6.02      At project closing, only about 462 of the originally intended credit
had beon provided (about US$10.2 million equivalent) due to the higher
disbursement percentage of Bank funds. Part I (Borruwer's perspective) shows
US$19.9 million were costs for credit component. This figure includes costs
in addition to counterpart funds and Bank disbursements. Such costs include
xpenditures for rehabilitation after the Hurricane of 1988. Part I and II do
not include such additional costs. About $88 of the Bank credit funds
earmarked for the credit component have been disbursed (Table 4). About 302
of the credit went for financing sugarcane, along with 18S for citrus, 132 for
xport quality coffeo, 11S for tobacco, 111 for banana, 102 for vegotables, 6S
for ornamental plants, and 1S for coconuts (Table 6)..
6.03      Although there was great demand for iuvestment credit throughout
projoct implemntation, this component moved slowly in the first two years.
Apart from the lack of counterpart funds, the following factors contributed to
the initial delays: (a) ACB was a new credit institution with weak
organization and management. It vas understaffed and lacked experienced
staff; (b) ACB required joint appraisals with the financial intermediaries for
all projects, regardless of the subloan amount. This involved excessive time;
(c) ACB disbursement aftor subloan approva-l was very slow. The flow of pap-r
for credit delivery took 13 steps that, at best, was completed in 17 weeks;
and (d) feasibility studies and crodit documentation submitted by the
financial intermediaries were of poor quality. The focus of API's analysis
was an the quality of securities rather than on the returns of the proposed
investment. Some problems still prevail, such as tho inadequate monitoring
and supervision of the enterprises financed with project subloans; and the
A9I's lack of adequate and timely reporting on the status of these lending
operations (including arrears). Howevor, the joint appraisal system, in which
ACB and the financial intermediaries participatedt, greatly improved the
evaluation of subprojects, contributing to the overall satisfactory
performance of subprojects.  Also, the overall arrears position o; financial
intermediaries has been reported to be gonerslly low.
6.04      To a large extent the sub-borrowers under the project were
enterprises involving business people, and large-scale farmers. Of a total of
182 11 beneficiaries, 102, or approximately 562 were corporate entitie&.
These borrowers,'therefore, had a diversified income base. Discussions with
the managers of the commercial Banks revealed that the incidence of arrears on
individual accounts was generally quite low. This good performance is due in
part to the good returns on the ventures financed, but also very likely
because sub-borrowers had access to resources othor than those gonerated by
the project to repay the loans and hnces avoid or reduce the incidence of
default. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the success of the
1/ Excludes the sugar industry authority which had tvao block
loans for a number of farmers.



- 4 -
credit component, in to-.s of recoveries, is due to the diversified income
bass of sub-borrowers, and the good financial returns.
6.05      In November 1986, the Bank increased the disbureement percentage of
the credit component from 35S to 802, and agroed to ACB's recruitment of an
experienced investment advisor to improve the quality and efficiency of
project subloan appraisals. The demand for credit was enhanced by the
"favorAblo" interest rate structure even though the expected level of credit
was not achieved. Although the level of interest rates to the ultimate sub-
borrower were positive (152 plus one percentage point comitment fea at the
end of 1986), they were low in comparison with ongoing commercial rates (252
and over) (para. 6.14). Other contributing factors to enhanced demand for
credit weres (i) tho floods during 1986 which destroyed many plantations; and
(ii) Hurricane Gilbert, which, in September 1988, devastated the island. In
both instances the "project" became the means to finance the needed
rehabilitation. The Bank's Part I and III do not include the additional costs
for rehabilitation after the Hurricane; however, the GOJ's Part II considers
the "project" to include these additional rehabilitation costs, hence their
cost-tables show a higher figure.
6.06      Infraitructurs.  The export facilities (shadehouse, cold storage) at
the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston were completed and
subsequently leased to a private firm.   There were, however, delays of about
two years due to the time involved in acquisition of land title for building
construction, and the subsequent repair work required after Hurricane Gilbert.
Likewise, the plant quarantine facilities at Bodles were completed and the
equipment installed. However, these facilities were completed only at the end
of the project. Supporting quarantine procedures and GOJ's commitment to
enforce quarantine regulations will be necessary if the utility of the Bodles
quarantine facilities is to be realized. The two incinerators (at Kingston
and Montego Bay) were installed, although the GOJ's severe fiscal constraints
also contributed to delays in their construction. The dcision by the Bank in
November 1986 to increase the rate of disbursement for civil works from 352 to
602 greatly accelerated the pace of construction. The program for limited
rehabilitation of the banana loading facilities at Port Antonio wsa not
implemented because the GOJ decided to completely overhaul these facilities
and to use another source of financing. Upgrading of the banana boxing plant
and the provision of a fermenting house, irrigation facilities, and drying
barns for cigar tobacco production did not take place because of the
privatization of the Banana Company of Jamaica (BANCO) and the Tobacco
Industry Control Authority (TICA) (Table 7).
6.07      Technical Assistance and Trainint.  An *greement between the GOJ and
PAO for the provision of project-financed technical assistance was signed in
April 1984. PAO provided about 315 man-months of internationally recruited
experts at a cost of US$2.6 million for a duration of 3.5 years.   he
recruitment of some experts took more time than anticipated, hence delaying
the planned operational activities. Because of delays in the completion of
the civil works, it was necessary to extend the contracts of some experts.
The performance of the PAO technical assistance team was mixed, the majority



being satisfactory, but a fw of them experienced difficulties due largely to
the lack of counterpart staffing.
6.08      During 1985, a training program was initiated by the PMU to address
the shortage of trained middle level managers in the agriculture public
service. The PAO experts also trained their respective local counterpart
specialists.  About 1,000 persons, subloan beneficiaries included,
participated in technical courses, seminars, and field days during project
implementation.
6.09      Adaptive Research.  The execution of this component lagged behind
schedule because of administrative changes in the Research and Development
Division of MINAG and the inability of that Division to recruit and retain
qualified personnel. A number of experiments were damaged by Hurricane
Gilbert and in the latter years of project implementation the research program
was financed by other sources. The research infrastructure envisaged at
appraisal was completed, but was subsequently damaged by Hurricane Gilbert.
It has now been rehabilitated. Houwver, it was completed too late for
technical asjistance under the project to be helpful in getting it
operational.
6.10      Studies.  Market studies were to be financed under the project to
assist export crop development. Although some studies were carried out in the
first two years of project implementation (as in the case of the adaptive
research), most of them were finncead by othef sources. Several studies
related to packaging and plant protection for bananss, and marketing and
pricing for tobacco and coconuts were cancelled due to the privatization of
the banana and tobacco subsectors and the financing of the coconut studies by
the Coconut Industry Board (Table 7).
6.11      The Emertency Flood Assistance Proatram.  By means of a loan
amendment, the Bank financed under the project the acquisition and utilization
of land preparation equipment and vehicles after the savere floods of 1986
(para. 8.01). The performance of this component was considered satisfactory.
6.12      Support Services.  HINAG had the overall responsibility for project
activities and implementation. Project support and assistance was provided to
and through the EMOs and other growers' organizations. The PHU was
established during 1985 and the individuals occupying the posts of Project
Director, Project Administrator, Project Accountant and Project Secretary
remained in those posts throughout the life of the project. This contributed
significantly to timely project implementation.
6.13      Loan Administration.  The total project cost was US$23.2 million
equivalent, 572 of the appraisal estimate. As stated in paragraph 5.03, the
Bank expected that the GOJ would finance about 502 of investment credit costs.
The actual GOJ financing was only about 20S of credit costs due mainly to
constraints imposed by the pervasive lack of counterpart funds. Overall, 992
of Bank funds were disbursed (USS14.9 million versus US$15.1 million), with
the pace of disbursements picking up in 1988/89 (average 912 of allocated
amounts disbursed each year as compared to average 442 for previous three



-6-
years 1985/87). The Loan Agreement modifications of November 1986 and
Septembor 1988 greatly facilitated the flow of disbursement funds (paras.
6.05, 6.06, and 8.01 and Tables 3, 4 and 6). Quarterly reports were presented
to the Bank; however, they did not provide actual statistical information on
the credit component nor on crop production and productivity. Also lacking
was information on market prices, inputs and labor costs in the different
areas of Jmaica. Audit reports were satisfactory. Procurement of vehicles
and equipment was satisfactory and no major problems were encountered.
6.14      The Borrower complied with the main sections of the Loan Agreement.
Covenants (4.04, Schedules 1 (4)(b) and 2 Part B (1) and (2)) for banana and
tobacco infrastructure were no longer warranted due to the privatization of
these two subsectors (Table 8). However, the interest rate to sub-borrowers
was established by the GOJ without prior approval by the Bank: This was not
in accordance with the Project Agr me nt which required a review by the Bank
of the interest rates and, if necessary, as a result of such review, revision
in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. (Interest rates to farmers moved from
181 before 1986, to 1S2 as of May 1986). While the Bank did not pursue the
interest rate question in the context of this loan, it was tackled at the
maero level and, more specifically, through an Agriculture Sector Adjustment
Loan (ASAL) (Ln. 3174-JM). The goal of the ASAL, and that of a follow-on
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan, now under preparation, has been to have all
interest rates on directed credit linked to market rates. Coupled with this
goal, the intention is to eliminate most existing credit subsidies and to
introduce a system of accounting in the development banking system which would
make credit subsidies transparent in order that those that remain could be
reduced to an affordable level.
6.15      Prolect  mpact.   While data is lacking to do a thorough analysis of
the project's impact, an attempt was made to do so based on the results of
crop models for farms of the most comcon crops for which subloans were
extended under the project.  The results (Table 5) show IRls calculated for
irrigated banana, planted citrus, Blue Mountain coffee and sugarcane, which
aecounted for about 722 of disbursements, ranged between 81 and 501 as
compared with appraisal *etba-tee which ranged from 131 to 271. The economic
rate of return for the directly productive aspects of the project has been
calculated at 35, which compares favorably with the 212 estimated during
appraisal. The improvements in yields and output prices accounted for the
above satisfactory results as compared to appraisal assumptions. The dmage
from the Hurricane was ia fact quite temporary for the banana and coffee crops
and quite low for the citrus crops (Table 5 footnotes). Within a year or two
after the Hurricane thtre were signs that the crops were very profitable as
the sub-borrowers were obviously doing well and more investors sought to gOt
into banana, coffee, citrus and sugarcane. As of 1991, the crops are
gonerally perceived as highly profitable and there is considerable pressure
for land suitable for these crops. The price of land is now much higher than
it was in 1984 or even 1989.



- 7-
7.        Proiect Sustainabil tv
7.01      There are good prospects for sustainability of benefits, provided
that adequate credit funds are available to continue the lending program. The
subsequent complementary reforms in the financial sector and in the trade
regime affecting agriculture, initiated under the ASAL, will be important in
sustaining efficient growth in the sector. Full benefits to producers are
still in the process of being reached because plantations have not achieved
full production development due to adverse weather conditions leading to
extension of iubloan paymen.s needed for rehabilitation works.  Further
funding for maintaining the flow of agriculture credit, both long and short
term, is ezpected to be provided through a loan from the Inter-American
Devolopment Bank (IDB), currently under discussion in the context of Booking
further alignment of agricultural lending rates with market interest rates.
A follow-up project, now under preparation by the Bank, will givo particular
attention to improving the extension services supporting small-scale farmers.
8.        Bank Performance
8.01      Bank performance was satisfactory throughout the project cycle.
However, the appraisal mission was too optimistic in estimating the GOJ's
capacity to provide counterpart funding. Relations between the Bank, MIaG,
ACB, API, EMOs, and other farmers' organizations were cordial at all times.
The Bank acted flexibly in responding, on four occasions, to the Government's
requests to amend the Loan Agreement tot (i) finance additional consultants'
services for the sugar sector (November 7, 1984); (ii) remove the subloan
ceiling of US$300,000 (Section 2.02 (b) of the Loan Agreement) (May 9, 1986);
(iii) increase the disburseamnt percentage for the provision of subloans for
the development of any eligible export or import substitution crops as well as
for civil works, permit the ACB to employ an investment advisor through to
project completion, finance equipmnt and vehicles for the emrgency flood
assistance program, and establish a Special Account (November 17, 1986); and
(iv) reallocate loan funds to Category 3, consultant fees, training and
research (Septmber 2, 1988).
9.        Borrower Performance
9.01      Important institutional changes occurred during project
implementation, such as the divostment of the Government-owned EMOs (the
Banana Company of Jamaica (BANCO) and the Tobacco Industry Control Authority
(TICA). This resulted in some deviation from the project's initial
objectives, but the privatization of these industries was a positive step.
The performance of NINAG was mixed. While the PHU performed reasonably
satisfactorily, the same canot be said for the Research and Development
Division, primarily because the adaptive research has not led to further
action (para. 6.09). The ACB proved to be an inexperienced institution,
lacking both an aggressive lending philosophy and an adequate and capable
professional staff to properly screen and analyze the large volume of sublosn
applications. The long delays in processing subloans have had a disruptive
effect on investors' plans. This project was the Bank's first direct



- 8 -
involvement with the ACB, the GOJ's specializod financial institution for
agriculture.
9.02      The main lessons, for both the Bank and the Borrower, that may be
relevant to other Bank-financed projects in Jamaica ares (i) the fiscal
constiaints of Government need to be given vory careful consideration in
designing investment projects. Use of a project account, with a balance
sufficient to pormit two to three months of project implementation, could have
helped in overcoming counterpart funding problms. In this project, tho lack
of timely counterpart funds delayed completion of the project infrastructure
by two years and, as a consequence, the technical assistance program had to be
extended; (ii) the improvements that came from having an "investment advisor"
suggest that, in similar projects, this type of technical assistance can be
very useful.  Indeed this experience has been replicated in a similar project
in Grenada (Cr. 1558-CGRD) and is planned for Barbados (Ln. 2782-BAR), where an
investment advisor has been very valuable in contacting potential borrowers
and in developing credit operations manual covering subloan appraisals
requirements, as wvll as procedural steps designed to accelerate subloan
processing. In this project, the hiring of the ACB's investment advisor
contributed to improved mobilization of credit funds to farmers. Prior to
having the investment advisor, subloan processing procedures in the ACE were
complex and led to major delays in disbursement of credit funds and
implementation of the project; and (iii) greater attention should be given to
ensuring that prior to project implementation (say, as conditions of Board
Presentation, or at least effectiveness) basic requirements for the project's
implementation are in place. In this project, several essential details, such
as staffing and organization of the ACB, resolution of legal issues portaining
to sites for building construction, and mechanisms for monitoring and
supervision of enterprises financed with project subloans, were left to be
resolved during implementation of the project, causing considerable delays.
10.       Proiect Relationshie
10.01     There were good working relationships between the Bank and the
Borrower, and betvaen the various institutions involved.
11.       Consultina Services
11.01     As stated in para. 6.07, consultants played an important rola in
implementing the project. The contract between the GOJ and FAO proved to be
appropriate due to the responsiveness and quality of the majority of the
consultants. The ACB's recruitment of the investment advisor was also
important in helping to expedite disbursaements of project subloans.
12.       Proiect Documentation and Data
12.01     The preparation missions suffered from the lack of reliable field
information or, as in the case of the credit component, ACB's inexperience in
the provision of investment credit. The Staff Appraisal Report was useful
during project implementation



-9-
12.02     Overall, the MINAG'. and the ACB's monitoring and *valuation
capacity was weak and they failed to monitor the agricultural technical
coefficients. As stated in par.. 6.15, MINAG's project completion report was
deficient in that they failed to evaluate the economic benefits of the
project, due largely to the inadequate monitoring and evaluation system set up
under tho project.

EXPORT CROPS PROJECT (Loan 2414-JMH
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Export Crops Project, Loan 2414-JM, has been successful in the
achivement of its major project objectives and targets prior to the official
completion of the project.
2.        Loan funds were approved, under Part A--the credit component of the
project, for the establishment and/or rehabilitation of 20,452 acres of export
crops as compared to a targeted a*reage of 20,295 acres.
3         Hurricane Gilbort ravaged the island on Septembor 12, 1988, but
despite damage to some civil works, and some research facilities and trial
plots, the majority of these activities were satisfactorily completed, and
most couuissioned before the closure of the project on September 30, 1989.
4.        Hurricane Gilbert and the meeting and/or surpassing of project
targets notwithstanding, at project closure there was a savings of
US$2,389,560 or J$13,334,468.
5.        The Jamaican dollar was devalued several times during the life of
the pro-jct, but remained stable for a number of years at a rate of US$1.00 to
J$5.50, the rate at projcet closure.

JAMAICA
EXPOk! CROPS PROJECT (Loan 2414-JM)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
A. Proiect Implementation
1.        The Loan Agreement, Loan No. 2414-JM, between GOJ and IBRD; and the
Project Agreement, related to the said loan, betweon IBRD and AC Bank, were
both signed on June 5, 1984.
2.        The project became effective on September 5, 1984 and closed on
September 30, 1989, vLth project completion date stated-to be
January 31, 1990.
3.        A major disaster, in the form of Hurricane Gilbert, occurred on
Septmber 12, 1988. Prior to this, there were flood rains, which affected
several parishes in the island in 1985 and 1986.
4.        The capital damages, caused by the hurricane, exerted tremendous
pressure on the working capital of subborrowers to resuscitate and/or
rehabilitate their farm., and had an adverse effect on the cash flcw and debt
servicing of most subprojects.
S.        The estimates of damage are summarized in Table 13.
Table 13
Cror                            Extent of Dama-o
Citrus                          less than 202
Tobacco                         202 to 401
Coffee                          402 to 602
Coconuts & Vegotables           601 to 801
Bananas & Horticulture          greater than 802
6.        Extensive damage was also done to some of the civil works under
construction under Parts B to P of the project, but repairs were effected
expeditiously as most sites were insured.
7.        A number of research trial plots, under the Adaptive Research
component, were extensively damaged by the hurricane resulting in either
termination, as in the case of one plot, delays in obtaining results as a
result of the need to re-establish plots, or delay in the actual
implementation of research trials, as was the case with bananas.



- 16 -
B. Implementation Problems and Constraints
8.        The major startup problems were:
(a)  The long delay,  xperienced by the Project Management Unit, in
having the Management Review Division of the Ministry of
Agriculture prepare a report on the staffing and organizational
structure of the Project Management Unit. This was aggravated by
further delays in obtaining the required approval from both the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Public Service after the
report was sent to them.
This problem was not satisfactorily resolved until April 1986,
nineteen months after the project became effective. This resulted
in tramendous pressure being put on what was essentially the
original nucleus staff of the unit.
(b) The continued variances between the funds targeted in the project
document; funds requested for the projects, via the Ministry of
Agriculture; funds budgeted in the annual budgets; and the actual
allocation of the budgetad funds. This remained a problem for the
first three fiscal years of the project. The situation resulted in
delays in the tendering of contractual services for civil works,
and delays in the payments of outstanding commitments.
It should be notad that the funds for the Export Crops Project, as
for most other internationally funded projects, were included in
the budget of the Ministry of Finance. This had no adverse effect
on project implementation, despite the fact that the Ministry of
Agriculture had overall responsibility for project implementation.
(c) The institutional changes, with respect to the banana and tobacco
industries, in particular, resulted in some delay in the
appointment of some consultants; the planning of some civil works;
and the cancellation of some proposed activities.
(d) The information on disbursements for direct payments by IBRD which
was made available to the Ministry of Finance, was not forwarded to
the Project Management Unit. The Project Management Unit was,
therefore, unable to keep track of these disbursements.
The problem was solved, during the latter years of the project, by
IBRD providing the Project Management Unit with copies of notices
of disbursement, on behalf of the project, of which the originals
were sent to the Ministry of Finance.
Other problems and constraints included:
(e) The inadequacy of staff, both in terms of quantity as well as
quality, of the Research and Development Division, in particular,
and the Ministry of Agriculture in general. This problem,
aggravated by the high turnover of professional staff, especially
those benefitting from further training, resultod in dolays;



- 17 -
inability to implement sections of the Adaptive Research Component
of the projects and the inability of the Ministry of Agriculture to
assign suitable counterparts to technical exports and consultants.
(f)  The lack of cooperation of some comeodity organizations, especially
in the early stages of the project. This resulted in technical
aseossment reports not being prepared and forwarded to AC Bank, as
required; and the absence of the required technical support in the
form of monitoring and project appraisal, being given to both the
AC Bank and the Approved Financial Institutions.
The coffee section of the Adaptive Research component was not
implemented as the research program, required in order to accoss
the funds provided, was not developed by CIDCO.
(g) The failure to synchronize the arrival of the four technical
assistant personnel, earmarked for the Plant Protection and Plant
Quarantine Services, viz: A Plant Protection Specialist, a Plant
Quarantine Specialist, a Greenhouse Horticulturist, and a Service
Engineer (Plant Quarantine) resulted in delays in the establishment
of the main post-entry plant quaramtine facility, as well as the
need to increase the Plant Quarantine Specialist support.
9.        The outbreak of coffee leaf rust, fcxlg  ia vastat?LU, underlined
not only the inadequacy of the existing Plant Quarantine ser-ice, but also the
need for increased research by CIDCO.
10.       The poor standard of the feasibility studies wE±ch accompanied loan
applications to AC Bank; and the tardiness in the submission of technical
reports, to the API's, by some commodity organizations, were problems
experienced by Part A of the project.
11.       The AC Bank, as the agency with direct responsibility for the
credit component of the project, was not able to identify serious management,
technical or financial problems early in the life of some subprojects. This
was the result of the tardiness in the submission of quarterly reports by
AlI's, as well as the inadequate monitoring and supervision of enterprises
funded by the project.
12.       Commercial banks had arrears ranging from ten to thirty pereent
(0L to 30S) in som subprojects, but this fact was not reflected either in
their reports, or the AC Bank portfolio as the required installments were paid
by the AFI's on schedule, while subborrower was chargSed comercial rates,
thereby increasing the burden of debt servicing.
13.       One project auditor for the Agricultural Credit Bank was inadequate
to identify the above, and othor shortcomings.
14.       In August 1988, GOJ took the decision to reduce AC Bank financing
from eighty percent (802) to sixty percent (60Z).
15.       The Financial and Audit Act of Jamaica prescribes that GOJ
equivalent of funds directly disbursed by international organizations such as



- 18 -
IBRD, should be paid over to the Accountant GCneral of Jamaica. This tenet
was repeatedly violated due to the lack of budgetary support, from the
Ministry of Finance, which would allow this. The matter was addressed during
the latter stages of the project.
C. Pro2ect Achievenents
16.       The Export Crops Project is considered to have been highly
successful in the meeting of its project targets and the achievement of its
project goals. This achievement is particularly remarkable when measured
against a balance of US$2,389,560 remaining at project closure on
September 30, 1989.
17.       Table 9 provided- dtails on proposed project costs and the
contribution of GOJ, IBRD and the farmers in the financing of these costs.
Table 14-compares the proposed total costs, at inception, with actual
expenditure up to project closure, September 30, 1989.
18.       The savings was achieved despite significant increases in
allocations to Category 3, Management, Extension Staff and Consultancy
Services, and to Category 4, Civil Works. The increaed allocation to these
categories was the result of cost escalations in the case of Civil Works,
Category 41 and increased consultancy need, in the case of Category 3. There
was underexpenditure in the Categories of Equipment, and Training, Research
and Studies, respectively.

20.       On October 31, 1989, one month after project closure, the total
funds committed under the project was J$ 109,450,623 or USS19.9 million, the
total amount of funds allocated to the project. Of this, ninety-two percent
(92Z) or J$ i00,609,455 had beon disbursed. Of the projected 20,295 acres of
crops to be developed, the project realized 20,452 acres or 100.772 of
projeated acreago.

1011 of targeted acreage. The approved acreage, for a number of crops, were
way in excess of targeted acreages, howev-r. The approved acreages for
tobacco were exceeded by 2991; for Blue Mountain Coffoo by 1691; for sugarcane
by 742; vegetables by 511; atd irrigated bananas by 261.
22.       The performance of other crops was not as impressive with coconuts
and rainfed bananas only achieving IIZ and 131 respectively; rehabilitated
citrus, 321 of targeted acreagel citrus--planting, 802; and ornamental
horticulture, 871 of targeted acreage. More dotails are provided in Table 16.

24.       It is felt that one of the reasons for the remarkable success of
the Export Crops Project is the fact that not only did the nucleus of the
Project Management Unit become effective in July 1983, fourteen months before
the project became effective, but also that the Project Board of Mnag eme nt
started meeting in February 1984. This formed the base for planning for
implementation which resulted in successful project implemenstation.
25.       The individuals occupying the posts of Project Director, Project
Administrator, Project Accountant. and Project Secretary, in the nucleus
Pioject Management Unit, continued to occupy these posts throughout the entire
life of the project. It is felt that this has made a significant contribution
to the succese of the project.
26.       The Project Mangement Unit did not become a unit of the Comodity,
Marketing and Credit Division, as had been proposed. The Project Director,
from the project became effective, has reported directly to the Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture who also chairs the Project Board of
Management.
27.       The Project Management Unit has now been upgraded to a Project
Management and Coordinating Unit which has responsibility for the Socond Sugar
Rehabilitation Loan, in addition to completing the Export Crops Project.
28.       The other major achievements of the project are:
(a) The drafting of a Plant Quarantine Act and regulations for the
proposed reorganization of the existing, inadequate Plant
Quarantine system.



- 21 -
(b) The deregulation of the marketing of coffao resulting in a widening
of the distribution system. This has resulted in joint ventures
between processors and foreign dealers; increased activity,
especially with respect to Blue Mountain coffee, in tho North
American marketplace; and a shift from tho export of green beans to
roasted beans.
C. Monetary Develo2monts
29.       Average lending rates moved from a high of thirty-six percent (362)
in February 1986 to twenty-three percent (232) in July 1987, where it remained
more or less stable for the remaining life of the project. Inflation moved
from twenty-six percent (262) in January 1986 to seven percent (72) in May
1988, and remained relatively stable until the hut 'canc in September 1988.
30.       AC Bank's interest rate to farmers moved from eighteen percent
(182) in 1986 to fifteen percent (152) as of May 1986, at which it remained
until 1989 when it was reduced to fourteen pereent (142).
D. Procur.man
31.       The procurewent of goods and services, both locally and
internationally, closely followed project guidelines and as such was
satisfactory, experioncing no major delays or problms.
C. Contractual Servicas
32.       There were some minor problems with some of the contractors
recruited for the implementation of the Civil Works component of the project,
but these were satisfactorily resolved by adequate supervision and monitoring,
primarily in the form of regular site meetings.  All Civil Works activity was
satisfactorily brought to complation, and commissioned before project closure.
P. Consultancies
33.       The scope and total cost of technical assistance to the Export
Crops Project were revised during project implementation as a result of the
restructuring and reorganization of some industries and commodity
organizations.
34.       Provision, at project inception, was for a total of 338 mnmonthe
for five years, with PAO providing 314 msnmonths for three and a half years.
35.       The following provisions for technical assistance were deleted:
(i) experts for the processing of citrus and cigar tobacco; (ii) the
Production Agronomist for bananas; (iii) the Research and Quality Control
Specialist for bananas. A provision for a Banana Research Specialist, as a
substitute, was eventually also deleted; and (iv) the Management and Marketing
Specialist (BANCO).
36.       Two new consultants were approved by IBRD.  An Invostment Advisor
for the Agricultural Credit Bank, who took up duties in March 1987; and a post
of Citrus Virologist for six months. Failure to identify a suitable candidate



- 22 -
for the post of Citrus Virologist resulted in this provision being eventually
deleted. It should be noted, however, that the project bonefitted from the
services of a Citrus Virologist for a short period between January and
February 1987.
37.       As a result of the unavailability of the Plant Quarantine
Consultant, who would have served for four manmonths, a Plant Quarantine
Specialist had to be recruited for six manmonths.
38.       Provision was made for nine manmonths of miscellaneous
consultancies, and with the approval of IBRD, a Rural Physical Planning
Specialist was appointed in place of the Management and Marketing Specialist
in order to facilitate Land Resource and Zoning atudies.
39.       The period of stay of the Greenhouse Horticulturist, Ornamental
Horticulturist and Postharvest Technologist had to be extended because of
program delays as a result of the hurricane.
40.       The Citrus Extension Specialist, although recommended for an
additional year, did not extend his stay for personal reasons. The Vegetable
Specialist wa vithdrawn by FAO.
41.       The final revision of the provision of technical services by FAO
resulted in an agreement with FAO for the provision of 308 man-months of
services for a total cost of US$2,273,860.
42.        uaa major-problem  xperienced under this component was in the level
and quality and full-time wvailability of local counterparts, further
aggravated by the poor supervision, in respect of those assigned, by their
Division Directors.
G. Trainint
43.,      A number of officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, and other
organizations benefitted from training, both- overseas and locally, as a result
of the project. This training took the form ef seminars, workshops, field
days, and short courses. A wide range of sub1scts was covered: Plant
Quarantine, Computer Techniques, Financial Men Sement$, Ornamental
Horticulture, Vegetable Production, Human and Industrial Relations,
Development Banking, Extension Methodology and C'inunications, and Citrus
Virology and Agricultural Credit.
44.       A Pathologist was trained in Citrus Virus Indexing in Florida but
the candidate selected for the MSc Horticulture course did not take up the
offer.
45.       A summary of achievements under the training component is as
follows:

B. Ada&tive Research
46.       The Adaptive Research component of the project was plagued by the
inability of the Research and Development Division of MINAG to recruit and
retain qualified and experienced personnel. This problm was partially
addressed by an innovative approach of rosearch being done on farmers'
holdings where the labor and day-to-day supervision were provided by the
farmer, with inputs and overall supervision being provided by the project.
47.       A number of trials were damaged by the hurricane, but by project
closure all infrastructure had been successfully rehabilitated and research
activity resumed.
48.       The research activity proposed for bananas and coffee vas not
implemented because of the failure of CIDCO to submit a proposal in the case
of coffee; and a number of delays as a result of the restructuring of the
banana industry in the case of bananas.
49.       Research trials completed or started during the life of the project
are listed below:
(a) Citrus. (i) Mother orchards for the provision of budwood/scion for
propagation were established at two sites. This is a prerequisite
of the Plant Nursery/certification program which is to be
established; (ii) A rootstock observation trial involving five
varieties, inclusivo of the local Sour orange rootstock, was
established; (iii) Fiddler beetle control trials were established,
of which the insecticide evaluation component was completed before
project closure.
(b) Coconut. A number of studies were done by CNIB, but these studies
were financed by the CNIB and not the Export Crops project.
(c)  Tobacco. Variety trials with a number of Fl crosses were
conducted.



- 24 -
(d) Ornamental Horticulture. (i) Anthuriums--two trials, aimed at the
identification of tolerable levels of the control of anthurium
blight, were established. Assistance was sought from the
University of Hawaii with respect to appropriate diagnostic
techniques, but the trials were evontually terminated after tho
hurricano; (ii) Other variety trials were conducted with lilies,
gladioli and leather leaf fern.
(e) Vapstables. A number of trials, primarily variety trials, were
conducted for the following crops: cucumbers, sweetpoppers, hot
peppers, chinese cabbages, pumpkins and muskmelons.
I.  Financial Performance and Economic Evaluation        -
50.       It is felt that sufficient data is not available to perform a
satisfactory financial and economic analysis. Hurricane Gilbert, which
occurred on September 12, 1988, had an adverse effect on Jamaica's economic
development. Most of the information available on the effects of the
hurricane is based on the preliminary estimates of damage. In light of this,
it was decided not to calculate an economic rate of return.
J. Institutional Performance and DeveloqgLnt
51.       The project aimed at improving the technical and management
capability of the Ministry of Agriculture and the relevant Comodity
Organizations. The establishment of a Plant Protection Advisory Unit was also
proposed.
52.       The ability of the Ministry of Agriculture to successfully manage
large-scale, multi-disciplinary and multi-organizational projects has been
significantly improved. This is-reflected in the success of the Project Board
of Management in the coordination of both components of the Exports Crops
Project, and in the subsequent upgrading of tho Project Management Unit into a
Project Management and Coordinating Unit with responsibility for the Second
Sugar Rehabilitation Project, also funded by IBRD, in addition to the Export
Crops Project.
53.       There is also evidence of improved institutional performance of the
Agricultural Credit Bink. Some of the improvements seen are directly
attributable to the assignment of an Investment Advisor to AC Bank.
54.       The drafting of Plant Quarantine regulations for a Plant Quarantine
Legislation Act, and the development of a Plant Quarantine Operations manual,
are important precursor to an improved Plant Quarantine service for which the
infrastructure has been provided under the project. GOJ must, however,
develop appropriate strategies for attracting trained professionals into areas
such as agricultural research and development, and plant quarantine, if the
infrastructure provided is to be effectively utilized.
55.       The construction of fumigation facilities and the availability of
pre-clearance activities at both airports, as well as the cold storage and
temporary holding facilities, will not only facilitate agricultural exports,



- 25 -
but should also further minimize losses. Other subjects such as inadequate
cargo space still need to be addressed.
56.       Further development of the citrus industry should be fostered by
the development of the budwood certification program for citrus, as well as
the citrus virus indexing program, for which baseline activity has been
started under the project.
K. Agricultural Impact
57.       The Exports Crops Project was designed to provide needed support
for the accomplishment of the objectives of the Government's structural
adjustment program in agriculture which essentially involved the rapid
expansion of export production. Some of the effects of both the export-led
strategy of GOJ, as wvll as the Export Crops Project, were negated with the
event of Hurricane Gilbert iii September 1988.
58.       Improvements were achieved in the production of both traditional
and non-traditional export crops.  In addition, there was a forty-five percent
(451) increase in earnings from export agriculture for the period 1984 to
1988.  These improvements are sumarized as followst
(a) The Tons cane to Tons sugar ratio, a measure of productivity in the
sugar industry, improved over the 1984 to 1988 period, although
there as a slight deterioration in 1988 as compared to 1987. The
figures are shown in Table 4. The 1988 sugarcane production, as
measured in tons of cane milled, showed an increase of six percent
(62) over 1984 (Table 4).
(b) Export banana production for the first nine months of 1988, and
prior to Hurricane Gilbert, was twenty-eight percent (282) higher
than total production for 1984.
(e) There was a widening of the market for coffee with inereased
activity in the North American market and a shift from the export
of greon to roasted beans. The 1988 production of coffee was
twenty-two percent (222) higher than that of 1984 despite the
hurricane.
(d) The quantity of citrus fruits delivered to packaging and processing
plants, increased by ninety-seven percent (971) as compared to 1984
deliveries; and there was a ninety-six percent (961) increase in
the export of citrus and selected products for the same period.
(s) Coconut production showed a twenty-five percent (251) increase over
1984.
(f) In 1987 there was a two hundred and seven pereent (2072) increase
in the production of ornamental horticultural crops as compared to
1984. In 1986, the production of vegetable crops, as compared to
1984 production figures, doubled. There was a significant decline
in the production of both vegetable and ornamental horticultural
crops between 1987 and 1988.  Ornamental horticultural production



- 26 -
was adversely affected by the hurricane. Most of the large-scale
vegetable production enterprises either scaled down their
operations significantly, or closed down altogaether between 1987
and 1988. This was the result of a number of marketing and
distribution problems which made these enterprises non-viable.
L. Conclusion and Recommendations
59.       The Export Crops Project, although experiencing some restructuring,
rescheduling of components and a number of amendments, has been completed with
a fairly substantial savings of US$2,389,560 or JS13,334,468, despite the need
to increase allocations for Civil Works, as a result of cost escalation; and
for consultancies as a result of increased consultancy needs. The project was
highly successful in the achievement of project objectives and the meeting
and/or surpassing of project targets.  The achievement is even more
outstanding when it is considered against the event of Surricane Gilbert which
occurred in September 1988, one year before project closure.
60.       The problems encountered during the implementation of the project,
as well as the factors responsible for its success should be exploited to
ensure *ven greater success and smoother implementation of future projects..
61.       Recouandations, provided below, have been divided into three main
categories: Pre-project Activity, Project Implementation and General.
M. Pre-Prolect Activity
62.       The following should be effected prior to project implementation if
extensive delays and unnecessary on existing staff are to be avoided:
(a) Organizational structure for the staffing of Project Management
Units and/or other relevant project organizations should be
developed and the required approval obtained from relevant
organizations/ministries as a condition of project affectivity.
(b) Architectural designs, specifications and costings for Civil Works
should be prepared prior to project inception, and sites for
infrastructure development not only identified, but any legal or
other entanglements cleared.
(c) Directors, whether of divisions, agencies, ministries or commodity
organizations, who will have responsibility for executing the
project, or components of the project, should not only be properly
apprised of the project, but should also be advised to identify
suitable counterparts for the consultants who are to be assigned.
N. Proaect Imolcm ntation
63.       Budgetary allocation, andtimely disbursements of funds to the
project should become a condition in the loan agreement between GOJ and IBRD
or other loan agencias.



- 27 -
64.       To enoure the more effective administration of funds, budgets for
internationally funded projects should be included under the Mlinistry or
Finance head instead of being groupod with budgetary support for regular
programs of the respective executing ministries.
65.       Counterparts to consultants should benefit financially from their
project assignments, especially in situations whero expatriate consultants,
who demand emoluments far in excess of civil service salaries, are assigned.
The bonefits should be retained for the life of the project and not restricted
to the poriod of the assignment.
66.       Where multidisciplinary tems of consultants will be required,
their identification and the assurance of availability should be agreed in
accordance with the timing of the implementation of project components in
order to synchronize the t4ming of their assignments to the project.
67.       The Research and Dovolopment Division and its reorganization has
been the subject of numerous studies. There has been great improvement in
infrastructure support but the division ha still been unable to attract and
retain professional staff.
68.       GOJ and MINAG need to develop strategies aimed at attracting
qualified professionals to this division, and others such as the Planning and
Policy Review Division which must be staffed by professionals with skills that
are highly marketable and for which, therefore, there i's trong competition
from the private sector and/or other public sector agencies which are not
constrained by civil sarvice regulations.
69.       The Plant Quarantine legislation, as well as the recomuendations to
improve both the Plant Quarantine and Plant Protection Services, should be
pursued vigorously to ensure early implementation.
70.       The recoumendations for the improvement of agricultural credit
should be the subject of study with the aim of implementation. These subjects
include the capitalization of interest and the availability of a working
capital line of credit, especially for enterprises involved in the production
of perennial cropo. risk-sharing and collateral requirements.
71.       Risk coverago should be a requirement for enterprises bonefitting
from loan funds in excess of a proscribed figure. GOJ assistance might have
to be sought in the underwriting of agricultural insurance schemes, as to date
local insurance companies have shied away from the subject, although in recent
months action has been taken by one local insurance company.
72.       It is felt that the medium-sized borrower, in particular, finds the
60:40 Loan to Equity ratio onerous; and that to facilitate the availability of
agricultural credit, that the original 80s20 ratio should bo applied to these
and other farmers.
73.       For future programs/projects, it is felt that there should be a
clear policy on the type of import substitution enterprises which may be



- 28 -
funded; in addition to the examinations of possibilities for the introduction
of additional crops under the catoeory "New Export Crops."

-land titling;
-the role of the Commodity Boards and Associationct
-the agricultural input supply;
-the rationalization of agricultural credit and the rolo of the
Aqricultural Credit Bank;
-Institutional arrangements.
Preparat ion 
-Weakness of the local preparation taimt
-institutional capacity to implement the proposed expansion programs;
-possible constraints to *xpanded *xport productions (citrus and Blue
Mountain Coffee); and
-uncertainty about the financial viability of certain expansion
programs.
Prgoaration 11
-The reinvestment in sugar production needs required a sectoral
approach which was beyond the possible scopa of the project;
-estimation of the possible demand for credit under the project remains
extremely subjective;
-uncertainty about the financial viability of banana and citrus
expansion programst
-interest charged by the project would be above the rates of interest
currently pravailing in the country unless the counterpart funds are
provided at an interest lower than the market rate;
-the AC's heavy involvement in Peoples' Cooperative Banks operations
would produce a loss In the early years of the project and only low
profitability later on; and
-expanded production of certain export crops must be constrained by the
highly competitive nature of export markets (citrus, vegetables) and
possible market saturation (coffee).
Apraisal
-  xchange rate (mom export crops would be adversely affected by the
overvalued official exchange rate);
-interest rates and spreads (ACB was just startinq its operations and
had a number of other costly responsibilities);
-foreign exchange risk and interest rate variabillty (the mission
recommended that the Government pass the counterpart funds as a loan
to AC8 rather than as equity with an interest charge of around 2% per
annum); and
-size of the loan (the appraisal mission recommended to increase the
proposed loan amount of US$15 million to USS18.6 million).

Delay in subloanz disbursement from date of subloan application (the
flow of paper for credit dolivery between Sub-borrower - AFI Branch -
AFT Head Office and AC8 took 13 steps that at best was completed in 17
weeks);
poor quality of credit documentation submitted by AFIs for appraisal;
sopate and joint subproject appraisals between AC8 and AlI were
repetitive and time consuming to the sub-borrower;
the financial plan for projects acceptable to commercial banks as ApIs
was a function of the quality of securities and not returns (several
viable projacts sponsored by limited resource investors, though
comp tent, were offered commercial bank rates and not presented to
AC8)t
it was very difficult to recruit a citrus virologist consultant for
the project adaptive research component despite help from FAO and the
Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARD!);
-fiscal austerity pressures in Jamaica have curtailed Government s
ability to provide adequate and timely counterpart funding;
-the level of the interest rates to the ultimate sub-borrower under the
project was always lower than the then prevailing commercial interest
rates.
-the civil works to construct export facilities were completed with two
years of delay and the sector did not benefit from these facilities
during project implementation;
-the execution of the technical research component took more time than
anticipated due to frequent changes Ln the Research Division of MINAG
and the research infrastructure was completed only at project closure;
-market studies envisaged at appraisal were not fully completed because
some were financed by other sources, some were cancelled and some
others were no longer justified due to the privatization of banana and
tobacco subsectors; and
there was no monitoring and evaluation system.

41 hurricane Gilbert, in Septembor 1988, did impact on the coffee and
banana crops but the effect of the damage was quite temporary as
banana bounced back* in lose then a year and coffee in lees than
two years. Rehabiltiation costs wore low, inavolving mainly the
removal of fallen trees and for coffee, the replanting of some
seedlings. For citrus the damage was quite low as most of the
trees by 1988 were quite samll and had little or no fruit, having
been planted only two to three years before the hurricane.

7 Banana: annual benefits are high from year 2 to year 10. A reduction
in the benefits for the last three months in 1988 and the first six months
in 1989 did not significantly affect the already high rate of return
for this crop.
8/ Citrus magnitude of annual benefits in 1988 (year 5 of the project)
would have been quite low compared with the rest of the stream as
full development is reached somewhere between year six and year seven.
