                         prone sections of Highway 1 in Central Region of Vietnam was completed successfully. 53 km of Highway 1 between Ca Mau and Nam Can and 9 out of 12 selected provincial road

                         sections under the extended Mekong Delta Transport Network were also completed which provided efficient connectivity to the national transport network. This would support the
                         likelihood of achieving the PDOs. Though the project end data are being collected and will be provided by the Borrower in their ICR, it can be considered that most of project Key
                         Performance Indicators can be achieved, such as reduction in travel time by bus from Can Tho to Ca Mau is about 30% compared to which was targeted by 10%; reduction in travel
                         time between Nam Can and Ca Mau is about 70% compared to which was targeted by 66%; reduction in time of road closure in central region is about 60% compared to which was
                         targeted by 50%; etc. The remained 3 road links is still ongoing, and two short consultancy service contracts remain to be completed. The Borrower is requesting another extension
                         for the Credit Closing Date, for both Original Credit (Cr. No. 3448) and AF (Cr. No. 3448-1) for 12 months to complete these on-going activities.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank has received a government request for extension of the closing date. The Task Team is preparing a package to recommend an extension of 6 months (until June 30, 2011)
                         for management's consideration and endorsement. However, upon the new closing date of June 30, 2011, the undisbursed amount of funds under both Credits is expected to be
                         about US$20.8 million equivalent. The Task Team will work with the Borrower to arrange for this amount to be canceled before the new Closing Date so that the funds can be re-
                         committed to Vietnam. The next mission will be in February/ March 2011 for the ICR preparation
