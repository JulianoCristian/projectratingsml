A detailed measurement survey (DMS) and\n            census and a socio-economic survey were conducted on the\n            project affected persons (PAPs).

In the flooded section of Dong Ha - Quang\n            Ngai, 3,582 PAPs are affected, mostly by loss of\n            agricultural land. The resettlement action plan (RAP) aims\n            to minimize adverse impacts of the project; improve, or at\n            least restore, incomes, living standards, and productive\n            capacity of PAPs; provide compensation at replacement costs;\n            and implement the plan with full participation of and\n            consultation with PAHs. Some of the PAPs who were affected\n            by loss of structures were in fact illegal owners of the\n            structures. The RAP provides detailed specification of the\n            eligibility of compensation."}, "docdt": "2007-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
