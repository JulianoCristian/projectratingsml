                                             I.Introduction

 1.     This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President for amendments to
the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) for: (i)financing the construction of additional
bridges; (ii) a reallocation o f Credit proceeds; and (iii)an extension o f closing date to December
31, 2010.

2.      The changes highlighted above require RVP approval as they affect the following
policies:
    0   OPBPI3.25 - Use ofproject cost savings -the reallocationofthe UnallocatedCategory
        exceeds five percent o f the total Credit and finances additional project activities not
        includedinthe project description inthe Development Credit Agreement (DCA); and
        An extension o f closing date o f more than two-years from the original date.

3.      Summary. The amendments which are processed as a second level restructuring address
the following modifications:


    0   Construction of Additional Bridges. The replacement o f six additional bridges
        constitutes fundamental linkages critical to the viability o f existing IDA investments on
        the National Highway 1 (NH1) corridor. The works constitute fundamental linkages
        critical to the viability o f existing investments on the NH1 corridor.
    0   Reallocation of Credit Proceeds. A reallocation o f Credit proceeds i s required to fund
        the proposed bridge works, approved contract variation orders for the completion of the
        major civil works activities, and to implement technical assistance.
    0   Extension of the Closing Date.           The original closing date of June 2006 has been
        extended (once) for 18 months. A second extension to December 31, 2010 enables
        completion o f all project activities and i s co-terminus with the Additional Financing
        closing date for purposes of impact evaluation and simplification of completion reporting.

4.      IDA appraisal of the relevant bridge works is now complete, the details of which are
outlined below. This project paper i s submittedto finalize the restructuring.

BackgroundandRationalefor Restructuring

5.      The objectives of the Project are to assist the Borrower to: (i)  complete the rehabilitation
o f Highway 1, including increased protection for certain flood-prone segments; and (ii)     improve
the efficiency o f the regional transport network in the Mekong Delta. The project i s expected to
stimulate the commercial use o f an improved transportation network, improve access to rural
areas by connecting them to the main trade and movement corridors, and ensure permanent
access to regular flood-prone areas.

6.      The proposed reallocation would meet the financial needs of the project. The extension
enables completion o f the activities identified in the amendment and reallocation. The rationale
for these modifications was discussed with the Borrower during the negotiations o f the
Additional Financingpackage.




                                                     2

7.      The amendments are consistent with the original development objectives and project
design, do not require changes to the key performance indicators, and are expected to strengthen
the associatedoutcomes.

8.      Implementation Performance.Implementation has been rated moderately satisfactory.
Completion of the original civil works plans for major ICB contracts on December 31, 2007 i s
slightly behind schedule. The contractors have recently engaged new private sector
subcontractors to undertake the approved additional works. This has resulted in improvement o f
works progress and thus increased disbursementrate.

9.      Disbursement Status. Disbursementsas o f December 12, 2007 amount to approximately
SDR54.6 million or 63 percent o f the SDR86.2 million Credit. ISR ratings, including those for
implementation progress (IP) and development objectives (DOs), have been consistently rated
satisfactory for more than one year and i s expected to continue insatisfactory status. The project
i s incompliance with Credit covenants. There are no overdue financial reports.

ProposedChanges

10.     The proposed changes entail the following:

     e  Expanded scope of works. It was envisaged that Part A. 2 (b) o f the project would
        finance the construction of the road between Dam Cung and Nam Can. Though the
        project preparation activities revealed a need for bridge replacements along the corridor
        at some future time, the bridges were not included as part of the original project. In its
        current condition, the newly constructed two lane highway i s connected by temporary
        one lane steel truss bridges (eight ton capacity) at six locations. Along with on-going
        bridge structure investments supported by the Government, JBIC, and the Additional
        Financing, the six bridges, which will be constructed to accommodate 30 ton gross
        weight vehicles, provide the final linkages along this road section.
     e  Reallocation. The reallocation request i s borne through the Credit's Unallocated
        Category, and through additional resources from cost savings made available as a result
        o f favorable exchange rate fluctuations between US$ and SDR. Table 1 below
        summarizes the changes to Schedule 1 o f the DCA.

         Extension ofthe CZosingDate. A second extension of Credit closing date, to December
         31, 2010, enables the conclusion o f the original project activities, final delivery of the
         consulting services, completion of the bridge works, and allows for monitoring and
         evaluate the project development impact. The three year extension enables completion o f
         all project activities and is co-terminus with the Additional Financing closing date for
         purposes o f impact evaluation and simplification o f completion reporting.

 11.     Ministry o f Transport's Project Management Unit 1 (PMU1) has prepared and submitted
to IDA an action plan and disbursement schedule through the end o f the project. An updated
disbursement profile i s shown below inTable 2.

12.      The total Credit amount o f SDR86.2 million remains unchanged. The amendment,
reallocation and extension are consistent with the original project design. The restructuring,
which does not impact the development objectives or key performance indicators, ensures that
the project outcome i s achievable. Existingimplementation arrangements including procurement,
financial management, and safeguards are inplace and will continue through the extended period
o f the project.

Analysis

13.     Appraisal of AdditionalActivities. The improvement to the final six bridges is critical
to completing a major national corridor that also serves as a key artery o f the provincial road
network. The bridges provide connectivity to more than one hundred thousand local people
previously dependent on the region's waterways, and are expected to facilitate the development
of the local economy and living standards.

14.     The principal benefits consist o f vehicle operating cost savings. These benefits have been
calculated using the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4).                However, the
social benefits o f integrating the regional provincial network, which are considered to be
significant, were not included in the evaluation. A discount rate of 12 percent was applied and


                                                  4

the evaluation period was 20 years. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted using several
scenarios where traffic growth rates and capital costs varied by 10 and 20 percent for lower than
expected benefits and higher than expected costs, respectively. The economic appraisal indicates
a marginal Economic Internal Rate o f Return o f 10.4 percent (using a 12 percent discount rate).
These investments are considered viable at a 10 percent discount rate given the high cost of
construction as a result o f the uniqueterrain inthe Mekong Delta.

 15.     Safeguards. The Project Office has developed an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the six bridges, and updated the original EMP
prepared for the Project to include the mitigation measures for the construction of the additional
six bridges, which are in line with relevant Government and World Bank safeguard policies (no
ethnic minority issues were identified). These documents have been reviewed and cleared, as
they comply with relevant Bank policies. The EIA and RAP have also been disclosed both inthe
country and at the World Bank InfoShop.

16.      Environmental Safeguards.        Though the project garners a Category A rating, the
potential for negative environmental impacts i s expected to be minimal and limited to the effects
o f air emissions, noise, erosion and sedimentation, impacts on aquatic and vegetation habitat and
effects on public heath, all o f which are localized and o f short term, are manageable with proven
road maintenance mitigation techniques. The other risks are waste disposal, labour safety, traffic
safety (waterway and road) which need to be concerned during project implementation. The
measures to minimize and mitigate the adverse impacts will be incorporated in the detailed
design o f the civil works.

17.      P M U l i s responsible for the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) implementation,
including monitoring and reporting to the DONRE, and mitigating any unforeseen impacts
during construction. PMUl will ensure that the actions required to mitigate impacts during
construction are included in the contract documents and will supervise compliance with the
assistance o f the supervising engineers. P M U l will also hire qualified consultants to undertake
the environmental monitoring program and will assign one full-time staff to coordinate and
supervise the implementation o f the EMP. In addition, the project has already engaged an
independent team of consultants selected to monitor the mitigating measures implementation o f
the contractor.

18.     Social Safeguards. P M U l will coordinate with the provincial and district resettlement
committees established by the peoples' committees in Ca Mau province for implementing the
resettlement action plan. The land acquisition impacts occurring near the bridges result in a total
of 21 project affected households (PAHs), including 13 partial losses, and 8 that will have to
relocate.   There are no PAPS from an ethnic minority group, and therefore the indigenous
peoples policy i s not triggered. Inline with Bank requirement on social safeguards, the RAP has
been developed infull consultation with the local peoples. The cost estimate of the RAP i s about
VND 3.3 billion (US$ 200,000 equivalent) and will come from the counterpart fund, including
the cost for independent monitoringo f RAP implementation.




                                                  5

ExpectedOutcomes

19.    The additional six bridges completes the rehabilitation of NH1 from Can Tho to Nam
Can, providing significant improvement to the region's road network and connecting one of
Vietnam's poorest districts, Nam Can. By facilitating the access and connectivity o f rural
communities with the major infrastructure investments along NH1, the additional works support
improvements to the mobility of the rural poor.

BenefitsandRisks

20.    The overall risk for theproject i s rated "Modest." There are no significant additional risks
associated with the proposed restructuring. The associated risks and the proposed mitigation
measures are as follows:

       Implementation Readiness. PMUl's preparation for the six bridge works is well
       advanced: IDA has provided its no-objection to the feasibility study, the Environmental
       Impact Assessment Report, the updated EMP and the Resettlement Action Plan.
       Procurement for the bridge works i s underway; the Bid Evaluation Reports (four NCB
       packages and two ICB packages) have been sent to IDA for no-objection.                   The
       implementationo f the remaining activities will be closely monitored.

   0   Disbursement Delays. As the closing date of December 31, 2010 can not be extended
       again, there i s a minor risk related to disbursement of Credit proceeds. All works
       activities and the final disbursements are scheduled and expected to be completed six
      months prior to the closing date.

21.   The Borrower and the Implementing Agency remain committed to successfully
completing the project.
