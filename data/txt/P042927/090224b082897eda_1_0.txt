                         delivering the development objectives. 180 km of Highway 1 between Can Tho and Ca Mau was completed with high quality. The protection work of an aggregate 39 km of 17 flood-
                         prone sections of Highway 1 in Central Region of Vietnam was completed successfully. 53 km of Highway 1 between Ca Mau and Nam Can and 9 out of 12 selected provincial road
                         sections under the extended Mekong Delta Transport Network were also completed which provided efficient connectivity to the national transport network. This would support the
