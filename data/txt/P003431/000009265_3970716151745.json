     (l985-94) to build up high-level technical and managerial\n            manpower for national development, the Secoond University\n            Development Project aims to promote policy and institutional\n            changes related to the engineering and economics/finance\n            education subsector. Objectives include: (a) relatively\n            faster growth of enrollment in economics/finance and\n            postgraduate education; (b) broadening of present\n            over-specialized curricula; (c) accelerated in-service\n            training and promotion of younger faculty; (d) strengthening\n            of experimental work and academic support services such as\n            computer and audio-visual centers and libraries; (e)\n            improvement in longer-term manpower planning, facilities\n            planning and university resource utilization; and (f)\n            introduction of project monitoring and evaluation. In\n            support of the program, the project would help finance: (a)\n            equipment and materials including books and journals related\n            to engineering and economics/finance for about 35 subproject\n            universities; and (b) technical assistance and equipment for\n            five national programs comprising specialist services,\n            fellowships, staff exchange, studies, and training centers."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
