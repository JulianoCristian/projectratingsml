project sustainability was uncertain, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the loan\n            supported a particular government's economic reform\n            agenda but the closing date was past the end of the\n            government's term. In such instances, conditionality\n            should be designed to ensure that it will be agreeable to a\n            successor government, and should require no difficult or\n            controversial actions on the part of the new government.\n            This loan illustrated the problems of multi-tranching. In\n            single-tranche adjustment operations policy change would be\n            implemented before Board approval. The complexity of the\n            conditionality was a particular problem when the Bucaram\n            government took office. The Bucaram government indicated\n            that while it was broadly in accord with the objectives of\n            the third-tranche conditionality, it had serious\n            reservations about detailed points, which were of lesser\n            importance. The Bank, however, had to enforce compliance\n            with all the required conditionality, and it proved\n            impossible to focus on what was more important."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
