                         Implementation Status Overview
                         No significant progress has been made in the implementation of the Project activities, in particular under components 1 where delays have been observed in the installation process
                         of PFM and HRM software. The project continues to face additional work, due to the fact that it is also implementing other Government procurement activities in relation with pro-poor
