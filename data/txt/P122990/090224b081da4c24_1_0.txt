                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is effective since January 11, 2013. To date, only the first installment of the Government contribution, estimated at USD 2 million, has already been paid in the
                         Designated Account in April 2012, as this was an effectiveness condition. But, the first installment of the Government counterpart for 2013, estimated at US$ 5 million and expected to
                         be paid in April 2013, is not yet released as of today.
                         The project is still facing additional work, due to the fact that it is also implementing PPAs related to Forest and EITI projects as well as others Government procurement activities in

                         relation with pro-poor expenditures. As a result, significant delays remain in the project procurement plan implementation. It turns out that less than 25 percent of the activities have
                         reached the contract level and many other activities have not yet started, due to the lack of terms of reference.
                         In terms of financial management, activities carried out to date represent only 2, 77 % of those planned in 2013 Project Budget.
                         Based on the above, the performance of the project remains rated Moderately Satisfactory.

                         Need to release the first part of the Government contribution for 2013.
                         Need to speed up the implementation of the procurement plan.
                         Need to complete the contract with selected NGOs with the aim of ensuring close monitoring of the implementation of key Government reforms.
