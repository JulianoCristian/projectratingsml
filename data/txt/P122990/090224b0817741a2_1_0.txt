                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Initially planned for October 31, 2012, the expected effectiveness date of the project has been extended to December 30, 2012. To date, the first instalment of the Government
                         contribution, estimated at USD 2 million, has already been paid in the Designated Account. Amount of USD 10 million is planned in the 2013 budget as the Government contribution
                         for the year 2013. The minimum Project team is already in place, namely the project Coordinator, the procurement Specialist, the PFM Specialist, the M&E Specialist, the Accountant,
                         the Assistant to the Coordinator and a driver.
                         On the other hand, the ratification of the Loan Agreement is expected to occur during the Parliamentary Session scheduled for October 2012.
                         The project is currently implementing a PPA in the amount of USD 980,000 since April 30, 2012. However, the project is facing additional work, due to the fact that it is also

                         implementing other PPAs related to Forest and EITI projects. As a result, significant delays were observed in the project procurement plan implementation. It turns out that less than
                         half of the activities have reached the contract level and many other activities have not yet started, due to lack of terms of reference. In other words, out of 14 planned contracts, only
                         six were signed, i.e. five contracts for consultants’ services and one for supplies.
                         In terms of financial management, activities carried out to date represent only 12% of those planned in PPA.
                         Based on the above, the performance of the project is rated Moderately Satisfactory
