Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Since the last ISR, no significant progress has been made in the implementation of the Project activities. Government ownership remains very poor, as
 demonstrated by the lack of Steering Committee meetings since the Project's effectiveness. Delays continue to be observed in the installation process
 of PFM and HRM software packages. Despite the TTL advice, the project management team continues to implement other Government tasks, which
 prevent the team from working full time for the Project. As of today, the disbursement rate is about 53 % and the Project is expected to close on June
 30, 2015.
 Based on the above, the performance of the project is downgraded from Moderately Unsatisfactory to Unsatisfactory.
 Following discussions with the Government counterparts in December 2014, an action plan, with objective to improve Project performance, was agreed
 upon. The Project team performance and the action plan will be assessed during the next supervision mission, tentatively planned from March 23-28,
 2015.

         Comments
         Deviation has increased from 30 % in 2013 to 94 % in 2014 as a result of a falling of budget revenues following the drop of petroleum
         prices.

 Overall Comments
 In addition to the above comments, it should be noted that Civil Servants identification operation, started in 2013, is still not completed. Therefore,
 there is no possibility to identify ghost workers and to remove them from payroll (PDO indicator 3).
 For PDO indicator 4, Supreme Audit Authority and State General Inspectorate produced annual reports for 2012 and 2013. These reports are not
 posted in websites which have yet to be created.
 Overall, considering several weaknesses mentioned in this report, it is unlikely that PDO and IP will be achieved.
