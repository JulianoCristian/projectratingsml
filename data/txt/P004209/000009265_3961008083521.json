    Project (SACIII) will support greater efficiency in private\n            and public investment, underpinning economic growth.  By\n            enhancing the efficiency of public resources management, it\n            will also assist the government in shifting its focus\n            towards social issues and the alleviation of poverty.  As\n            with the two previous structural adjustment credits, SACIII\n            will assist the government in sustaining the momentum of\n            reform and undertaking more difficult structural measures.\n            The basis for this project is the government's own\n            adjustment program, which addresses the main factors\n            limiting growth and effective poverty reduction. SACIII will\n            assist the government in improving the incentive system for\n            private sector development and the management of public\n            resources by closely interlinking two principal components:\n            1) private sector enabling environment, focusing on\n            state-owned enterprise reform, the regulatory framework, and\n            financial sector reform; and 2) public resources management,\n            focusing on public expenditure management, civil service\n            reform and the social security system."}, "docdt": "1996-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
