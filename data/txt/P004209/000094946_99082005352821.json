unsatisfactory. Project sustainability is uncertain. World\n            bank performance is satisfactory and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory overall. Important lessons include the\n            following: First is the need to adequately reflect weak\n            client capacity in the design of short-term adjustment\n            support. Operations in countries such as this need to be\n            more focused, limiting interventions to a few areas, but\n            seeking substantive reforms likely to have high impact.\n            Unfortunately, the legal development framework which\n            involved substantial change was not appropriate for an\n            adjustment operation. Secondly, World Bank staff need to\n            focus more on the \"big picture\" during\n            supervision. Detailed conditionalities should be seen as\n            means to, not ends in, themselves. Staff should regularly\n            assess the impact of measures and examine whether changes\n            are needed in project design or implementation arrangements.\n            Another lesson is to pay extra attention to the needs of\n            small clients that usually have limited economic management\n            capacity. Finally, broad support and ownership within\n            government at the highest levels is important. Project\n            implementation suffered because support for reforms under\n            the credit was centered around a few key people; most\n            decisionmakers interacted little with the Bank and did not\n            understand much of the credit's objectives and details.\n            Efforts should be made to understand decisionmaking and the\n            political economy of reform in relatively closed societies."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
