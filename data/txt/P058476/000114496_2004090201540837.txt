for any given calendar year as set forth in paragraph (b) 
above, the Host Country 
shall be required to make-up the  shortfall over the course of the following calendar 
year or 
such later period as acceptable to the Trustee in its sole 
discretion; provided however, that the Host Country shall 
not be permitted to 
deliver any make-up quantities of MERs 
beyond 31 December 2012, and all MERs 
for prior years shall 
be delivered to Trustee in full by such date, unless 
otherwise permitted in writing by the Trustee.  Any 
Emissions Reductions
