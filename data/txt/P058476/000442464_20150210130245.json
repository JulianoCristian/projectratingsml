Waste has been\n            discharged here since 1960. A facility for collection of\n            biogas will be built at the Grobina landfill. At Skede, a\n            gas collection station will operate where gas generated by\n            rotting waste through a specially built collection system\n            will be channeled to a generator producing electricity.\n            Under the Kyoto protocol, carbon quotas can be traded, and\n            as Latvia does not use its quota in full, it can sell a part\n            to another country via the prototype carbon fund."}, "docdt": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
