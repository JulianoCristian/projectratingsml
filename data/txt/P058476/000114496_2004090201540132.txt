Dear Mr. Stals: 
 
Re: LATVIA:  Loan No. 7033-LV
(Liepaja Region Solid Waste Management Project)
Amendment to the Project Agreement
We refer to the Project Agreement (Liepaja Region Solid Waste Managament 
Project) dated December 19, 2000 between the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development and the Liepajas Ras, Ltd.  We also refer to your letter dated January 28, 
2003 requesting amendments to the Project Agreement.  We are pleased to inform you 
that the Bank agrees to the following amendments: 
 
1. 
Part C of Schedule 1 is amended by adding number “1” before the words 
“National Competitive Bidding”, substituting “$350,000” with “$400,000”and deleting 
the words “up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $400,000.”  
 
2. 
A new  section 2 is added to Part C of Schedule 1, and reads as follows:  
 
“2. 
Procurement of Small Works
Works estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent per 
contract, may be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded 
on the basis of quotations obtained from three (3) qualified domestic 
contractors in response to a written invitation.  The invitation shall include 
a
detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the 
required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the 
Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made 
to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required 
work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the contract 
successfully.”
