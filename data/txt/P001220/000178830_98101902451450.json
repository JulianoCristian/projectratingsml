This project will consist of\n            financing and establishment of nurseries and sale of\n            planting material to smallholders; supervision of\n            smallholder tea cultivation in the field and the training of\n            smallholders through a staff of instructors; operation of\n            buying centers, including collection, inspection, purchase\n            and transport of green leaf to the factories; and organizing\n            and supervising these activities through a small central\n            staff. The project will provide about 15,000 smallholders\n            with a cash income, raising them from subsistence economy to\n            a better standard of living, thus contributing to the\n            political stability of the country."}, "docdt": "1964-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
