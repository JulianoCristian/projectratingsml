SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Kenya has applied for an IDA credit to help
finance the expansion (second plan) of its tea development program in the
African smallholder areas. Under the first plan, which is being mainly
financed by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) and the Federal
Republic of Germany, 8,400 acres of tea have already been planted by 18,000
smallholders and two factories have been built in addition to existing
factories already processing smallholders' leaf. To complete the first
plan a further 2,700 acres would be planted and four more factories built.
ii.       The project for which IDA financing is requested is the second
plan under which an additional 14,400 acres would be planted and 10 more
factories would be built.
iii.      The development of smallholder tea cultivation in Kenya is organ-
ized and supervised by the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA), a
statutory body set up in 1960. KTDA establishes and finances tea nurseries
for the production of planting material which is sold to smallholders either
for cash or on credit, and it supervises smallholders' planting and cultiva-
tion. It establishes buying centers for green leaf and provides staff and
transport to collect, inspect and carry the leaf to the factories. It
arranges for processing of smallholderst leaf in existing or new tea fac-
tories, and participates in the financing of new tea factories.
iv.       Private commercial tea companies would participate in the project,
as they are already doing under the first plan, by providing factory manage-
ment and tea marketing services, and by providing funds for KTDA to invest
in the factory companies.
v.        The estimated cost of the field sector of the project is £ 13760,000
and of the factory sector £ 1,440,000; total £ 3,200,000 (US$8,960,000 equiv-
alent). It is proposed that the field sector would be financed by an IDA
credit of £ 1 million (US$2.8 million), the balance being provided by CDC
loan and KTDA revenues. The investment costs in the field sector include
expenditures on seed, salaries and wages, vehicles and equipment, transport
and miscellaneous items. The largest item is salaries, wages and other
staff costs during the development period (i.e. the first four years of
each planting), which account for 42 per cent of the costs of the field
sector. The additional tea roads that will be needed for carrying green
leaf to the factories are not part of the project and will be financed
separately.
vi.       Under the arrangements which KTDA would make for the processing
and sale of smallholderst leaf the grower would receive a first payment of
40 cents 1/ per lb of green leaf plus a second payment depending on factory
profits. KTDA would recovrer its operating expenses through a revenue levy
of 10 cents per lb of green leaf; additional capital levies of seven cents
per lb would be payable to enable KTDA to recover with interest its invest-
ment in the field sector of the program. The field sector would be finan-
cially self-liquidating.
1/ The East African Shilling is divided into 100 cents.



vii.      IDA would not contribute finance for the factories.   Of the
£ 1,h40,000 required CDC would provide about half (£ 720,00); commercial
tea firms would provide about one third (£ 480,000) through KTDA; the
remaining £ 240,000 would be provided by a Kenya Government loan. Four
commercial firms have already expressed to KTDA their interest in providing
finance, management and marketing services.
viii.     The KTDA Board comprises representatives of the Department of
Agriculture, the Kenya Tea Board, CDC and the growers. The represelntatives
of the growers are elected from divisional and district tea committees.
The KTDA head office staff has been largely recruited -with assistance from
CDC and is well qualified. The staff for the supervision of tea planting
is employed by the Department of Agriculture and is made available to KTDA.
KTDA reimburses the Department of Agriculture for the cost of this staff.
The staff for inspection and collection of green leaf is employed directly
by KTDA.
ix.       The project will provide about 15,000 smallholders with a cash
income, raising them from subsistence economy to a better standard of living,
thus contributing to the political stability of the country. Since most of
the tea produce would be exported, the project's contribution to the foreign
exchange earnings of Kenya would be substantial, averaging about £ 2.3 mil-
lion a year at full production. The project would yield an average annual
net return to the economy of about 28 per cent over its expected lifetime
of 50 years. With tea roads included in the investment cost, this net
return would be reduced to 24 per cent.
xo        The project, which is the second stage of a program already suc-
cessfully unde.vay, is sound. The organizing authority is well staffed and
capable and smallholders are keen to participate, The project is suitable
for an IDA credit of about £ 1 million (US$2.8 million).

SMALIHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Government of Kenya has applied for an IDA credit to help
finance the expansion of its program for the development of tea production
by African smallholders. This appraisal report is based on findings of a
field mission which visited Kenya in September 1963 and on discussions in
January-February ].964, with representatives of the Kenya Tea Authority
(KTDA), the Kenya Government and the Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC).
II. BACKGROUND
2.        Tea production has become one of the most important agricultural
industries in Kenya during recent years, now ranking writh sisal as second
earner of export income (coffee is first). In 1963, over 54,QQO acres were
in tea, with about 85 per cent in large estates owned and managed by private
companies. These companies are experienced in tea growing and are well
established in Kenya. They have close working relations with other tea
growing areas and have gained recognition for Kenya in the world tea markets.
The tea industry as a whole employs about nine per cent of the Kenya labor
force, and its output of 40 million pounds per year accounts for about 2-1/2
per cent of world tea production.
3.        In the future more emphasis will be given to expanding tea growing
in the African smallholder areas since in many places it is the only practi-
cal cash crop that will enable the subsistence farmers to achieve a better
standard of living. Experience has already shown that tea growing by small-
holders is feasible in Kenya. The Kenya Department of Agriculture has
estimated that there are some 800,000 acres having soils and climate suitable
for tea in the African smallholder areas, but the average smallholder will
have only a fraction of his land in tea, with the balance used for food
crops and cattle.
4.        The smallholder tea planting program was started in the late fifties
with a target of 11,100 acres for the first plan. Planting has now been com-
pleted on 8,h00 acres and the remaining 2,700 acres are expected to be
planted by 1966/67. The original goal was one acre of tea per farm, which
would have limited participation to 11,100 smallholders.   However, the pro-
gram has proved so popular that 18,0CO farmers have taken part already,
necessitating a wider distribution of available planting material, and an
average planting so far of only 047 acres per farm. It is intended to limit
the number of growers admitted each year to the program and to increase the
average size of planting to at least 0.75 acres per farm. Participants in
the tea program are selected by Growers' District Tea Committees and by the



- 2 -
Specialist Tea Officer with approval by the Department of Agriculture. The
criteria for selection include experience in farming, a satisfactory land
title and creditiworthiness. The smalllolders occupy their own land which
has been consolidated in a land reform program under the Swynnerton Plan.
In the main tea growing area farms range in size from four to eight acres.
In less densely populated areas farms may be as large as 40 to 50 acres.
Food crops are usually grown on two to three acres with the balance of the
land used for grazing.
5.        The development of smallholder tea cultivation in Kenya is organ-
ized and supervised by the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA). The
Authority is a corporate body which was first established in 1960 as the
Special Crops Development Authority (SCDA). XTDA establishes and finances
tea nurseries for the production of planting material to be sold to the
smallholders either for cash or on credit; and it supervises the smallholders
planting and cultivation. It establishes buying centers for green leaf and
provides staff and transport to collect, inspect and carry the leaf to the
tea factories. It arranges for processing of smallholders' leaf in existing
tea factories and participates in the financing of new tea factories. Furns
needed to finance the field development for the first plan have been provided
by loans from CDC, the Federal Republic of Germany and to a small extent by
the Kenya Government itself. KTDAls balance sheet at June 30, 1963, and its
financial results for the past three years are summarized in Annex 1.
6.        In 1957, the Government built a small tea factory at Ragati in
Nyeri District to process smallholdersf green leaf; this factory was trans-
ferred to KTDA in 1960.  By arrangement with KTDA, eight private factories
wholly owned by commercial tea companies and one nucleus estate factory
financed by CDC, Eastern Produce (Africa) Ltd. and the Meru African District
Council are also processing leaf from smallholder areas. To process the
increasing quantities of leaf that smallholders will produce on the 11,100
acres under the first plan two new factories have recently been completed
at Chinga in Nyeri District and Mataara in Kiambu District. A separate
company has been formed for each factory, two thirds of the finance being
provided by CDC and one third by KTDA, using funds borrowed from two pri,vate
commercial tea companies for the purpose; these private tea companies 1/ are
responsible for managing the factories and marketing the tea. Four more new
factories are to be built for the first plan and negotiations for three of
them are already underway between IKTDA, CDC and private companies. The
locations of the KTDA factories of the first plan are shown on the attached
map.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Definition
7.        The project is the expansion of the tea development program in
the African smallholder areas of Kenya and is identified as the second plan.
It will provide production and processing facilities for 14,h00 acres of
tea, increasing the smallholder tea cultivation to a total of 25,500 acres.
About 15,000 smallholders will participate in this project, including some
growers already participating in the first plan.
8.        In the field sector of the project KTDA's responsibilities would
include the following:
1) financing and establishment of nurseries and sale of
planting material to smallholders;
2) supervision of smallholder tea cultivation in the field
and the training of smallholders through a staff of
instructors;
3) operation of buying centers, including collection, inspec-
tion, purchase and transport of green leaf to the factories;
and
4) organizing and supervising these activities through a small
central staff.
9.        Ten new factories would be built in addition to the six new fac-
tories of the first plan, Each factory would process the tea from 1,200 to
1,500 acres and would produce 1.2 to 1.5 million lb made tea per year.
10.       The construction or improvement of the roads which will be needed
by the time the green leaf has to be transported to the factories is not
included in the project.  The Government has drawn up a tentative schedule
of road requirements with an estimated cost of £ 640,000 and has applied to
IDA for financial assistance. Arrangements have been made for consultants
to review this road program and it is expected that it will be appraised
later in 1964 for possible IDA financing. The Government would in any event
undertake to construct and maintain the roads needed to enable KTDA to col-
lect green leaf from growers producing tea under the project and to deliver
such leaf to the factories.
B. Planting Program
11.       The area of tea to be planted would be 14,400 acres and the plant-
ing program would be spread over seven years beginning in 1963/64 and ending
1969/70. The planting schedule, which takes account of the number of



supervisory staff and the amount of good quality planting material that is
expected to be available is shown in detail in Annex 2.
C. Field Development
Nurseries
12.       The planting material would be produced in nurseries, some of
which are already established for the first plan. One nursery acre produces
planting material for about 25 acres of tea. About 3,000 to 3,500 seedlings
are required for planting one acre of tea. The seedlings are retained in
the nursery for approximately two years and then are sold to the growers for
30 cents each. The grower may pay the whole amount in cash or he may receive
credit from KTDA. For the first 3,000 seedlings planted he may elect to
receive credit of 6, 12 or 18 cents per seedling, the minimum cash payment
per seedling being 12 cents. Thereafter for all other planting and for
replanting growers are required to pay the full 30 cents per seedling in
cash. KTDA's estimates of receipts from sales of seedlings assume maximum
use of credit.
Field Supervision
13.       For both plans of the tea program, the supervisory staff would
include one Tea Officer for each of the 11 districts and four Senior Tea
Officers. It is proposed to increase the existing staff of instructors as
the second plan progresses. The junior staff for the first plan has com-
prised one agricultural instructor for eachl 400 acres planted and one assis-
tant agricultural instructor for each 200 growers. As more tea is planted
some will be on farms already growing tea, and there would be a greater
degree of instruction from established tea growers to new ones. With increas-
ing concentration of plantings each instructor will be able to look after
more growers. After completion of the planting program in 1969/70, the need
for field supervision would be substantially reduced. In future greater use
is to be made of the Kagochi Training School at Nyeri in training farmers
and instructors. The proposed staff for field supervision is shown in Annex 3.
Inspection and Collection
14.       Additional buying centers and the necessary staff of leaf officers,
leaf inspectors, car and lorry drivers, and clerks would be added as the
production of green leaf increases. This staff, which would be working on
both the first and second plans is expected to increase from 201 in 1963/64
to 588 in 1973/74.
15.   -   Equipment to be provided for inspection and collection will include
trucks, landrovers and telecommunications instruments. Trucks, the princi-
pal item, used on both first and second plans would increase from 18 to 89.
Servicing and repair of all equipment would be provided by private workshops.



Yields and Prices
16.       Yields of 4,500 lb of green leaf per acre are expected from mature
(six-year) tea, equivalent to 1,000 lb of made tea. Production should nor-
mally start in the third year at about 200 lb of made tea per acre, increas-
ing to 400 lb in the fourth year, 800 lb in the fifth year and 1,000 lb in
the sixth year and thereafter.  Actual yields of tea from small holdings
delivered to factories averaged 88 per cent of these estimates in 1961/62
and 83 per cent in 1962/63. Most of the shortfall was due to the manufac-
turing of sun-dried tea by the growers and to substandard cultural practices.
It is expected that the manufacturing of sun-dried tea will be substantially
reduced by the opening of new factories and by establishing more buying
centers. The cultural practices have already been improved by better train-
ing of field staff and growers. Examination of production records of commer-
cial tea estates adjacent to the smallholder areas indicates that estate
yields are in many cases considerably above 1,000 lb of made tea per acre.
This, however, is sometimes due to coarse plucking which results in lower
quality. HTDA insists on fine plucking, which gives lmier quantities but
higher quality.
17.       The tea produced has been of high quality and has brought good
prices. The price for Ragati tea on the Nairobi market averaged Sh 3097
per lb in 1960/61, Sh 3.71 in 1961/62 and was over Sh 4 in 1962/63. Price
projections for the project have been based on a price of Sh 3.75 per lb of
made tea, after checking against long-term price projections for the world
tea market made by the Bank's economic staff. According to these projec-
tions little change is expected for medium and higher quality teas such as
will be produced under the project. The Government would not place cesses,
taxes or other imposts on KTDA tea.
D. Factories
18.       The ten additional factories required under the second plan would
be located in the main tea areas (see map) and each factory would usually
be built in two stages. The first stage would be for a capacity of 800,000
to 900,000 lb and the second stage for an additional 400,000 to 600,000 lb
of made tea per year. The factories would be planned so as to come into
operation as soon as there is a supply of green leaf big enough for economic
operation (Annex 2). Before that time the leaf would be processed in exist-
ing factories. The new factories would use the CTC/Rotovane process which
is being used successfully in modern tea factories in Kenya in preference
to older methods. Tea processed by CTC/Rotovane has also brought higher
prices on the Nairobi market.
E. Arrangements for Processing Smallholders' Leaf
19.       In addition to being responsible for setting up and staffing
buying centers, and for collection, inspection and transport of green leaf
to t.he factories, KTDA is responsible for making agreements with the factolies



- 6 -
for the processing of the smallholdersI leaf.  The existing agreements,
which it is proposed should also be the pattern for the second plan, provide
for a fixed payment to the grower of 40 cents per lb of green leaf plus a
second payment depending on factory profits. In 1962/63 all factories made
second payments; for more than two thirds of smallholders' production under
the KTDA program the second payment was 16 cents per lb. As under the first
plan, KTDA would recover its operating expenses through a revenue levy of
10 cents per lb on all smallholder leaf purchased; in addition, to enable
KTDA to recover with interest its investment in the field sector of the
program, a capital levy of seven cents per lb would be payable. Accounts
would be kept for each grower and the capital levy would cease when his
individual assessment (based on delivery of a certain amount of green leaf
for every tea bush planted) had been repaid.
F. Cost Estimates
20.       The estimated investment cost of the project (second plan of tea
program), including field sector and factories is £ 3.2 million (US$8.96
million). The estimates which are based on experience in the first plan
plus a 15 per cent contingency allowance are summarized below:

US$tooo Equivalent        8,960           5,400
In calculating the investment costs of the field sector (Annex 4) all expen-
ditures for nurseries and distribution of planting material are regarded as
investment costs.  Field supervision, inspection and collection, and head
office expenses are regarded as investment costs only during the development
period, after which they are regarded as operating expenses. Interest at



- 7 -
6.5 per cent has been included during the first four years of development
in which interest would not be covered by levies on green leaf production.
The development period for each planting includes two vears with no produc-
tion and twro years with low production (para 16)o  Since the planting program
extends over seven years (Annex 2) the development period for the project
would be 11 years.
21.       A breakdown of field sector costs into seed, salaries, vehicles
and equipment, transport costs (fuel, spare parts, etc.) and miscellaneous
costs is showsn in Annex 5. The largest item is salaries, wages and other
staff costs which account for 42 per cent of the costs of the field sector.
22.       The private on-farm investments, as well as the additional costs
of tea roads (para 10), have not been included in the cost estimates. The
on-farm works would consist mainly of land preparation and cultivation during
the development period. This would be done by the fanners with family labor
under the general guidance and supervision of the KMDAo
23.       The actual costs of the two factories which have recently been
completed under the first plan have been used as a basis for estimating the
cost of the ten factories to be constructed for the second plan between
1965/66 and 1972/73. The average cost per factory is estimated at £ lh,OC0,
including a 15 per cent contingency allowance.
G, Proposed Financing
24.       The £ 1,760,000 investment cost for the field sector of the project
would be financed by an IDA credit of £ 1 million, the balance being provided
by CDC loan and KTDA revenues. IDA would not contribute finance for the fac-
tories.
25.       CDC has agreed to finance about 50 per cent (£ 720,000) of the
investment required for the 10 factories needed for the project provided
that ccnmmercial interests and the Kenya Government finance the balance. It
is expected that, as in the first plan, commercial firms would provide loans
to KTDA amounting to one third of the factory costs (£ 480,000) which ITDA
would invest in the new factory companies, part in equity and part in loan
capital.  The remaining £ 240,000 would be met by Kenya Government loans.
Four commercial firms have already expressed to ITDA in writing their inter-
est in providing finance, management and marketing services for factories
under the second plan. They would not, however, make a firm commitment
until nearer the time when the factories are required. The Kenya Government
would undertake in any event to provide or cause to be provided the process-
ing facilities required for the project.
26.       As in the first plan a separate company would be formed for each
factory; tea growers would be encouraged to buy shares and would be repre-
sented on its board. Further details of the proposed arrangements for
financing individual factory companies and for eventual transfer of owner-
ship to growers are in Annex 6.

27.       In accordance with the foregoing proposals, financing for the
field and factory sectors of the project would be provided as follows:

H. Proposed Terms of Loans and Disbursements
28.       After discussion with CDC and KTDA, it has been proposed that for
disbursement purposes the tea program should be divided into two phases with
July 1, 1964 as the dividing point.  Up to that date CDC, in addition to its
contributions to the first plan, would finance costs incurred for the second
plan, including costs for which the Kenya Government has already made advances
(Annex 1, Footnote 5). At the end of the first phase (June 30, 1964), the
total accumulated borrowings for the field sector of the two plans would be
about £ 960,000 (Annex 7), of which £ 700,000 would have been drawn from the
CDC loan of £ 900,000; the balance would have come from the German and Kenya
Government loans both of which would be fully disbursed by that date (Annex 1).
29.       The terms of repayment of the £ 700,000 (which would be withdrawn
from the CDC loan by July 1, 1964) would be changed from 20 years, including
10 years of grace for each drawing as at present to 15 years, including 10
years of grace. A repayment schedule reflecting these changes is in Annex 7.
30.       The new loans required for the second phase of field development
(after July 1, 1964) would be £ 1,200,000, being the maximum of accumulated
borrowings for the second phase in 1969/70 as shown in Annex 7. These loans
would be divided, £ 1,000,000 IDa and £ 200,000 1/ CDC, bringing the total
of CDC loans to £ 900,000.
1/ The difference between this figure of £ 200,000 and the £ 245,000 in
paragraph 27 is shown in the following table:

31.       It is proposed that the IDA credit of £ 1 million (US$2.8 million)
to assist development of the field sector should be made to the Kenya Govern-
ment on normal IDA terms. The Government would re-lend the proceeds of the
IDA credit to KTDA.
32.       Terms on which the Government would re-lend to KTDA the proceeds
of the IDA credit would take account of the balance between KTDAts costs
and revenues in the second phase of the tea program as indicated in Annex 7.
Cash deficits would accrue during the first six years of the second phase
(1964/65-1969/70) after which surplus revenues should be sufficient to repay
the accumulated borrowings within the following seven years. However, in
order to provide a margin for setbacks or delays, it is proposed that repay-
ment terms for the Government (IDA) and CDC loans to ETDA for the second
phase should be 16 years, including eight years of grace. A provisional
schedule of drawings and redemptions is shown in Annex 8, The proceeds of
the IDA credit would be re-lent to KTDA by the Kenya Government at an inter-
est rate of 5-1/2 per cent.
33.       The CDC loan of £ 200,000 would be disbursed during the first two
years of the second phase (at the rate of £ 40,000 a quarter starting July 1,
1964) covering the remaining loan requirements of the first plan; the Govern-
ment (IDA) loan would be disbursed over a period of six years (196h/65-
1969/70) and would be limited to expenditures in the field sector of the
project incurred after July 1, 1964.
34.       IDA would make no disbursements until CDC had disbursed its full
contribution to the first phase of field development (estimated £ 700,000
up to June 30, 1964). IDA's disbursements would be made against statements
of expenditures on the field sector of the project. Disbursements would
never be greater than the amount necessary to cover KTDA's cash deficit,
i.e. the amount by which expenditures, both recurrent and investment, of
KTDA on all its operations in the field sector exceed its revenues. To
ensure that the withdrawal of the IDA credit would be spread over the main
part of the development period the withdrawals would be limited to amounts
not in excess of 10 per cent above the disbursement schedule for the IDA
credit shown in Annex 8. In the event that KTDA's deficits should exceed
IDAts disbursements the Government wjould make available necessary funds to
cover the shortfall.
35.       KTDA's accounts and balance sheets would be audited semiannually
by accountants approved by IDA.
36.       KTDA would be required to provide regular reports to IDA showing
progress in all operations, especially in planting and staffing and would
consult IDA and CDC promptly in the case of deviations of more than 10 per
cent in the planting program. Any further borrowings would be subject to
approval by IDA and CDC as long as CDC and the Government loans to KTDA are
outstanding. KTDA would also consult with IDA and CDC on the appropriation
of any surpluses arising from the combined plans.

I. KTDA's Estimated Operating Results
37.       A summary of projected operating results in the field sector for
the combined first and second plans is shown in Annex 9. By recovery of
all operating and investment costs, including interest through revenue and
capital levies as described in paragraph 19, the field sector would be
financially selfliquidating.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. The Organizing Authority
38.       Under the new constitution of KTDA the Board would consist of the
Permanent Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, the Director of Agri-
culture, the Chairman of the Kenya Tea Board and a representative of CDC;
three members appointed by the Minister of Agriculture, including the Chair-
man of the Board; the general manager of KTDA and representatives of the
growers, currently one from each of five regions, with provision for an
additional representative for each region with more than 4,000 acres of tea
(at completion of the project it is expected that there would be seven repre-
sentatives of growers). Representatives of the growers would be elected from
the divisional and district tea committees through the regional tea boards.
These grower committees are important in that they provide a channel through
which growers can express their views and voice their grievances, The loan
agreement between CDC and KTDA for the first plan provided that for the
period of the loan one member of the Board shall at all times be a person
to be nominated by CDC. A similar provision has now been included in the
new constitution of KTDA and will apply to any further borrowing from CDC.
CDC expects to be able to provide any necessary replacements for I{TDA head
office staff. The Government would consult IDA about any proposed changes
in the appointmnent to the KTDA Board of the Chairman and the two other mein-
bers whose appointment is at the discretion of the Minister of Agriculture.
39.       KTDA has power to provide that no person shall establish a tea
nursery, garden or plantation or sell leaf to anyone else without permission
of KTDA. In addition, KTDA has established standards for tea cultural prac-
tices, including disease control.
B, Staffing
hO.       The staff for field supervision of the tea program (para 13) is
employed by the Department of Agriculture and is made available to KTDA on
a reimbursable basis. All but one oZ the present tea officers are European.
The policy of the Department of Agriculture and KTDA, however, is to make
additional appointments of Africans to the tea officer posts as soon as prac-
ticab'e. The problem is not so much howi long the Euiropean officers will
stay, but hof soon suitable African officer replacements can be found.
KTDA envisages the recruitment of African tea officers by further temporary



- 11 -
transfer from the Department of Agriculture and by the recruitment from
agricultural colleges and tea estates. The Kenya Government would provide
the field staff of all grades required for the project together writh the
necessary staff housing.
4i.       The staff for inspection and collection (para 14) is employed
directly by KTDA and consists only of Africans. As lim:ited training is
needed, the staffing problems can be reasonably met.
42.       The head office staff has been largely recruited from abroad
through the assistance of CDC., and is well qualified. The first general
manager recently retired and was succeeded by a former Senior District
Commissioner wiho has excellent working relationships with the African
groups. The present assistant general manager is seconded by CDC and will
be available until the end of 1964, after which CDC has a qualified replace-
ment for him. The chief accountant is a qualified accountant from CDC.
The chief technical officer of the Authority w-ho is in charge of all field
supervision, leaf inspection and collection, is employed directly by KTDA.
At present one member of the head office staff is an African and steps are
being taken to train others. IDA would be consulted about appointments to
KTDAts senior management positions.
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
43.       The project has social as well as economic benefits.  It will
provide a great number of smallholders with a cash income, raising them
from subsistence economy to a better standard of living. Tea is a high-
yielding cash crop which is grown at high altitudes on land unsuitable for
most other crops. Its development, therefore, may help to ease pressure on
the best land at lower elevations and contribute to the political stability
of the country.
44.       Assuming yields of 4h500 lb green leaf (1,000 lb of made tea) per
acre and a gross payment to the grower of 40 cents per lb green leaf (Sh 1.8
per lb made tea) the net return to the grower, after deduction of revenue
and capital levies totaling 17 cents per lb green leaf, would be £ 52 per
acre per annum. When a smallholder has paid off his capital levy his return
would increase to £ 68 per acre. Assuming market conditions remain favorable
and second payments can be made to the growers the net returns would be higher.
With a second payment of 16 cents per lb of green leaf (which was made for
two thirds of the smallholder tea production in 1962/63), the net return
would be £ 88 per acre, while capital levies are being paid off, and £ 104
per acre thereafter.
45.       For the purpose of economic appraisal on-farm costs are negligible
since the operation and maintenance of tea gardens require mainly hand labor
that can be provided by the growerts family at no additional cost. The use
of fertilizers and plant protection materials is not necessary for the time
being.



- 12 -
46.       Tea graring would scarcely reduce the production of other crops.
Most of the tea can be grown on bush and grassland which is suitable only
for extensive grazing. Therefore, no opportunity costs for land use have
been included in the economic evaluation of the project.
47.       On the basis of the yield and price assumptions given in paragraphs
16 and 17, the gross value of production of the completed scheme (in 1975/76)
would amount to £ 2.7 million per year (Annex 10). As most of the total
production would be exported the projectts contribution to the foreign
exchange earnings of Kenya would be substantial. Deducting the foreign
exchange component of the production costs and debt services the net increase
in foreign exchange earnings would average about £ 2.0 million per year during
the repayment period and £ 2.3 million per year thereafter.
48.       The total investment cost of the project, incurred over an 11-year
development period, as summarized for the field and factory sector in Annex
10 amounts to approximately £ 3.2 million (US$90O million). The estimated
operating expenditures and gross and net revenues are also summarized in
Annex 10. On the basis of these estimates and taking full account of the
development period in discounting, the project would yield an average annual
net return to the econoniy of about 28 per cent over its expected lifetime
of 50 years. Plans for the construction and improvement of tea roads have
not yet been appraised by IDA (para 10), but if the cost of these roads at
Governmentts estimate of £ 640,000 should be charged to the tea project and
distributed over two years (1064/65 and 1965/66) the average annual net
return would be reduced to 24 per cent. It should be noted that the tea
growers would repay the total field development costs, including the cost
of some services normally provided at Government expense.
VI. CONCLUSIONJS UMD RECOiChENDATIONS
49.       The project, which is the second plan of a program already suc-
cessfully underway, is technically and economically sound. The administrative
arrangements for executing the project are satisfactory and the organizing
authority is well staffed and capable. Smallholders are keen to enter the
project and it has already been proven in the first plan of the tea program
that they are able to grow tea of good quality.
50.       The project is suitable for an IDA credit of £ 1.0 million (US$2.8
million) which would be used for financing field development. This would
be equivalent to about 31 per cent of the total project cost.

4/ The loans, of which £ 588.7 thousand had been disbursed at June 30, 1963
were for the first plan.  They comprise the following:
a)  A CDC loan made direct to KTDA,  The authorized amount is £ 900,000
of which £ 450,000 was drawn down to June 30, 1963 (and £ 700,000 is
expected to have been drawn by June 30, 1964). The interest rate
varies with the different tranches, being one per cent above CDCls
borrowing rate from the British Treasury. The cost to KTDA has
averaged about seven per cent. Each tranche was to be repaid over
ten years after ten years of grace, but this is to be revised to
repayment over five years after ten years of grace (see para 29),
except the first installment wh; ch woild be repaid in four years
after 11 years of grace.

with equal annual instanhaents through 1977.
c)  Kenya Government loans, totaling £ 48,500 as of June 30, 1963, of
which £ 20,000 is repayable in December 1969 and the balance at the
rate of £ 2,000 per year from 1963/64 to 1977/78.
5/ The Kenya Government advanced £ 40,000 for the second plan free of inter-
est and this is to be refunded when finance for the second plan is arranged.
The remaining £. 13,800 was advanced by the former Iand Development and
Settlement Board for services and materials provided by ErDA for tea
plantings on settlement schemes. In addition, the Kenya Government is
providing road improvement and staff housing up to a total of £ 185,000
obtained from a German loan for which KTDA has no obligation.

IENY-A TEA PROGRAM
Arrangements for Setting Up and Operating Factory Companies
1.        It is intended that, as under the first plan, a separate company
would be formed for each tea factory. For each company, finance would be
provided by CDC, KTDA and Kenya Government on the following lines:
Equity       Loan
Source of Fund         Capital      Capital      Total
.. i n   £. . .  * .    *
C D C                    20,500      51,500      72,000
K T D A                 20500       27,500      h8,ooo
Kenya Government            --       24,000      24,000
Total   41,000     103,000      144,000
2.        For its investments in the factory companies KTDA would use loans
from private commercial tea companies. Loans made by commercial tea com-
panies to KTDA would, if the same pattern is followed as for the first plan,
be at eight per cent interest with repayment in equal annual installments
over 13 years after a five-year grace period.   Loans to the factory compan-
ies by CDC and KTDA would be on the same terms,
3.        Dividends on issued shares would be paid out of profits with the
objective that shareholders should receive over a period of 18 years a return
averaging eight per cent a year; the balance of profits would be available
for appropriations to a price reserve fund and for a second payment to
growers. Growers would be encouraged to buy shares in each company, but
these would be limited to a maximum of £ 39,000 so long as the company had
loans outstanding. Such shares would be issued progressively in addition
to the initial issued share capital of £ 41,000, bringing the total author-
ized and issued share capital to £ 80,000. Once the loans had been redeemed
(i.e. after 18 years, or by prior redemption) growers would be able to buy
KTDA and CDC shareholdings until they held the whole of the equity capital.-
1/ It seems likely, however, that by the recent introduction of corporation
tax the eauity holding by CDC and KTDA would be limited to a nominal
£ 1,000 and the balance of £ 40,000 would be held in income notes evenly
divided between the two parties.   The income notes would be convertible
into equity so that when the growers have taken up the balance of £. 39s000
in shares and when the loans have been repaid these notes could be con-
verted intosquity for growers to purchase.

Net Income (before interest)    15,400     37,200       53,500       72,000
5.        As in the first plan arrangements for management would be covered
for each factory company in a management agreement between the company and
the commercial firm that undertakes the managing agency. The same or another
commercial firm would be responsible for marketing of tea. Most of the tea
at present is sold at the tea auctions in Nairobi, the remnainder being sold
in London.

1/  Includes £ 609,600 at the end of 1962/63.
In the foregoing projection it is shown that the annual net operating expen-
ditures would accumulate as in the past three fiscal years and would reach
a maximum of £ 1,808,500 at the end of 1968/69. Starting -with 1969/70, the
first year in which a net revenue is indicated, annual net revenues are applied
to reduce the development expenditure which would disappear in fiscal year
1975/76 at the end of which a small earned surplus of £ 50,500 should appear
on the books of KTDA. Thereafter revenues and expenses would be kept, more or
less, in balance by the scheduled exDiration of capital levies and, if
necessary, by adjustment of the revenue levies. The interest payable by KTDA
to the private tea companies which would provide all the capital funds that
KTDA would re-invest in the factories would be offset by dividends and interest
on KTDA?s shares and loans in the factory companies.
