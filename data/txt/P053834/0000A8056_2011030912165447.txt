                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Grant, funded by USAID, provides a total of US$10 million in funding for technical assistance for the privatization and economic reform program of the Government of Jordan.
                         Good progress has been made to date towards the objectives of the grant. The grant supported Jordan's major privatization transactions and assisted the Executive Private
                         Commission, the implementing agency, in developing a pipeline of potential Public-Private Participation projects in infrastructure.
