LNDC's\n            performance in achieving the objectives of the first line of\n            Credit has been mixed. LNDC has made significant progress in\n            correcting many of the numerous problems noted at the time\n            of appraisal, it still needs to achieve much to develop into\n            a strong institution. The limited availability of trained\n            and experienced staff in Lesotho has made achievement of\n            credit objectives a difficult task, and LNDC will need to\n            exert considerable effort to overcoat the problems it still\n            has. Probably because of other views on priorities, staff\n            weaknesses and overstretched management, LNDC was not always\n            successful In implementing measures agreed upon. Government\n            officials were cooperative in receiving missions and openly\n            discussing their conclusions and concerns. As for the\n            Association's role, it probably would have been useful\n            if it had fielded more frequent supervision missions and\n            exerted more efforts to assist LNDC in such areas as\n            strengthening project appraisal."}, "docdt": "1984-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
