         reconstruction of roads and drainage works damaged by\n            cyclone \"Wally\" which hit Viti Levu, Fiji's\n            largest island, in April 1980. Works will include\n            reconstruction and realignment of a 32 km section of the\n            Suva-Nadi highway; restoration of seawalls, outfall\n            structures, and drains for about 12,000 ha; and dredging of\n            rivers to remove flood-deposited sediments and thereby\n            restore their flood discharge capacity. The proposed\n            reconstruction of the 32 km long section of the Suva-Nadi\n            highway would eliminate the problems of an unstable\n            alignment subject to landslide and thereby reduce\n            disruptions to traffic and avoid the need for costly repairs\n            and maintenance. The benefits due to the restoration and\n            expansion of the drainage works would be in bringing\n            cyclone-damaged land back into production and providing\n            conditions for further expansion of cultivation. There are\n            no institutional risks since PWD and DID have considerable\n            experience in works similar to those included in the\n            project. The cost of the highway component may exceed\n            estimates if unusually severe storms damage work in progress\n            but this would not jeopardize the successful completion of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "1980-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
