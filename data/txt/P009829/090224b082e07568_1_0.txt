            During the Board discussion of the Status Report and Next Steps for
      the Sardar Sarovar (Narmada)Projects last October, we promised to review
      the Bank-wide lessons learned from the Narmadaexperience.

               We asked Mr. Wyss to undertake this review, and his report is attached
      for your Information. It focuses on lessons learned in three main areas:
       :i) project quality at entry; (ii) communications and decision-making; and
      (iii) ownership. We accept the recommendationsmade by Mr. Wyss, which
      are consistent with those of the Report of the Task Force on Portfolio
      Management. They will be implemented in the context of the follow-up to
      that report.

      however, major shortcomings:

            (i)    in R+R:
                                                         for a very small number of
             *     lack of baselineinformation: except      of the people affected,
                   the villages affected, no census existed their future options
                   their economic activity, level of income,
                                                          their preferences. What
                   (most important: land availability)or
                                      2

            was available in terms of baseline information I were surveys of
            differing scope and details;

      *     lack of specific Rolicies covering all the different groups of
            neonle affected - policies which were to ensure that the objective
            stated in the legal documentswill be achieved (i.e., after a
            reasonable transitionperiod, the displaced people would regain at
            least their previous standard of living). Thus, the commitmentto
            this broad policy objectivewas not translated into specific,
            monitorable policy measures agreed with the Government of India
            (GOI) and the three state governmentsconcerned; and

      *     the ganal (Rart of the) Droiect did not grovide tor R+R since it
            was expected that people would be affected only to a limited
            extent and that their compensation would not raise special issues;

     (ii)   on environment:

      *     the effects of the large canal works were not the subject of a
            review of environmentalaspects, though water logging and salinity
            were addressed extensivelyin the engineering studies in the light
            of experiencefrom other irrigationprojects in the region; and

      *     the upstream environmentalreview was limited to the area to be
            inundated rather than covering the full basin.

In sum, shortcomingsat 'project entry" were especially glaring on R+R. In
the light of subsequentdevelopments,this review concentrateson R+R. True,
there are also important environmentalissues, including with respect to
forest cover (especiallyon differences in the assessment of the degraded
nature of such forests), biodiversityand health aspects.

5.        The absence of adequate baseline information,in combinationwith
the poorly specified policies, was certain to make future implementationof
R+R difficult - even more so as R+R touched on politically sensitive points in
GOI and particularly in the three state governments. Therefore, the
resettlementplans prepared for, and agreed to during negotiations,did not
have much operationalmeaning, especially since the institutionalarrangements
for implementingthese plans were not well developed. Finally, the monitoring
arrangements for R+R were woefully weak: there was initially reliance on
poorly selected independent research institutionsretained by each of the
three states and on GOI through the Narmada Control Authority which was
unproven in this area.




            The term "baseline information"is used here in the narrow sense
            of the detailed informationbase essential for R+R planning
            purposes. (In much of the Region's discussion on the project in
            recent years, "baseline"became a measure against which readiness
            of R+R was to be judged.)

6.         Project implementation was postponed by GOI for about two years
because of delays in environmental   clearances. But evidence already had built

Thus, R+R became the subject of intensive

                                     6

     (ii)    from loan/creditanDroval till about 1987/88: NGOs were assured
             that the Bank had a progressiveR+R policy, that this policy was
             fully incorporatedin the loan/creditagreements, that there was
             an agreed resettlementprogram (with details for phas- I and a
             rolling plan thereafter),and that carefully designed monitoring
             arrangementsyere in place;
     (iii)   after 1987/88: letters referred to the intensive dialoguebetween
             the Bank and GOI/state governmentsand to the progressive
             implementation plans which had been designed, and were being
             implementedwith a view to ensuring that the agreed R+R
             objectiveswill be achieved.
13.       Communications with EDs started almost at the same time as those
with NGOs - indeed the same international NGOs tended to inform their
respectiveED about the concerns communicatedto the Bank. Many written
briefings were sent to individual EDs in response to specific requests - in
addition to many oral briefings. Beginning in July 1988, "informal'meetings
took place on a semi-annualbasis between Mr. Arlman and other EDs (mainly
attended by Assistantsto EDs), and the Region. It should be noted that the
Indian ED, although invited, did not attend these meetings; this changed in
1990. The RVP and/or the CD Directorwere present at these meetings with a
group of project managers and staff. The meetings generally coincidedwith
the completion of the semi-annual supervisionmissions. The exchanges
(records of these meetings in the files are not detailed) tended to focus
almost exclusively on R+R, although staff tried also to address other major
project issues. From the limited records, especially in the light of the
detailed written briefs for the first meeting, it appears that the message
from the staff was that important progress on pending R+R matters was underway
and/or agreed to be addressed though major difficultiesremained (especially
in Madhya Pradesh). Managers and staff participatingin these meetings
believe they presented complete factual briefings at these meetings.

14.       Over time the EDs became increasinglyimpatient about what they
considered as slow progress and even backsliding. They felt Bank staff gave
them ever hopeful, rosy reports with emphasis on selected areas of progress
while they receivedvery different reports from NGOs. Eventually, in early
1991, meeting among themselves, they concluded that they needed an Independent
Review to satisfy their constituents. When they brought the subject to the
President,he already had significantknowledge of the project: he had
received a briefing on Narmada in preparation of his visit to India in late
1987 (during that visit, a meeting with NGOs had been quite friendly and he
had not obtained a sense of a major problem brewing). Subsequently,
especially in 1990, he had answered many letters sent to him on the subject.

15.       In the light of the foregoing,it is clear that channels of
communicationwere not clogged, either within the Bank or with the outside.
If anything, communicationswere 'too good': a number of messages went
through various channels where, later on, recipients felt the message had been
misleading. This was the case, first, internallyat the time of negotiations
and subsequentlyat Board approval, when R+R arrangements appeared well in
hand given the agreed resettlementplan and monitoring systems. This line was
reflected fully in exchanges with NGOs and EDs. As the Bank moved into its
activist "incremental"approach, communications  became more difficult. The
                                     7

initial answers did not suffice anymore. True, the Bank's efforts were
recognizedfavorablyby NGOs interestedin the betterment of R+R conditions
for project affected people. But those who opposed the project as such found
it convenientto undermine the Bank's credibilitywith 'its' moving targets
(often not entirely fulfilled);the same NGOs pushed the former group from
center stage and vigorously attacked the Bank thereby putting pressure on
"their" EDs for an IndependentReview. Differences of views between staff
members, referred to earlier,became known both to NGOs and to EDs. This
added to the conflictingnature of signals perceived by EDs.

C.     Ownership

16.       Looking over the developmentsrelated to this project, the most
striking feature is the Bank's gradual "loss of control over the agenda." A
group of very determinedpersons, operating through NGOs and other
constituentsof Bank shareholderseventuallytook over the agenda - up to
having a group of EDs induce the President to contract an IndependentReview.
This happened at a time when Bank staff were making strong efforts to ensure
that the R+R objectiveswould be achieved according to the agreementsreached
in only very broad terms in 1985.

17.       Underlying this extraordinarydevelopment was the following:the
Bank had (been) moved into a situationwhere it was seen more and more as the
owner of, or at least the major force guiding, the R+R aspects of the project
(the dam/canal investments as such had the unflagging support from GOI and the
three state governments through numerous government changes). NGOs succeeded
in working directly with, and on, the Bank to take action on R+R - as if the
Bank were the owner of the project. The Bank itself fuelled this tendency in
two ways: first, when responding to NGOs, it addressed on its own the
substance of the issues raised by the NGOs rather than bringing these to the
attention of GOI for its handling (and, as appropriate, advising GOI on
technical aspects). Second, the Bank tried to engage NGOs to exert a positive
influence on GOI and the State Governmentsto improve R+R.

18.       Beyond the NGOs' looking to the Bank as their chosen instrumentfor
ensuring desired R+R results, GOI itself - in subtle ways - also turned to the
Bank for resolving the difficult R+R problem which it, or at least a part of
the Central Government, considered to be mainly in the hands of the three
state governments.

19.       As the pressures from some NGOs mounted on major Bank shareholders,
a group of EDs turned to Bank management for resolving the R+R problems of the
project rather than to the borrower, thereby heightening further the Bank's
exposure as the "main actor". Finally, Bank staff and management, in turn,
added to this tendencyby taking a very active role in pushing for
improvementsto overcome the original project deficiencies. Thus the Bank,
rather than the borrower, found itself tagged as the non-performing party.

20.       This section contains a set of recommendationsfor actions designed
to help avoiding the main failures observed in this project. The proposals
                                     8

are presented along the three priority areas identified in this note. Given
the special importanceof the last factor reviewed ("ownership'),  this is
where we begin:

     (i)     Ensuring greater ownershipby borrower/executingagencies

             (a) Bank/borrogerrelations: there is nuch room for engaging
                 the borrower more deeply in R+R, as has been done by the
                 Bank in other parts of the project (e.g., through the
                 large team of supervisoryengineering consultants as well as
                 two specializedpanels of high level experts for the dam and
                 for the canal - all engaged by GOI/state governments in
                 accordancewith their agreementswith the Bank). The
                 borrower/executing agency(ies),as a matter of course,
                 should be asked to engage consultants,financed under the
                 project, for supervisingexecution of R+R programs.
                 There should also be a preference for Bank financing of R+R
                 components, in which case supervising consultantswould
                 certify reimbursementrequests. As appropriate, i.e.,
                 depending on the complexityof the project's R+R issues,
                 specializedpanel(s) may also be requested (this is already
                 done, for instance, in the large Lesotho Highlands Water
                 Project). The objective of these requirements is to deepen
                 the borrower's ownership,but also to strengthen the Bank's
                 ability to play its "arms length" supervision role, i.e., to
                 hold the borrower/executing agencies to the commitments
                 under loan/credit agreements. (Thus, such 'arms length'
                 role still requires an activist approach by Bank staff.) At
                 the same time. the proposed approach would reduce the undue
                 load now put on Bank staff for R+R supervision.2 (Note:
                 this is much broader than an R+R issue. The above approach
                 ought to be consideredsystematicallyin other soft areas as
                 well). It is recognized that the role of consultants in
                 supervisingproject implementation   has been a controversial
                 subject in India; nevertheless,  in the light of the Narmada
                 experience,a review   of this matter may be merited.

                  The Narmada project suffered from an unusual complexity of
                  contractual arrangementsunder which the Bank had to deal
                  with GOI as the Borrower and three states as executing
                  agents. These arrangementslaid the ground for the Bank to
                  play an active, if not 'directive",role of coordinator.



     2      Since OD 4.30: InvoluntaryResettlement,needs updating in any
            case (in the light of decisions listed in Attachment 2), it should
            be reviewed against the apparent perception of some staff that the
            intent of the OD is to get the Bank directly involved in project
            implementation.

                                              to States in India (unlike
          The Bank does not lend directly         as has been the case in
          in some other countries)although,
                                          agreementshave been entered
          the Narmada project, project           limits the development of

           to have been good reasons for critical
           directly taking charge of all (and which would have received

                                           to the Independent
        the initial management response
                                          23. 1992 (reproducedas Attachment
        addressed to the Board on June             emerging from various
        2), a number of specific suggestions,    3.
        interviews, are given in Attachment
                                                                                   C

             At a more general level, our main recomeendationrelates to the
             need for setting specific guideposts(for proper M&E) at the time
             of project entry. There is a need for the borrower and the Bank
             to ensure that a cormon basis has been establishedand agreed for
             AUl relevant R+R factors so that progress can be monitored
             properly, and also that a meaningfulproject evaluation can
             eventually take place. The interest of OED in such
             guideposts is self-evidentand its role in setting appropriate
             ground rules for defining such guidepostsneeds special
             consideration.

     (iii)   Communicationsand Decision Making:

       (a)   first, the importanceof the highest professional standards,
             includingcandor, for internaland external communicationscannot
             be overstressed. This has been a,hallmarkin the Bank's
             traditionalareas of operationalactivitiesand the Bank cannot
             afford to see these standards weakened in the newer areas of the
             Bank's developmentagenda. Second, the bureaucratic tendency of
             passing the good news - mainly in the sense of (over) optimism on
             timely borrower actions - toward EDs needs greater attention.
             Realism is required, togetherwith timely action on difficult
             issues. Third, on decision-making,    a more explicit/open
             recognition of different staff views needs to be encouraged; this
             would also help maintain broader staff support of final
             decisions;

       (b)   the weakest element underlying decisionmaking in the present
             case was the inability  of the responsible  Division and Department
             management to attract  and nurture  senior professional(s)  in
             sociology/anthropology  (with  on-the-ground  R+R  management
             experience) into responsiblepositions for the handling of R+R
             aspects - this has not been achieved even over a long period.
             (This should be of special concern given the many and large Bank-
             assisted projects with R+R componentsin India). Such a
             professionalvoice is needed to carry weight, both within and
             outside of the Bank.

Final Comment

21.       At least one of the senior intervieweessuggested that the
institutionalcost incurredby the Bank in being associatedwith large
projects involving R+R may be prohibitive. This is the only major suggestion
which the writer of this note does not share. To limit the Bank's assistance
in the area of irrigation (and "clean" hydro power), would be a strong
indictment that the Bank has lost its ability to remain an effective agent in
assisting its members in critical areas of development. An effective response
to the points raised in this note is well within the capacity of the Bank.

II. POLICYBASIS FOR PROJECTS; PROJECTAPPRAISAL

6.       The IRR examinesin detailBank operational    guidelines  and procedures
as they appliedin the 1980s to the Bank'swork on the Narmada projectsl. It:'
reviews the evolution of the guidelines  up until the present. characterizing
them as setting the highest standards of any aid or lending organization      in
the world for attempting to influence Borrowers and implementation agencies      to
mitigate adverse consequences to human vell-being  causedby involuntary
resettlement.The IRR also examinesthe aspectsof the Indian Narmada         Water
Disputes Tribunal   award.dealingwith resettlement as vell as the Bank Loan
and Credit Agreements for the Narmada projects.     The IRR concludes that
despitethe existence  of explicit  operational   guidelines, the Bank failed to
insiston a properpreparation    of R&R plans by the Government    and accordingly
did not appraise adequately  the resettlement   components of the SardarSarovar
projects.
7.      Response. Bank management  acceptsthe findings of the IRR with
respectto the guidelines in forceand the failureof the preparation  and
appraisalto take these fully into account. Thesedeficiencies  were
particularlynoteworthyin areas that todayhave become important parts of the
preparationand appraisal process -- i.e. insistenceon Government
consultationwith affectedparties;development  of socio-economic data on
projectaffectedpeoples;assessment   of the Government'simplementation
capacity   for resettlement.

8.           As the IRK acknowledges,        the application      of relatively      new
operational      guidelines     in the early 1980s demanded         high quality resettlement
projectcomponents. This was not a simpletask for eitherBorrowers                           or Bank
staff.     It  required     major  improvements     in the   practices    of  many   Bank  Borrowers
as well as     a   comprehensive     change  in  approaches     and  resource   allocation    for
all Bank     units   dealing   with   such  projects.      During   this  adjustment    process.
particularly       in the first    few years after the 1980 adoption by the Bank of the
new guidelines,       there   were  a significant     number of departures        from the
guidelines,      including    in  the  Narmada   projects.

9.      These departures led management early in 1986 to undertake a thorough
reviewof the operational experience with the guidelines.As a resultof the
review,seniormanagementissuedinstructions     that potentialor known
resettlementissuesbe flaggedprior to   appraisal missiondeparture. In
addition.Bank lead advisersin centraloperating   departments were directedto
raiseany unresolved  problemswith regional  managementand, if  necessary, with
the Bank-wideLoan Comittee.

10.      RemedialAction. Taking into accountrecommendations of the IR!. and
based on the Bank's own broader experience                 management
                                          with resettlement,          has
decidedto initiateseveralorganizational                 measures-- both to

                          SUGGESTIONSFOR IMPROVEMENTOF OUALITY AT ENTRY FOR R+R

               1.   Imorove SubstantiveKnowledge through Guidelines/BestPractice
                    Dissemination:

                    *     on consultationprocesses with people affected by R+R;

                    *     on land acquisitionand related compensation;

                    *     on restoring income to at least earlier, "pre-project"levels;

                    *     on transitioncosts (which may be a multiple of eventual [annual]
                          income levels);

                    *     on relevant training for people affected;

                    *     on resettlementon marginal land (especiallyrelevant for tribal
                          people living on marginal lands).

               2.   Need for Resource Book and Training of Staff in above (and other
                    Relevant) R+R Related Subiects:

                    *     such efforts should be *dovetailed'with knowledge from NGOs;

                    e     relevance of eventual trainingmaterial (and training
                          technologies)to people affected (e.g., videos?).

               3.   Review Process:

                         review at Regional Loan Committee stage, i.e., just prior to
                         appraisal, is too late for effective handling of R+R. Need for
                         consistent review of R+R projects/components at IEPS stage,
                         includingwith ENV resettlementadvisors;

                         in projects with especially sensitiveR+R issues (as identifiedat
                         the IEPS stage), a small team of highly experienced Bank officers
                         may be assigned to review these issues with a view to putting such
                         project to the Bankwide Loan Committee for a decision as to
                         whether to go ahead with such project.
