The project's\n            poor quality at entry, combined with the shift of the\n            government's focus to undeveloped fields, caused the\n            project to gradually lose momentum and undermined the\n            achievement of its objectives. Only 6 o f the project's\n            17 activities were implemented. Some of the key lessons from\n            this evaluation are: a) the design of the project should\n            have been simpler, to include only a few high impact\n            components and substantial real time interventions by the\n            Bank in response to the borrower's needs, b) carefully\n            consider the need to include major legislative action as a\n            policy condition, based on borrower ownership and capacity ;\n            and c) the Bank should ensure that the borrower has in place\n            the necessary arrangements and commitments to ensure that\n            project implementation units (PIUs) are given adequate\n            authority (including financial authority) to deal with\n            day-to-day implementation issues."}, "docdt": "2006-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
