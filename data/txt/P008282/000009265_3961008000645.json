objectives of the Petroleum\n            Technical Assistance Project are: 1) to accelerate foreign\n            private investment and financial participation in petroleum\n            exploration and production; b) to strengthen petroleum\n            sub-sector institutions through development of petroleum\n            legislation, training, and improvements in information\n            systems; and c) to prepare investment projects in the\n            petroleum sub-sector. The project will provide: 1) provision\n            of resources to the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic\n            (SOCAR) to recruit financial, legal and technical advisors\n            for: formulation and management of a project for the\n            rehabilitation of the Guneshli field; exploration and\n            development of other fields and construction of related\n            infrastructure; legal studies on Caspian Sea boundary\n            determination; development of an oil export pipeline; and\n            petroleum licensing and exploration promotion; 2)\n            development of a legislative and fiscal framework for\n            petroleum exploration and production; 3) institutional\n            strengthening of SOCAR through training, and introduction of\n            information and communication systems; 4) detailed\n            investment and restructuring studies of the older oil\n            fields, gas processing facilities and oil export\n            infrastructure improvements; 5) technical assistance for the\n            Project Implementation Unit covering financial, procurement\n            and project management services; and 6) an unallocated\n            amount of US$1.0 million to cover additional project\n            preparation activities and advisory services."}, "docdt": "1995-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
