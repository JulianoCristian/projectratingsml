The overall performance\n            of the International Development Association (IDA) is rated\n            satisfactory: although the quality of supervision weakened\n            during 1997-99, this was fully addressed by the\n            rearrangement of task management, and supervision improved\n            markedly in the project's final year. The overall\n            performance of the Borrower can be considered satisfactory,\n            but only if allowance is made for the difficult business\n            environment within which the project was implemented. A key\n            reason for the satisfactory rating is the strong performance\n            of the State Oil Company's Project Implementation unit\n            in managing the project and in preventing difficulties in\n            implementation from causing the project's cancellation.\n            Lessons learned included the following: The difficulties\n            encountered in defining fully all priority components during\n            project preparation made the ability to alter the content of\n            project components important. Some of the key components\n            implemented were chosen as a result of detailed Energy\n            sector work, which was an indication that the consultant\n            studies were thus relatively successful. The desire to\n            incorporate the Petroleum Law component into the project\n            greatly complicated the design. The misprocurement of the\n            management information system was in part the result of\n            insufficient specialized review in IDA."}, "docdt": "2001-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
