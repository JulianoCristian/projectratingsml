The government of\n            Senegal stated that this project is a success. The\n            objectives of this project were to: (a) demonstrate an\n            affordable and acceptable alternative to conventional\n            housing solutions; (b) mobilize private savings for the\n            production of shelter; and (c) develop an institutional\n            capacity to plan and develop similar projects for other\n            urban areas. This project included the following components:\n            (i) 400 ha of sites and services including community\n            facilities in the capital of Dakar, providing 14,000 plots\n            for 140,000 people and 60 ha of serviced sites in the\n            secondary center of Thies, providing 1,200 plots for 12,000\n            people; (ii) technical assistance to assist in planning for\n            urban growth over the longer term, in preparing detailed\n            design, and in project execution; and (iii) a study to\n            determine criteria for upgrading of squatter neighborhoods\n            and funds for a pilot upgrading scheme. Delays in overall\n            project execution were due to inadequate preparation and the\n            lack of firm Government support for project objectives.\n            Delays in completing detailed design were due to in some\n            degree to disagreements over design standards. Delays in\n            procurement and construction were due to: (a) cumbersome\n            bureaucratic procedures and; (b) counterpart funding constraints."}, "docdt": "1983-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
