Enviromnental Management Plan
Enhanced HIV/AIDS Prevention Project
Background
Biomedical and healthcare waste is produced by medical or other related practices. In reality, only a
small proportion of this waste poses a higher risk than normal household or municipal waste.
According to WHO, each hospital bed in developing countries produces about 0.5 KG potentially
infectious and hazardous waste including from blood banks and pathological laboratories. Ministry of
Health developed guidelines for Hospital Waste Management in 1998. As a consequence tertiary care
hospitals have started implementing these guidelines.
An important part of preventing HIV is to ensure proper handling and safe disposal of needles, other
sharps, syringes, and blood bank waste. The proposed enhanced HIV/AIDS prevention project is not
expected to generate any additional hazardous and infectious waste. The proposed environmental plan
under the project would ensure safe handling and disposal of hazardous and infection waste already
generated.
Objectives
The proposed Enhanced HIV/AIDS prevention program plans to reduce the risk to human health and
diminish the burden on the environment by proper handling of hazardous and infection waste
generated from blood banks and community based programs for injecting drug users.
Scope of Work
The environmental management plan (EMP) would cover:
*  Community-based programs for injecting drug users at cities of Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi,
Peshawar and Quetta at drop-in centers
*  25 large teaching/tertiary care hospitals at the federal capital, provincial metropolis, and large
cities
* 102 district level hospitals which run blood bank services
Consultation Process
EMP was developed using standard EMP development methodology with technical assistance of
consultants. Stakeholders were identified and met with to identify challenges and concerns. This was
followed by selective field visits to map out the practices in-vogue for handling and disposal of waste
material. The environmental aspects of each of the practices were then listed. Annex I provides a list
of stakeholders met and facilities visited.
Mitigation measures for each of the significant aspects were then identified. The institutional
requirements for successful implementation and continued operation and improvement of the EMP
were then framed in consultation with stakeholders. The implementation schedule also addresses
issues of capacity building and training needs of related staff.
Implementation Plan
1. Plan for Safe Handllng and Disposal: The plan is for safe handling and disposal of blood bank
based sharps, syringes, and other material at teaching and district hospitals, and community based
programs for injecting drug users. The plan covers areas like; source of waste; quantity of waste
generated; and method of segregation, dis-infection, transportation and disposal. For details,
please see annex 2 and 3 respectively.

2. Training and Capacity Development Plan: Training requirements of health care workers cover
teaching and district hospital, and drop-in centers for injecting drug users. The staff to be trained
include: blood bank officers, blood bank technicians, related staff from hospital administration,
sanitation staff, and service providers of drop-in centers. The expected staff to be trained would be
around 800 persons. A curricular material would be developed using consulting services followed
by consultative process for its finalization. This activity would be completed in first quarter of
year one of the projecL Next nine months would be spent in training of provincial trainers and
training of trainees. The detailed plan is enclosed as annex 4.
3. Pbysical Inputs for Collections, Segregation and Safe Disposal. This envisages provision of
coded bags, collection containers, needle cutters, shredders, gloves, microwaves and autoclaves,
liquid bleach for dis-infection, and inputs for deep land burial. The details are enclosed as annex
5.
Institutional Arrangements
Overall coordination would be carried out by the National coordination for blood Transfusion of
services in close collaboration with national manager for HIV/AIDS. At provincial level, the Blood
Transfusion Services Coordinator of the provincial program unit would monitor the implementation
of EMP. Each hospital and drop-in center would nominate a focal person to ensure implementation of
EMP as per agreed guidelines.
The main responsibilities of the NACP Manager will be as follows:
* Financing the EMP
*  Monitor the development of procedures and training materials
* Overall monitoring and coordination
The main functions at the provincial level would be as follows:
*  Ensure timely availability of inputs
*  Implement on a pilot basis before expansion
*  Evaluating pilot
*  Prepare provincial implementation plan
*  Schedule training
*  Identify and counter barriers
*  Monitor and report progress
*  Progress monitoring and evaluation
The objective is to monitor implementation and evaluate its effectiveness. The ongoing supervision
and monitoring would be done by a focal person at each blood bank and drop-in center, provincial
Blood Transfusion Coordinator, and a consultant kept on retainer basis. A focal person at blood bank
would generate monthly progress and share it with provincial Blood Transfusion Coordinator. The
effectiveness of the EMP will be monitored through a measurement of the following parameters
before and after the conduct of the trainings and equipment supply:
*  Non-decapitated syringes in blood bank wastes
*  Non-segregated sharps in blood bank wastes
*  Awareness interviews amongst healthcare and waste disposal workers
*  Evaluation of deep burial sites
*  Utilization of personal protective equipment
