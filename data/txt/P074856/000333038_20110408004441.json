"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the HIV/AIDS Prevention\n            Project for Pakistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the firm selected to provide procurement and management\n            support not only lacked the qualifications for the job, it\n            also lacked incentives to manage effectively. In future\n            projects, Terms of Reference (TOR) should be upgraded to\n            take into account and contracts for such firms should\n            specify that payments be at least partly linked to\n            performance such as disbursements, contract signing, and\n            timely payments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n            Most of the success in Punjab could be attributed to strong\n            ownership of the provincial government that enabled\n            managerial autonomy with continuity of staff, and\n            flexibility in increasing allocations for priority\n            interventions for Internal Documents Unit (IDU). The\n            manager, financial management (FM) and procurement staff\n            continued to be the same individuals throughout the life of\n            the project. Hence, staff continuity with proper\n            administrative authority could be considered as\n            preconditions for the relevant provinces for any future\n            operation. In the meantime, NGO competencies and strong\n            NGO/CBO (community based organization) leadership was\n            another important factor for successes in Punjab. A project\n            which is first of its kind, both in subject and in\n            implementation modalities, must be designed in a flexible\n            manner taking its pilot character into consideration. There\n            should be prior agreement with the Government to make sure\n            there is sufficient flexibility in the Government's\n            planning process in terms of responding to a dynamic\n            epidemic. The project suffered from lack of proper\n            understanding of Government of Pakistan (GOP) officials\n            regarding the importance of confidentiality of the high risk\n            population groups and their HIV status. This requires\n            special advocacy and orientation activities which should\n            have been addressed in the project preparation phase."}, "docdt": "2010-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
