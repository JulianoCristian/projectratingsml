prevent a widespread HIV/AIDS epidemic, and from becoming\n            established in vulnerable populations, as well as to avoid\n            further stigmatization among vulnerable populations. The\n            main components will: 1) expand interventions among\n            vulnerable populations, by supporting HIV prevention\n            services to vulnerable groups, particularly those people\n            living in large cities. This would include behavioral change\n            through information communication, promotion of effective\n            condom use, counseling and HIV testing, and proper\n            management of sexually transmitted diseases. Small grants\n            will be made available to build capacity of nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs), and institutions working on HIV/AIDS,\n            to allow development of a track record so as to increase\n            their role in HIV prevention, and, to develop improved\n            testing, innovative approaches, and operational research; 2)\n            improve HIV prevention by the general population, which\n            comprises a behavior change communication, to be coordinated\n            between the National AIDS Control Program (NACP) and\n            provincial programs to undertake behavior changes towards\n            the use of condoms, of sterile syringes, blood donation, and\n            transfusions, and caring behaviors towards people affected\n            by the epidemic, based on targeted interventions, and\n            improved management of sexually transmitted infections\n            (STI); 3) prevent HIV/STI transmission through blood\n            transfusions, by building the capacity of provincial blood\n            transfusion authorities, implementing a quality assurance\n            system, blood screening, and, adequate waste management;\n            and, 4) strengthen federal, and provincial AIDS control\n            programs, build NGOs' capacity through technical\n            assistance and training, support second generation HIV\n            surveillance, and evaluation, and, support caring for people\n            living with AIDS."}, "docdt": "2003-05-13T00:00:00Z"}
