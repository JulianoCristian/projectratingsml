Re:  HIV-AIDS Prevention Project (DFID Grant No. TF093986-PK) 
Second Retroactive Extension of Closing Date  
 
Dear Mr. Halim: 
 
I
refer to the DFID Grant Agreement between Islamic Republic of Pakistan (the 
“Recipient”) and the International Development Association (the “Association”), acting as 
administrator of the funds provided by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland, through its Department for Foreign International Development (“DFID”) dated April 22, 
2009 for the above-referenced HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (the “Project”), as amended (the 
“DFID Grant Agreement”). I also refer to the letter dated August 5, 2010, from the National 
Program Manager for the National AIDS Control Programme and the Project requesting an 
extension of the Closing Date of the DFID Grant Agreement until March 31, 2011.  
 
I
am pleased to inform you that the Association, after due consideration, has agreed to 
retroactively extend the Closing Date in order to continue financing procurement of anti-retroviral 
drugs under disbursement category 3 (“HIV anti-retroviral medicines”), carried out by the 
National AIDS Control Programme, exclusively. To that end, the Association hereby establishes 
March 31, 2011 as the Closing Date for purposes of Section IV.B, paragraph 2, of the Schedule 2 
to the DFID Grant Agreement. Kindly note that this would be the last extension to be granted 
under the aforementioned DFID Grant Agreement 
 
Sincerely, 
 
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
