72 km\n            feeder line to the large coal mines at Pingdingshan; (b) the\n            first stage of a modernization program of the passenger\n            coach factory at Changchun, which will provide technical\n            assistance necessary to increase the quantity and improve\n            the quality of current production and determine the\n            investment needed for production of a new coach design of\n            1,500 per year; (c) assistance for new laboratories and\n            staff training at the China Academy of Railway Sciences; (d)\n            a Management Information System study to lay the basis for\n            improving the railway's managerial and operational\n            efficiency; and (e) assistance to railway universities in\n            updating their curricula."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
