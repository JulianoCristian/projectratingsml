SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:               People's Republic of China.
Beneficiary:            Ministry of Railways.
Amount:                 US$235.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                  20 years including 5 years of grace; standard variable
interest rate.
Project Description:  This will be the second Bank Group's involvement in the
railway subsector. The proposed project would make a
direct contribution to the Government's objectives of
increasing railway capacity to support economic growth
and of modernizing railways management. The project con-
sists of five components: (a) upgrading and electrifica-
tion of the line between Zhengzhou and Wuhan, a 547 km
central section of the Beijing-Guangzhou main line, and
a 72 km feeder line to the large coal mines at Pingding-
shan; (b) the first stage of a modernization program of
the passenger coach factory at Changchun, which would
provide technical assistance necessary to increase the
quantity and improve the quality of current production
and determine the investment needed for production of a
new coach design of 1,500 per year; (c) assistance to
new laboratories and staff training at the China Academy
of Railway Sciences; (d) a Management Information System
study to lay the basis for improving the railwayts man-
agerial and operational efficiency; and (e) assistance
to the railway universities in updating their curricula.
The project has no particular risk as the Ministry of
Railways has successfully completed similar projects in
the past and the demand for both freight and passenger
transport is increasing rapidly as a result of economic
reforms being implemented by the Government.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.01      Like other centrally planned economies, China's transport system
exhibits a high freight intensity, measured in ton-km per dollar of output,
and a low personal mobility in its population. This high freight intensity is
explained partly by: (a) China's economic structure, with the service sector
accounting for a very low share of GNP; (b) the historical emphasis on heavy
industry, requiring the movement of ores, steel, and other bulk products; and
(c) the high level of energy consumption per unit of output in China's indus-
try; energy use per unit of GDP is two and a half times that of other low-
income developing countries.
1.02      Traffic Trends.  Domestic freight traffic in 1983 reached 1,006 bil-
lion ton-km, almost a fourteen-fold increase since 1952, or an average annual
growth rate of almost 9%, systematically higher than the growth of domestic
product. The modal split has moved toward a more balanced use of modes, but the
railways still handle 66% of the traffic, versus 82% in 1952; this predominance
is expected to continue for quite some time. By the year 2000, domestic freight
traffic could be in the range of 3,000 billion ton-km or about three times the
1983 level.
1.03      Passenger traffic reached 310 billion passenger-km in 1983, a 12.5-
fold increase since 1952 and an average annual growth rate above 8%. Since
1978, growth has averaged 12% p.a., well above twice the overall rate of econo-
mic growth. It is likely that this growth would have been even more rapid if it
had not been constrained by the limited capacity, particularly of the railways,
to offer more passenger services. Despite the rapid growth of passenger traf-
fic in recent years, the mobility of people in China is still much lower than
in countries of comparable income levels. By the turn of the century, passenger
traffic in China may well reach about 1,500 billion passenger-km per year or
about five times current levels.
1.04      Investments.  Over the period 1953-80, some V 110 billion, or 15% of
all new investment under Central Government control, went to transport (Table
1.1). Compared to other countries, the annual investment in China's transport
sector has been somewhat low, and this has made transport a bottleneck to eco-
nomic development. For example, by 1983, 30 million tons of coal had accumu-
lated in Shanxi for lack of transport, and some of this stockpiled coal was
destroyed by spontaneous combustion. Despite a recent policy of curtailing pro-
duction to match available transport, the volume of coal stockpiled in Shanxi
increased during 1984. Rural areas are short of transport both for agriculture
and for commune and brigade enterprises. In the ports, lack of proper handling
facilities is preventing the import of bulk fertilizer, while for grain the
ship waiting time has exceeded 15 days at some ports, resulting in large demur-
rage charges. In the forthcoming decades, a much larger investment effort will
be needed in transport if bottlenecks to economic development are to be
avoided.
1.05      Port traffic has grown rapidly since 1976, reflecting the economic
opening of China to foreign trade. Annual growth has averaged over 11%. Domes-
tic coastal shipping and inland water transport also increased substantially.
As a result, ports became congested despite commendable efforts to achieve high



- 2 -
productivity. A major effort to modernize ports started in the early 1970s and
continues with particular emphasis on container and bulk terminals, the latter
mainly for coal. The Bank's first transport operation in China was the Three
Ports Project (Loan 2207-CHA, November 1982), which includes container termi-
nals at Huangpu, Shanghai and Tianjin, and a coal berth at Huangpu. A second
port project, which will provide ten additional berths at Tianjin, is now being
considered for Bank financing.
1.06      The highway network comprised 915,000 km in 1983, of which about
180,000 km are asphalt paved, about 510,000 km are gravel/sand paved, and the
remainder are earth roads. Despite impressive expansion of the network since
1949, the roads in China today are inadequate because: (a) pavement strength
and quality are poor; (b) there are many thousands of kilometers of extremely
rough macadam-surfaced roads with average daily traffic in excess of 300 vehi-
cles; (c) congestion is severe near cities due to mixed slow and fast moving
traffic; and (d) there are gaps totalling  about 4,000 km on major national
roads linking large cities and provincial capitals. The road network and road
transport in China today can therefore be characterized as underdeveloped.
Road maintenance, however, is well organized and currently absorbs much of the
attention and resources of the provincial and other road authorities. Except
for western China, the highway network is still very much a system of feeder
roads to the railways. The Bank's first highway project in China, which will
involve the construction or improvement of about 290 km of national roads and
about 1,400 km of rural roads, was negotiated in April 1985.
1.07      Transport Issues and Objectives in the 1980s.  The Sixth Five-Year
Plan, 1981-85 (SFYP) approved in December 1982, includes 1 27.5 billion (16.2%
of the total) earmarked for transport sector investments.  The railways are
scheduled to receive 63% of this amount. The plan document does not directly
mention issues in the transport sector, but a number of other recent publica-
tions gives a fairly consistent picture of some key problems. The most impor-
tant sectoral issues at this time are: (a) the capacity constraints for both
freight and passenger traffic; (b) the appropriate economic role of the various
modes and in particular the modal allocation of short-distance traffic; (c) the
management of the transport system, including policy, planning, coordination,
and pricing; (d) the modernization of technology for both infrastructure and
vehicles; (e) the conservation of energy; and (f) the training and development
of staff in all the above matters.
II. THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
2.01      Railway Facilities and Rolling Stock.  China's railway network more
than doubled in size between 1949 and 1983, from 21,800 route-km to 51,600 km.
The network now includes 9,200 route-km of double track and 2,650 route-km of
electrified track. Further double tracking and electrification works are in
progress as present line capacity is insufficient to meet traffic demands. The
rail network is served by a fleet of 10,000 locomotives, 260,000 freight cars
and 15,000 passenger coaches. At present, 75% of tractive power is still steam,
22% is diesel and 3% is electric. Rolling stock includes large numbers of older
wagons and coaches, many in poor condition and with high maintenance costs.



-3-
Traffic growth has outstripped production of new units and the fleet ia far
from adequate.
2.02      Operations.  Despite the limitations of network and rolling stock,
rail operations in China utilize traok and equipment intensively and efficient-
ly (Table 2.1). Freight traffic density averages 13.8 million net ton-k. per
route-km which is the second highest freight density in the world after the
Soviet Union, and 50% higher than freight density in the United States. China's
passenger traffic density of 3.7 million passenger-km per route-km is also the
second highest in the world, this time after India. Passenger traffic donsity
in the Soviet Union is roughly the same as in China, but in the United States
it is only 0.1 million passenger-km per route-km.  Despite this heavy traffic
density, track and other fixed installations are carefully maintained, although
the labor-intensive maintenance methods now used will become inadequate under
the heavier traffic planned for the future.
2.03      Scope for utilizing track and equipment even more efficiently is
mostly limited to lengthening trains (freight car turnaround time is already
extremely quick and it would be diffioult to improve upon the present average
of 3.3 days). The average train now has 35 cars as 75% of passing loops are
only 650 meters long. Most of the remaining 25% of loopa are 850 meters long,
which allows 50-oar trains to run in some regions. A program is under way to
extend passing loops in more regions.
2.04      Traffic.  Rail remains the major carrier in China's transport sector.
In 1983, rail freight accounted for 663.5 blllion ton-km of total domestic
freight of 1,006 billion ton-km (Table 2.2), and between 1950 and 1983 rail
freight increased more than 17 times: freight tonnage increased 12-fold to
1,161 million tons (Table 2.3) and the average haul Increased over 40% to
572 km (Table 2.4). China's freight traffic is now the third largest in the
world after the Soviet Union and the United States.
2.05      The growth in rail freight traffic between 1950 and 1983 averaged 9%
p.a. Since 1978, traffic growth has slowed to around 4.5% p.a. as traffic has
saturated existing lines and rolling stock capacity. However, the 1983 traffic
already reached the SFYP forecast for 1985. Three quarters of all freight traf-
fic involves the movement of ten important basic or intermediate commodities
(including coal, iron and steel products, grain and construction materials) and
the shortage of freight capacity has emerged as one of the key constraints to
economic growth: shortages of electric power supply capacity are estimated to
be losing China up to 20% of potential industrial output and freight capacity
to serve the power sector is an important part of this constraint.
2.06      The Government is aware of these impediments to growth and is placing
special emphasis on developing the energy and transport sectors. As part of the
Government's program to expand capacity, the Bank's first railway project in
China (Loan 2394-CHA, March 1984) is helping to provide important new rail
lines, to double track and electrify sections of existing lines, and to double
domestic production of electric locomotives to 120 per year. The Ministry of
Railways is also taking steps to increase freight car production.



2.07      Passenger traffic grow from 24 billion passenger-km in 1950 to 310
billion passenger-km in 1983 and rail is again the most important carrier. In
1983, rail accounted for 57% of total passenger travel and the railways trans-
ported 1,049 million passengers, eight times more than in 1950 (Table 2.5).
Most of the increase in rail passenger traffic occurred with the opening of the
economy and the start of system reforms between 1978 and 1983. In Just these
five years, traffic increased to 177.3 billion passenger-km at an average 10%
p.a. The growth in total passenger traffic was more than double GNP growth and
shows the high priority afforded to personal travel out of the extra income
generated by the economic reforms of the late 19703.
2.08      Although thi  growth in passenger traffic is formidable, the mobility
of people in China is still low. Annual per capita mobility in India averages
about 800 passenger-km, much more than China's average of about 300 passenger-
km, despite India's lower per capita income. Partly this low mobility is be-
cause of a shortage of transport infrastructure; on the railways there in an
acute shortage of passenger coaches. Even though trains are very crowded, many
would-be passengers are now turned away for lack Of space. And demand probably
will continue to exceed capacity for the foreseeable future: even if the 1978-
1983 income elasticity of rail travel of 1.3 subsides to unity as inoome
increases, China's coach production of 1,200 per year will satisfy only half
the demand increase that would be generated by planned economic growth of 7%
p.a. and it is unlikely that coach production can be increased quickly enough
to make good all the shortfall.
2.09      Tariffs and Costs. In common with other sectora, railway charges have
changed little since the early 19509. Freight rates were increased in late 1983
for the first time since 1967, at which time they had been reduced. Passenger
rates, though, remain at the 1967 level. The 1983 freight rate increase doubled
the minimum chargeable distanc3 to 100 km, and increased rates for 75% of
freight (including coal, cement, oil, and fertilizers) by 23%. The present
average freight haul of 572 km yields an average revenue net of sales tax of
Fen 1.68 per ton-km, 57% above average operating costs. The average passenger
journey is 169 km, and this yields a net revenue of Fen 1.78 per passenger-km,
65% above operating costs. As part of the Firat Railway Project, MR is now
carrying out a comprehensive costing study.
2.10      Although operating margins are high, the railways are an integral
part of Government and have until recently remitted all earnings to the State.
In 1983, a package of broad financial reforms was put into effect for all state
agencies and enterprises, to encourage and introduce better management and new
concepts and incentives. The railways, even though not an enterprise, are now
liable for a sales tax set at 15% of gross operating revenues and income tax at
55% of net profits. A certain share of after-tax profits has to be remitted to
the State as well. Overall, the effect of the reforms has been to substitute
tax revenues for direct profit remittance to the State. In 1983, the railways
contributed V 4.8 billion (USS 1.7 billion) to State revenues.
2.11      Orxanization. The railways employ 2.7 million people; 1.6 million are
in railway operations and 1.1 million in industry (MR operates 68 factories
producing locomotives, rolling stock, etc.), capital construction (new railway
track, bridges, electrification, workshops, housing, etc.), and in various sup-



- 5 -
port services (education for example). Central control of the railways is
vested in the Ministry Of Railways, though operations are managed by 13 region-
al administrations, seven fewer than in 1983. Each administration is headed by
a General Manager, and consists of eight departments and at least three operat-
ing subadministrations. Management is generally effective though management
techniques are somewhat out of date.
2.12      The Ministry of Railways has six design bureaus and seven construc-
tion bureaus. All these units are adequatoly staffed with skilled workers and
management (unskilled labor is recruited locally for each project). All project
designs are tailored to the labor-intensive construction methods appropriate in
China, and construction work is done to a good standard. Projects have mostly
been completed on or ahead Of schedule without cost overruns. Two of the design
bureaus are specialized. One deals with track electrification and has prepared
all China's electrification projects to date (about 2,650 km), using technology
widely used in developed countries, i.e., 25 kv-50 Hz. Another bureau special-
izes in major bridge design. Tho remaining four bureaus deal with general
design. Of the seven construction bureaus, five deal with general construction
projects and two are specialized: one in tunnel construction and one in factory
construction.
2.13      Education and Research.  Under the coordination of the Ministry of
Education, the Ministry of Railways operates 10 universities, 20 staff colleges
for in-service training, and more than 2,000 schools with 100,000 teachers and
stafr. Seven of the universities provide technical courses, two provide medical
courses and one is a teacher training college. Most of the ten now offer grad-
uate programs. For high school graduates unable to enter university, MR oper-
ates more than 60 intermediate technical schools which train locomotive drivers
and other operations staff; MR's other schools provide primary and middle edu-
cation for an enrollment now exceeding one million.
2.14      The Ministry also operates the ten research institutes which comprise
the China Academy of Railway Sciences. Mostly, the institutes are concerned
with applied research and acceptance tests on new products procured locally and
from abroad, but the institutes also provide instruction to Masters and Doctor-
ate levels. The institutes are seriously concerned about a number of railway
operating problems which they are ill-equipped to research, but which need
prompt attention because or the traffic disruption the problems are causing.
Excessive rail wear, the craoking of concrete sleepers, and design shortcominga
in some types of rolling stock are the most serious of these problems.
2.15      Budget. Accounts and Audits. The railways annual capital budget is
prepared by MR within the sectoral allocation of resources decided by the State
Planning ComMission. Some of MR's tax remittance to the State are used to
finance railway investments directly and to service debt contracted for railway
investments. But in comon with other sectors, MR's budget allocation is no
longer limited by the amount of uncomitted State resources. Following its
recent economic reforms, the State will, when necessary, now provide foreign
loan financing to sectors to sustain its desired level of investment.
2.16      An annual recurrent budget for the railways is prepared first at the
subadministration level, then at the regional administration level and is then



-6-
finalized by the Ministry. Regional capital budgets are coordinated centrally
by the Ministry's Planning and Statistics Bureau, which is responsible for all
investment planning.
2.17      Accounting procedures are based on a double-entry accrual system.
Their most unusual feature is a dual system of depreciation: a basic provision
of 3% of the cumulative historic gross value of assets, and an additional pro-
vision for major repairs of 3.5%. Some part of the extra provision would nor-
mally be charged to working expenses and the current practice probably under-
states MR's net asset base and overstates its earning position. A review of the
dual system of depreciation is part of the overall review of MR's accounting
plan being conducted under the First Project's costing study (para. 2.09).
2.18      The Ministry of Railways has a "Financial Checking Division" that
performs internal auditing and checks the correlation of revenue and expend-
iture with planned allocations.  The People's Bank of China is MR's paying and
collecting agent. It keeps a close record of budgetary allocations including
their subsequent adjustments; its inspectors regularly check the use of funds
by MR. The People's Construction Bank of China fulfills a similar role for
investment funds. Ext.ernal auditing will in the future be undertaken by the
newly-established State Audit Agency (SAA) which has the status of a Ministry
and reports directly to the State Council. The SAA is progressively taking over
responsibility for auditing all Government departments and State-owned enter-
prises.
2.19      Investments and Planning. China's railways investments fluctuated
considerably throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s because MR's budget alloca-
tions were tied closely to total State revenues, which in turn varied with
China's rate of economic development. More recently, recognition of the impor-
tant role of the railways in the development process has fostered a long-term
view of the need to develop railway capacity and budget allocations are now
less arbitrary. The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-1985) aims to increase coal
carrying capacity from western provinces to China's east coast, to relieve
constraints on lines on the eastern seaboard and to develop passenger transport
in the most populous provinces. Accordingly, after falling to 1 1.5 billion in
1981 during the period of budgetary stringency, rail investments were increased
to I 3.7 billion in 1982 and to X 4.2 billion in 1983, over half the total
investment in transport of 1 7.2 billion, but still far short of the level
which would be needed to alleviate bottlenecks.
2.20      Within the Ministry of Railways, investment planning is the respon-
sibility of the Planning and Statistics Bureau.  Proposals for expansion, new
production capacity and new technology are developed by the Ministry. Total
investment amounts are determined by the State Planning Commission. New techno-
logies, system expansion, imports versus increased production and total invest-
ment levels and financial options are all key issues to the sound future devel-
opment of China's railways.
2.21      Government Objectives and Bank Goals.  The Sixth Five-Year Plan
(1981-1985) allocated 1 72.5 billion, 16.2S of total investments, to the trans-
port sector. Of this, 1 17.3 billion was for investment in railways. These
resources have facilitated considerable development of the rail network, but



-7-
not enough to keep pace with China's rapid eccnomic growth. The present satura-
tion of the rail network and the constraints this imposes on further economic
growth have brought into sharp focus the important role transport plays in the
development of all main sectors. If China is to achieve its goal of quadrupling
the gross value of industrial and agricultural output (GVIAO) by the year 2000,
the railways expansion and modernization must be accelerated so that limited
capacity does not hold back economic growth. The resources needed for an ade-
quate level of investment are now much larger than could be provided by China's
previous practice of funding all investments from within the sector. Some
further expansion of investment financing through loans, both domestic and
foreign, is desirable for the higher economic growth it would facilitate.
2.22,    The Bank Group's strategy for the sub-sector is to support the
Government in increasing the capacity and improving operations and efficiency
of its railways, and in further developing MR's technical and management capa-
bilities. The first part of the atrategy then is to be responsive to the mate-
rial needs of China's railway system as they arise; the second part is to help
better equip the subsector with the expertise it needs to meet the increasing
and more complex demands being planed upon it. Thus, the strategy is a balance
between helping to provide sufficient transport capacity to match economic
growth and to improve MR's ability to manage future developments of the railway
system.
2.23      Through this and subsequent projects, the Bank hopes to work with MR
in almost every aspect of railways planning and operations. The Bank will con-
centrate its efforts in the following five areas where it can have most effect:
(a) capacity and suitability of infrastructure and equipment;
Cb)  manufacture and maintenance of infrastructure and equipment;
(c) financial management;
(d) management structure; and
Ce) technology transfer and education.
III. THE PROJECT
A.  ProJect Origin znd Objectives
3.01      In December 1983, the Government requested Bank assistance in financ-
ing urgently needed investments to increase MR's transport and p Kduction capa-
city. The proposed project was p-epared by the Government and was appraised in
October/November 1984. The projeet would make a direct contribution to the
Government's objective of increasing railway capacity to support economic
growth. The project would increase railway line capacity in central China on
the important route between Zhengzhou and Wuhan and increase the product_on of
passenger coaches. In addition, the project would strengthen applied research,



-8-
continue the modernization of Mi's management techniques, and advise on
improvements in university curricula.
B. Project Description
3.02      The project comprises the following five components:
(a) additional line capacity on the 547 km Zhengzhou-Wuhan section of
the Beijing-Guangzhou line, one of the most important transport
arteries in China;
(b) improvements in production technology and increases in coach produc-
tion at the Changchun Passenger Coach factory;
(c) assistance in development of the China Academy of Railway Sciences
with new laboratories for materials and equipment testing;
(d) a Management Information System Study in a selected area of MR; and
Ce) technical assistance to MR's universities to strengthen curricula
and meet MR's changing technology and management needs.
The five subsections which follow give a brief summary of each of the
project components.
3.03      Zhengzhou-Wuhan Upgrading and Electrification. This section is in the
central part of the Beijing-Guangzhou main railway artery, which has the second
highest traffic density in China. This section has already reached its maximum
practical capacity (about 37 million tons p.a. in the north-south direction)
and is now a severe bottleneck for transporting both freight and passengers.
Three alternatives were considered for increasing the capacity of this section:
to build a new line in the mountainous region between Xinyang and Guangshui; to
use foreign diesel locomotives, instead of the present 50/50 mix of steam and
domestic diesel locomotives; or to electrify the line (para. 4.06).
3.04      Electrification was found to be the least cost solution and accords
with MR's long-term development plan to electrify all lines carrying very heavy
traffic.  Adequate electric locomotives to serve the line would be produced by
the Zhuzhou factory, supported in part by the Bank's First Railway Project.
This component of the Second Project would include:
(a) track lengthening (from 850 to 1,050 m) at 59 stations and increase
of the loading gauge at 18 bridges on the Zhengzhou-Wuhan section;
(b)  electrification of the 547 km double track section and of the 72 km
single track feeder line from Pingdingshan (the site of a major coal
mine now being expanded) to Mengmiao, on the Zhengzhou-Wuhan section;
(c) expansion of three marshalling yards along the Zhengzhou-Wuhan
section;



- 9 -
(d) provision of construction and maintenance equipment for the overhead
catenary system; and
(e) technical assistance and training in design and construction of
electrified railway lines.
3.05      Changchun Passenger Coach Factory (CPCF).  The Ministry of Railways
has four coach factories, which together produce about 1,200 coaches p.a. The
largest is CPCF, which was established in 1950 to produce 1,000 passenger
coaches p.a., but has never been able to produce more than 700 because of a
combination of various technical and managerial shortcomings. Bank assistance
was requested by MR for developing a program to correct these deficiencies and
eventually to increase production capacity to 1,500 coaches per year. The Min-
istry of Railways also would like the program to improve the quality of the
coaches produced to make them more durable, so that major overhauls could be
spaced at 12 to 15 year intervals instead of the six-year interval for the cur-
rent model. The Changchun factory produces the most common passenger coach used
in China. It is a basic design with a compact hard seat arrangement and is
equivalent to a third class coach in other countries.
3.06      The activities supported by the project cover the first stage of a
two-stage program to modernize CPCF. The objectives of this first stage are:
(a) technical assistance to CPCF, to increase current production and
improve coach quality;
Cb) training of CPCF personnel in modern technical and management
practices;
(c) preparation of a feasibility study on the expansion of production;
Cd) development of a new coach design adapted to Chinese conditions; and
Ce) provision of welding and surface treatment equipment and production
machines.
The factory would be expanded under the second stage of the program,
possibly supported by a subsequent project.
3.'0      The Ministry of Railways has selected a suitable partner (British
Rail Engineering Ltd., U.K.) who would help in the design of a new generation
coach, plan the work needed to expand production facilities, determine which
equipment to purchase, and assist CPCF from production start-up to achievement
of full output. The selection of this technical assistance was carried out in
accordance with Bank guidelines under terms of reference agreed with the Bank.
3.08      China Academy of Railway Sciences.  The Academy is the main railway
research center in China and the prime quality control body within MR, for both
domestic and imported equipment and materials. It is fairly well equipped for
meeting basic research needs and employs 3,665 people, 2,046 of whom are tech-



- 10 -
nicians covering a wide range of specialties. In 1978, the Academy started a
university level education program with eight specialties leading to the Bach-
elor's degree level and two to the Ph.D. level. To date, 58 students have
obtained Bachelor's degrees; 102 students are currently enrolled.
3.09      Two new laboratories are needed to test rolling stock and track com-
ponents. The Association of American Railroads assisted MR to select the basic
co-cept of the laboratories, but the Academy needs further assistance to final-
ize the design, prepare tender documents for ICB, carry out procurement and set
up the facilities. Selection of a suitable consultant is under way, in accord-
ance with Bank guidelines, and with terms of reference agreed with the Bank.
This component will include:
(a) consultants services, as defined above;
(b) provision of equipment and instruments to equip the laboratories; and
(c) training of Academy staff in fields related to the laboratories.
3.10      Management Information System Study.  To act efficiently, managers at
all levels must be provided with adequate and timely information. At present,
not all MR managers have access to the information they need; others are pre-
sented with too much, which obscures what they need to know. To better tailor
information to the needs of managers throughout the railways and the related
factories, a Management Information System Study is proposed which would do
four things:
(a) record present information flows to each level of management;
(b) determine for each level of management what is the minimum of
essential information;
Cc) recommend both improvements to present information flows and
ways of speeding up the flows; and
(d) assist MR and the factories to implement the improvements, including
the provision of computer hardware and software.
3.11      In addition to streamlining and accelerating flows of information,
the study will provide an opportunity to review MR's managerial functions and
to amend them where appropriate. The ultimate objective of the study is to help
improve the overall management and operations efficiency of the railways and
related factories.
3.12      The study's ambitious objectives will take several years to research
and implement and therefore probably will be spread over several Bank projects.
The study team will be formed by the end of 1985. A description of the scove of
the study and of the phases to be carried out during this project is given in
Annex 1. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, commencing by
January 31, 1986, the study will be carried out in accordance with TORs agreed
with the Bank and, upon completion of each phase, MR shall furnish to the Bank
a copy of the report for review and comment.

3-13      Education.  China's rapid economic growth has led to a shortage of
high level manpower throughout the economy. In the railway subsector, the
shortage of manpower is particularly acute. High traffic growth has been accom-
panied by further improvements in technology as more lines are converted to
electric traction. China urgently needs the new capacity that will be provided
through electrification and MR needs to have the managerial and technical capa-
bilities to accelerate capacity expansion if the railways are not to impede
economic growth. This will mean maintaining peak management efficiency whilst
strengthening MR's ability to take full advantage of the contribution which
technology can make in MR's growing investment program.
3.14      While HR's skilled manpower will increasingly be provided from
China's wider university system, MR's universities will continue for many years
to supply the majority of MR's new high level staff. There is therefore a need
to improve and strengthen curricula at MR's universities in areas where new
technology, through complementing traditional work practices, could facilitate
investment planning and help further improve the efficiency of railway opera-
tions. This is a particularly opportune moment to explore the universities'
needs, since there are potential overlaps and complementarities between their
work and that of the Academy. For this purpose, the project would include an
international panel of six specialists (Annex 2) to assist MR in reviewing and
strengthening curricula of MR's universities. The panel would have three tasks:
(a) to compare the numbers of graduates and their mix of skills with the
subsector's likely future needs;
(b) to determine areas of MR's planning and operations where new
technology is most relevant; and
(c) in light of these, to review and recommend university curricula
improvements to provide MR with better qualified high level manpower
in areas of new technology, economics, finance, management, and
planning.
3.15      Training and Technical Assistance.  In conjunction with each of the
five project components, an extensive training program (Annex 3) has been set
up under which Chinese railway staff will study and gain practical experience
abroad (about 810 man-months) and foreign trainers would spend about 117 man-
months in China, mostly giving instruction in new technologies and modern
management practices. In addition, technical assistance will be provided to the
Changchun Passenger Coach Factory and to the Academy of Railway Sciences
(paras. 3.06 and 3.09). The total cost of the combined program is about US$7.0
million or 3% of the proposed loan. Technical assistance will be contracted
according to Bank guidelines. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that the training will be carried out in accordance with the agreed program.

C. Cost Estimates and Financing
3.16      Detailed designs are completed for all project works. Quantities were
derived from final engineering, and unit prices are based on current world mar-
ket prices for equipment to be imported. The cost of equipment and materials to
be procured locally and not to be financed by the Bank was estimated on the
basis of current domestic prices, but shadow pricing was used for the economic
analysis. The estimated project cost, expressed in April 1985 prices and
including training and contingencies is about US$569.1 million, of which
US$248.0 million represents direct and indirect foreign exchange costs. Cost
estimates are given in Tables 3.1 to 3.14. The Government has requested a loan
of US$235.0 million which would cover about 95% of the estimated foreign ex-
change cost. It will finance other materials, equipment and construction costs
from its own resources.
3.17      An average of 6% physical contingencies is included for all project
costs. For the calculation of price contingencies, it is assumed that exchange
rate adjustments will, on average, be made to maintain "purchasing power pari-
ty" durirg the project implementation period.  On this basis, price escalation
for both foreign and local costs: (a) when expressed in US dollars, is based on
expected international inflation rates of 5% in 1985, 7.5% in 1986, 8% in 1987
to 1990, and 5% in 1991; (b) when expressed in Yuan, is based on expected
domestic inflation of 3% p.a. in 1985-1991. Price contingencies thus represent
25.4% of base cost estimates plus physical contingencies expressed in US
dollars, and 10% of the same total expressed in Yuan.
3.18      The proposed Bank loan would finance:
(a) for the Zhengzhou-Wuhan line electrification: rails, other slteel
products, timber and cement, transformers, copper wire, insulators,
power and signalling cables, design and construction equipment, and
technical assistance and training;
(b) for the Changchun Passenger Coach Factory: on-site technical assist-
ance and training by the foreign partner and training of factory pro-
duction and management staff abroad; the foreign cost involved in the
development of a new coach design and its engineering; the production
of three prototypes and the transfer of know-how for the new coach;
the preparation of a feasibility study on the expansion of production
facilities to 1,500 coaches per year; some basic items such as weld-
ing and surface treatment equipment; and a limited number of machines
tools, urgently needed by the factory independently of the new design
chosen;
(c) for the China Academy of Railway Sciences: the foreign exchange cost
of the technical assistance program; equipment and instruments to
equip the new laboratories; and the training of staff in fields
related to the work to be performed in the new laboratories; and
(d) for the Management Information System Study: the foreign exchange
cost of study tours; technical assistance; and computer hardware and
software to implement the new MIS.

A list of items to be financed by the proposed loan is given in
Table 3.15. A summary of the project costs (in April 1985 prices) and of the
proposed loan is shown on page 13.
D. Project Implementation
3.19      Upgrading and electrification of the Zhengzhou-Wuhan line will be
carried out by the railways' own forces. This is common practice with work on
lines with heavy traffic. The Ministry of Railways is well equipped and has
experience in this type of work (para. 2.12). In this case, the Fourth Design
and Construction Bureau will be responsible for track, station and yard upgrad-
ing and the Electrification and Automation Bureau for installing electrifica-
tion equipment. Implementation of the other components of the project will be
carried out by MR with the help of competent consultants (para. 3.15). The
expected implementation schedule is shown in Tables 3.16 to 3.18. The project
is expected to be completed by December 31, 1991, and the Closing Date of the
proposed loan would then be June 30, 1992.

3.Z0       Procurement of materials and equipment for electrification works and
of equipment for the Changchun Passenger Coach Factory and the China Academy of
Railway Sciences will be subject to international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines for procurement, except for a number of small
items worth less than US$100,000 per order and totalling less than US$2.0 mil-
lion, which would be purchased on the basis of quotations received from three
potential suppliers. All packages for equipment above US$100,000 (about 95% of
the total amount) will be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation. In bid evaluation, Chinese manufacturers will be allowed a pre-
ferential margin of 15% of the CIF cost of competing imports, or the relevant
prevailing level of customs duties, whichever is lower.
3.21      For items not financed by the Bank, Government procurement proce-
dures will apply. Such items comprise civil works, various local materials, and
miscellaneous equipment. The civil works involved in this project are not suit-
able for ICB. They include a large number of small concrete foundations for the
catenary masts all along the line to be electrified, and clearance adjustments
on 18 bridges; these works have to be carried out under heavy traffic. Other
civil works include lengthening 59 crossing loops by 200 m each, and adding
more tracks in three marshalling yards. Delivery of major materials such as
rails, other steel and cement is independently arranged by the owner and sup-
plied to the construction bureaus. In this case, such materials are to be
procured through ICB and financed by the Bank loan.
F. Disbursement
3.22      Disbursement of the proposed loan would be as follows:
(a) 100% foreign expenditures of the CIF cost of imported equipment and
materials;
(b) 100% local expenditures of the ex-factory cost of locally manufac-
tured equipment and materials;
(c) 100% of the cost of technical assistance and overseas training.
3-23      Domestic transport from port or factory would not be eligible for
Bank financing. Any savings under the loan would be cancelled unless otherwise
agreed with the Bank. Disbursements against training and contracts for goods
and services valued at less than US$50,000 each would be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). To facilitate disbursements for these items,
a revolving fund will be established with an initial deposit of US$500,000,
equivalent to about four months of expected expenditures. Documentation sup-
porting the SOEs will not be submitted to the Bank but will be kept in the
project office in Beijing and made available for review by the Bank's super-
vision missions.
3.24      An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 3.19, where
a comparison is made with the Bank-wide profile for railway projects. Disburse-
ments are expected to start slightly slower but proceed slightly faster than
the standard profile. The schedule is based on the assumption that the proposed
loan would become effective by September 1985.

G. Environment
3.25      No negative impact on the environment is anticipated from the pro-
ject. The electrification of the 619 km section between Zhengzhou, Wuhan and
Pingdingshan (presently steam and diesel operated) will significantly reduce
pollution in the area.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits
4.01      This project would make a direct contribution to the Government's
overall plan for providing the increased rail transport capacity that is essen-
tial for sustained economic development. In particular, the project would
increase the railway system's ability to move coal from the rich fields of
Shanxi and Henan provinces to the major consuming points that lie to the south
along the Beijing-Guangzhou line, thereby easing the serious energy shortages
in that region. Regional trade in grain and other essential commodities would
be facilitated as well. The project would also contribute to the improvement
and expansion of railway passenger coach production, which is urgently needed
to meet the growing demand for passenger travel throughout the country. In
addition, the project would directly address several important areas of human
capital formation, i.e., in applied research, technical education, and manage-
rial methods. Project benefits would thus be well spread throughout the eco-
nomy.
4.02      For this analysis, all inputs and outputs were evaluated in constant
mid-1984 economic prices. As far as practicable, taxes were excluded from
financial prices. In principle, import duties were also excluded, though in
practice this was an unimportant issue, since virtually all of the imported
materials and equipment to be used in the project will enter the country duty
free. For traddd goods, CIF prices of imports and FOB prices of exports were
used in estimating the cost of materials and equipment, with due adjustment for
the cost of inland transportation. The official exchange rate wae used to con-
vert foreign currency figures to Renminbi. A conversion factor of 0.5 was ap-
plied for unskilled labor costs, while the shadow wage rate was calculated at
four times the actual wage for highly qualified supervisory staff.
B. Zhengzhou-Wuhan Track Upgrading and Electrification
4.03      Current traffic capacity through the mountainous bottleneck section
of the project line, after allowance for the existing level of passenger traf-
fic, is about 37 million tons p.a. in the heavy (southbound) direction, while
actual traffic had already reached about 36.4 million net tons in 1983 (Table
4.1). When the bottleneck is removed, southbound traffic is expected to reach
55 million tons by about 1996, decline somewhat until the turn of the century
due to the planned completion of a parallel line to Jiujiang on the Yangtse



- 17 -
River, and then resume strong growth (for detailed projections, see Table 4.2).
Among the coal mines that will benefit from thir expanded capacity is the clus-
ter of mines in the area around Pingdingshan in Henan province, which already
ship about 11 million tons p.a. over the feeder line to Mengmiao, and which are
currently undergoing a major expansion and modernization.  Coal transported by
rail is typically of high calorific content and it is more economical to trans-
port it to consumption centers than to use it at mine-mouth power stations. In
addition to increasing rail capacity to move coal, the Government has a large
program to build mine-mouth power plants wherever economically justified.
4.04      The benefits are in terms of value added for the diverse commodities
that will be shipped on the line when capacity is increased. They are measured
as value added per ton of coal since coal accounts for about two-thirds of the
southbound traffic on the line. Equal benefits are assigned to non-coal ton-
nage, on the grounds that such traffic would not be allowed to displace coal if
it were not of equal economic value. Each ton of coal (a traded good) is pro-
jected to be worth about US$44 FOB Chinese port in 1991, rising to US$47/ton in
1995 and constant thereafter (all in constant 1984 US dollars). For further
details, including a check on the validity of using the value added for coal as
a proxy for other commodities, see Annex 4. The combined production, transport
and handling costs within China are estimated at US$17 per ton. Thus, the net
value added per ton is about US$27 in 1991, rising to US$30 in 1995 and cons-
tant thereafter.
4.05      Apart from the cost of the project itself, the cost streams also
include the necessary complementary investments in coal mines and other enter-
prises, electrical power supply, and locomotives and rolling stock. The econo-
mic rate of return (ERR) of this entire set of investments, which include the
proposed project, is 24% with a 25-year period for benefits (Table 4.3).  Some
of these investments have a life expectancy well beyond 25 years, but benefits
beyond the 25th year increase the rate of return only marginally. Details can
be found in Annex 4.
4.06      Several alternatives to electrification were carefully considered but
rejected because they would be more costly. Two realignments through the moun-
tainous section were studied by MR, but bowh were found to be more expensive
than upgrading and electrifying the corresponding section of the existing
route. Upgrading of the single-track Pingdingshan feeder line to the standards
necessary to carry the projected future coal traffic, which would amount to
virtually double tracking, was again found to be more costly than electrifying
it. For the remainder of the main line, the argument for electrification hinges
not so much on capacity problems as on relative costs of operation. Electric
locomotives are cheaper to run than either the current fleet (a mixture of
steam and domestic diesel units) oi the more powerful American diesels that are
now being imported. Adequate electric power supply is assured in this region,
either from existing power plants or from additional plants now under con-
struction (map IBRD 18674). At the traffic levels that will be involved by 1992
(about 80 billion converted gross ton-km, both directions combined) the sav-
ings obtained on locomotive maintenance and fuel costs alone already indicate
that electrification is economically fully justified (Annex 4 and Table 4.4).

C. Changchun Passenger Coach Factory
4.07      China urgently needs more passenger coaches.  Even though trains are
very crowded, many would-be travellers are turned away for lack or space. The
evidence from other developing countries and from China's own experience in
recent years strongly suggests that demand for passenger travel will continue
to grow rapidly in the years to come.
4.08      China's four coach factories, taken together, produce about 1,200
coaches per year. The factory at Changchun, which currently produces about 700
coaches per year, is the most promising candidate for upgrading and expansion.
The project will help the factory to increase both the quality and quantity of
coaches produced, in the first phase of a two-phase process. The primary justi-
fication of the first phase is that it prepares the way for the second, which
is when most of the production increase will take place. However, it is expect-
ed that during the first phase there will already be some improvement in the
quality and number of coaches produced. Thus benefits for both phases are of
two types: the value of the extra passenger travel made ponsible by a larger
fleet of coaches, and the savings on maintenance, fuel, and other costs that
better quality coaches willl provide.
4.09      As shown in Table 4.5, the economic rate of return of the first phase
at Changchun is 47%. This high rate of return reflects two factors: the size of
the unmet demand for passenger travel, and the generic advantage of small,
high-priority itvestments in an existing factory. A more detailed discussion
of the costs and uenefits of the Changohun project is shown in Annex 5.
D. China AcademY of Railway Sciences and
Beifang Communieations University
41.10     The two new laboratories to be built at the China Academy of Railway
Sciences will engage in applied research on urgent problems related especially
to questions of wear and tear on vehicles and track. The results of such re-
search are inherently unpredictable, which means that conventional cost-benefit
analysis is not easily applied to such an investment. At the same time, how-
ever, it is reasonably clear that successful research on these issues could
yield a good economic return in the form of cost savings on maintenance and
repairs. Like the Bank's assistance to the Academy, assistance to the railway
universities is difficult to evaluate with the tools of conventional cost-
benefit analysis, but could yield a large pay-off.
E. Overall Evaluation and Risks
4.11      Overall economic evaluation shows that implementation of all project
components is well justified and should proceed without delay. The overall ERR
including the costs of the research and training components is estimated at
25%. The electrification works involve proven technology that is already in
wide use in China and elsewhere in the world: technological risks are therefore
small. Similarly, the project at Changchun carries little risk, since the
foreign partner will be an established builder. In addition, MR has successful-
ly completed similar projects for a number of years; risks from inadequate pro-
ject implementation and operation are therefore negligible. The constraint



- 19 -
placed on China's development by tight energy supplies insures that the Govern-
ment will continue to focus on coal transport, just as the recent reforms in
agriculture guarantee that transport of agricultural products will continue to
be vital to the economy. Passenger travel also has an important and construc-
tive role to play as the economy grows. Thus the risk is very low that the
benefits of the project would fall substantially short of projections. The
sensitivity analysis for i;he largest project component is shown in Annex 4.
FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. The Railway
Recent Financial Performance
5.01      The operations of the Ministry of Railways (MR) have bec.a highly
profitable, as can be seen from Table 5.1. The following ratios reflect the
system's actual 1982 and 1983 and estimated 1984 financial results.

Financial Arrangements
5.02      Until recently, most of the net earnings of MR were remitted to the
State and formed part of general State revenues. Retentions were permitted for
only a small number of clearly defined purposes. Capital investment and working
capital were financed exclusively from the State budget. Investment levels were
not related to net revenues earned by MR. Investment priorities were determined
nationally by the State Planning Commission, and were made with reference to
national and plan needs, not with reference to MR's greater financial capa-
bilities.



- 20 -
Possible Future Performance. 1985-1995
5.03      Recently, China has introduceG budget loans for capital investment
projects, and pronouncements by Chinese leaders suggest that these will play an
increasingly important role in the funding of national investment programs,
including that of MR. At the same time, more autonomy is gradually being dele-
gated from the State Planning Commission to ministries and enterprises for the
development of their own investment plans and priorities and the management of
their own finances. For the railway, it is possible -- though by no means
certain - that in the pursuit of such reforms, the Government will consider
adopting a different form of organization for the operational part of MR which
would emphasize its self-accounting character and would convey a somewhat
greater degree of autonomy to its management.
5.04      Even if this does not happen in the near future, it is appropriate
that MR should increasingly focus on questions such as the scale and pace of
its expansion program, the appropriate mix of local and foreign loans and bud-
get contributions to finance this expansion, and the relationship between its
tariffs and the growth of traffic, investment, tax and other dues to the State,
ano debt service. Until these basic policy questions have been resolved, it is
not meaningful to attempt to quantify MR's %uture financial performance.
However, the prudence with which its affairs have been conducted in the past
encourages confidence that its future policies will be soundly based.
5.05      Under the First Railway Project (Loan 2394-CHA, March 19i84), a
dialogue on railway finances was initiated between MR and the Bank. Up to the
present, this has productively emphasized current financial performance, new
financial concepts, and links to planning of each year's operations and
improved management systems. These are areas where the Bank's substantial
international experience and methodologies of planning and analysis can be
particularly useful to the Ministry, but they are sensitive areas in which the
Bzank should not expect to move quickly. The focus of our dialogue should
gradually be broadened to include development of an investment program, its
financing, and the implications for the railways financial situation; but
progress can be expected only gradually and only to the extent that the Bank
can be seen to be offering useful and practical advice in the Chinese context.
Therefore, no specific financial performance requirement or investment plan
reviews have been included in this project.
B. Zhengzhou-Wuhan Upgrading and Electrificat5on
5.06      The financial implications of this project component have been
assessed by: (a) comparing project operating costs and revenues in 1991, the
first year when diesel traction will fully replace steam traction in the "with-
out project" case or when electric traction will fully replace the present mix
of steam and diesel traction in the "with proJect" case; and (b) analyzing line
operating costs and revenues in 1995.



- 21 -
MethodologY
5.07      Without project, cost calculations are based on actual 1983 statis-
tical and accounting data of the Zhengzhou (Table 5.2) and Wuhan (Table 5.3)
subadministrations, allocated to the project line (Tables 5.4 to 5. ). Detailed
calculations are available in the Project File. These data were then updated to
match 1991 traffic proJections (Tables 5.7 and 5.8). With the project, cost
estimates (Table 5.8) reflect the assumptions on numbers of locomotives,
coaches and freight cars listed in paragraph 2 (b) of Annex 4 and project costs
given in Table 3.13. All cost calculations have been quoted in constant 1983
terms, taking into consideration a 3% p.a. real increase in salaries, energy
and service cost items. Sales revenues were calculated using end-1983 tariffs.
5.08      The 1995 costs were calculated using the same cost assumptions
(Table 5.09). Sales revenue calculations were based on end-1983 tariffs
increased by 10% or about one-third of the annual increase in real terms cumu-
lated over 1984-95.

5.09      The table on page 21 summarizes projected gross operating revenues
and costs of the line in 1991 with and without the project, and in 1995 with
the project. The 1991 traffic in the "without project" case represents the full
capacity of the existing line if only imported diesel locomotives are used,
instead of the present 50/50 mix of steam and domestic diesels. With the pro-
ject, 1991 traffic would already be over a third higher. Operating revenues
would be greater than possible without the project, under the double effect of
lower traffic unit operating costs and higher traffic, although the capacity of
the electrified line would only be used at about 65%. By 1995 when that capa-
city would be more fully utilized, the operating ratio would also improve.
C. Changchun Passenger Coach Factory
Present Financial Performance
5.10      In 1983, the factory produced 700 hard seat YZ-22 coaches and the
last four of a series of 50 subway coaches, and overhauled 281 coaches. This
turnover generated a net operating revenue of T 12.9 million on sales revenues
of 1 92 million after deduction of the 5% sales tax (Table 5.10). The working
ratio was 83%, the operating ratio 87% and the rate of return a comfortable
18%. This performance could have been even better if the factory had been free
to set higher sales prices, taking advantage of its situation of quasi-monopoly
in a high demand environment.
Future Financial Performance
5.11      The factory plans to discontinue producing YZ-22 coaches in 1986 in
favor of an interim model, the CCK-33, which will be produced through 1989 when
it will be replaced by the new generation coach. Based on very preliminary cost
estimates, which should be considered as indicative only, these two coaches
could be produced at respective unit costs of 1 156,000 'Table 5.11) and
x 162,000 (Table 5.12). These costs are about half international prices for the
same type of cars.
5.12      Based on the above estimates of future unit costs and on unit sales
prices of 1 187,000 for the CCK-33 and 1 200,000 for the new generation coach,
the factory prepared tentative projected income statements according to which
it would generate a 42% rate of return on average net fixed assets in use in
1991. Details of these projections are in the Project File. Since the assumed
sales prices reflect the same profit margin as for the existing YZ-22, the high
rate of return shows that the profit prospects of the factory are very good.
D. China Academy of Railway Sciences
5.13      Until 1980, the Academy operated as a full-fledged department of MR.
Its funding consisted of annual budgetary allocations covering operating and
capital expenditures. Since 1980, the Academy operates under a dual system
whereby budgetary financing is supplemented by contracts entered into with
other State agencies or enterprises. These contracts are financed from "cus-
tomers" resources. Budgetary operating allocations will progressively be phased



- 23 -
out. According to present plans and starting in 1987, the Academy will finance
all its working expenses from contracts, but MR will continue to give the Aca-
demy budgetary allocations to finance major repairs, renewals and investment
costs or the related debt service.
E. Audits
5.14      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that project accounts
and the financial statements of (a) the Zhengzhou and Wuhan railway subadmin-
istrations; and (b) the Changchun Passenger Coach Factory, will be audited in
accordance with sound accounting practices by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank, and that audit reports would be sent to the Bank for review not
later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The Bank currently
eccepts SAA (para. 2.18) audits for this purpose.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a) the Ministry of Railways will commence the Management Information
System Study not later than January 31, 1986, under terms of refer-
ence agreed with the Bank (para. 3.12);
(b) training will be carried out in accordance with the program agreed
with the Bank (para. 3.15); and
(c) the project accounts and the financial statements of (i) the Zheng-
zhou and Wuhan railway subadministrations; and (ii) the Changchun
Passenger Coach Factory will be audited in accordance with sound
accounting practices by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,
and audit reports will be sent to the Bank for review not later than
six months after the end of each fiscal year (para. 5.14).
6.02      Subject to the above assurances, the proposed project would be suit-
able for a Bank loan of US$235.0 million to the People's Republic of China. The
loan would be for a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period, at the
standard variable rate.

CHINA
SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Pro osed Study of a Management Infbrmation System
of the Chinese Railways and Related Industries
Approach.
1.        China's railways are well organized, and efficiently operated.
Because of the rapidly increasing demands on the railways, the Ministry of
Railways (MR) considers it necessary to update its management practices by
taking advantage of new tecbnology to further improve the efficiency of its
operations. To do this, MR will undertake a Management Information System
Study. The Study's recommendations would be implemented in the pilot area and
in one of its factories and the results monitored. From this experience MR
would then decide how to extend the results of the study to other units of its
operations. This approach will assist MR:
Ca) to etablish a nucleus of MR officiala well trained in modern manage-
ment information practices and with experience of implementing these
practices in MR;
(b) to develop new practices tailored to the different information needs
of different units of MR;
(c) to improve the new pratices during implementation to include further
improvements; and
(d) to demonstrate the new system to facilate thorough training of
railway managerial staff.
Content of MIS Study
2.        For the area of railway operations selected for this pilot study and
for the factory selected, the MIS Study would do four things:
(a) record present information flows to each level of management;
(b) determine for each level of management what is the minimum of
essential information;
(c) recommend improvements to present information flows and ways of
speeding up the flows; and
(d) implement the improvements including the provision of computer

These four tasks will lead to preliminary definition of a new MIS for the HR.
Part (a) of the study will describe the existing information system; part tb)
will identify the information flows to best meet managers' needs; and part tc)
will examine how to redirect and tailor the information flows and how to speed
them up. Part (d) will provide a trial implementation and evaluation of the new
system.
Study Organization
3.        Overall responsibility for implementation and control of the Study
would be vested in a Leading Group (LG) composed of senior M1R officials. The LG
would direct the scope and depth of the study and coordinate work during the
study's implementation. A Study Team (ST) under the LG would have day-to-day
responsibility for the study and development of the new MIS. The ST would have
a backbone staff of MR officials and would be assisted by domestic and foreign
specialists as and when necessary to advise ST on any technical problems
encountered, and to enable LG and ST to take account of international
experience with alternative MIS systems during design of MR's new system. Bank
staff would assist MR in identifying internationally-experienced, suitable
specialists.
Study Phases
4i.       The course of the study would broadly follow the four tasks to be
undertaken, but some preparatory work would also be needed. The study is
expected to comprise the following main phases:
Ca) Setting up of LG and ST. It is envisaged that this would be completed
by the end of 1985. The Bank could assist in recruiting consultants
and specialists which may be necessary;
(b) Training in China. Consultants would provide training in China to
strengthen the basic inderstanding of MIS, to describe how modern
MISs work in practice and to explain theoretical aspects of designing
a new system;
(c) Study tours and training abroad. After training in China, selected
members of LG and ST would spend time abroad gaining experience of
different railway MIS systems;
(d) DescriDtion of present MIS. At the same time as (c), remaining ST
members and consultants would record and study present information
flows in the pilot area and in the factory;
(e) Seminars in China. Returning ST members and consultants would assist
other ST members to understand the experience of other railway MISs;
Cf) Design of new HIS. ST would work with consultants to design the
preliminary new HIS;

ANNEX 1
Page 3
(g) Pilot implementation. ST would plan conversion of the existing system
to the new MIS by redirection and tailoring of information flows and
by introducing computer hardware and software and to put the new MIS
into operation; and
(h) Demonstration and monitoring. ST would monitor performance of new MIS
and show other units of NR what has been done and how it is working.
It is expected that pilot implementation would be in 1988, so that by comple-
tion of the Second Railway Project, MR would have sufficient experience of the
new MIS to decide how to extend it to other units of MR.
Study Financing
5.        The Second Railway Project loan includes an amount of $500,000 to
finance the foreign exchange costs of the MIS study. This amount is a first
estimate of the amount needed; the amount may need to be adjusted as the work
is specified in more detail.
Reporting
6.        ST will prepare a report after each of the phases of the study.  A
copy of each report would be furnished to the Bank within a month of its
completion for dicussion of the recommendations with LG.

Panel of Advisors for MR Universities
Background
1.        During discussions with Bank mission members, representatives of
Beifang (Northern) Communications University, Xinan (Southwest) Communications
University, and MR's Education Bureau proposed that a component be included in
the proposed proJeot, for an internationally recruited panel of railway ape-
cialists to visit China and offer suggestions for strengthening the work of
MR's universities. It was further suggested that the composition of the panel
should be a senior university administrator as chairman, and experts in the
following fields: (a) civil engineering; (b) mechanical engineering; (c) rail-
way electrification; (d) computer and information sciences; and (e) management.
The Panel's Responsibilities
2.        The universities would particularly hope for advice from the panel in
the following areas:
Ca) reform, improve and modernize the existing specialties;
Cb) identify and nurture appropriate new specialties;
(c) advise on new laboratory equipment; and
Cd) improve university management.
3.        It is hoped that the panel members could spend a total of about six
months on this project, perhaps divided into several segments over the course
of about a year.

Project Capital Costs
1.        The development of a conversion factor for the project capital costs
is shown below. The conversion factors applied to particular categories are
those developed in detail for the Bank's First Railway Project, which were in
turn based on the data presented in the "Economic Analysis of Aluminum Milling
in Shanghai," the EAAMS study. The resultant overall conversion factor, which
has been applied to direct project costs, is 1.13.

Complementary Capital Costs
2.        The proposed project will require complementary investments of sev-
eral types. Most directly, a high-voltage supply line will be needed to connect
the project with the regional power grid, and additional locomotives and rol-
ling stock will be needed to handle the increase in traffic. In addition,
investments will be needed to expand the production of coal and other comodi-
ties to be carried. These linked investments are measured as follows:
(a) High-Voltage Supply Line. This connection, which will be financed
by MR but built by the Ministry of Power, is estimated to cost Y 70 million.
The conversion factor is 1.21, under the assumption that about half the cost
will be construction (EAAMS conversion factor 1.08) and the other half equip-

ANNEX 4
Page 2
ment (EAAMS conversion factor 1.34). Construction is assumed to take four
years.
(b) Locomotives and Cars. For the projected 1991 traffic levels, rol-
ling stock requirements will be 166 electric locomotives (replacing the exist-
ing fleet of 189 diesel and 288 steam locomotives) and an additional 2,437
freight cars and 310 passenger coaches (augmenting the existing fleet). Using
the EAAMS conversion factor of 1.34, the economic cost of this investment can
be summarized as follows (with the diesels assumed to be 50% depreciated and
with no value assigned to steam locomotives):
No.    Unit Price      Amount       Ratio    Amount
Electric Locos        166    Y 1,250,000  1 207.5 mln.
- diesels          189         725,000    137.0  "
- net amt.                                 70.5  "       1.34   1 94.5 mln.
Freight Cars       2,437          34,000     82.9  "       1.34    111.1  "
Passenger Coaches    310         120,000     37.2  "       1.34     49.8  "
Total                                                              255.4  "
The locomotive component of this total is phased in over four years to allow
for supply constraints (Table 4.3). Additional investments after 1991 are
scaled to projected traffic increases.
(c)  Coal Mine Development Costs. The cost of completely new mine
development has been estimated at US$56/ton for the Bank Coal Project. For the
proposed project, the additional coal to be transported will come in about
equal parts from (i) existing mines that could readily produce more coal when
transport becomes available and (ii) new mines and existing mines to be expand-
ed. Therefore, development costs nave been taken at half the cost of developing
completely new mines. Mine development expenditures were assumed to be equally
spread over the five years prior to production increments, according to the
traffic pattern shown in Table 4.2. The new traffic shown in this table in-
cludes all commodities, not just the projected coal traffic, on the assumption
that non-coal traffic will also involve development costs. Since coal produc-
tion is quite capital-intensive, the imputed development costs for non-coal
traffic are probably overstated. The net effect is that the estimated rate of
return probably understates the true value.
Project Benefits
3.        Benefits of the project are measured as value added per ton of coal,
since this commodity accounts for about two-thirds of the southbound traffic on
the project line. However, equal benefits are also ascribed to the non-coal
tonnage, on the grounds that the latter traffic would not generally be permit-
ted to displace coal if it were not of equal urgency. The price of coal FOB
Shanghai is estimated to be US$44 per ton in 1991, rising to US$47 per ton in



- 31 -
ANNEX 4
Page 3
1995 and constant thereafter (all in constant 1984 dollars). These prices are
based on Bank forecasts of thermal coal prices. Handling costs per ton are
estimated at 1 5 for loading at Shanghai, I 10 fOr shipping costs on the
Yangtse River, 1 3 for loading at Wuhan, and 1 8 for railroad shipping from
mine mouth to Wuhan. Operating costs of coal mines are estimated at Y 21 per
ton, based on data from the Bank's Coal Project. Thus, at an exchange rate of
1 2.84 to the US dollar, the value added per ton of coal is about I 125 minus
(5 + 10 + 3 + 8 + 21) = 1 78 in 1991, rising to Y 86 for 1995 and thereafter.
The projections of generated traffic in Table 4.2 are based on MR's projections
up to the year 2000, and are conservatively assumed to grow at 4.5% p.a. there-
after. It should be noted that the traffic projections peak in 1996, decline
until 2001, and then begin to rise again. This pattern occurs because of the
expected impact of a new north-south line reaching the Yangtse at Jiujiang,
which will attract some of the traffic that would otherwise flow on the pro-
ject line. It should also be noted that, to keep the estimates conservative, no
benefits have been ascribed to the additional passenger traffic that electrifi-
cation will make possible.
4.        As a simple check on the validity of the assumption that non-coal
traffic makes an economic contribution equal to that of the coal traffic, it is
useful to consider the regional trade in grain. Hubei province, the area around
Wuhan, is a rice-growing region. Some of this rice is used locally as animal
fodder, because coarse grains from the north cannot reach Hubei in significant
amounts (domestic trade data for 1982 indicate that only about 10,000 tons of
grain from northeast China reached Hubei, which represents only about 3/100 of
1% of the grain shipped interprovincially). In early 1983, the average free
market price of a ton of rice was about I 549, while the free market prices of
corn and sorghum were Y 398 and 1 386 per ton, respectively. If uniform prices
prevailed throughout the country, shipping an extra ton of coarse gralins from
northeast China to feed the pigs in Hubei, and sending the corresponding ton of
rice to meet higher priority needs elsewhere, would mean a savings of about I
97, even after subtracting about 1 60 for rail costs in both directions. Thus,
even after making allowances for regional price differences, it seems probable
that shipping an incremental ton of grain is at least as valuable as shipping
an extra ton of coal.
Economic Rate of Return
5.        As shown in Table 4.3, the ERR is estimated at 24%.
Least Cost Studies
6.        At present, traffic faces a bottleneck in the section between Xinyang
and Guangshui, due to a ruling gradient of 1.25% in the heavy (southbound)
direction. As an alternative to electrification, two realignments were consid-
ered, each of which would have a ruling gradient of D.4%. The first realignment
would involve building 177.7 kcm of new line, at an estimated cost of 1 407.5
million. The second reall.nment would require 86.8 km of new line, at a cost of
1 303.5 million.  At an estimated cost of 1 435,000 per double track route-km,
electrification of the relevant section would cost about 1 90 million. Thus,
electrification is much cheaper than either realignment.



- 32-
ANNEX 4
Page 4
7.        Another alternative to realignment would be to equip this seotion
with more powerful imported diesels, which do not suffer from the acoeleration
and braking limitations that hamper Chinese locomotives on steep gradients.
Projected traffic levels would require about 120 foreign diesels /1, at an
economic cost of about 1 421 million. Electrifioation would require about 92
locomotives, at an economic cost of about 1 98 million, plus 1 90 million for
fixed installations, a total of about 1 188 million. Again, electrification is
the lowest cost alternative, espeoially taking into acoount the lower operating
cost it provides (Table 4.4).
B.        The line from Pingdingshan to Mengmiao carries a heavy coal traffic
from the Pingdingshan mine, which is undergoing a major expansion of oapacity.
Traffic on this line in 1983 was 13.83 million tons in the heavy direction
(Table 4.1). After allowing for passenger traffic, present capacity is 16 mil-
lion tons p.a. Traffic projections worked out between MR and the coal mining
authorities of Henan province call for an annual freight traffic of 17.6 mil-
lion tons by 1990 and 24.1 million tons by 1995. Electrification is less expen-
sive than the track improvements that would otherwise be required, which amount
to virtual double tracking. Electrification also offers greater operational
efficiency, since trains loaded at Pingdingshan will be able to run through
onto the main line without stopping for re-marshalling at Mengmiao, which would
otherwise be needed since trailing loads are lighter with steam than with elc-
tric locomotives.
9.        Apart from the rapidly emerging capacity bottlenecks between Xinyang
and Guangshui and between Pingdingshan and Mengmiao, the other sections of the
Zhengzhou-Wuhan line could carry projected traffic levels without electrifica-
tion.  These less mountainous sections total about 340 ki, which means that
electrification costs would be about 1 148 million. Although the ourrent fleet
of locomotives is about half steam and half diesell the fleet will need to be
entirely diesel to produce a marginal capacity increase over the 1983 traffic.
As can be seen from Table 4.4, unit traction costs are 0.347 fen per gross
ton-km for diesel and 0.224 fen per gross ton-km for eleotric, a saving of
0.123 fen per gross ton-km. Traffic is expected to be about 49.4 billion GTK
in 1992 (non-mountainous sections only). Thus, electrification would yield a
saving of about 1 60.8 million in 1991, rising thereafter as traffic increases.
Over a 25-year period, the ERR would be approximately 24% when compared to
initial costs of I 148 million for electrification works and I 27 million for
new locomotives. Details of these calculations are available in the Project
File.
10.       It is evident from Table 4.4 that the cost of fuel is critical to any
cost comparison of various types of traotive power. The cost calculations pro-
vided by MR (the columns labeled "Financial" in Table 4.4) are all based on
domestic fuel prices. The conversion ratios applied to these fuel costs to
obtain economic costs were calculated as follows:
/1   After due allowance is made for differences in availability and effective
speed, one Shaoshan electric locomotive (4,000 gross tons trailing weight) can
move the sme traffic as 1.5 Dongfeng diesels (3,500 tons each) or 1.3 imported
diesels (3,850 tons each).

Coal: Based on world prices, the shadow prioo of ooal PAS Wuhan is about
1 107 per ton at an exchange rate of 1 2.84 to the US dollar (para. 3 ).
The prlce of coal to MR is about 1 73, thus the ratio or 107/73 or 1.47
used in Table 4.4.
Diesel: The prioe of diesel fuel to MR at the time these table. were oal-
oulated was 1 435 per ton, while the market prica in Hong Kong in mid-1984
was about US$250 per ton. At an exahange rate of 2.84, this means a shadow
price of about 1 710 per ton, which yields the conversion factor of 1.63
used in Table 4.4. It should be noted that the price of diesel fuel in
China has since been raised, and Ls now rather closer to world market
levels.
Electricity: Since electricity is not traded on the world market, it is
more difficult to establish an appropriate conversion factor for the price
of electric power in China.  The price to MR used in Table 4.4 is 8.38
fen/kwh. However, this flgure is then multiplied by 1.42, to conform to
the estimate, calculated for the Bank's Second Power Project, that an
increase in domestic coal prices to world levels would in turn cause a 42%
increase in the cost of thermal electricity.

SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Economic Evaluation of the Changehun Passenger Coach
Factory Modernization, Phase I
Project Capital Costs
1.        Economic costs of the project have been evaluated by applying conver-
sion factors to domestic prices and using estimated world market prices for
imported items. The resulting overall conversion factor is 1.09.

Project Benefits
2.        China urgently needs more passenger coaches. Even though trains are
very crowded, many would-be passengers are turned away for lack of space. The
four coach factories, taken together, currently produce about 1200 cars per
year. Only Changehun has much space to expand. A comparison of the growth of
railway passenger traffic and the growth of the gross value or industrial and
agricultural output (GVIAO) over the five-year period 1978-1983 suggests an
income elasticity or demand of about 1.3. The GVIAO is targeted to grow at
about 7% p.a. for the remainder of this century (the "doubling and redoubling*
goal). Thus, a projection of 7% for the annual growth of railway passenger
demand is probably conservative. As Table 4.5 indicates, if demand grows at the
plausible rate of 7% p.a., and ignoring the shortages that already exist, it
appears that a fleet growing by 1200 coaches per year will be able to handle
only 53% of demand by the turn of the century.

ANNEX 5

3.        The activities outlined in Chapter 3, paragraph 3.06 are only the
first phase of a two-phase process. The primary justification for this first
phase is that it prcvides careful preparation for the second phase, which in
its turn will bring about a substantial and urgently needed increasq in China's
capacity to produce railway passenger coaches. However, some improvements in
both the number and quality of coaches produced at Changchun are expected to
occur because of the first phase. Thus, an economic rate of return can be
calculated for Phase 1 on a stand-alone basis.
4.        Current production at Changchun is currently about 700 coaches per
year. The first phase of modernization is expected to bring this number to
about 800 units p.a. within two or three years. As shown in Table 4.5, the net
effect of such an increase is that by the year 2000, the railways will be able
to carry about 298.7 billion passenger-km p.a. instead of 280.7 billion. The
value of this extra traffic is measured as a consumer's surplus calculation on
a year by year basis, as follows (a more detailed discussion can be found in
the Project File):
(a) Sketch a horizontal supply curve at 1.78 fen/pkm, which is the
approximate average revenue per passenger-km for 1984. The implicit
assumption is that average revenues will cover full costs, including an
adequate rate of return to any complementary investment, such as addition-
al locomotives, needed to carry the additional passenger traffic. Since
the system-wide rate of return to average fixed assets in use in 1984 was
about 10.55, this seems a reasonable first assumption, for which further
justification is provided in the Project File. The costing study currently
being carried out by MR should provide more accurate data in due ccurse.
(b) Sketch a demand curve, with an assumed price elasticity of 1.0,
that passes through the supply curve at the traffic level given by estima-
ted demand for the year in question.
(c) Calculate the area of the trapezoid bounded by the supply curve
below, the demand curve above, the traffic capacity without the project on
the left, and the traffic capacity with Phase 1 on the right.
The result of this calculation is given in Table 4.5, in the column
labeled "Benefits of Extra Trafficn.
5.        If production capacity at Changchun is not expanded, an alternative
way to increase passenger transport capacity would be to import coaches. Im-
ported coaches would cost at least I 312,000 each (US$110,000 at 2.84), as com-
pared with an economic cost of about 1 217,000 (1 162,000 times the adjustment
factor of 1.34) for the domestic model. It is tempting, but incorrect, to meas-
ure the benefits of Phase 1 in terms of the cost savings that can be realized
through import substitution. The error of this approach can most easily be seen
by considering a limiting case, in which the costs of domestic and foreign
coaches happen to be the same. In such a situation, benefits as measured by the
cost difference must always equal zero, thereby suggesting that no additional
coaches should be built (and by symmetry, that no coaches should be imported
either). As this example suggests, a cost comparison between domestic and



- 36 -
ANNEX 5
Page 3
imported coaches helps identify the least-cost alternative; it does not reveal
whether either alternative is economically justified.
6.        An additional benefit of Phase 1 will be the savings on maintenance
expenditures. At present, the typical coach requires a major overhaul costing
1 20,175 in the sixth year and another major overhaul costing Y 28,055 in the
twelfth year. The column labeled "Maintenance Savings" in Table 4.5 assumes
that the cost of these two repair cycles can be cut in half after the quality
of the coach is improved.
Internal Rate of Return
7.        As shown in Table 4.5, the ERR is estimated at 47%.
Sensitivity and Risk Analysis
8.        The main risks for Phase 1 are that extra production may not reach
100 coaches per year, that maintenance savings may not be realized, or that the
assumptions underlying the consumers' surplus calculation may not be met (in
particular, that demand may not grow at 7% p.a. or that the price elasticity of
demand may be more than 1.0). The eensitivity of the ERR to these factors has
been tested as follows:
ERR
