export sectors to increase their efficiency and\n            competitiveness; and (c) supporting in addition, the\n            development of a business action plan to assess the legal\n            and business requirements that will be a prerequisite to\n            addressing a market-driven corporate restructuring program\n            for potentially viable enterprises presently located in the\n            Non-Performing Assets Recovery Trust (NPART). The project\n            includes two principal components: (i) a revolving export\n            credit refinance and guarantee facility (US$34 million\n            equivalent) to assist private exporters except for cocoa,\n            gold, diamonds, electricity, and raw timber in obtaining\n            short-term and pre- and post-shipment finance from banks;\n            and (ii) a comprehensive technical assistance component\n            (US$7 million equivalent) to finance, firstly, management\n            and technical training, consultant services, equipment and\n            materials for strengthening the export finance\n            infrastructure, and secondly, appropriate expertise to\n            develop the legal and financial issues involved in preparing\n            a business and action plan for dealing with restructuring\n            viable companies under NPART."}, "docdt": "1993-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
