The key lessons are: a) In the absence of a\n            stable macroeconomic environment, financial sector\n            operations are not likely to succeed. b) Broader\n            achievements under financial intermediary loans are unlikely\n            within an undisciplined credit environment; in this case,\n            measures should be included to address issues relating to\n            governance, management, financial policies, collection\n            performance, appraisal and supervision techniques, and\n            credit risk management policies of participating financial\n            institutions. c) When erroneous decisions are made and these\n            mistakes are realized, countermeasures, including project\n            cancellation, should be taken as soon as possible to\n            minimize their cost."}, "docdt": "1998-10-29T00:00:00Z"}
