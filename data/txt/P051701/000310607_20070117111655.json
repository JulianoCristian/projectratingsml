The lessons learned were\n            that: 1) decentralization of fiscal and investment\n            decision-making and implementation at the state and local\n            levels, results in administrative efficiency and superior\n            results; 2) by assigning responsibility to local communities\n            and their organizations, and by involving the municipal\n            government as a partner, community-driven development (CDD)\n            approaches can successfully support decentralized resource\n            allocation and create social capital in even the poorest\n            rural areas; 3) self-selection of beneficiaries results in\n            strong targeting; 4) alignment of community investments with\n            the Municipal Human Development Index (HDI-M) as a targeting\n            and mobilizing goal, is both a logical evolution of the\n            Northeast CDD approach and an important way to further scale\n            it up; 5) natural resources management (NRM) and\n            sustainability issues require proactive attention in\n            environmentally fragile states; 6) productive subprojects\n            are likely to assume greater prominence under the new\n            project; 7) municipal councils can play a broader role in\n            local planning; 8) indigenous community organizations can\n            establish and express priorities, and administer resources\n            received; 9) intensive supervision which includes the use of\n            local entities closest to the communities, is an\n            indispensable determinant of success and sustainability for\n            CDD projects; 10) technical assistance is an essential\n            ingredient for CDD projects and presents particular\n            challenges for its systematic organization, location,\n            delivery and supervision in poor rural regions; 11) the\n            project management information system (MIS) is capable of\n            generating real-time data/reports on the full subproject\n            cycle and supporting monitoring and evaluation activities;\n            12) standardized subproject documents, technical designs and\n            unit costs simplify sub-project preparation and evaluation,\n            improve sub-project quality, facilitate procurement, prevent\n            over- and under-design, and promote the participation of\n            poorer communities; and 13) checks and balances are\n            essential to ensure proper targeting and use of resources\n            and to boost and institutionalize transparency."}, "docdt": "2004-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
