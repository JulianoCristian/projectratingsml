poverty by a) providing basic social and economic\n            infrastructure, and employment and income-generating\n            opportunities; b) decentralizing resource allocation and\n            decisionmaking; c) leveraging resources mobilized at the\n            community level; and d) deepening the creation of social\n            capital. The project has three components: 1) community\n            subprojects, which support small-scale investments selected\n            and subsequently operated and maintained by beneficiaries;\n            2) institutional development, which provides all\n            implementing entities and communities with technical\n            assistance and training to increase capacity and improve\n            project implementation; and 3) project administration,\n            supervision, monitoring, and evaluation, which finances\n            project coordination and activities to provide feedback on\n            project performance and impact."}, "docdt": "1997-10-23T00:00:00Z"}
