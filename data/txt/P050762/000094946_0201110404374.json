sustainability likely, and institutional\n            development impacts substantial. Lessons emphasize that\n            working with state, and municipal governments (as these were\n            directly responsible of the delivery of basic education), a\n            recognition taken into account early on during project\n            design, and implementation, ensured the political support,\n            and demonstrated the efficacy of grassroots policies.\n            Similarly, empowering schools through direct interventions,\n            designed to generate greater school commitment to the\n            project's development objectives, was conducive to\n            success. This was demonstrated by an initial evaluation of\n            the School Development Plan, which concluded that students\n            under this plan performed better on assessment tests, and\n            other dependent variables, such as student promotion rates.\n            The popularity of these new educational development plans,\n            presented the dilemma of expanding the project's\n            success, though the project had reached its full training,\n            and financial resources to bear. In response to this, the\n            follow-up operation addresses expansion, with more explicit\n            procedures, and criteria. The long-term strategy of an\n            educational program (the project was prepared on previous\n            project experiences, while lessons from this project will be\n            incorporated to follow-up operations) allows for capacity\n            building, technical skills, and innovations to flourish, and\n            be institutionalized."}, "docdt": "2001-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
