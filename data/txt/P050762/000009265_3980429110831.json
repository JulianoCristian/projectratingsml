public institutions that\n            are responsible for them within a coordinated management\n            framework, in order to increase the participation, promotion\n            and graduation rates, and achievement levels of children in\n            the North and Center-West capital microregions of Brazil.\n            There are four components. The first raises schools to\n            minimum operational standards through educating and\n            certifying teachers, supplying basic furniture and\n            equipment, financing school improvement investments, and\n            financing school-managed rehabilitation of physical\n            facilities. The second component establishes a school\n            development process by designing and supporting school\n            development plans; and financing school subprojects. The\n            third component carries out school microplanning and\n            develops and tests standard architectural plans for\n            additional school places. The fourth component builds\n            management capacity in schools, municipalities, and states;\n            provides specialized teaching and learning improvement\n            programs; fosters community participation; strengthens\n            national education information systems and programs; and\n            finances project management."}, "docdt": "1998-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
