     Re:  MALAWI: Dutch  Grant  Related  to Credit Number 1920-MAI
          (Third Amendment)
          (Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Credit)
Dear Sir:
1.   We refer to the Dutch Grant Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi (the Recipient) and the International Development Association
as Administrator on behalf of the Minister for Development
Cooperation of the Netherlands (the Administrator), dated July 14,
1989 (the Dutch Grant Agreement) whereby the Administrator agreed to
extend to the Recipient a grant in an amount of seven million eight
hundred thousand Dutch guilders (f.7,800,000) to assist the
Recipient in carrying out the Program referred to in the First
Recital of the Preamble to the Dutch Grant Agreement.  We also refer
to the Administrator's letter dated September 29, 1989, confirmed by
the Recipient on October 10, 1989 whereby the Dutch Grant Agreement
was amended to give effect to a second contribution of five million
Dutch guilders (f.5,000,000) made by the Netherlands' Authorities.
We also refer to the Administrator's letter dated December 12, 1989
confirmed by the Recipient on December 19, 1989 whereby the Dutch
Grant Agreement was further amended to give effect to a third
contribution of two million five hundred thousand Dutch guilders
(f.2,500,000) made by the Netherlands Authorities.
2.   The Netherlands' authorities have by a letter dated March 20,
1990, agreed to further supplement the grant amount of f.15,300,000
by a fourth contribution of f.7,500,000.
3.   We, therefore, propose the following amendment to the Dutch
Grant Agreement to give effect to this supplemental contribution:
     The amount in, the Third Recital of the Preamble to, and in
     Section 2.01 of, the Dutch Grant Agreement shall now read
     twenty-two million eight hundred thousand guilders
     (f.22,800,000).
4.   All conditions of the Dutch Grant Agreement as amended hereby
shall remain in full force and effect.
5.   Kindly confirm your agreement to the above amendment by
countersigning and dating the enclosed copy of this letter and
returning it to us.
Yours sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
Isaac K. Sam, Acting Director
Southern Africa Department
