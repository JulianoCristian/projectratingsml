     Re:  MALAWI: Dutch Grant Related to Credit Number 1920-MAI
          (Second Amendment)
          (Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment Credit)
Dear Sir:
1.   We refer to the Dutch Grant Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi (the Recipient) and the International Development Association
as Administrator on behalf of the Minister for Development
Cooperation of the Netherlands (the Administrator), dated July 14,
1989 (the Dutch Grant Agreement) whereby the Administrator agreed to
extend to the Recipient a grant in an amount of seven million eight
hundred thousand Dutch guilders (f.7,800,000) to assist the
Recipient in carrying out the Program referred to in the First
Recital of the Preamble to the Dutch Grant Agreement.  We also refer
to the Administrator's letter dated September 29, 1989, confirmed by
the Recipient on October 10, 1989 whereby the Dutch Grant Agreement
was amended to give effect to a second contribution of five million
Dutch guilders (f.5,000,000) made by the Netherlands' Authorities.
     The Netherlands' authorities have by a letter dated November
2, 1989 agreed to further supplement the grant amount of
f.12,800,000 by a third contribution of f.2,500,000.
3.   We, therefore, propose the following amendment to the Dutch
Grant Agreement to give effect to this supplemental contribution:
     The amount in, the Third Recital of the Preamble to, and in
     Section 2.01 of, the Dutch Grant Agreement shall now read
     fifteen million three hundred thousand guilders
     (f.15,300,000).
4.   All conditions of the Dutch Grant Agreement as amended hereby
shall remain in full force and effect.
5.   Kindly confirm your agreement to the above amendment by
countersigning and dating the enclosed copy of this letter and
returning it to us.
Yours sincerely,
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
