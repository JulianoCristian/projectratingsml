Capacity\n            Building Project (EMCAP) aims to assist Nigeria in\n            strengthening key aspects of economic management. EMCAP is\n            part of a broader, ambitious effort by the Government to\n            improve economic governance and the tools for economic\n            management. The project supports and strengthens capacity\n            building efforts and assists in good governance and the\n            anti-corruption stance of the government. The project has\n            eight components. The first improves economic statistics and\n            national accounts, consumer price data, poverty monitoring\n            indicators, social statistics, and primary data collection.\n            The second component strengthens the capacity of the\n            national planning commission to prioritize, allocate, and\n            monitor public expenditures. The third component supports\n            oversight institutions to promote transparency and\n            accountability in the public sector, and to improve\n            dissemination of information on fiscal operations. The\n            fourth component finances a comprehensive review of the\n            public sector covering financial, operational, technical,\n            legal, and contractual aspects as well as reform of key\n            sector institutions. The remaining four components\n            strengthen procurement activities in the public sector,\n            policy development capabilities, and the legal and judicial\n            systems along with supporting the design and implementation\n            of an information management system."}, "docdt": "2000-02-25T00:00:00Z"}
