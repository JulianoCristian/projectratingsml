"Irrigation Rio Panuco Project will\n            develop intensive agriculture on 137,000 ha in three\n            separate areas in the Panuco River Basin: Las Animas (48,000\n            ha) in the State of Tamaulipas; Pujal-Coy (72,000 ha) in the\n            States of San Luis Potosi, Tamaulipas and Veracruz; and\n            Chicayan (17,000 ha) in the State of Veracruz. The project\n            elements are summarized below: (a) diversion dams, storage,\n            reservoirs, two pumping plants, and two regulating\n            reservoirs at different elevations; (b) irrigation\n            distribution system of main canals, laterals and sublaterals\n            and devices to measure water delivery in each area; (c)\n            drainage systems of open main and secondary drains to\n            discharge water into the natural stream channels in each\n            area; (d) access roads to the storage reservoirs and along\n            canals and drains to facilitate operation and maintenance\n            with a total length of about 1,800 km; (e) headquarters,\n            sub-offices and a telephone network linking key operation\n            points in each area; (f) land preparation, consisting of all\n            lands in the project areas being leveled and lands under\n            native vegetation being cleared; and (g) intensive\n            agricultural extension service during initial period of\n            project to insure efficient use of water. This report\n            comprises two impact evaluation reports for Mexico and\n            Morocco, and an overview which synthesizes the findings of\n            both impact evaluations regarding the extent of, and reasons\n            for, sustainability a compares the impact of irrigation\n            systems design on project performanc striking feature of all\n            four projects is the lower agricultural and ec performance\n            than that estimated at the time of audit. Weaker commodity\n            an inadequate development approach in one project, lower\n            than expected efficiencies, insufficient attention to\n            operation and maintenance in a projects, and damage to the\n            environment and natural resources have bee main factors\n            affecting performance. However, with one exception, which\n            performed poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of\n            technology respect of both irrigation practice and\n            agricultural productivity has continued to be sustained in\n            the other three projects."}, "docdt": "1974-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
