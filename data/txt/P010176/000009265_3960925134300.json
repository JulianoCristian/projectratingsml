The project achieved\n            its technical objectives, its impact has been significant,\n            sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the CEB (Ceylon Electricity Board)\n            should assess the feasibility of installing radiator cooling\n            in anticipation of restricted access to unpolluted and\n            sufficient sources of natural cooling water. Second, the\n            timely amendment of the performance bond clause of the\n            contract would have avoided the accrual of the large amount\n            of retention monies and allowed the remaining funds in the\n            loan account to be largely disbursed. Third, running the\n            diesels sparingly has reduced the possibility of overcoming\n            teething problems before the plant is required to run at a\n            high load factor and has limited training opportunities,\n            which will increase the risk factor in future operation at\n            high load. Fourth, reporting on project execution and\n            accounting was inadequate and needs to be improved. Fifth,\n            the possibility of future problems stemming from the use of\n            potable water for cooling should have been anticipated and\n            alternatives explored. Lastly, the CEB should implement a\n            program to recruit and retain experienced staff."}, "docdt": "1988-04-04T00:00:00Z"}
