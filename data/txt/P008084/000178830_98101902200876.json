on those cane lands that lend\n            themselves to full mechanization, and for undertaking three\n            technical studies designed to improve operational and\n            administrative efficiency. The project would reduce costs\n            and improve efficiency, thus assuring a satisfactory return\n            to the country's sugar industry, and to the largest\n            employer of labor apart from the Government itself."}, "docdt": "1973-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
