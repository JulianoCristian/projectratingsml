                                      Executive Summary
The Tajikistan Public Financial Management Modernization Project (PFMMP) was approved in
May 2009 with the objectives of (a) establishing basic processes for the efficient and transparent
management of public expenditures; and (b) developing adequate institutional capacity to
support the implementation and sustained functioning of an automated financial management
information system (FMIS). The Government of Tajikistan had requested an IDA grant to
support the implementation of reforms in the area of PFM, in line with Tajikistan’s PFM
Strategy.
The PFMMP had three components: Building Capacity for Public Financial Management
(US$4.18 million); Streamlining Core Budget Management Procedures (US$3.95 million); and
Preparation for Automation of Core PFM Operations (US$ 4.67 million). The equivalent of
USD 5.00 million were provided by IDA (3.4 million SDR), while the rest of the funding was
provided by other donors, namely the EU, DFID and Japan. The project did not undergo any
major restructuring, with the exception of a 7-month extension of the closing date until the end
of March 2015. By that time the IDA grant closed it was almost fully disbursed (USD 4.96
million).
The PFMMP was designed as a two-stage APL operation, rather than as a traditional one-step
sector investment loan. The project design took into account the need to sequence PFM reforms
in line with the Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) low absorption capacity and complementary
activities undertaken by other donors. As a result, the project concentrated on building the
foundations of the PFM system, reforming the budget formulation and execution systems instead
of implementing more advanced reforms. Concentrating the support on these core PFM areas
helped build strong technical capacity and strengthened the client’s ownership of the reform
process.
Implementation of all project components proceeded well albeit at a slow pace. The PDO and IP
ratings stayed at Moderately Satisfactory and Moderately Unsatisfactory levels throughout most
of the project’s lifetime. A Mid-Term Review conducted in September 2012 concluded that the
project had made noticeable progress towards its objectives. It also pointed out to deficiencies in
the results framework, notably the lack of quantitative indicators, which were addressed. PDO
and IP ratings were finally upgraded to Satisfactory when SGB.NET was approved for
application and the budgeting and accounting reforms could be fully applied in execution of the
2015 budget.
The overall project outcome rating is Satisfactory based on the individual ratings for relevance,
efficacy and efficiency. The project’s objectives were relevant both to the Government’s PFM
strategy and the Bank’s past and current strategies for Tajikistan. The two-phased design of the
project was consistent with the stated objectives and took into account the country’s conditions
and capacities. The design proved to be flexible as well, in that it allowed some deviations from
the original plan, which contributed to its objectives.
The PDO of the PFMMP can be broken down into four sub-objectives, all of which were
achieved (rating Substantial). The project succeeded in establishing basic processes for the
efficient and transparent management of public expenditures (objectives 1 and 2). With the
support of the project, Tajikistan made significant progress in streamlining its budget process.
This was achieved by adopting the Law on Public Finance in 2011, which laid the foundations

                                                1
for an improved budget process, and a large number of instructions related to budget preparation
and execution at the central and local levels. The improvements in the way the budget process in
Tajikistan works today are clearly visible: the latest Budget Circulars for 2014-2016 and 2015-
2017 are based on the new business process and the budget reflects the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and macro-fiscal forecasts. These forecasts proved a reliable
basis for budget preparation during the project period when Tajikistan realized steady economic
growth. Subsequently, as Tajikistan has experienced a recession, the forecasts have proved
overambitious.
PFMMP supported the development and approval of a public sector accounting reform strategy,
as well as the development of a new budget classification in line with GFS 2001 and a manual
for its use. MoF adopted the new budget classification in June 2012 and implemented it with the
2014 budget. A unified Chart of Accounts, integrated with the budget classification and
supporting the IPSAS was approved as well and has been applied from 2014. Budget
submissions to the Parliament, the Budget Law and amendments, as well as budget execution
reports are published regularly on the Ministry of Finance website (www.moliya.tj).
PFMMP made significant improvements into the treasury system, by preparing a strategic plan
and adapting the structure of the Treasury Department. A central level Treasury Single Account
(TSA) was created and it now covers all Republican budget transactions. The budget is executed
using the new automated budget execution module of the Tajikistan Financial Management
Information System (TFMIS). The TFMIS is based the Turkish SGB.NET system which was
offered free of charge by the Turkish Ministry of Finance. SGB.NET was a relatively simple IT
system that included basic PFM functionalities. Although the plan was to use a Commercial off-
the-Shelf solution, following a review of the SGB.NET, the Bank concluded that it could be
customized to fit the MoF’s needs and the project implementation plan was revised accordingly.
A comparison of the 2007 and 2012 PEFA Assessments provides additional evidence that
objectives 1 and 2 were achieved, with improvements in the following PEFA indicators: PI-5
Classification of the budget (from D to B), PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of accounts
reconciliation (from B to B+), PI-25 Quality and timeliness of annual financial statements (from
D+ to C+) and PI-10 Public access to key fiscal information (from D to C in 2012). Tajikistan’s
score in the Open Budget Index has also improved slightly from 17 in 2012 to 25 in 2015.
Objectives 3 and 4 (to develop adequate institutional capacity to support the implementation
and sustained functioning of an automated financial management information system (FMIS))
were also achieved (rating Substantial). With assistance of the project, the Ministry of Finance
improved the overall institutional capacity needed to implement the TFMIS. A PFM Council was
established to oversee the implementation of the PFM reforms. More than 9,000 staff from the
Ministry of Finance, line ministries and agencies, representing 90% of all staff working on PFM
issues in Tajikistan, were trained through the upgraded Training Center of the Ministry of
Finance. An IT Center was established in 2012 to support first the reforms of the Treasury and
later on to facilitate SGB.NET customization and implementation. Twelve IT specialists were
hired, most of whom were retained at the IT Center after the project completion.
Last but not least, the implementation of the project was efficient. The return on investment for
the project is 41%, even under conservative assumptions. The net present value of economic
benefits is US$ 5.2 million using a discount rate of 12 percent. It declines to US$ 2.6 million if
the discount rate is 20 percent. This high rate of return was achieved through the implementation

                                                2
of the FMIS, which added a high value to the country’s PFM system. Rolling out the TSA to all
local governments and implementing the different FMIS modules, including accounting,
generated substantial savings from eliminating transaction fee payments, earning interest on idle
cash balances and eliminating the need to purchase accounting software for 90 percent of the
country’s budget organizations.

1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal
1.       Country context. Tajikistan is a small economy in Central Asia with a population of 7.1
million and real GDP per capita of US$518 in 2007. Tajikistan underwent a period of severe
civil unrest during the late 1990s until peace accords were signed in 1997. Thereafter, despite
major structural and geographic challenges, the country’s economy grew steadily, external debt
was reduced to 30 percent of GDP in 2007, and the groundwork for important institutional
reforms was laid. The two main goals of the 2007 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper were to
alleviate poverty and maintain growth and macroeconomic stability. The poverty rate in
Tajikistan in 2007 was 53 percent, while extreme poverty was 17 percent. The worsening global
economic situation had an impact on the availability of finances through remittances and credits,
thus posing additional constraints to growth and development. Consequently, improvements in
the allocation, transparency and efficiency of the use of public resources were identified as
critical contributors to the sustainable growth and social development of Tajikistan.
2.      Sector Policy. Tajikistan’s 2006 Public Administration Reform Strategy laid out the key
public financial management (PFM) objectives that the Government sought to achieve, namely:
(i) closer coordination between the budget and economic policy; (ii) greater coherence in the
responsibilities for PFM (with a view to integrating more closely investment planning and the
budget process and providing the Ministry of Finance (MoF) with the overall responsibility for
linking strategies and programs with the budget process); (iii) better procedures for financial
decision-making in ministries; (iv) reformed internal control and audit systems; (v) greater
effectiveness of public procurement; and (vi) optimized revenue allocation mechanisms among
levels of government.
3.      Sector Context. By the time of PFMMP preparation results had already been achieved
with regard to: establishing the Treasury in 1997, covering all components of the state budget;
incremental improvements in the budget classification; and piloting medium-term budgeting and
aligning expenditures with evolving sector strategies. A partially automated Treasury system had
been operating at the Central Treasury for budget execution and reporting since 2001. The local
treasuries used bank accounts at local branches of the Amonat Bank, which is the State Savings
Bank of the Republic of Tajikistan. A new budget classification (economic and functional
segments) was developed in 2004 with IMF support largely based on Government Financial
Statistics (GFS) 1986 classifications. MoF was in the process of developing the administrative
segment of the budget classification and planned to introduce it for the preparation and execution
of the 2010 budget. Most other segments had either been revised, such as the economic and
functional segments, or developed, such as the fund type and territorial segments. They were
supposed to be implemented by 2011, although the program classification remained partial.
There were ongoing efforts in pilot sectors (education and health) to strengthen strategic
planning and resource allocation over the medium-term looked promising, although there were
still challenges in establishing a proper sector-driven expenditure management process. These
challenges included capacity constraints, limited role of central ministries with regard to
budgeting for decentralized services, and incomplete financial and performance information.
4.    Diagnostic reports issued in 2007, such as the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA), the IMF’s Report on The Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC)—Fiscal Transparency Module, the Bank’s Second Programmatic Public

                                                4
Expenditure Review, and the review of the public sector accounting system sponsored by the
Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), provided an assessment of achievements
and challenges ahead. The most important challenges identified were: (i) fragmentation of the
budget process (the MoF has to work with a high number of spending entities); (ii) deviations
between the planned and implemented budgets at the substantial level, both in amount and
composition; (iii) lack of a proper link between the commitment tracking and control systems
and the decentralized procurement system; (iv) incomplete reforms in the Treasury such as
improving cash management and several TSA functions; (v) lack of an administrative segment in
the budget classification as well as weaknesses in other segments of the classification; (vi) lack
of a Chart of Accounts that would be integrated with the budget classification; and (vii)
inadequate public access to fiscal information. The challenges at the subnational level were
caused by the absence of an automated budget execution system, weak personnel capacity, and
insufficient communication between local departments and treasury offices. These weaknesses
had several implications for the overall public financial management system of the country, such
as: weak commitment controls; inaccurate, untimely and paper-based budget reporting; and
inadequate asset management. The implementation of a new core FMIS based was seen as a
solution to many of these problems. Champions of the reforms advocated for a fully integrated
system would incorporate multiple functionalities, such as macroeconomic forecasting, debt
management, payroll management, and asset/inventory management.
1.2.   Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators
5.     The Project Development Objective in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD- Report
No: H463-TJ) is: (a) to establish basic processes for efficient and transparent management of
public expenditures; and (b) to develop adequate institutional capacity to support the
implementation and sustained functioning of an automated financial management information
system (FMIS).
6.      These objectives were to be pursued by strengthening budgeting and treasury functions,
improving transparency and communications, designing and implementing improvements of the
public financial management information systems, and building capacity in core areas of public
financial management. The indicators proposed in the PAD includes the following:
    (i) Orderly budget cycle is implemented and reflected in law.
    (ii) Budget classification (BC) and chart of accounts (COA) are integrated and allow for
       preparation and execution of the republican and local budgets based on the following
       titles: administrative unit, economic item, and function. Improved BC and COA are
       implemented by updating and expanding existing information systems for budget
       preparation and execution before FMIS.
    (iii) A core training capacity for PFM is developed and key staff is trained, including
       strengthening their basic technical capacity to use automated systems developed at
       central and local levels.
    (iv) The MOF IT Center is established with an adequate number of trained technical
       specialists to ensure user support and sustainability of information systems.
    (v) Information on central and local budget needed for managerial decisions is available at
       least twice faster than currently, or within one working day (currently 2 days) using a
       modern FMIS (APL2).

                                                5
    (vi) Accountability to citizens on budget planning and execution is improved through timely
       publishing of documentation o Budget submissions to the Parliament, the Budget Law
       and amendments, as well as budget execution reports are published regularly on the
       Ministry of Finance website (www.moliya.tj). n budget planning and execution
       (quarterly and end-of-year fiscal statement).
7.      The outcome indicators are described in Annex 3 of the PAD are: the MOF and budget
organizations practice streamlined business processes for budget preparation and execution; the
budget is prepared and executed based on an upgraded budget classification (BC) which is
integrated with the Chart of Accounts (COA); Budget submission to Parliament, the Budget
Law and amendments, and Quarterly and Annual budget execution reports are published on the
MOF’s web page by Year 4; the MOF has adequate technical capacity to implement redesigned
procedures and manage existing applications, support users and sustain IT systems.
8.     In addition, intermediate results under each of the project’s three components were
tracked through the following intermediate results indicators:
Component 1

    The MoF’s IT Center is established, and an adequate number of specialists is recruited and
     trained: (i) MoF’s IT Center with a proper organizational structure to support key ICT
     functions is established in 2011; (ii) MOF’s ICT infrastructure is enhanced to enable FMIS
     implementation; (iii) At least 12 ICT specialists at the central level and at least one technical
     staff for each regional treasury office are recruited and trained in Years 1-2.
1.3.    Revised PDO and Key Indicators and Reasons/Justification
9.      There were no revisions of the PDO and other key indicators.
1.4.     Main Beneficiaries
10.     The project was prepared before the implementation of the current PAD template and,
therefore, no primary target group was identified in the PAD. However, based on the description
of the project, Implementation Status Reports (ISRs), Aide Memoirs (AMs), and Annual
Reports, it is clear that the direct beneficiaries of the project were the Ministry of Finance,
including the Treasury, as well as officials and staff both at the central and the sub-national
levels. Some of the benefits they received include extensive training, improved business
processes, development of an FMIS system, upgraded IT and network equipment. Line
ministries and agencies also benefited from improvements in the Treasury system through
improvements in cash and expenditure management.
1.5. Original Components
11.   The Public Financial Management Modernization Project (PFMMP) had the following
components:
Component 1: Building Capacity for Public Financial Management (US$4.18 million): The
main activities of this component were:
     (i) Supporting the capacity of the MoF to manage PFM reforms at strategic and operational
         levels. The objective of this support was to ensure synergy among various activities,
         coordinate initiatives and monitor results, and to advise on the proper sequencing and
         timely decision-making on reform issues. This support was provided to the Minister of
         Finance, the PFM Secretariat, the PFMMP Project Director and to Activity Leaders;
     (ii) Improving the MoF’s institutional capacity, which included support to optimizing the
          organizational structure of the MoF to align tasks and responsibilities with reformed
          business processes;
     (iii)Supporting the development of PFM skills in the country and strengthening MoF’s
          capacity to develop the PFM skills of public officials and enable them to work with the
          improved PFM system;
     (iv) Supporting effective Project fiduciary management and project audit.
Component 2: Streamlining Core Budget Management Procedures (US$3.95 million): The
main activities of this component were:

                                                  7
      (i) Support for improvement of budget planning and budget preparation;
      (ii) Support for implementation of the integrated chart of accounts and improved budget
           classification system aligned with international standards;
      (iii)Support for improvement of procedures for budget execution through the treasury
           system;
      (iv) Support for redesigning the existing information systems to align operations with changes
           to the budget classification system and chart of accounts;
      (v) Support to implementation of upgraded information system (developed in activity (iv));
          and
      (vi) Support for systematic revision and improvement of primary and secondary legislation
           regulating PFM areas.
Component 3: Preparation for Automation of Core PFM Operations (US$ 4.67 million):
The main activities of this component are:
      (i) Support for establishing and building the capacity of the MoF’s IT Center, including
          advisory support, training for the MoF IT Center, setting up a training facility for hands-
          on ICT training, and a feasibility study on establishing common ICT network
          infrastructure;
      (ii) Modernization of the MoF ICT infrastructure, including an upgrade of the existing
           information systems and an upgrade of the ICT equipment for Main System and Backup
           Centers and Local Treasury Offices (LTO);
      (iii)Support for change management (technical training, study visits for the MoF and IT
           Center staff and workshops); and
      (iv) Preparation of the FMIS technical requirements and procurement documents.
1.6.      Revised Components
12.      There were no revisions in the Components.
1.7.      Other Significant Changes
13.      The Ministry of Finance requested a seven-month extension of the closing date of the
project from August 31, 2014, to March 31, 2015 to complete the implementation of three
activities: procurement and installation of the Data Center equipment, institutionalization of the
Training Center and institutionalization of the IT Center. This was the only restructuring of the
project.
14.     According to the original plan, the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)
was to provide parallel support for the implementation of the public sector accounting reform
and for scaling up the envisaged reforms. Tentative SECO parallel financing was projected to be
equivalent to approximately US$2 million. In the end, some of the activities on accounting
reform (accounting strategy and chart of accounts) were funded by the PFMMP while SECO
provided funding for a separate project implementing public sector accounting standards.
15.     The most important change in the project design was the decision to improve the FMIS
and the Treasury systems by implementing the software “SGB.NET” as a temporary solution
instead of purchasing a Commercial off-the- Shelf (COTS) solution during the second phase of
                                                  8
the APL. This decision was a reflection of the flexible and rational approach of both the
Government and the Bank which allowed them to use the opportunity of adopting an alternative
solution. A technical assessment of the functional capability of SGB.NET was undertaken in
2011. It confirmed that the software would meet the Tajik authorities’ near- term requirements
and could therefore be implemented. This deferred investments in a much more expensive and
more sophisticated IFMIS solution until a later date when the regulatory framework would be
more stable and business requirements clarified through on-going PFM reforms.
2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
16.    Quality at entry. The Bank team tried to incorporate into the project design important
lessons learned from an IEG review of a previous project- the Institution Building Technical
Assistance 2 Project (IBTA-2) which closed in 2005- and drew lessons learned. The key lessons
applied into the design of the PFMMP included: (i) proper sequencing of PFM reforms in line
with client capacity and internal demand; (ii) maintaining Government commitment and
ownership of reforms throughout project implementation; (iii) maintaining an effective
governance structure for implementing PFM reforms; and (iv) promoting PFM reforms through
budget support operations of the Bank and donors.
17.     In addition, an independent assessment of the capacities to undertake PFM reforms in
Tajikistan was conducted during the preparation of the project. The review recommended the
inclusion of capacity building as an integral part of all reform initiatives. It also concluded that
PFM reforms might have better chances of sustainability if they supported broader governance
improvements introduced by the Government, such as reform of the financing principles of
social services, decentralizing the authority for budget execution, conducting sector- wide wage
reforms, etc.
18.     Project design. The project was designed as a two-stage Adaptable Program Loan (APL)
operation, rather than as a traditional one-step sector investment loan based on lessons learned
from previous operations. Experience has shown that projects are more successful if finance
ministries undertake reforms related to budget process, treasury operations, accounting and
reporting before attempting automation. Implementation of these reforms can take a long time
and requires a lot of capacity building. Therefore, this project was designed in two stages,
whereby the implementation of complex IT solutions for the PFM system would be done at the
second stage. This would allow the Bank team to incorporate lessons learned from reforms
implemented during the first stage into the second stage. It would also provide more flexibility in
mobilizing financing as the functional and institutional requirements for automation would
become clearer once regulatory and business process reforms had been agreed.
19.    Another positive feature of the project design was the fact that it focused on sequencing
the reforms in line with the MoF’s low absorption capacity and taking into account
complementary activities undertaken by other donors. The project’s sought to build strong
foundations of the PFM system instead of implementing more advanced reforms. This entailed a
focus on budget formulation and execution systems. Concentrating the support on these core
PFM areas helped build strong technical capacity and strengthened the client’s ownership of the
reforms.



                                                 9
20.     Risk. The overall risk of the project in the PAD was assessed as Substantial. The project
team identified a number of risks to the achievement of the PDO: weakening of the client’s
commitment to the PFM reform agenda; weak implementation capacity due to insufficient skills,
staff turnover, and problems with attraction and retention of skilled specialists; weak donor
coordination; and corruption.
21.    The risk mitigation measures suggested by the project team were solid and their viability
was reconfirmed during the implementation stage. The measures concentrated on: building and
enhancing the MoF’s ownership of the reforms and the project; hiring external consultants to
help the MoF at the initial stages of the project and eventually integrating them in its structure;
improving donor coordination on PFM issues through regular meetings of the Donor
Coordination Council; and involving donors in project implementation. In addition, the risk of
corruption was mitigated by strengthening the capacities of the Administrative and Procurement
Support Team (APST) under the MoF to apply the Bank’s fiduciary guidelines and by publishing
as much information as possible about the project. As a result of these risk mitigation measures,
the key risks did not materialize and the overall project risk was downgraded from Substantial to
Moderate during the Mid-Term Review (MTR).
2.2.    Implementation
22.     Key ratings. The implementation of all project components proceeded well albeit at a
slow pace. The feasibility assessment of the SGB.NET information system took almost a year
and slowed down progress in overall project implementation and disbursement rate. Once a
decision had been taken to proceed with the SGB.NET option, implementation picked up.
However, project results could only be achieved when the SGB.NET system became operational.
As a result, the PDO and Implementation Progress (IP) ratings stayed at Moderately Satisfactory
and Moderately Unsatisfactory levels throughout most of the project’s lifetime. Both PDO and IP
ratings were upgraded to Satisfactory when budgeting and accounting reforms were applied in
the preparation of the 2015 budget and SGB.NET was approved for application in budget
execution.
23.      Mid-Term Review. A Mid-Term Review of the project was conducted in September
2012 and concluded that the MoF had made noticeable progress in implementing the project
activities. Specifically, progress was achieved with regard to: adoption of the Training Strategy,
the Treasury Modernization Plan, and the Public Sector Accounting Reform Strategy;
modernization of the ICT network; customization of the budget preparation module of the
SGB.NET information system; extension of the Treasury Single Account (TSA); and adoption of
the new GFS 2001 compliant Unified Chart of Accounts. the MTR identified problems with the
attainment of the following two intermediate indicators: Implementation of staff retention plan
and Organizational structure of MOF is streamlined and properly staffed. Nonetheless, the
MTR found that the PDO and key monitoring indicators could be achieved but delays in the
delivery of project outputs indicated that it was necessary to focus on keeping the project on
schedule.
24.     Restructuring. The project was restructured only once to extend the closing date with
seven months. The extension facilitated the attainment of the PDO and allowed for a smooth
transition towards the follow-up operation.
25.    Institutional changes. Changes in the top management of the MoF, including changing
of the Minister, occurred during the last year of the project. However, these changes did not

                                                10
affect negatively the project outcomes. On the contrary, the new Minister took key decisions
which helped the project achieve its outcomes and ensured its sustainability.
26.    The institutional changes supported by the project were transformative. At preparation,
the MoF relied on largely paper based systems, there was very limited IT capacity, accounting
and budgeting regulations were out dated and did not facilitate alignment of resources with
policy objectives. By project closing, the MoF had put in place a modern accounting and
budgeting system, automated core PFM functions through the implementation of a financial
management information system, MoF had a modern IT center, MoF and line agency technical
capacity had significantly improved and the institutional arrangements were in place for on-
going delivery of training.
2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
27.     M&E design. The results of the Government’s program were monitored through
performance indicators agreed during project negotiations and designed in consultations with the
MoF staff, donors and the Bank. On the whole, the results framework of the project was
adequate. It included PDO indicators which measured two of the aspects of the PDO: operational
efficiency and transparency. However, there was no PDO indicator on improving institutional
capacity: the indicators that did capture this aspect of the PDO were listed as an intermediate
outcome indicators. Furthermore, most of the indicators were qualitative in nature. Based on the
findings of the MTR, the indicators could have been revised to incorporate quantitative
measures, such as indicators from the Open Budget Index (OBI) and different quantitative
characteristics of the Treasury system (e.g. number of transactions per annum, number of system
users, number of connections, budgetary savings from better liquidity management). Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) indicators could have also helped track
improvements in the PFM system but they were available only for 2011 and the next PEFA
assessment was scheduled to be performed after the end of the project.
28.    M&E implementation. The Bank task team monitored project implementation progress
through semi-annual project supervision missions. The findings of these supervision missions
were shared with other donors. Progress toward achieving project outputs and outcomes, as well
as disbursement rates, were summarized in ISRs. An MTR to assess the progress towards
achieving the PDO and to review the status of APL2 triggers was conducted in September 2012,
although it was supposed to be completed by December 2011
29.     M&E utilization. Two key reports were used for monitoring and evaluation purposes by
the MOF, APST and the Bank: Quarterly Progress Reports on implementation progress were
prepared by Component Leaders and submitted to the Project Director; and an Annual Project
Report was prepared within the first quarter following the end of each fiscal year. The annual
report summarized the results accomplished against the planned performance indicators and
results commitments, as set out in the project Annual Work Plan. This report was endorsed by
the PFM Council and was circulated to a wider stakeholder group. The APST maintained special
monitoring tables, updated them on a monthly basis and used them for preparing the reports.
2.4.   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
30.     The Bank’s assessment of May 2012 found that C1 financial management (FM) system at
that time was not fully automated, fixed assets did not have tag numbers, an Interim unaudited
Financial Report (IFR) report was not generated from IC accounting software, and the

                                              11
calculation of exchange rates was incorrect. Therefore, at that stage of the project, the financial
management arrangements were assessed as Moderately Satisfactory. In order to address the low
ratings, the Bank and APST implemented measures to strengthen the client’s capacities for
financial management and build the systems needed for project implementation within the MoF.
As a result, the shortcomings identified by the Bank’s assessment were fixed and reported to the
Bank by the time of the MTR. Since then, the FM arrangements were maintained at a proper
level throughout the project’s lifetime and were rated Satisfactory. Quarterly financial
monitoring reports for the project were submitted on time and were accepted by the Bank.
Annual audit reports were submitted on time and were unqualified, no issues were raised by
auditors in the management letters.
31.     The project supported building of the MoF’s procurement capacity through the APST.
The project’s procurement specialist completed a training in procurement at the International
Labor Organization (ILO) in Turin and acquired experience in managing the procurement of
goods and consulting services in line with the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines. A procurement
review found that the procurement files were complete and in good order, while documents were
kept in separate bookshelves. The project Procurement Plans were updated and approved by the
Bank. The procurement process was in line with the agreed Procurement Plan, which was
published on the project’s public website (www.pfmmp.tj) and on the Bank’s external website.
All eight project implementation covenants had been complied with by the MTR, although with
some delays. Nonetheless, the MTR rated the project procurement arrangements as Moderately
Satisfactory due to delays in the procurement of several contracts. As the performance of the
procurement process improved this was upgraded to Satisfactory. Goods and services were
delivered in full amount and on time and there were no delays in payments. The APST was
selected to implement the follow- on operation which was a testimony of the high quality of its
work.
32.    The project did not trigger any social or environmental safeguards and thus was rated as
“C” for both.
2.5       Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
33.     Based on the achievements and lessons learned during the implementation of the
PFMMP, the Tajikistan Public Finance Management Modernization Project II (P150381,
implementation in June 2015- June 2021) was approved by the World Bank Board of Directors
on June 1, 2015 in the amount of ZDR7.2 million (about USD10 million). The project is
expected to be co-financed by the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) in
the amount of USD11 million. The development objective of the project is to improve the
effectiveness, control and accountability of public expenditure of the Republic of Tajikistan. The
project will fund the following four Components: “Public Finance Management Modernization”,
“Strengthening Public Procurement”, “Strengthening External Audit”, “Managing Public
Administration Reforms”.
3.        Assessment of Outcomes: PDO and Intermediate Results Indicators
3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
         Relevance of Objectives: High
34.   The relevance of the project objectives is rated as High at design and throughout project
implementation. PFMMP supported the Government’s Public Financial Management Strategy

                                                12
(2009-2018). The following medium- term priorities identified in the Strategy are relevant to the
project development goals: developing PFM capacities, expanding the coverage of medium-term
budget planning, automating PFM management. In addition, the project supported also
Tajikistan’s Public Administration Reform Strategy (2006), the National Development Strategy
(2007) and the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2007).
35.     The objectives of the project were also relevant to the Bank’s strategy for Tajikistan as
described in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2006-2009. The CPS identified the
improvement of governance and state capacity as a cross-cutting objective, underpinning the
development goals of improving the business environment, social services and the reliability of
energy services. To facilitate governance improvements, the CPS envisaged the provision of
technical assistance to public sector reforms and treasury operations. The Bank’s subsequent
strategies for Tajikistan, namely the CPS 2010-2013 and the CPS 2015-2018 both highlight
governance and in particular PFM reforms as one of the cross-cutting themes in support of other
broad areas of engagement or pillars. In particular, the priorities in the area of public sector and
PFM reform in the current CPS are to continue the work on budget transparency and
accountability through the PFM investment project (APL2), which was preceded by the PFMPP
(APL1). The CPS notes that the APL1 helped create preconditions for the implementation of the
FMIS and has supported the reengineering of business processes and reforms of the institutional
structure of the MoF.
      Relevance of Design: Substantial
36.     The project components and activities are consistent with the stated objectives. The
decision to design the project as a two-phase APL operation — rather than a traditional one-step
sector investment loan — reflected lessons learned from past projects, in particular those related
to the need to accompany PFM reform efforts with capacity building. The two-phased design
allowed the Bank to lay the foundations of the FMIS and simultaneously build the capacities
needed system implementation. The activities that supported the establishment of basic processes
for more efficient PFM included the technical assistance on: the Law on Public Finance and its
supporting regulations; improvements in budget circulars and business processes; upgrading the
budget classification and Chart of Accounts; improvements in Treasury management; publication
of budget documents and reports on the website.
37.      In terms of capacity building, the project helped develop adequate institutional capacity
to support the implementation of an automated FMIS through technical assistance on improving
the organizational structure of the MoF, training of 90% of the relevant staff on the new PFM
procedures, establishing the MoF’s IT Center equipped with a modern Data Center and staffing it
with employees hired at competitive salaries. Other relevant activities aimed at building
institutional capacity included technical assistance on customizing some of the modules of
SGB.NET to the needs of the Government, development of proper manuals for business
processes and upgrading of the ICT infrastructure.
38.     The phased approach also allowed for learning lessons from the reforms conducted
during APL1 and taking them into account in the design of APL2. The APL provides more
flexibility in terms of mobilizing financing, given that the design is more specific and the
financial commitment does not have to be locked up during a long preparation period. The two-
stage allowed APL1 to concentrate on a narrowly defined set of reforms related to budget
formulation and execution. APL1’s focus on core areas of the budget management cycle

                                                13
accompanied by capacity building was a prerequisite for the successful implementation of FMIS
through APL2. Last but not least, concentrating the support on core PFM areas helped build
strong technical capacity and Government ownership.
39.    In sum, the solid results achieved by the project, the high level of ownership
demonstrated by the Government and the MOF, the flexibility of the project design, which
allowed the incorporation of SGB.Net into the PFM system as an interim solution, the effective
role of the APST and the successful preparation and approval of the follow- on operation
(APL2), demonstrated the validity and relevance of the project design.
         Relevance of Implementation: Substantial
40.      Project activities remained relevant throughout implementation. Although there were
some delays in project implementation, eventually all key activities were completed and the
project was almost fully disbursed at closing. The APST was very efficient in communicating to
the MOF and the Government, as well as in implementing the Bank’s fiduciary requirements, so
that even difficult contracts were signed and executed by the project’s closing date. In addition,
the flexibility demonstrated when opting for an alternative solution rather than an off-the-shelve
one, showed that the project was able to adapt to changing circumstances and respond to the
client’s needs.
3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives
41.     The PDO of the project is clearly defined and activities under each component are closely
linked to the achievement of each objective. Progress against the four elements of the PDO –
efficient and transparent management of public finances, and institutional capacity for the
implementation and sustained functioning of an automated FMIS – are reviewed in turn below,
drawing on information from project supervision and monitoring reports, the Project Completion
Report prepared by the MoF, reports of consultants and third party sources (PEFA assessments
and data from the Open Budget Index).
42.     Objective 1. Objective 1 (to establish basic processes for efficient management of public
expenditures) is achieved and is rated Substantial. Both of the PDO indicators measuring this
aspect of the PDO were fully achieved albeit with some delays (see below). With the support of
the project, Tajikistan made significant progress in streamlining its budget process. This was
achieved by adopting the Law on Public Finance in 2011, which laid the foundations for an
improved budget process, as well as by developing and implementing a large number of
instructions related to budget preparation and execution at the central and local levels. Business
procedures defining the interactions between the MoF and the Ministry of Economy regarding
the investment budget were also updated and a regulation on budgetary hearings was developed.
Furthermore, the project developed guidelines and model calculations for the formulation of the
baseline budget by local authorities. The Project supported also program budgeting, the
development of draft strategic budget plans and produced methodological instructions on how to
determine the ceilings of the central budget by sectors and ministries/agencies. The Budget
Circulars for 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 are based on the new business process and the budget
reflects the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and macro-fiscal forecasts.
However, while these forecasts proved a reliable basis for budget preparation during the project
period when Tajikistan realized steady economic growth, subsequently, as Tajikistan has
experienced a recession, the forecasts have proved overambitious. This is an area where further
work is needed at a policy level.

                                               14
43.     PDO Indicator 1 and Intermediate Indicator 3. PDO Indicator 1 (The MoF and budget
organizations practice streamlined business processes for budget preparation and execution)
and Intermediate Indicator 3 (Budget preparation cycle is improved and integrates MTEF as a
regular budget cycle phase) are fully achieved. The improvements in the way the budget process
in Tajikistan works today are clearly visible- in the latest Budget Circulars for 2014-2016 and
2015-2017, the MoF prescribed specific templates and business process steps which are now
used as the basis for budget formulation with a three year indicative expenditure plan. The
budget also reflects the MTEF and macro-fiscal forecasts.
44.     PDO Indicator 2 and Intermediate Indicator 4. PDO Indicator 2 (The budget is
prepared and executed based on an upgraded budget classification which is integrated with the
chart of accounts) and intermediate indicator 4 (Budget classification (BC) and chart of accounts
(COA) are integrated and brought in line with international standards) have been fully achieved.
The project supported the development and approval of a public sector accounting reform
strategy, as well as the development of a new budget classification in line with GFS 2001 and a
manual for its use. The MoF adopted the new budget classification in June 2012 and its
implementation was scheduled for 2013, but due to delays in the implementation of the training
program and the development of the customized IT solution, the new budget classification was
implemented only with the 2014 budget. Furthermore, thanks to the project, the first eight
national public sector accounting standards based on IPSAS were introduced in 2014. A unified
Chart of Accounts, integrated with the budget classification and supporting the IPSAS was
approved as well, together with instructions for its application.
45.     Intermediate Indicator 5. Intermediate Indicator 5 (Procedures for budget execution
through the treasury system are improved) is fully achieved. The project made significant
improvements into the treasury system. In particular, a five-year strategic plan for the
development of the treasury system was developed and approved as well as a new structure of
the Main Department of the Central Treasury of the MoF. New Treasury instructions on budget
execution that included new features for cash and liability management were also prepared. A
central level (Republican) budget Treasury Single Account (TSA) was created and there was a
gradual transition of all 73 local finance offices to the Treasury. The TSA system now covers all
Republican budget transactions. The budget is executed via the new automated budget execution
module of the Tajikistan Financial Management Information System (TFMIS), in line with the
new manuals. The TFMIS is based on the Turkish SGB.NET system but was customized to fit
the conditions in Tajikistan implementing first the budget preparation, execution, and accounting
modules.
46.     Additional indicator: PEFA. The 2012 PEFA Assessment, funded by DFID and SECO,
provides additional evidence that Objective 1 was achieved: in comparison to 2007, Tajikistan
improved its scores on the following three indicators: PI-5 Classification of the budget (from D
to B), PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of accounts reconciliation (from B to B+), PI-25 Quality
and timeliness of annual financial statements (from D+ to C+). PEFA ratings would be
significantly higher if they were based on the results achieved by 2015.
47.    Objective 2, PDO Indicator 3 and Additional indicator. Objective 2 (to establish basic
processes for transparent management of public expenditures) was achieved and is rated
Substantial. Budget submissions to the Parliament, the Budget Law and amendments, as well as
budget execution reports are published regularly on the MoF website (www.moliya.tj).
Therefore, PDO Indicator 3 (Budget submission to Parliament, the Budget Law and amendments,

                                               15
and Quarterly and Annual budget execution reports are published on the MoF's web-page by
YR4) was fully achieved. An additional indicator, which is supporting the rating is the increase of
Tajikistan’s score on the OBI from 17 in 2012 to 25 in 2015. The OBI report mentions that since
2012 the Government of Tajikistan has increased the availability of budget information to the
public by publishing the Executive’s budget proposal, the pre-budget statement and a citizens’
budget. In addition, Tajikistan’s score on the PEFA indicator PI-10 Public access to key fiscal
information improved from D in 2007 to C in 2012.
48.      Objective 3 and Intermediate Indicator 7. Objective 3 (to develop adequate
institutional capacity to support the implementation and sustained functioning of an automated
financial management information system (FMIS)), is achieved and is rated Substantial. With
assistance of the project, the MoF was able to improve the institutional capacity to implement the
Tajikistan FMIS. In order to support the implementation of the TFMIS, the MoF established a
PFM Council, which represented the strategic decision-making level and was supported by
international and local advisors. The PFM Council was chaired by the Minister of Finance and
oversaw the implementation of the PFM Strategy. The Council decided on the nature, sequence
and format of the technical assistance needed to support PFM reforms. In 2011, international
consultants assisted the Council in assessing the SGB.net suitability for the MOF’s needs. In
2012, based on the recommendations of the report, the MoF decided to adapt and adopt
SGB.NET. Consequently, a Project Initiation Document (PID) for the implementation of
SGB.Net was developed to define the scope of the automation and confirm project management
structure and arrangements. In order to customize and implement SGB.Net, twelve IT specialists
were hired, most of whom were retained at the IT Center after the project completion. The IT
Center1 was established in 2012 to support first the reforms of the Treasury and later on to
facilitate SGB.NET customization and implementation. Therefore, intermediate indicator 7
(MoF's IT Center established, adequate number of specialists recruited and trained) was fully
achieved (see also the paragraphs below for additional information on this indicator).
49.    FMIS implementation. In 2011, during the initial stages of APL1 implementation, when
the project was assisting the MoF in upgrading the existing budget preparation and budget
execution (TFMIS v2) modules, the MoF informed the Bank that it had signed a Protocol2 with
the Turkish MoF to adapt the Turkish SGB.NET application software for the budget preparation,
execution, accounting and reporting needs of Tajikistan. The SGB.NET solution was offered free
of charge and the Turkish MoF had agreed to provide technical assistance to customize the
proposed software to the needs of the MoF in Tajikistan. The Bank team initiated a review3 of
the SGB.NET software before implementation. The review recommended proceeding with the
deployment of SGB.NET and the development of additional modules (e.g. TSA sub-accounts
and accounts payable) in the medium term. The report also indicated that there would likely be a
requirement to move to a COTS product in the late medium term. Based on the positive
conclusion of the review, the MoF decided to implement SGB.NET and the project
implementation plan was accordingly revised. As a result, thanks to the thorough review of
SGB.NET, the sustained commitment of the Borrower, the flexibility of all stakeholders and the
availability of local IT experts, the MoF was able to implement the FMIS already within the
APL1.

50.     The initial functionality of the SGB.NET software included eight modules4, while based
on its business needs, the MoF decided to implement only the following three modules: Medium
Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF); Budget Preparation and Execution; Access Control. All
modules were developed by the end of the project in line with the initial project implementation
plan. In line with the Protocol between the MoF and the National Bank of Tajikistan signed in
2006, the MoF became a participant in the banking system of Tajikistan, as the TFMIS was
connected to the banking system. In 2014, SGB.Net was assessed as to whether it was suitable as
an alternative solution to purchasing a COTS FMIS. The result of the analysis was positive, with
some provisos5, and concluded that only two core modules required development in the medium
to longer term in order to meet the standards of the COTS systems for fragile states with low
capacity. These modules were Cash Management/Planning and Accounts Payable.
51.     Intermediate Indicator 1. Intermediate indicator 1 (Improved capacity of the MoF to
manage reforms) is fully achieved. The new MoF and Treasury organizational structures
approved by the Government enhanced the effectiveness of the Ministry’s management which
supported changes in different PFM reform areas, including a PFM Council and a Secretariat
which was headed by a Deputy Minister- Project Director. The new structure of the MoF was
approved in April 2015, after the end of the project6 and has not been reviewed. MoF is properly
staffed and adequate management skills developed. In line with the project design, the MoF
approved its Human Resources Management (HRM) Strategy and created a new HRM
Department. A course on HRM and leadership in PFM was developed and followed by the
employees of the newly created department and its subordinate organizations. In addition, the
staff of the HR Department were trained to work with the first version of the HRM information
system.
52.     Intermediate Indicator 2. Intermediate indicator 2 (Sustainable training capacity is
developed and core staff in financial departments are trained in PFM procedures) is fully
achieved. The project supported the development of a training strategy for staff working in the
area of PFM. During the implementation of this strategy more than 9,000 staff from the MoF,
line ministries and agencies, the Chamber of Accounts, budget organizations and other
organizations, were trained. This represents 90 percent of all staff working on PFM issues in
Tajikistan. This was achieved through a complete upgrade of the Training Center within the
MoF, which included redesign of its physical infrastructure, development of specialized learning
modules on the new budget procedures, training of trainers, repair of existing facilities,
installation of furniture and modern equipment and an uninterrupted power supply. Following
this upgrade, the Training Center was able to provide continuous education for all staff working
in the area of PFM. A new plan for development of the Training Centre has been recently
approved and additional (substantial) budgetary allocations were provided in the 2015 central

  The modules: Strategic Plan; Performance‐Based Budgeting Management; Analytical Budget Preparation;
Analytical Budget Execution; Expenditure Management and Processes (Receivables Follow ‐up); Ex‐Ante Financial
Control (Movables); Final Account; Personnel (Library, Accounting)
5
  The conditions included recruitment of system development staff, creation of PIU to support implementation of
SGB.NET, introduction of project management methodologies (PMM), and recruitment of an international project
manager to provide advice.

  MoF’s new more streamlined organizational structure was enacted in April 2015 (Government Resolution #187
dated April 2, 2015).

budget for the Centre. A first version of the Center’s website was developed as well and it
currently available within the local network of the MoF.
53.      Objective 4, PDO Indicator 4 and Intermediate Indicator 6. Objective 4 (to develop
adequate institutional capacity to support the implementation and sustained functioning of an
automated financial management information system (FMIS)), was achieved and is rated
Substantial. The MoF established an IT Center to ensure the proper functioning of the TFMIS.
Twelve IT specialists were hired and trained at the central level and seventeen IT specialists
were trained to assist with the maintenance of the information systems at the local level. In order
to retain qualified staff, starting in April 2015, the MoF has provided competitive salaries to the
staff of the IT Center. The MoF’s ICT infrastructure was enhanced through the purchasing and
installing of modern network and data equipment. A modern Data Processing Center was
constructed, equipped, and became fully functional at the MoF premises. PDO indicator 4 (The
MOF has adequate technical capacity to implement redesigned procedures and manage existing
applications, support users and sustain IT systems) and intermediate indicator 6 (Central and
local ICT systems modernized in YR3) are fully achieved.
3.3      Efficiency: High
54.      Implementation of the project was efficient. The return on investment for the project is 41
percent, even under conservative assumptions. The net present value of economic benefits is
US$ 5.2 million using a discount rate of 12 percent. It declines to US$ 2.6 million if the discount
rate is 20 percent. This high rate of return was achieved through the implementation of the FMIS,
which added a high value to the country’s PFM system. Rolling out the TSA to all local
governments and implementing the different FMIS modules, including accounting, generated
substantial savings from eliminating transaction fee payments, earning interest on idle cash
balances and eliminating the need to purchase accounting software for 90 percent of the
country’s budget organizations. The estimated annual saving form non-payment of transaction
fees and interest earned on depositing idle cash balances is Somoni 8.2 million or $1.2 million in
2015. This saving will accrue annually prorated for inflation and growth by 1 percent. Annex 5
provides the full economic and financial analysis, including the assumptions used.
3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
55.     The overall outcome rating of Satisfactory is based on the individual ratings for
relevance, efficacy and efficiency as showed in Table 1. All ratings were either Substantial or
higher, with High ratings for relevance of objectives and efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
      (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender aspects, and Social Development



                                                      18
56.     There was no direct poverty, gender and social development impact on the population.
Indirectly the whole population of the country, both poor and rich and men and women benefited
from the strengthened budget process, improved budget data, improved PFM and the improved
expenditure and liquidity management by the Treasury. The project has facilitated the
implementation of a more progressive fiscal policy. The share of spending on social policies in
total public expenditures went up from 31 percent in 2007 to over 48 percent in 2014. This was
mainly due to material increases in pensions and salaries in the public sector. The social
protection sector by far is the largest recipient of budgetary funds, with 22 percent of total
expenditures in 2014, followed by education with 18 percent.
      (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
57.     The PFMMP, as an institutional building project, facilitated the deepening of institutional
reforms through improvements in the legal and normative framework. It improved the business
processes for the PFM system both at the central and the sub-national level. It led to the
restructuring of the Ministry of Finance and the Treasury, which optimized their resources, and
created a modern Data Center within the MoF connecting all local finance
departments/treasuries.
      (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
58.    The project created positive externalities for the government and the MOF of the Kyrgyz
Republic, where the authorities are implementing similar reforms in the PFM area and are
looking at the option to implement the SBG.NET system as a next step in improving their FMIS.
In May 2015, the Bank organized a study tour for a delegation from the Kyrgyz MOF to
Dushanbe to look at the advantages and disadvantages of SGB.NET in Tajikistan.
3.6      Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
59.      No beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshops were conducted during the preparation
of this report.
4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes
Rating: Negligible to Low
60.     The risks to development outcomes are negligible or low because the likelihood of
changes occurring that may be detrimental to the achievement of the project’s development
outcome is very low. The project laid the foundations for a modern PFM system in Tajikistan
which will be further enhanced by the follow-on operation APL2. APL1 introduced a
qualitatively new framework for PFM in Tajikistan. It improved the physical infrastructure and
built adequate human capacity in the PFM and Treasury systems of the country. In addition,
numerous legal and normative acts, as well as instructions/procedures in the PFM area were
adopted and implemented. Officials and staff of line ministries and local governments received
training on PFM issues. The Government and key stakeholders across the administration
demonstrate strong commitment and ownership of the system and institutional improvements
supported by the project in discussions during the PFM Council. The one risk that the ICR team
highlights is the critical role played by the Project Coordinator who has played an important
leadership, managerial and technical role in project implementation and now leads the IT Center.
This individual would be difficult to replace.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1      Bank Performance
      (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Satisfactory
61.      The Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is Satisfactory. During the
identification, preparation, and appraisal stages of the project, the Bank team studied carefully
lessons learned from previous operations in Tajikistan and from other FMIS related projects
implemented in Eastern and Central European countries. In addition, a special study of the
feasibility and sequence of PFM reforms in Tajikistan was conducted. This informed the design
of the project as a two- stage APL with a strong focus on capacity building activities in all
project components and a narrow focus on specific PFM reforms. Project risks were
appropriately identified and mitigation measures envisaged in the project design. The project was
consistent with the CPS, Government’s, the MoF’s and donors’ priorities at the time of
preparation. Nonetheless, in retrospect, the team could have incorporated in the project design
activities dedicated to exploring the availability of free FMIS systems developed by other
donors. In addition, the Results Framework of the project could have been strengthened through
the use of quantitative indicators, using methodologies similar to the PEFA and Open Budget
Index scoring.
      (b) Quality of Supervision: Satisfactory
62.     The Bank’s performance at the implementation stage was Satisfactory. The project had
sufficient funds and staff dedicated to supervision. Supervision costs were kept low by
combining missions across on-going PFM projects in Tajikistan, combining with missions to
PFM projects in Kyrgyz Republic and making extensive use of staff in the field. The team was in
full compliance with the Bank supervision rules: it conducted regular semi-annual missions;
prepared regular aide memoires and ISRs; conducted special reviews of the procurement and
financial management arrangements; and conducted an in depth MTR, which identified the
project’s successes and critical issues for improvement; and conducted an ICR mission in May
2015. The project’s ISR ratings were realistic and reflected slow but consistent progress in
project implementation and achievement of project development outcomes, which was reflected
in the gradual increase from Moderately Unsatisfactory and Moderately Satisfactory to
Satisfactory ratings at the end of the project. The Bank’s financial management and procurement
staff invested a lot of effort in increasing the APST’s capacity, as well as in monitoring and
suggesting corrective actions. The project benefitted also from the transfer of TTL-ship from
headquarters to the Bank’s local office in Dushanbe in April 2011. This reinforced the successful
collaboration between the Bank, the MoF and donors. During the ICR mission, both the MoF and
donors showed high respect for the TTL of the project and specifically for his achievements,
drive for results, technical skills, and constructive communication style. Finally, with the
decision to adopt SGB.NET as an interim solution, the Bank team showed flexibility and a
rational approach to project implementation.
      (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Satisfactory
63.    Based on Bank’s performance during project identification, preparation, appraisal, and
supervision discussed above, the overall Bank’s performance is rated Satisfactory.
5.2      Borrower Performance
      (a) Government Performance: Satisfactory
                                                 20
64.     The Finance Minister, Deputy Ministers, and Project Coordinators demonstrated strong
ownership and commitment to reforms throughout. Furthermore, the Ministry made effective use
of the technical assistance provided by the project. MoF took the initiative in proposing the
Turkish SGB.NET information system but awaited the results of an independent assessment
before proceeding to develop the budget preparation and budget execution modules through local
IT specialists. MoF was receptive to fundamental reforms in its working practices and internal
organization. A new Budget classification was developed in line with Government Finance
Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001. The Treasury was reorganized and a Unified Chart of Accounts
was developed. A TSA was established and budget execution data were published regularly on
the MoF’s website. An IT Center equipped with modern equipment and staffed with qualified
staff was established. A competitive salary scale for the staff of the IT Center was established in
order to attract and retain the staff. The Training Center was transferred to the Finance and
Economics Institute of Tajikistan which is also under the MoF.
65.      There were some changes in the initial project plan and some implementation delays.
First, there were delays in fulfilling the effectiveness conditions of the project due to delays in
approving the Staff Retention Plan. Second, the MoF changed its initial plans with regard to the
automation of the FMIS. Instead of developing a customized IT system for budget preparation
and execution, the MoF decided to adopt an off-the-shelf solution, SGB.NET, with more limited
customization. Third, there were delays in adapting the HRM Strategy, implementing the Unified
Court of Account and reorganizing the MoF structure, which took place only after the closing of
the project. Notwithstanding these delays, the Ministry made steady progress and completed all
major outputs before project closing.
     (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Satisfactory
66.     The M&E and fiduciary arrangements performed by the APST, located within the MOF,
were adequate and provided solid support for the successful implementation of the project.
FMRs were delivered on time and deemed satisfactory by the Bank. APST regularly updated
and followed its procurement plans. The Training Center, IT Center, Central Treasury and the
Accounting Methodology Department were all actively involved into day-to day project
implementation. MoF effectively coordinated across the various institutions, ensured a shared
vision for reforms and addressed implementation challenges through the PFM Council.
     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Satisfactory
67.     In view of the performance ratings of the Government and the implementing agency, the
overall Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory.
6.      Lessons Learned
68.     Realism in the project’s objectives and the reform trajectory allowed the authorities
to implement reforms at their own pace and thereby ensured their ownership and
commitment to results. The authorities came under pressure from a number of external
stakeholders to adopt a more ambitious reform agenda and timetable, including proposals to
accelerate the adoption of medium-term expenditure planning, performance budgeting,
international accounting standards and the implementation of a state of the art financial
management information system. The Bank project team argued against initiatives that they
considered too ambitious given the political context and institutional capacity in Tajikistan.
Some external partners, under pressure themselves to create an institutional framework for sector

                                                21
budget support operations, advocated a more accelerated approach. The PFM Council proved
successful as a forum for resolving differing perspectives and ensuring that partners respected a
common on the PFM reform agenda. In addition, the Donor Coordination Council, which holds
regular meetings of donors involved in PFM reform, provided an effective platform for
coordination and harmonization of donors’ activities. The long-term commitment to PFM
reforms on the part of Government and the key development partners enabled all parties to build
trust and take a more strategic perspective on PFM reforms, rather than focusing on short-term
deliverables.
69.    Active participation of MoF management structures in project implementation
ensured that works plans were realistic and were followed up by the appropriate
government officials. Availability of client’s dedicated team of reformers is important for the
success of project implementation. PFM reforms and the project enjoyed the vigorous support
and commitment from two Ministers of Finance, Deputy Ministers, many department heads and
Treasury top managers, program coordinators and APST staff.
70.     Attention needs to be paid to the role of center of government institutions in the
implementation of PFM reforms. Some institutional decisions beyond the control of the MoF
were delayed due to the centralized nature of the decision making process in the country. The
involvement of the Presidential Administration at all stages of project preparation and
implementation could have helped ensure more timely decision making and facilitated
collaboration with other Government agencies. The Presidential Administration will play a
particularly important role in the next phase of reforms when systems are rolled out across
Government. The new PFMMP II project provides for creation of the Steering Committee led by
a senior official from the Presidential Administration, who is expected to coordinate activities of
different project stake-holders involved in project implementation.
71.     The availability of high quality project management and technical expertise helped
the team to adjust international best practices to the country context. The project provided
the Government with excellent international consultants - both individuals and firms- who
worked closely with Government officials, Bank staff and other donor partners. The Bank
provided diverse and experienced team to support preparation and supervision, while the
transition of the TTL function to the field reinforced the good relations with the client and
strengthened project supervision. International expertise helped ensure that reforms are
consistent with international standards whilst at the same time the seniority of the staff involved
gave them the confidence and authority to advocate for a realistic pace of implementation.
72.     Informed flexibility during project implementation can contribute to positive
development outcomes. The adoption of SGB.NET, which was not foreseen at the design stage,
was critical to the project’s success. This represented a significant change in the project design.
The proposal originated from MoF. While there were some concerns on the part of the Bank
team regarding the functionality of the SGB.NET and the likely impact of adoption on the
longer-term objective of establishing an integrated FMIS, the team supported an independent
assessment and reviewed the results in consultation with Government. Based on this assessment
and respecting the MoF’s preference, the Bank team agreed to support the implementation of
SGB.NET as an interim solution. This allowed the authorities to put in place a reasonably robust
financial management system in place quickly and at very low cost.

      Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and Comments on Draft ICR
The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan has outlined a number of important initiatives
aimed at a better adjusting the public expenses in line with the priorities of the country’s social
and economic policy, as well as improving the efficiency of public expenses. The Public
Administration Reform Strategy adopted in 2006 supports reforms in the area of public financial
management (PFM), including ensuring: (i) greater coordination of budget and economic policy;
(ii) greater consistency in the distribution of responsibilities on PFM (with a view of closer
integration of the investment planning and budgeting process, along with the overall
responsibility for the binding of strategies and programs to the budget process assigned to the
Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan); (iii) higher efficiency of financial decision-
making procedures in the ministries; (iv) reforming the system of internal control and audit; (v)
greater efficiency of public procurement; and (vi) optimization of the mechanisms for allocating
budgetary receipts among the levels of state apparatus.
In order to continue the implementation of the mentioned initiatives, the Public Financial
Management (PFM) Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan was approved by the Decree of the
President of the Republic of Tajikistan dated March 20, 2009, No. 639.
To support the implementation of the Public Financial Management Strategy of the Republic of
Tajikistan, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan has addressed to the International
Development Association (IDA) a request for the allocation of a grant to support the Tajikistan
Public Financial Management Reform.
IDA approved this request and a Financing Agreement for a grant allocation in the amount
equivalent to 3.4 million SDR was signed on May 27, 2009 between the Republic of Tajikistan
and IDA, for the implementation of the Public Financial Management Modernization Project
(PFMMP). The aim of the project was to maintain the implementation of Tajikistan Public
Financial Management Strategy. In addition to the Financing Agreement on the Public Financial
Management Modernization Project, two additional grant agreements were signed for co-
financing of the project: (1) A Multi-Donor Trust Fund (EC and DFID) was signed on February
9, 2010 in the amount of USD 4697 885.50 and (2) A Grant of the Japan Government (PHRD)
was signed on August 21, 2009 in the amount of USD 971 821.00.
The Public Financial Management Modernization Project in Tajikistan became effective on
February 12, 2010 and the Project closing date was August 31, 2014.
On February 13, 2014 the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan addressed to IDA a
request for project extension until April 1, 2015. This request was approved by IDA and the
project closing date was extended to March 31, 2015.
The purpose of the PFMMP is to support 1) some of the key PFM reforms, as defined in the
PFM Strategy developed by the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan and 2) the capacity
building in the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan (MoF RT) and the relevant
departments. The project considers the additional reforms that are being implemented currently.
Two-staged APL was chosen as the implementation approach of PFMMP. APL1 was aimed at
addressing the capacity gaps, ensuring the modernization of the procedures for the preparation
and execution of the budget, improving transparency and cooperation, as well as supporting the
additional automation of financial transactions in the MoF RT, along with capacity building in
the field of information technology (IT). APL2 will build on the results of the reforms

                                                37
implemented under APL1 and will support the automation of the upgraded public financial
management processes.
The MoF RT was designated as the Project Executing Agency. To overcome the complexity of
the management of the different activities, lead employees of the MoF RT were officially
appointed to lead the main activities:
    a. Capacity building activities. The Deputy Minister of Finance of the Republic of
       Tajikistan was appointed to lead these activities;
    b. Activities on improvement of the budget planning processes. The Head of the Main
       Department of the State Budget of the MoF RT was appointed to lead these activities;
    c. Activities on improvement of the budget execution processes. The first Deputy Director of
       the Main Department of the Central Treasury of MoF RT was appointed to lead these
       activities;
    d. Activities on accounting reform. The Head of the Department of Accounting and Audit
       Methodology of MoF RT was appointed to lead these activities;
The Deputy Minister of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan was appointed as the Director of
the Public Financial Management Modernization Project. Deputy Minister of Finance became
also the Head of the PFM Coordination Council Secretariat.
Extraneous factors caused some delays in the implementation of the project, including:
   a. Discussing and agreeing on TORs for the different contracts with all donors (WB, EC,
      DFID, SECO) took much longer than expected;
   b. The Bank’s procurement procedures took longer than expected as well;
   c. There was delay with establishing a trust fund account for SECO funding for the
      Accounting Reform Project.
   d. The first tender procedure for the modernization of the MoF’s ICT infrastructure was
      cancelled due to the lack of a sufficient number of bids and had to be retendered.
The project achieved the following results:
As part of the support of the PFM Coordination Council, the following activities were carried
out:
   a. First meeting of the Public Finance Management Coordinating Council. Adoption of the
      Regulations of public finance management Coordinating Council Secretariat and
      adoption of a three-year public finance management Implementation Strategy Plan for the
      years 2009-2011.
   b. Second meeting of the Public Finance Management Coordinating Council and adoption
      of updated three-year public finance management Implementation Strategy Plan for the
      years 2012-2014.
