3.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Cash basis of accounting

     Special purpose project financial statements are prepared on a cash basis of accounting. The cash basis of
     accounting recognizes transactions and events only when cash (including cash equivalents) is received or
     paid by the entity. Special purpose project financial statements prepared under the cash basis provide
     readers with information about the sources of cash raised during the period, the purposes for which cash
     was used and the cash balances at the reporting date. The measurement focus in the special purpose
     project financial statements is balances of cash and changes therein.

     Foreign currency

     Operations in foreign currency initially are counted in functional currency by the official currency
     exchange rate settled by the National Bank of Tajikistan (the “NBT”) on a date of operation.

     Funds received are translated into USD at official exchange rate of Special Drawing Rights (the “SDR”) at
     the date of funds receipt. All payments made in local currency are translated into USD at the official
     exchange rate defined by National Bank of Tajikistan, at the date of transaction.

     Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currency are converted to functional currency at
     official exchange rate on a date settled by the NBT.

     All foreign exchange differences resulted from maturity or recounting are included in statement of cash
     proceeds and disbursements.

     Non-monetary items are valued according to their historic cost in foreign currency, which are
     recalculated on rates of the initial operation date.

     In preparation of the special purpose project financial statements the following exchange rates of NBT in
     regard to Tajik somoni were used:
