Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 There is a high commitment to and ownership of reforms by MoF, which gives hope that all key project development objectives will be achieved. Top
 MoF management is actively involved in reform implementation. Activity leaders are in charge of reform implementation in their specific areas and
 regularly report on reform progress to the MoF top management. Several working groups are established in MoF, which are well coordinated by MoF
 and project management.
 Due to a delay in approval of a new organizational structure of MoF by the Government, the progress in reorganization of HR Department and the
 Training Center has been slow. A new organizational structure of MoF, which will be soon submitted to the Government for approval, provides for both
 mechanisms for effective integration of HR management and training and improved management structures of the HR Department and the Training
 Center.
 After implementing a new organizational structure of the Treasury, MoF has finalized new treasury legislation. With the help of an IMF Advisor, MoF is
 finalizing methodologies on commitment control and cash management. It is expected that all legislation, except for the Law on Treasury which has
 longer procedures for adoption, will be adopted by the end of 2014. More than 600 treasury workers throughout the country received training on the new
 TFMIS information system. By order of the Minister, the Treasury staff and staff of budget organizations are jointly testing a new budget execution
 module, which will finish by December 27, 2015. After summarizing testing results, the system will be implemented from January 1, 2015.
 There has been noticeable progress towards the objective of a treasury single account since the last supervision mission in May 2014. MoF has
 brought 8 more local treasury accounts to the TSA increasing the total number of accounts to 14. It is expected that all remaining 59 local treasury
 accounts will be brought into the TSA by the end of 2014. The account of the Social Protection Fund in the TSA will be opened in 2016.
 TFMIS is available for utilization throughout Tajikistan but is still in pilot mode until January 1, 2015. For the 2014 and 2015 budgets, the TFMIS budget
 preparation module has exclusively produced the budget amounts. By January 2015 the budget execution module will be used for both the Republican
 budget and all local budgets. The IT team remains adamant that the system has now been fully tested and is ready for production status on January 1,
 2015.
 Secure access to the TFMIS system and appropriate in-flight encryption are in place. Secure access to the system is in place with the deployment of
 security tokens and certificates for approximately 80 units. The certificate administration is in place with the State Security organization and training in
 the use of the certificates and tokens is taking place in December for the units that will be on-line in January.
 Computing and Network capacity appear to be adequate to meet the demand for the system through the first quarter of 2015 based upon the results of
 the piloting that has been done using production data. However, after March 2015 if the new Data Centre is not operational there will be a lack of server
 capacity that will invoke a contingency strategy that is being developed (i.e.: a co-location of TFMIS servers in another building is the likely
 contingency).
 The Data Center will likely not be fully operational until late March 2015 due to construction delays in specifying the structure to support the air
 conditioners. This is delaying the fit-up of the data center. The IT team believes that the decision about how the structure will be constructed will be
 made by the Minister of Finance this month. The data center facilities can then proceed with a timely deployment of its fit-up and installation of server
 and network equipment and should result in the center being fully operational by March 2015. The IT team confirms that there is sufficient computing
 and network capacity on hand to run the TFMIS applications until the end of March 2015 although use of this contingency facility will likely result in
 impact on processing times experienced by the users. A suggestion to allow users extended time (i.e.: beyond normal working hours) was proposed as
 one way to lessen the impact of the limited computing resources.
 MoF has included funding for the new IT Center and its associated IT team in the 2015 budget but staff remuneration remains an issue. Work is being
 done by the IT Center staff to support the proposed salary package through reference to competitive market rates. Resolution of this issue will allow for
 the current project IT staff to be transferred to the Center in 2015 but absence of resolution and the potential inability to hire appropriate IT staff could
 put the entire TFMIS at risk.
