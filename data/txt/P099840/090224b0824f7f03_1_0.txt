                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The MoF has conducted substantial preparatory work on capacity building, IT development and institutional change to implement a new TFMIS. This preparatory work included
                         reorganization of treasury and developing new legislation, implementing a UCOA, modernizing ICT infrastructure, and progress in developing adequate HR capacities to support
                         reform implementation. The Treasury Modernization Program, Public Sector Accounting Reform Strategy, HR Reform Strategy, and Training Strategy have been adopted, advancing
                         key PFM reform priorities. All local financial departments have been connected to Headquarters through a common network. The IT Center has been established and staffed. In
                         addition, a group of IT specialists, who provide services to local offices, were trained and deployed in the field. MoF has completed training of local financial departments and budget

                         organizations on the new budget preparation and execution modules. All data for Budget 2014 were introduced into the new TFMIS budget preparation module.
                         MoF introduced a new UCOA from January 1, 2014. MoF approved a new UCOA in June 2012, which was expected to be introduced from January 1, 2013. However, due to the
                         delays with both an adequate IT program to support the UCOA and providing training for MoF staff on the new UCOA, the introduction of the UCOA was postponed till January 1,
                         2014. Currently all budget organizations are using the new UCOA.

                         However, the new budget execution module did not become operational from April 1, 2014, in spite of the MoFâ€™s commitment to this effect. Currently the MoF uses only the budget
                         preparation module of the new TFMIS. Due to delays with both providing training to the staff on new budget execution module and treasury reorganization, MoF had to postpone
                         implementing the new budget execution module. Although technically feasible to implement the budget execution module from July 1, 2014, significant data migration would be
                         required and the field organizations would have to manage old and new databases, which is not desirable. The budget execution module is currently being piloted in four
                         organizations. Upon successful completion of testing, it is expected that the module will be implemented from January 1, 2015.
                         The Project development objectives and key monitoring indicators are found to be achievable, but due to delays in procurement of some consultancies in the early project
                         implementation stage, an extension to the project closing date is required. There is progress in achieving the project intermediate results indicators. Some intermediate indicators
                         such as improved budget preparation procedures, establishing the IT Center, and developing MoF staff capacity, have already been achieved, while others such as extension of the
                         TSA country-wide, and purchasing and installing data center equipment, are in progress. The Project is expected to achieve its development objectives. However, a short extension
                         of the closing date of the project is required. MoF has sent a letter to the Bank requesting an eight month extension of the project closing date until March 31, 2015. The issue is being
                         considered by the Bank.

                         The overall project disbursement rate has increased from 54% to 66% over the recent seven months. The Project is expected to achieve its development objectives.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Project is expected to achieve its development objectives. However, a short extension of the closing date of the project is required. MoF has sent a letter to the Bank requesting
                         an eight month extension of the project closing date until March 31, 2015. The issue is being considered by the Bank.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.

                         Related Projects
