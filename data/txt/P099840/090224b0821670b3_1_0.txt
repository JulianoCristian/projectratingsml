                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The MoF has conducted substantial preparatory work on capacity building, IT development and institutional change. The preparatory work included improving legislation, modernizing
                         ICT infrastructure, customizing the SGB.NET information system and progress in developing adequate HR capacities to support reform implementation. The Treasury Modernization
                         Program, Public Sector Accounting Reform Strategy, HR Reform Strategy, Training Strategy, and a Unified Chart of Accounts have been adopted, advancing key PFM reform
                         priorities. All local financial departments have been connected to Headquarters through a common network. The IT Center has been established and staffed. In addition, a group of
                         IT specialists, who provide services to local offices, were trained and deployed in the field. MoF has completed training of local financial departments and budget organizations on a

                         new budget preparation module. All data for Budget 2014 were introduced into the new SGB.NET budget preparation module. It is expected that SGB.NET will be fully operational in
                         2014.
                         MoF approved a new UCOA in June 2012, which was expected to be introduced from January 1, 2013. However, due to the delay with both adopting an adequate IT program to
                         support the UCOA and providing training for MoF staff on the new UCOA, the introduction of the UCOA was postponed till January 1, 2014. To successfully introduce the UCOA,

                         MoF should (i) complete customization of the budget execution modules of SGB.NET information system, and (ii) conduct training of appropriate MoF staff on both the UCOA and
                         SGB.NET. By the date, MoF has trained 112 accountants who are expected to be providing training and consultations for budget organizations' staff on new UCOA throughout the
                         country.
                         Medium-term expenditure frameworks were developed for 6 pilot sectors. This year MoF delegated much more authorities to pilot line ministries to develop their sectoral budgets.
                         Health, Education, Social Protection, Agriculture, Transport and Energy developed their baseline budgets based on program budgeting and new program classification on a new
                         SGB.NET information system. Each ministry identified its priorities (usually 3-4), programs and sub-programs. Performance indicators (PI) for objective-oriented allocation of
                         expenditure were developed in order to measure and pursue sector- related objectives. At present, there exist about 10 to 20 programs, developed by lead line ministries for each
                         appropriate sector.
                         Although there has been some progress in delivery of training and developing new job descriptions for HR and Training Center staff, less progress is observed in the upgrade of the
                         Training Center operation and reorganization of the HR Department. The major objective of reform is to connect training with HR, which is expected to be achieved through an
                         upgrade of the Training Center and reorganization of the HR Department. Due to the fact that there are only two months remaining till the end of the year and many more tasks to
                         complete, MoF should speed up the process of adoption and implementation of the Business Plan for Institutionalization of Training Center, including hiring 4 new full-time employees
                         for the Center and ensure adequate budget allocations for the Training center.
                         To implement the HR Management Strategy approved in December 2012, MoF is developing an Implementation Plan. The Implementation Plan will include activities on
                         reorganization of the MoF HR department, revising HR Department mandates and job descriptions, introduce modern HR management techniques, and a database for staff and
                         training records. MoF approved a reorganization plan for HR Department in June 2013, but the plan has not been implemented yet.

                         The overall project disbursement rate has increased from 44% to 54% over the recent six months. The Project is expected to achieve its development objectives. However, a short
                         extension of the closing date of the project, up to 6 months, may be required.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following MoF request, the Bank is considering a possible extension of MTEF assignment, which is ending by the end 2013, for additional six months. In 2014, MoF is intending to
                         extend MTEF to local budgets and implement an Implementation Plan for Integration of Capital and Recurrent Expenditures, success of which depends, in large extend, on
                         availability of international experts to assist with implementation of the above activities. Additional financing possibly to be provided will be limited to the available project savings.
