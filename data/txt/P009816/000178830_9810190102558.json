the State's construction program of Medium Irrigation\n            projects (MIPs) begun in 1960. This includes completion of\n            15 MIPs already under construction in Orissa I,\n            near-completion of three other MIPs, and appraisal as well\n            as partial construction of six new MIPs. In addition, the\n            project provides funds for some 160,000 ha of land to be\n            consolidated into economic production areas. Within the same\n            area, a system of watercourses and drains (defined as\n            On-farm Development or OFD) are to be designed. On\n            approximately 48,000 ha of consolidated land, the OFD works\n            would be built during the project. To test improved MIP and\n            canal system performance, a Research, Development and\n            Training Cell is being established to undertake pilot\n            studies. In addition, there are a number of coordinating\n            units being established to insure that all State Government\n            departments and research institutions are actively involved\n            in the success of the project."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
