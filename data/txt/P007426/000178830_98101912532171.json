of foreign exchange to\n            meet current import requirements of exporters; (ii) allowing\n            a better utilization of the presently installed\n            manufacturing capacity; (iii) complementing the export\n            policies which the Government intends to put in place; and\n            (iv) strengthening the institutional framework that provides\n            support to exporters. Up to $26.0 million of the loan funds\n            will be used to increase the resources available to EDF for\n            short-term financing or cash sale of foreign exchange for\n            imports required by exporters, of which $22.0 million will\n            be used for the importation of raw materials, intermediate\n            goods, packaging materials and spare parts by producers of\n            manufactured goods for export and local suppliers to\n            exporters, and $4.0 million for the importation of current\n            inputs by the Banana Company of Jamaica Ltd. At least $10.0\n            million of loan funds will be made available to the EDF to\n            provide medium-term financing to exporters and their\n            suppliers for the importation of capital equipment required\n            to utilize installed production capacity and for limited\n            inventories of imported inputs.
