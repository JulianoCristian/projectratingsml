of foreign exchange to\n            meet current import requirements of exporters; (ii) allowing\n            a better utilization of the presently installed\n            manufacturing capacity; (iii) complementing the export\n            policies which the Government intends to put in place; and\n            (iv) strengthening the institutional framework that provides\n            support to exporters. Up to $26.0 million of the loan funds\n            will be used to increase the resources available to EDF for\n            short-term financing or cash sale of foreign exchange for\n            imports required by exporters, of which $22.0 million will\n            be used for the importation of raw materials, intermediate\n            goods, packaging materials and spare parts by producers of\n            manufactured goods for export and local suppliers to\n            exporters, and $4.0 million for the importation of current\n            inputs by the Banana Company of Jamaica Ltd. At least $10.0\n            million of loan funds will be made available to the EDF to\n            provide medium-term financing to exporters and their\n            suppliers for the importation of capital equipment required\n            to utilize installed production capacity and for limited\n            inventories of imported inputs. One million of loan funds\n            will be used."}, "docdt": "1981-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
