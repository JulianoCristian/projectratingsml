Bank staff and officials of the Government\n            involved in the implementation of the project enjoyed an\n            amiable and highly professional working relationship. The\n            project benefited from the high level of continuity in the\n            supervisory staff assigned to it as well as from the vast\n            professional experience of the individuals. The Loan\n            Agreement provided adequate guidance in project management\n            and implementation. There were no distinguishable delays in\n            the submission of withdrawal applications. However, this was\n            not the case regarding the submission of both audit and\n            consultant progress reports. The Fourth Highway Project was,\n            to a large extent, coordinated by expatriates due to the\n            whole scale movement of local engineers to the Lesotho\n            Highlands Water Project (LHWP) and the private sector. As a\n            result the few local engineers that remained behind did not\n            get as much exposure as these expatriates due to some work\n            exigencies in some other projects and activities of the Road\n            Branch (RB). Perhaps the Government of Lesotho (GOL) would\n            be well advised to try to address the problem of the\n            unabating movement of Basotho engineers from the civil service."}, "docdt": "1992-08-14T00:00:00Z"}
