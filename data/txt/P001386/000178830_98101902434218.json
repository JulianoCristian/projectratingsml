roads and strengthen institutions in the transport\n            sector. It includes: rehabilitation of two paved road\n            sections; regravelling of 360 km of gravel roads, upgrading\n            of 42 km of earth roads to gravel standard, and improvement\n            of drainage of 123 km of gravel roads. In addition, the\n            project provides for traffic counters and weighbridges; and\n            technical assistance and training. Road rehabilitation and\n            improvement would lower transport costs, protect past\n            investments and increase accessibility of rural areas.\n            Technical assistance and training would improve the\n            operational capability of the Roads Branch and the Plant and\n            Vehicle Pool Services. In addition, assistance for the\n            Labor-intensive Construction Unit would enhance the\n            Government's efforts to increase domestic employment opportunities."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
