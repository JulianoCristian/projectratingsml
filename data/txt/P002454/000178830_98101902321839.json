The\n            Project would directly benefit the 195,000 farm families\n            engaged in crop production, as well as the farm workers\n            working on state and cooperative farms. The Project would\n            also contribute towards manpower development and income\n            distribution. The success of the Project would depend to a\n            great extent on adequate coordination between the Extension\n            and Farm Management Services, research input supply agencies\n            and marketing organizations."}, "docdt": "1979-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
