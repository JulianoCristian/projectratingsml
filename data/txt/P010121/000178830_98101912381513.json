Agricultural\n            Development Project is designed to strengthen agricultural\n            extension services and develop adaptive research farms in\n            five of the 21 districts of Punjab. It provides for an\n            increase in the number of extension staff; buildings and\n            equipment for five adaptive research farms; suitable housing\n            and vehicles for service extension staff; 30 heavy wheeled\n            tractors to carry out soil and water conservation work;\n            sprayers with suitable specifications for the project area;\n            and consultant assistance. The main project benefit will be\n            an increase in production as a consequence of the impact of\n            the new extension and research system on agricultural\n            yields. Marginal and small farmers, now living close to or\n            below the poverty line will be the primary beneficiaries of\n            the new system and of the project's emphasis on\n            efficient use of existing resources. The most significant\n            risk lies in the fact that the effectiveness of the new\n            extension methodology is highly dependent on an efficient\n            organization and management of extension and research\n            services, as well as on farmers' response. Experience\n            with ongoing projects in other countries has already\n            demonstrated, however, that the new system can work\n            efficiently in formulation and delivery of messages, and in\n            motivating farmers."}, "docdt": "1978-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
