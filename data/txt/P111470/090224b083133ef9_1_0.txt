1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Context

1.      Guinea, a country of 11.78 million, is located on the west coast of Africa, bordered by Guinea
Bissau, Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Guinea is a constitutional republic with a
presidency that governs with an appointed council of ministers. Since its independence from France in
1958, Guinea has experienced a number of autocratic regimes characterized by limited political and
economic freedom. It has experienced periods of macroeconomic instability and the economy, highly
dependent on mineral exports, remains highly vulnerable to external shocks.

2.       When the Pooled Fund Program (or FC-PSE3) was appraised in 2008, Guinea was considered both
a low-income country and a fragile state. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth had stagnated at the
low level of 2.2 percent on average over the previous five years which was, in turn, jeopardizing the social
and economic improvements observed during the 1990’s when structural reforms were undertaken. Per
capita income averaged US$370 and an estimated 50 percent of the population was living below the poverty
line. Human development indicators were also low with Guinea ranking 156 out of 177 countries on the
Human Development Index (HDI). This was, in large part, a result of consistently low level of spending on
social sectors at 3.5 percent of GDP (with only one-third of this going towards investment).

3.       The period prior to project appraisal was characterized by political and social unrest. Though the
Government had taken important steps towards reform, the worsening social, economic and governance
conditions had resulted in widespread strikes in 2006 and later in 2007, which transitioned into widespread
political unrest and growing pressure for political change, improved governance and delivery of public
services. After an eight-week period of strife and conflict which resulted in 100 deaths, an agreement was
reached to establish a government on the basis of a national consensus. A Presidential decree in late 2007
introduced a reorganization of Government with a diminished role for the Prime Minister and a restoration
of the constitutionally guarded presidential privileges. Though political unrest did flare to some degree
following this period, general strikes were avoided by, among other things, the Government assuring unions
of more political transparency and progress on economic conditions. Despite the establishment of the new
reform-minded Government in 2007, there was a coup d’état in 2008 which suspended the country’s
constitution and all political and union activity. This was coupled with fiscal instability given the loss of
control over government revenue and spending which led to rising inflation and spiraling debt. Although
the FC-PSE was appraised in 2008, as a result of these difficult circumstances, implementation could not
begin until 2011 when the level of political stability improved.

 This report evaluates the Pooled Fund (FC-PSE) which was funded by a number of DPs, and was in support of the
Government’s ESP. The PAD refers to this support or operation as the “Education Sector Development Program” or
“FC-PSE Program”. For simplicity, since the pooled fund was in support of the Government’s Program (ESP), the
operation being reviewed will be referred to as the Pooled Fund (FC-PSE).

                                                      1
Sector Context

4.       At the time of project appraisal, some of the key challenges facing the education sector included:
(i) low access to education at early childhood education (ECE) in rural areas among the poor and
particularly among girls; (ii) high dropout rates in rural areas as many schools did not offer the complete
six-grade primary cycle (though multi-grade schooling had been encouraged in less densely populated
areas, it had not been largely successful); (iii) low retention rates at secondary level given limited spaces
and growing demand; (iv) low quality of education despite investment in this area (particularly in primary
education); (v) inefficient management procedures and an administration which was highly reliant on donor
funding; and (vi) limited domestic funding for the sector.

5.       Although a number of development partners (DPs), including the World Bank, had been providing
support to the Government since 2002 in the sector, coordination among them had been limited. At this
time, it was agreed that a sector-wide approach (SWAp) to support an EFA strategy would be important in
strengthening coordination among the various DPs and the activities supported. Support to the Education
Sector Plan (ESP) would be provided through two modalities: (i) the International Development
Association (IDA)-financed Education for All Project (under implementation since 2001); and (ii) a pooled
fund (with contributions from EFA-FTI 4 , German Development Cooperation (Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau – KfW) and the French Development Agency (Agence Francaise de developpement –
AFD)). The IDA-Financed project would be a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL) while the Pooled
Fund (FC-PSE) would finance a share of the Government’s ESP activities.

6.      In addition to an EFA Project supported by IDA5, there were a number of other projects supported
by various DPs.6 The new approach aimed to lead to coordination and synergies of DPs’ efforts with those
of the Government to ensure consistency, harmonization of activities and, in turn, sustainable improvements
in access to and quality of basic education. The Pooled Fund (FC-PSE or Pooled Fund Program) supported
the Government’s Education Sector Plan (ESP) for 2008-2015. The overarching objectives of the ESP were
to improve the country’s education system in line with the education Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) and the EFA-FTI Indicative Framework. By supporting and strengthening the development of
human capital, these efforts would be contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction. The rationale
behind pooled funding was that it provided the opportunity to improve the efficiency of support for the ESP
while also reducing transaction costs for the Government in line with the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness. As the ESP and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II (PRSP II) were developed at around
the same time, there was a strong degree of alignment between them (including some of the key program
and performance indicators).

Project Context

7.      The Pooled Fund (FC-PSE)7 was approved on July 30, 2008. Its planned effectiveness date was
January 1, 2009. It was expected to close on August 31, 2011. The total amount of the Pooled Fund was
US$160 million and had three contributing partners: EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund Grant (No.TF092364;

phase of the Government’s EFA Program (2001-2013).
6
  There were projects financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische
Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) that were being implemented.
7
  As mentioned earlier, this was referred to as the Education Sector Development Program and the FC-PSE Program
in the PAD. For clarity, this operation is referred to in this report as the Pooled Fund (FC-PSE).

                                                        2
US$117.8 million); AFD (US$15.2 million) and KfW (US$27 million). Although the Government had met
conditions of effectiveness, the 2008 coup d’état prevented the FC-PSE from becoming effective.8 The
Bank’s Operational Policy [OP 7.30] "Dealings with De Facto Governments" was triggered and in mid-
2009, the country fell into arrears which led to the suspension of the Bank and EFA-FTI support. At the
time of this suspension, a portion of funding from AFD to the Pooled Fund had been disbursed which, in
turn, provided sufficient funding for the already established Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to remain
intact and operational. In addition to this support, AFD funded the evaluation of teachers in preparation for
in-service training and commenced construction of 99 classrooms. In addition, since UNICEF was able to
maintain its presence on the ground and support activities in the sector during this period, US$24 million
of the FTI financing was allocated to UNICEF. OP7.30 restriction was lifted on January 19, 2011, and the
country came out of arrears on April 21, 2011. As such, the Bank was able to reengage with the country.
On June 6, 2011 the waiver to World Bank OP13.00 "Signing of Legal documents and effectiveness of
loans and credits" was granted. The FTI reduced the allocation for the Pooled Fund from US$117.8 million
to US$64 million of which US$40 million would be managed by the Bank as SE while the remaining US$24
million was being managed by UNICEF as Implementing Entity. The decision to allocate this financing to
UNICEF as IE was made given the organization’s ability to continue its activities during the period in which
the Bank had formally disengaged from the country. The Project was restructured on August 25, 2011 and
the Pooled Fund became effective on September 22, 2011 when the Grant Agreement (GA) was reinstated.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.       According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), “the objective of the FC-PSE is to contribute
to enhancing equitable access to and quality in education at all levels - with focus on primary education –
and literacy training, while also strengthening central and de-concentrated management of the education
system.” According to the original GA, “The Project is part of the Recipient’s Program, which contributes
to enhancing equitable access to and quality in education at all levels, with focus on primary education and
literacy training, while also strengthening central and de-concentrated management of the education system.

9.        Reflecting the strong alignment of the FC-PSE with the larger ESP, the Pooled Fund utilized several
of the ESP indicators as its key performance indicators (KPIs) (or PDO-level indicators), with the
intermediate-level indicators designed to measure the specific outputs of the FC-PSE Project. The adoption
of indicators directly from the Government’s sector matrix was common practice at the time for FTI-funded
Projects and reflects the view of the Pooled-Fund’s objectives as supportive of the Government’s overall
education sector program. The PDO-level indicators are presented by objective in Table 1 below. A detailed
list of intermediate-level indicators can be found in Annex 10.




8
  Although the GA was countersigned on August 13, 2008, it was subsequently legally terminated as the Project did
not become effective within 90 days of its signing, as was stipulated in Article V (5.03) of the GA. The revised GA,
reflecting the restructured design, was reinstated in September of 2011.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.      The PDO was revised under the 2011 restructuring to the following: “The objective of the Project,
which is part of the Program, is to enhance equitable access to and quality of basic education, while also
strengthening decentralized management of the education system, in the Recipient's territory.” 11 The
revisions to the PDO introduced in the 2011 restructuring narrowed the scope of the original PDO by
focusing specifically on supporting improved access, quality, and management within the basic education
sub-sector. Though the PDO’s mention of the Recipient’s territory was omitted under the 2012
restructuring in 2012, both the objectives and intent of the Project remained unchanged.12 See Table 2 for
modifications to the PDO.

11.     During the project life, modifications were introduced to the FC-PSE Results Framework (RF) to
PDO- and intermediate-level indicators. Under the original design the RF included 10 PDO-level indicators
and 29 intermediate-level indicators. Under the first restructuring in 2011, a number of modifications were
introduced to the Project’s RF. While a large number of indicators were dropped, others were revised and
some new performance measures were added. Under the second restructuring in 2012, additional
modifications were introduced to the Project’s RF, including most notably, adjustments to the end-of-
project targets due to the withdrawal of KFW from the Pooled Fund. Under the restructuring in 2013,
indicators and/or associated end-of-project targets were revised to reflect changes in the project’s scope as

changes introduced to the RF during the Project life are detailed in Annex 10 of this report. Annex 10 also
documents the level of achievement for all of the PDO- and intermediate-level indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     The main beneficiaries of the Pooled Fund (FC-PSE) were primary school-aged children
nationwide, teachers, central and de-concentrated level education administrators, illiterate adults, and the
poorest prefectures and populations. The number of beneficiaries targeted by the FC-PSE was not specified
in the original project documents. However, the 2011 Restructuring Paper lists the beneficiaries as those
individuals benefitting from school construction, teacher training and textbooks and estimates the total
number of project beneficiaries to be 1,584,282 (of which 48 percent would be female).

1.5 Original Components

13.      The FC-PSE was comprised of three Components, as follows:

Component 1: Improving Equitable Access to Basic and Non-Formal Education [Appraisal: US$119
million; Original FTI Financing: US$90.9 million; Revised FTI Financing13: US$23.7 million; Actual
Expenditure: US$22.7 million].14 This component aimed to promote equitable and regulated access to
basic and non-formal education, to increase enrollment rates in pre-school, and primary and lower
secondary education, support specific measures for mentally and/or physically handicapped children,
expand access to literacy training, support the creation of professional integration courses for primary and
lower secondary leavers, and professional training specifically oriented toward the mining sector.
Component 1 included the following five sub-components: (i) Improving pre-school, primary, and
secondary level educational infrastructure; (ii) expanding educational access of primary-level students with
special needs; (iii) expanding access to literacy training; (iv) establishing professional integration courses
for primary and lower secondary leavers; and (v) increasing availability of skilled labor for the mining
sector.  
 
Component 2: Improving Quality of Basic and Non-Formal Education [Appraisal: US$26 million;
Original FTI Financing: US$20.1 million; Revised FTI Financing: US$11.8 million; Actual
Expenditure: US$12.6 million.]15 The objective was to improve the quality and relevance of basic and non-
formal education, with particular focus on the acquisition of pedagogical materials, provide initial and
continued teacher training, provide block grants to Primary Education Delegations (Délégation Scolaire de
l’Enseignement Élementaire – DSEE), the MEPU-EC administrative level below the prefecture, and student
evaluations. The following six sub-components were supported under Component 2: (i) Acquiring and
supplying free textbooks and teachers’ guides for public and private primary and secondary schools; (ii)
supporting initial training for primary and secondary teachers; (iii) Supporting continued training for
primary and secondary teachers; (iv) Providing block grants to schools and DSEE; (v) Conducting nation-
wide student learning assessments at primary level (year 4—2008; year 6—2009; and year 2—2010) and
lower secondary level (2009); and (vi) Implementing curriculum reform in higher education.




13
   These are the values for the 2011 Restructuring Project which included revised financial figures based on the revised
FTI allocation.
14
   Actual expenditure for the components reflect spending under the Project supported by the EFA-FTI CF Grant.

Component 3: Improving Management of the Educational System [Appraisal: US$9 million; Original
FTI Financing: US$6.8 million; Revised FTI Financing: US$4.5 million; Actual Expenditure: US$4.7
million]. 16 The objective was to strengthen the central and de-concentrated management of the sector,
including its infrastructure services. Component 3 was comprised of the following four sub-components:
(i) Enhancing the National Service for Educational Infrastructure and Equipment (Service National des
Infrastructures et Équipements Scolaires—SNIES) capacity to monitor civil works; (ii) Construction and
rehabilitation of regional and prefectural administrative education offices by financing civil works on one
Inspection Regionale de l’Education (IRE) and six DPE that had sustained serious physical damage during
the January-February 2007 civil strife; (iii) Strengthening planning and monitoring capacity at the regional
and prefectural level; and (iv) Strengthening the MEPU-EC at the central level.

14.     A detailed overview of the three components can be found in Annex 2 of this report. Of the total
funding for the FC-PSE under the original design, 96 percent was allocated to the three components listed
above while 4 percent (about US$6 million) was unallocated.

1.6 Revised Components

15.      The overarching aims of the three project components remained relatively consistent throughout
the project life. However, activities to be supported under Components 1 and 2 were modified as follows.
Under the first restructuring in 2011, Components 1 and 2 were modified to focus only on “basic
education”. 17 In terms of activities, under this restructuring, some activities were modified given the
substantial reduction in FTI funding from US$117.8 million to US$40 million, a few new activities were
added and one activity was dropped. Under this restructuring, the scope and number of activities to be
supported under the Pooled Fund were reduced in light of the reduced financial support for the FC-PSE.18
The modifications to Components 1 and 2 were also reflected in adjustments to various indicators and
targets in the RF under these restructurings. 19 In terms of Component 3 20 , the activity to support
construction of administrative offices was dropped and increased emphasis was placed on strengthening
human resources (HR) management. The revisions introduced within each component of the Project are
detailed in Table 2 below (as described in the revisions to the GA). Under the third restructuring, the
construction of lower secondary schools (planned under Component 1) was cancelled as there was
insufficient time to complete this activity. Additionally, under the third restructuring, funding was
reallocated to Component 2 to support the provision of school grants for in-service teacher training for an
additional year and two new activities: (i) in-service teacher training was provided to 1,000 lower secondary
school teachers; and (ii) 67,313 French textbooks were provided to 10th grade students.

   The Original Program specified Component 1 as “Improving equitable access to basic and non-formal education”,
whereas during the first restructuring, the revised articulation was “Improving equitable access to basic education”;
and specified Component 2 as “Improving quality of basic and non-formal education”, whereas during the first
restructuring, the revised articulation was “Improving quality of basic education”.
18
   Funding changes included: (i) the reduction in GPE financing from US$117.8 million to US$64 million in 2011;
and (ii) the withdrawal of KfW financing in 2012.

1.7 Other significant changes

16.      The amount of the original grant was US$117.8 million with the World Bank acting as Supervising
Entity (SE).21 In 2011, when the Grant was reinstated, the FTI Board requested that the funding amount
allocated to Guinea be reduced. Together, the DPs and Government agreed to reduce the funding for the
Pooled Fund to US$64 million with the World Bank serving as SE for US$40 million with the remaining
US$24 million being administered by UNICEF as Implementing Entity (IE). This shared responsibility
between the Bank and UNICEF had been agreed and suggested by the DPs and the Government. It was the
first time that an FTI grant had followed such an arrangement.

17.     During the Project life, the Project was restructured three times as follows:

18.      First restructuring: The level 1 restructuring was approved on August 25, 2011 in response to the
FTI Board request to reduce the FTI amount from US$117.8 million to US$64 million, with the World
Bank managing US$40 million as the SE and UNICEF responsible for US$24 million as the IE. The project
scope of activities was narrowed and reoriented as evidenced in changes to the PDO and the RF. The
amended GA was reinstated on September 22, 2011. The project closing date was extended from August
31, 2011 to January 15, 2013 was stipulated by FTI.
 
19.      Second restructuring: On May 15, 2012, a second restructuring was undertaken in response to the
decision of KfW to withdraw from the Pooled Fund. 22 In addition to narrowing the scope of project
activities, the restructuring extended the closing date by approximately one year from January 15, 2013 to
December 31, 2013. This restructuring provided additional time to ensure completion of project activities
and achievement of the PDO by project closing.

20.     Third restructuring: The last restructuring of the project was approved on November 12, 2013 in
response to a Government request. Under this restructuring, (i) funding was reallocated from the
construction of middle schools (which could not be completed by the project closing date) to in-service
teacher training, provision of learning materials for early grades and textbooks benefiting secondary
schools, and continued TA; (ii) the closing date was extended again by one year from December 31, 2013
to December 31, 2014 to provide additional time for completion of project activities and further progress
towards achievement of the PDO; and (iii) the RF was modified to reflect changes in the scope of the project
and the additional allotted time. 

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation and Design
 
21.     The Pooled Fund’s objectives were directly aligned with the Government’s objectives for the sector
and with the aims of the PRSP II, the Letter of Sector Policy and the Government’s National Development




21
  The total amount of the Grant from the FTI was based on the financing gap in the sector.
22
  KfW’s decision to withdraw was based on the fact that legislative elections in the country did not take place as
anticipated.

                                                       10
Strategy which was developed at around the same time.23 The project’s original design was also informed
by a number of analytical studies including a recently completed education Country Status Report (CSR)24
(2005 - 2006) and a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). Moreover, the design of the Pooled
Fund also drew on lessons learned from other investments adopting a SWAp in other relevant settings (e.g.,
Zambia, Kenya and Bangladesh) and other operations in Guinea, including the ongoing IDA-funded
operation. The decision to use a SWAp was guided by the implementation of the IDA-funded EFA Project
(P050046) and a strong commitment among DPs to uphold the principles of the 2005 Paris Declaration.
Since it was designed in the framework of the ESP, the operation’s development benefitted from wide
consultations with various stakeholders across all levels of the education system. Further, it capitalized on
the FTI Board’s growing support of the new and ambitious pooled fund approach to support the
Government’s ESP. The Bank was able to use its experience in project design in and implementation in the
Guinean context as the Bank had been very active in the sector since 2002. A select number of activities
to be supported under the FC-PSE had been piloted and, in many cases, implemented during the previous
Government-supported Education Sector Program which had been prepared in 2001 for the period spanning
from 2002 to 2006. 

22.     Despite the operation’s strong alignment with Government strategy and strong analytical
underpinnings, the original design was overly complex and ambitious given the fragile political
environment prevailing in Guinea at the time of project preparation. In order to better account for these
challenges to project implementation, the original design needed to be modified to enhance its overall
development impact.

Quality of Entry

23.      The Bank team possessed the necessary and relevant expertise to prepare and appraise the Pooled
Fund and drew on relevant analytical work. The team was well-positioned to lead preparation of the Pooled
Fund and to take on the role of SE, as it was able to build on the existing working relationship with the
Government and other DPs which had been developed over the course of previous and on-going Bank-
supported operations. As described above, the Pooled Fund was very well-aligned with Government
objectives and aimed to address those issues which had been identified as central to the Government’s own
strategic agenda. The Pooled Fund did not benefit from either a Quality at Entry Review (QER) or a Quality
of Supervision Assessment (QSA). The risk related to effectively implementing a project of this size and
complexity within such a fragile context was, however, somewhat underestimated. Although the Pooled
Fund was designed to provide a much larger amount of financing to an array of activities, the Bank and
Government assumed that the sector had sufficient absorptive capacity. However, it is important to
highlight that the initial amount to be provided was determined on the basis of an assessment of the
financing gap of the national education sector plan in basic education (this was the funding criteria under
the FTI initiative at the time).


23
   The Government had begun to carry out fundamental reforms in April 2007 to restore good governance, stabilize
the economy, and promote sustainable growth, employment and poverty reduction based on a short economic
rehabilitation emergency program (July 2007) and a second generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II),
which was completed in August 2007. The PRSP II had aimed to capture the ground lost over the previous five years,
so that the MDGs could be reached. The PRSP II had three pillars: (i) improving governance (ii) accelerating growth
and increasing employment opportunities; and (iii) improving access to basic services.
24
   This analysis provided some evidence that although government financing allocated to the education sector had
been limited, access to education had improved in the 15 years prior to this due to private provision of education and
improved internal efficiency of the sector. At the same time, despite investments targeting quality improvements in
education little improvement had been observed and some management methods had been slow to take root without
support from the donor community. In addition, regional and gender disparities were of concern as was the lack of
regular and rigorous student learning assessments.

                                                         11
24.       Specifically, the FC-PSE design presented a number of specific challenges to Government capacity
including, most notably: (i) a high level of multi-ministerial coordination in an environment where
ministries had little history of cross-collaboration; (ii) increased sharing of responsibilities in terms of
implementation across many actors and levels (for example, Government institutions, NGOs, schools); and
(iii) a high degree of coordination with DPs. Many of these also posed challenges to the ongoing IDA-
funded Project. Further, a significant amount of time was needed in order to prepare for implementation of
activities. Although the FC-PSE was innovative by scaling up pilots and testing new strategies, often
simultaneously, this placed additional pressure on an already limited institutional capacity, particularly in
the areas of planning and M&E. At the same time, key aspects of project design (including the reliance on
three different methods for school construction activities (NGO, community-based support and small and
medium enterprises) were highly appropriate for the context. Based on the information above Quality at
Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Revised Design

25.      The 2011 Restructuring introduced significant changes to the Project design including: (i)
sharpening the focus of the PDO; (ii) support to select activities to buttress achievement of the revised PDO
and with consideration for existing capacity and comparative advantage among DPs (particularly the case
in terms of the redistribution of civil works among DPs); (iii) increased focus on human resources
management; and (iv) modifications to the RF to better capture project-related results and outcomes. The
revised design was less complex and more narrowly focused on providing support to basic education. A
number of activities were cancelled and/or scaled down, including for example the provision of textbooks
for senior secondary schools. The 2012 Restructuring, was necessitated by KfW’s decision to withdraw its
resources (the total contribution to the Pooled Fund was US$27 million) from the Pooled Fund. Though the
2012 Restructuring did not change the overarching objectives and intent of the operation, it did narrow its
scope (i.e., reducing the number of primary schools to be constructed under the project) in order to account
for the reduction in available funding. Under the 2013 restructuring, funding was reallocated from the
construction of secondary schools to the provision of quality inputs (textbooks and teacher training) as it
was unlikely that the secondary schools could be completed even within the extended project period. This
activity was taken on by other DPs. The various extensions of the closing date, provided the necessary time
for the Government to achieve its goals of expanding access, addressing equity, improving quality and
strengthening management capacity in the sector.

2.2 Implementation

26.      The implementation arrangements were complex25, relying on a number of different levels and
entities for managing different aspects of the Pooled Fund and the implementation of the larger ESP. The
National Coordination of the ESP (CN/PSE), as responsible for operational coordination of the ESP, was
the primary management center for the majority of the Pooled Fund resources, including financial



25
  Detailed Program implementation arrangements were specified in 13 documents including the: (i) PSE Execution
Manual; (ii) FC-PSE Administrative, Financial, and Accounting Manual; (iii) Guidelines for the Management of
Grants to Schools and DSEE; (iv) Guidelines for textbooks; (v) Operations Manual for Functional Literacy and NAFA
Centers; (vi) Operations Manual for School Construction by Contract Management Delegated to NGOs; (vii)
Operations Manual for School Construction by Community Delegation; (viii) Operations Manual for Research and
Innovation Funds; (ix) PSE Monitoring and Evaluation Guide; (x) Manual for the Development of Prefectural
Education Development Plans; (xi) Manual for Continued Training of Primary-School Teachers; (xii) Manual for
Continued Training for Secondary-School Teachers; and (xiii) the various execution manuals of sectoral investment
projects that were underway and contributed to the ESP.

                                                       12
management (FM) and procurement. As the central operational coordination unit for the IDA-financed
project, the CN/PSE and the Bank had already developed a solid working relationship with this unit. The
Strategic National Committee (SNC), led by the Secretary General of the MEPU-EC, coordinated
discussions around budget, announced annual budgetized action plans (Plans annuels d’activités budgétisés
–PAAB) adoption and supervised preparation of key documents for sector reviews as well as audit, M&E
and progress reports. In addition, it coordinated capacity-building and institutional reform activities
supported under the Project. The National Education Steering Committee, led by the Minister of MEPU-
EC and with wide representation from a variety of stakeholders, was responsible for ensuring continued
strategic alignment of the Pooled Fund, as well as any other parallel DP-supported activities within the
education sector. Finally, regional and prefecture steering committees were responsible for ensuring
consistency between local plans and the ESP and for leading policy dialogue at the deconcentrated levels.

27.     Implementation can be described in four distinct phases.

Overview of implementation by phase

28.      Phase I: July 2008 – August 24, 2011. Though the Pooled Fund was approved in 2008, it did not
become effective until 2011 as a result of the coup d’état and the non-payment of arrears which required
the Bank to formally disengage from the country. During this period, however, funding from the AFD
within the pooled fund allowed the previously established PCU to remain operational.26 Further, though
the Bank had formally disengaged with the country, the Bank team maintained dialogue with the project
and technical teams during this period through videoconferences (VCs) and missions (in Dakar). The
implementation status reports (ISRs) completed during this period pointed to a deterioration in key sector
indicators including repetition and primary completion rates, although limited data were provided on the
level of achievements observed across the various PDO- or intermediate-level indicators. Following the
presidential elections in January 2011, the previously tenuous macroeconomic, political and social context
improved considerably and a joint review mission was undertaken in the Spring (May/June) of 2011. With
the clearance of arrears in April 2011, the Bank was able to re-engage in the country. The lack of
implementation during the two-year period due to the country context led to the decision by the FTI
Secretariat to reduce financing from the FTI Catalytic Fund to the Pooled Fund from US$117.8 to US$64
million. As UNICEF had a strong presence on the ground and had been able to continue its activities during
this period when the Bank was not allowed to formally engage in the country, it took on the role of IE for
US$24 million while the Bank would be SE for the remaining US$40 million. The Bank worked closely
with other partners to recalibrate the scope of activities to be supported by the FC-PSE to make it
commensurate with reduced funding and agreed on a realistic implementation timeframe. As the PCU had
remained functional, once the Bank was allowed to officially reengage with the Government, changes
introduced under the first restructuring on August 25, 2011 were carried out in a timely manner. Indeed,
this operation was one of the first to be reactivated after this period of disengagement which was largely
possible given the efforts to maintain continued dialogue described above. Although no disbursements
were made during this period from the FTI portion of the funding managed by the Bank, the AFD had
disbursed during this period.

29.     Phase 2: August 25, 2011 - December 10, 2012. This first restructuring introduced important
modifications to the Project as described earlier. As a result of the significant reduction in funding, the
PDO, RF and project timeframe were revised. In December 2011, the first supervision mission following
project effectiveness was held which revealed project implementation was progressing well in the initial

  In addition, AFD funded the evaluation of teachers in preparation for in-service teacher training and the launch of
the construction of 99 classrooms. AFD funding during this period totaled US$2.3 million.

                                                        13
phases in spite of the difficult context and the changes in senior management within the MEPU-EC. The
strong level of collaboration among DPs and continued supervision (by VCs on a monthly basis) played an
important role in the uptake of the Project during this time. However, during this time, KfW made the
decision to withdraw its funding from the Pooled Fund as the legislative elections had not taken place which
was a condition for their disbursement. This decision was not based on any issues with the pooled fund
arrangement, but was politically motivated (their funding was ultimately channeled and implemented
through an international NGO and not directly executed by the Government as was the Pooled Fund). This
led to the decision to further narrow the scope of the Project and these changes would be formally introduced
under the 2012 restructuring. Significant progress across many activities – including construction,
textbooks, provision of school grants, and recruitment of teacher trainees, private tutoring and technical
capacity-building – was observed during this phase. Given the progress made in terms of construction (and
this activity receiving the largest allocation of funding of around 70 percent), disbursement during this
period reached US$25.56 (around 64 percent of the total funding amount of US$40 million). Joint sector
reviews were also carried out during this time while aspects of project implementation were effectively
carried out (i.e., procurement, FM, etc.) Despite the progress made, some key activities were delayed
including the assessment of learning outcomes and construction was behind schedule. Furthermore, KfW
decided to withdraw from the Pooled Fund as a condition for its funding had not been met (related to
legislative elections). On the basis of these factors, it was agreed that the Project would again be
restructured.

30.      Phase 3: December 11, 2012 – December 25, 2013. The second restructuring, approved on
December 11, 2012 introduced some modifications to the project scope, evidenced in the scaling back of a
number of end-of-project targets, and an extension in the closing date (also reflected in a scaling up of some
end-of-project targets, i.e., number of project beneficiaries). Specifically, with the withdrawal of KfW from
the Pooled fund, targets for the number of primary and lower secondary classrooms were reduced. This
restructuring, which required a thorough assessment of project achievements to date and critical review of
key aspects of the project, replaced the mid-term review (MTR). The pace of implementation was
maintained with the Project having disbursed 84 percent of total grant funding by May 2013, less than six
months after the restructuring. Progress continued on key activities – including the implementation of
PAABs, continuing delivery of textbooks and a rigorous monitoring system for their delivery, training of
teachers, private tutoring for girls, learning assessment for fourth grade, the development of an MTEF, and
continued construction of classrooms. Further, grants to schools were being managed directly, for the first
time, by the DNEE and the most recent statistical data for all sub-sectors from 2012 were analyzed.
Supervision of construction was strengthened to ensure improved quality of civil works and some steps
were taken to improve adherence to safeguards procedures. It was agreed near the end of this year that the
Project would need to be restructured in response to a Government request. Specifically, this restructuring
would reallocate funding from the construction of middle schools (which would no longer be supported
under the Pooled Fund), to activities designed to improve quality and it would extend the project closing
date by one year. In addition to providing more time for completion of project activities, this would allow
a bridge between this funding and the preparation of an upcoming GPE-funded project. By the end of this
phase, US$38.67 million had been disbursed, representing 97 percent of total net grant funding.

31.     Phase 4: December 26, 2013 - December 31, 2014. The last restructuring was approved on
December 26, 2013 and introduced only marginal changes to the Project, as described earlier. As a result
of strong implementation progress in the previous period, most of the project activities were completed,
including 96 percent of the planned primary school construction with significant improvements observed
in terms of quality. Given the reallocation of funding, and in order to fully complete activities planned under
the Project, select activities to support improvements in quality were scaled up (including provision of
additional textbooks, supporting training of lower secondary school teachers) while other activities were
continued – including assessment activities (learning outcomes and a tracer study), primary school
construction, private tutoring for girls, and the provision of grants to schools. On average, two joint

                                                      14
supervision missions were also carried out during this period. By the time of Project closing, most project
activities had been implemented. By project closing on December 31, 2014, 100 percent of the revised (net)
grant amount had been disbursed.

32.      Implementation was characterized by a high level of coordination among Government,
development partners, and other stakeholders and supportive and intense and continued supervision was
provided by the Bank, both in-country and through widely-attended VCs. The Bank’s strong engagement
with the Government and other DPs was also useful in effectively undertaking semi-annual joint reviews.
This high level of engagement allowed the Bank, along with the various DPs, to identify and address
bottlenecks in a timely manner. Further, despite reduced funding and contribution to the Pooled Fund,
coordination and policy dialogue needed to be maintained to ensure that the operation would still be capable
of achieving the PDO. During implementation, the FC-PSE adopted innovative approaches from the IDA-
financed project including, for example, the three method approach to school construction. Continued
attention was also focused on strengthening the supervision capacity of the implementing ministry and of
those entities responsible for specific activities (data collection and analysis, school construction, etc.)
central to the Project’s success.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

33.     M&E Design. The original Program included a comprehensive RF with ten PDO- and 29
intermediate-level indicators. The ten PDO-level indicators are mapped according to each sub-objective of
the project. These objectives were, in turn, logically linked to the three components of the Pooled Fund.
The performance measures used to evaluate the Pooled Fund’s performance were taken directly from the
ESP M&E Matrix and focused on measuring sector-wide results. The intermediate-level indicators, by
contrast, focused on specific outputs and included targets which were the focus of activities supported under
the FC-PSE. This approach was common at the time – in the context of sector-wide approaches which
aimed to provide direct support to the Government’s own ESP.

34.      At the national level, the M&E unit in the CN/PSE was responsible for M&E under the ESP and
would be responsible for producing regular reports on implementation of the ESP as well as reports
specifically pertaining to the FC-PSE (use of funds, implementation progress) as well as organizing annual
joint sector reviews. An M&E manual had been developed during ESP preparation and the Government
and DPs had agreed to set up a more sophisticated and reliable M&E system. The Government planned to
establish a single database to capture all information relevant to different levels of Government and DPs
(including for the FC-PSE). Data would be collected from the annual statistical survey (Enquete Statistique
Annuel – ESA, which the MEPU-EC was already using) and an additional survey that was under
development by the M&E unit of the CN/PSE. The latter would aim to capture data which were not
collected as part of the ESA. The data for the ESA was collected by the schools themselves – and then
aggregated at the DSEE, DPE, IRE and national levels (with MEPU-EC staff in the DPE, IRE and central
levels heavily involved in analysis and synthesis of information collected). A table on ESP output and
results indicators (tableau de bord) was maintained at all levels making it possible to track PAAB activities

                                                     15
and outcomes. On this basis, annual reports were produced to show progress made under the Pooled Fund
as well as the sector as whole. Finally, an inter-sectoral M&E commission was to be established that would
be in charged with monitoring the implementation of the capacity-building information, validating M&E
reports, and facilitating information-sharing among stakeholders.

35.      Revised M&E Design. As described earlier, a number of important changes were introduced under
the 2011 restructuring. Given the more narrowed focus of the Project, and growing attention at a corporate
level to ensuring the inclusion of SMART indicators in operations, the RF was significantly modified and
recalibrated. A number of performance measures no longer relevant to the restructured operation or which
could not feasibly be impacted by FC-PSE supported interventions were omitted, a number of measures
were fine-tuned and an additional number of indicators were added to the RF to ensure progress under the
Project could be adequately captured. For example, under the 2011 restructuring, the indicator measuring
changes in the GER, was narrowed to focus only on the GER in the nine targeted prefectures and the
measure of access rate in first grade (described as gross intake rate) was moved to the intermediate-level.
In 2013, the indicator to measure learning assessment was modified to allow for comparability of figures
over time. At the same time, however, end-of-project targets for the unchanged indicators were not
significantly modified until the second restructuring in 2012 and again in 2013 when a few activities were
modified (cancellation of construction of secondary schools and increased funding was provided to support
quality inputs, i.e. in-service teacher training, additional textbooks, etc.)27 Adjustments made to the RF,
including baseline values and end-of-project targets as well as a brief description of the level of achievement
for each of the PDO- and intermediate-level indicators is provided in Annex 10.
  
36.      M&E Implementation. As envisaged, an organized M&E system was established under the Project.
At the national level, the CN/PSE was responsible for M&E. An inter-sectoral M&E commission was also
successfully established and met regularly to monitor capacity-building activities in this area. The MEPU-
EC established a single database to capture all information relevant to the Government (at central and
deconcentrated levels) including information on the Pooled Fund and each of the DPs’ investment projects
(central EMIS). Data were collected using the EMS and the newly developed survey. This database and
the collection, transfer and analysis of data at various levels were strengthened under the FC-PSE. Further,
this allowed entities to track PAAB activities and outcomes. In addition, a learning assessment was also
established under the FC-PSE (with a lot of support by the Bank) which helped monitor student learning
achievement and tracking progress over time by equating the assessments. Notable support was provided
by the Bank and other DPs in terms of capacity strengthened with a number of DPs requiring use of results-
based management approaches.

37.      As a result of the restructurings, the number of PDO-level and intermediate-level indicators was
reduced over time. This pattern also characterized the indicators reported in this ISRs, the first status report
(PSR) presented 10 PDO-level and 29 intermediate-level indicators while the last ISR had 6 PDO-level and
11 intermediate-level indicators. Further, though the RPs provide an overview of changes in indicators (and
targets) under the Project, as was common practice at the time, project teams had discretion to include
and/or exclude indicators in these reports without seeking formal clearance (through a restructuring). The
established M&E framework indicators (outputs and outcomes) were reported on in joint sector reviews
and supervision reports (ISRs and aide-memoires) and again presented in each of the restructuring papers.

38.     M&E Utilization. Data collection and analysis were particularly useful in light of the fragile and
tenuous political and macroeconomic context which characterized Guinea at the time. M&E reporting in


27
  The number of indicators reported in the ISRs varied across the life of the project from ten (10) PDO-level and
twenty-nine (29) intermediate-level in the first project status report (PSR) to six (6) PDO-level and eleven (11)
intermediate-level indicators.

                                                       16
status reports were generally adequate and data were well-documented to the extent to which information
was available. Available and reported data were used to inform decision-making and for assessing and
guiding policy efforts during the annual joint reviews. For instance, teacher deployment was proven to be
inequitable (favoring Conakry) which led to the development of a human resource (HR) management
strategy. In addition, the finding that learning outcomes in reading performance were low led to the
introduction of the early grade reading assessment (EGRA) and training of teachers in reading methods. On
the basis of the information above, M&E design and utilization is rated Substantial during the pre-
restructuring period and Substantial during the post-restructuring period.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards Compliance

39.      Taking into account the construction and/or rehabilitation of schools, latrines and water points
planned under the Project design, the ongoing FC-PSE triggered the Environmental Assessment OP
(OP4.01) and the Involuntary Resettlement OP (OP4.12) resulting in a Category B rating. An
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was carried out to assess the Project’s environmental
and social risks and impacts. During the first phase of the Project, no issues were reported. However,
following the 2012 restructuring, it was noted that the provisions and guidelines of the Environmental and
Social Impact Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)28 had not been fully adhered
to. Since there were no safeguard focal points in the SNIES, PCU or within contractors’ teams, no one was
responsible for ensuring that these frameworks had been followed and that safeguard requirements were
observed under the Project. Additional efforts were undertaken to address the shortcomings including the
hiring of a safeguards specialist to provide guidance and raise awareness through workshops and a team
was formed at the MOE and CN-PSE level to oversee compliance with safeguards. A stronger relationship
between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Environment was also established.

40.      An Environmental and Social safeguards audit conducted in January 2014 did find there were some
areas where environmental and social clauses were not fully adhered to, though these deficiencies were
deemed to be rather minor as they did not lead to environmental and safeguard breaches. Indeed, the audit
which was undertaken under the Pooled Fund concluded that the size and nature of infrastructure works
carried out under the Project did not have any significant negative biophysical or socioeconomic impacts
and did not result in the relocation of populations, loss of livelihood, or access to economic assets of
populations. Additionally, there were no objections or counterclaims pertaining to the allocation of land for
schools during the life of the Project. On the basis of the information above, overall safeguards compliance
is rated Moderately Satisfactory.




28
     These delineated the step-by-step procedure for sub-projects screening, review, implementation and monitoring.

                                                          17
Fiduciary Compliance

41.      Financial management. An assessment undertaken during preparation concluded that the public
FM systems and processes were not adequate for use in managing the FC-PSE. However, the CN/PSE
financial and accounting unit was deemed to have adequate capacity to manage FM and disbursement
activities as this entity was also responsible for fiduciary management under the IDA-funded project.
Reviews of CN/PSE up until that point had found that this unit had adequately managed the IDA-funded
project and its staff had been trained in World Bank fiduciary procedures. At the time of preparation of the
FC-PSE, the FM risk was Moderate and with some prescribed actions (in an FM action plan), the FM
system would be further strengthened. An updated FM assessment in 2011 found that the FM arrangements
were still adequate for the purposes of the FC-PSE.

42.      Staffing remained adequate and proper accounting procedures were followed throughout project
implementation with all supporting documents maintained for FC-PSE expenditures. Interim Unaudited
Financial Reports (IFRs), which assessed finances for both the FC-PSE and the IDA-funded project, were
prepared and submitted in a timely manner and were consistently deemed satisfactory.29 All of the audit
reports for the FC-PSE were unqualified. Further, regular internal audits were carried out by the MEPU-
EC Internal Audit Office. An FM manual, approved prior to Project effectiveness guided FM procedures
while additional manuals were useful in guiding certain activities (i.e., provision of school grants and block
grants to DSEE). The Bank also provided continued support in its supervision missions. FM was
consistently rated Satisfactory under the Project.

43.     Procurement. A participatory procurement capacity assessment during project preparation had
revealed that the procurement specialist and three analysts working within the CN/PSE had adequate
experience to fulfill their roles and to carry out procurement activities under the Project. In addition, the
project procurement team for the IDA-funded Project was able to provide additional guidance and support
to procurement activities under the Pooled Fund. Each of the DPs had authorized the World Bank to review
procurement documents for no-objections on their behalf. The procurement activities and practices under
the Project were adequate and undertaken in a timely manner and bidding documents were generally of
good quality. The Bank team provided consistent guidance and follow-up on procurement activities and
procurement capacity was further strengthened with support from a procurement analyst financed by the
FC-PSE.

44.      Though there were some limitations in fiduciary capacity, there were no major issues relating to
the use of accounting systems, preparation of financial statements, adherence to auditing requirements, and
qualifications of accounting and procurement personnel. Overall fiduciary compliance is, therefore, rated
Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.      The Government and DPs through the Pooled Fund together with the IDA-funded EFA Project
established a good foundation for continued collaboration and partnership today. It also set the stage for
continued support to a sector-wide approach to improving the education system in Guinea. In addition to
the ongoing IDA-funded Stepping up Skills Project which aims to address the growing needs of youth as
they transition through the education system and in search of employment opportunities, a US$38 million
Pooled Fund Project for which the Bank is the SE was approved by the Regional Vice President in July
2015. The new Pooled Fund operation is funded by GPE, Ebola Recovery and Reconstruction Trust Fund


29
  IFRs were even completed during the period of Bank disengagement when only AFD contributions continued to be
provided within the Pooled Fund arrangement.

                                                     18
(ERRTF), AFD and UNICEF and is expected to become effective in the fall of 2015. The new Pooled
Fund operation has incorporated many of the lessons acquired in the context of the FC-PSE and builds on
and expands many of the activities supported by this operation (e.g., school grants and block grants) while
also piloting some innovative approaches. The Government remains committed to maintaining important
gains in the sector while continuing to make progress in terms of building capacity of the system while
increasing access to and quality of education in the country. The recent Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)
outbreak, however, has had, and is expected to continue to have an impact on the country’s ability to sustain
the gains made and to devote the necessary financial and human resources to each of the social sectors.
Recently, Guinea was one of three countries to receive World Bank support through the ERRTF which
intends to maintain, as possible, continued provision of key social services including education. Given the
recently approved funding to address EVD as well as the current GPE-funded operation, the prospect for
maintaining and scaling up the gains made under the Project are good.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.      The original PDO was relevant to the Guinean context at the time as it focused on supporting the
objectives as articulated by the Government in its ESP which had also been widely endorsed by other DPs
working in the sector. It also adhered to the principles of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness
which guided approaches to development that emphasized ownership, alignment, and harmonization. In
addition to directly supporting the Government objectives and harmonization with other DPs, it also
capitalized on the growing support within the EFA-FTI for using a Pooled Fund mechanism. Moreover, the
objectives were aligned with the aims of the PRSP II which had been developed around the same time and
complemented the ongoing IDA-funded operation in the sector.30 Finally, it was well-aligned with the EFA
FTI strategy and the Bank strategy for support to Africa. Following reductions in the financial resources
available for the Pooled Fund and the growing needs for support to basic education, the PDO was
appropriately revised. The new ESP approved in 2014 for the period of 2015 to 2017 aims to support
increasing equitable access to quality education while also strengthening overall governance of the sector
through capacity-building. This document is serving as the foundation for the development of the
Government’s ten year sector development plan (Plan de Developpement decennal de l’éducation et de
l’alphabétisation - PDDEA) which was endorsed in September 2014. The relevance of the original and
revised PDO is rated High.

47.      The original design was consistent with the country’s development priorities. The design of the
original Program and the subsequent restructurings were appropriately situated within the broader aims of
the Government’s 2008-2015 education strategy. The FCPSE and the Government’s strategy both aimed to
improve the education system in line with: (i) the Millennium Development Goals (E-MDGs); (ii) the newly
articulated sustainable development goals (SDGs); and (iii) the targets of the EFA-FTI Indicative
Framework. The scope of the original Program and the restructurings are also in sync with the primary
education sub-sector strategy of the Government. The PDO-level indicators captured the main areas for
intervention: (i) improving access; (ii) improving quality; and (iii) improving management. Project
preparation took into account lessons learned from previous projects and international good practice in the
sector. However, the far-reaching aims of the Project and reliance on institutional capacity which was
limited at the time, the original design was overly ambitious. In light of the information described above,
the relevance of the original design is rated Modest.


30
  The IDA-funded Project supported a number of activities including, among others: revision to the national education
policy, preparation of an education sector MTEF, comprehensive student testing in Math and French, TA and block
grants to schools, empowering school management committees and DP coordination.

                                                        19
48.      The revised design was focused on a select number of critical activities which were needed in order
to achieve the overarching objectives of the Pooled Fund and were guided by a more accurate assessment
of what could be feasibly achieved and implemented given the fragile context, limited institutional capacity,
and significant reduction in available resources. Indeed, the reduced levels of pooled funding reflected, to
some extent, the DPs’ re-assessment of implementation and absorptive capacity of the education sector.
Appropriately, this was reflected in diminished scope of activities under the first restructuring, including
the redistribution of civil works activities among different actors (based on their comparative advantages
in specific areas) as well as adaption of modified activities to the existing capacity and implementation
mechanisms. Further, the decision to focus on human resource management in the revised design reflected
an increased emphasis on strengthening management within the Ministry. Modifications to indicators’
targets were scaled down under the second restructuring to reflect the withdrawal of KfW from the Pooled
Fund. The advantage of the restructurings was that learning from previous years and from the IDA-funded
operation resulted in the adoption of more effective methods in managing and implementing project
activities. The consecutive restructurings helped with the continual stocktaking of capacity and progress,
and under the second and third restructurings the end-of-project targets were recalibrated. The results chain
was well-defined and continued to be strengthened under each restructuring with each activity logically
linked to achievement of the PDO and based on a more realistic plan for implementation. The
implementation design and institutions were continually reviewed throughout the Project’s implementation
period. The project restructurings reflected the task team’s responsiveness to needed adjustments as
implementation progressed, thereby maintaining their relevance. The methods continue to be relevant and
are prioritized by the Government and development partners evidenced in the decision of the GPE-financed
project to build on many of the approaches supported under the FC-PSE. The relevance of the revised
design is rated Substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

49.      The achievements of the FC-PSE are analyzed in relation to each of the sub-objectives of the
Project. The overall outcome rating is weighted based on the portion of the total net grant amount disbursed
during each of the project phases as presented in Table 2. Though the PDO was revised under the first
restructuring to narrow its focus to basic education the three sub-objective of the PDO (in each iteration)
were: (i) enhancing equitable access; (ii) enhancing quality; and (iii) strengthening decentralized
management of the education system.




                                                     20
Phase I: July 2008 – August 24, 2011

50.      Though the Project was not made effective until October 2011, it is useful to explore this period as
a distinct phase of the Project given the unique circumstances. Deterioration on a number of other key
sector indicators was observed including decreases in the primary completion rate from 59 percent to 57
percent and increases in the primary repetition rate from 9 percent to 16 percent. The difficult political and
economic context prevented adequate Government and DP support that would have been necessary to make
progress on each of the key sector indicators some of which were monitored under the FC-PSE. The impact
on learning outcomes could not be determined as the last national assessment prior to that time had been
undertaken in 2007. As AFD and UNICEF were able to continue to operate in Guinea during this period
of non-engagement on the part of the Bank, the PCU was able to remain functional and it was able to launch
the construction of 99 primary classrooms planned under the Project. During this period, a baseline
assessment of teachers’ competencies and knowledge was undertaken which informed the design of the in-
service training program that was subsequently developed. As a result of lack of formal involvement and
limited information on most of the performance measures, it is difficult to evaluate the level of progress
towards achievement of the PDO during this period. Further, the Government’s contribution to the sector
budget remained low during this phase with a peak in 2009. In light of the above, the rating for progress
towards achievement of the PDO during this phase is rated Modest.

Phase 2: August 25, 2011 - December 10, 2012

51.      Objective 1: Enhancing Equitable Access to Basic Education. Following the restructuring of
the Project in 2011, the FC-PSE aimed to increase equitable access to basic education. As the Project had
only began implementation after the first restructuring, in order to undertake a civil works program of this
size, significant preparatory activities were necessary in order to successfully roll out the civil works
program nationwide. During this period, most procurement documents were reviewed and contracts signed
related to construction. This included the signing of contracts with NGOs to construct classrooms using a
community-based approach. A contract with the Bureau d’Ingenieur (BIC) was entered into in order to
provide systematic technical support to the Ministry’s department of infrastructure (SNIES) while the study
office (bureau d’etudes) had been tasked with conducting regular visits of the construction sites. In order
to ensure quality of infrastructure, monitoring and supervision of school construction was supported by the
project through workshops for construction supervisors and also by supporting SNIES in the development
of a user friendly and pedagogic manual as a useful resource for site supervisors. In addition, during this
roll out phase, targeted rural communities had developed their annual investment plans on which they were
to financing for school construction. These preparatory activities laid the foundation for improvements in
equitable access throughout the country while also strengthening capacity to manage a large school
construction program. During this initial phase of implementation, the following trends were observed:
GER (total/girls) in the nine target prefectures increased from 47 to 49.6 percent (and from 43 to 45.7
percent for girls); gross intake rate among girls increased slightly (from 77.7 percent to 78 percent); and the
number of direct project beneficiaries reached 767,559.31 In terms of intermediate-level indicators, in
addition to the 99 primary classrooms whose construction was being funded by the AFD, an additional
1,545 were under construction. Based on the evidence presented above, the rating for this objective within
Phase 2 is Substantial.

52.    Objective 2: Improving Quality of Basic Education. Following the 2011 restructuring, the FC-
PSE aimed to improve the quality of basic education. Some of the key activities undertaken during this


31
  It would not be appropriate to discuss achievements during this period relative to end-of-project targets as the
restructuring was undertaken in 2012 (and reporting most recent available data at the time) and the project was
scheduled to close in January 2013.

                                                       21
period included: a study tour of Ministry officials to learn from experience in the Gambia in carrying out
the EGRA and efforts commenced to support the Government in undertaking the EGRA. The Project took
steps to strengthen the project approach to the grants activity – with revision to the manual of procedures
for school grants and the provision of training to local entities. The teacher trainee recruitment process was
modified to ensure greater rigor in their selection which resulted in a reduced number of teacher trainees.
To this end, the Government agreed to provide scholarships to incentivize individuals to improve their
qualifications in order to qualify to become teacher trainees. A sensitization campaign was launched to
increase the number of teacher trainee applicants. In addition, ENI processes were harmonized and similar
methodologies for training adopted while the roles and responsibilities for administrative posts in the
institutes were developed. With regards to girls’ education, 125 schools were selected for participation and
250 teachers from these schools were trained in French, reading and student-centered pedagogy. In addition,
3,750 girls were provided supplementary private tutoring in French, math and sexual education and learning
materials were also provided to them. A TVET strategy was also supported and TA provided to introduce
market driven programs in TVET skills centers linked to employment opportunities. The TVET teacher
training school was also reopened.

53.      Trends observed during this period were the following: girls’ success rate on the examination for
entrance to 7th grade in 100 targeted schools increased from 49 to 53 percent; a student learning assessment
system at the primary level had been partially established, 2,895,400 textbooks had been purchased and
distributed to schools. The Bank and the Government had also developed an M&E system capable of
tracking the delivery of textbooks up to the school level. This rigorous system provided incentives as it held
local structures accountable for their delivery. In addition, 11,000 primary teachers were assessed in French
and Math of which 3,000 were selected to benefit from in-service training. Based on the information above,
the rating for this objective within Phase 2 is Substantial.

54.      Objective 3: Strengthening Central and Deconcentrated Management of the Education
System. Under the 2011 restructuring, the FC-PSE also aimed to strengthen management of the education
system more generally, with an emphasis on strengthening human resource management. During this
period, an inter-ministerial MTEF team was established with an accompanying methodology and action
plan. The sector policy letter and sectoral analyses were being revised and expanded for the 2013-2015
period. An MTEF was achieved (leading the effort amongst all sectors) which benefited from the
participation of Ministry officials in a South-South learning exchange with Senegal to learn from its
experience in carrying out an MTEF. The statistical campaign for 2011 had been carried out with school
level data made available and data for all subsectors was analyzed. Improvements in annual statistical data
were noted with comprehensive and regular data available for the entire sector and teacher management as
measured by the allocation of teachers (deployment index) was maintained at 0.70. Further, responsibility
for budget management and execution (of resources provided by the FC-PSE) was transferred to the
decentralized levels. Based on the above information, the rating for this objective within Phase 2 is
Substantial.

55.     In sum, given this was the first year of implementation, most activities commenced during this time
frame. Though indicators had been established, the targets of a number of these measures could not have
feasibly registered progress within a one-year time frame though the large majority of these targets were
achieved or exceed by the end of the project.32



32
  For example, implementation of annual budgeted action plans (PAAB) at the decentralized levels could also not be
verified since funds had been transferred only in October 2012 in time for the beginning of the school year and
implementation commenced only in 2012. And annual reading assessments planned under the Project had not yet
been undertaken as the assessment tools were under development during this period.

                                                       22
Phase 3: December 11, 2012 – December 25, 2013

56.      Objective 1: Enhancing Equitable Access to Basic Education. Achievements during this period
point to improvements in equitable access to basic education. During the third phase, construction of
primary classrooms continued using the three selected approaches and concrete steps had been taken to
address some of the issues identified related to monitoring and supervision of construction sites, including
the establishment of a small committee to ensure regular follow up and reporting to donors on the status of
the program. During this period, the following trends were observed: GER for the nine targeted prefectures
increased from 49.6 percent to 53 percent (45.7 percent to 47.8 percent for girls); the number of direct
project beneficiaries had more than doubled, increasing from 757,550 to 1,750,150; the gross intake rate
also increased from 82 to 85 percent (and from 78 to 80 percent among girls); and construction and
furnishing of 1,644 classrooms was underway with 615 of these having been fully completed. An estimated
73 percent of planned construction had been completed by this time with the remaining primary classrooms
expected to be completed by September 2013. Based on the evidence presented above, the rating for this
objective within Phase 3 is Substantial.

57.       Objective 2: Improving Quality of Basic Education. Efforts supported under the Project to
enhance the quality of basic education also continued. The procurement and delivery of textbooks increased
significantly with the number of textbooks procured and delivered reaching 6,695,080 and continued to be
monitored closely using local structures. Almost all public primary schools received grants which created
a positive dynamic within the schools and a number of individuals benefited from training provided relate
to their delivery. The 3,016 teachers that had been selected to benefit from in-service training participated
in a 25-day training which took place in September of 2012. This training, which covered both academic
and pedagogical skills, was supplemented with a five-day training in December as well as a number of other
activities. Some of the supplemental activities supported included classroom observations, regional
workshops, and training of school directors in learning assessment. It was found that 54 percent of teachers
benefiting from this training had improved results compared to baseline. The sensitization campaign
organized by the MEPU-EC continued to boost recruitment of qualified candidates and to ensure continuous
monitoring of teacher trainees’ progress throughout the training. As a result, 1,321 high school graduates
were elected to enter ENI compared to only 71 two years prior to this. Activities aimed at promoting girls’
education under the Project also contributed to the positive trends in their participation and performance on
the 7th grade entrance exam. Approximately 75.4 percent of girls participating in the program passed the
exam to enter 7th grade. In terms of learning assessments, 60 schools were implementing early grade
reading assessments (EGRA); learning assessments was carried out in grade 4 and a tracer study of tertiary
and TVET was ongoing. TA was ongoing to support the TVET teacher training school and to design new
skills training programs linked to employment opportunities. Based on the evidence presented above, the
rating for this objective within Phase 3 is Substantial.

58.      Objective 3: Strengthening Central and Deconcentrated Management of the Education
System. Important gains were observed in terms of strengthening management at the central and de-
concentrated levels, where by this time all decentralized levels were implementing annual budgeted action
plans. Sector directorates were made responsible for executing their own budget rather than the relying on
the financial controller within the Ministry of Finance (MOF), marking a major shift from the arrangements
prevailing prior to the Project’s launch. Annual education statistics data were made available at the
beginning of the school year and teacher management had improved (with the deployment index, for
Conakry only, reaching 76.6 (R-Squared)). With the support of TA from the Bank, training modules for
the newly appointed management analysts (assistants gestionnaires) had been developed and the manual
of procedures had been further expanded to spell out the government execution of the budget within a
MTEF approach. In addition to the launch of a diagnostic study within the PER (related to the function of


                                                     23
the DAFs), a review of the project management system was also under preparation. Based on the evidence
presented above, the rating for this objective within Phase 3 is Substantial.

Phase 4: December 26, 2013 - December 31, 2014

59.      Objective 1: Enhancing Equitable Access to Basic Education. During the last period of the
Project, planned activities to support an increase in equitable access to basic education under the operation
were in their final stages of implementation. Although construction was initially behind schedule, by the
end of the Project, 1698 classrooms had been constructed and furnished. As a result of efforts to strengthen
supervision and control of the school construction program, the quality of the structures had improved
significantly (regular supervision visits were conducted by a World Bank consultant). By the time of
Project closing, GER for the nine targeted prefectures had reached 57 percent (and 53 among girls), a
significant increase from just one year prior from 51 percent (and 46 percent among girls); the number of
project beneficiaries reached 1,870,408 (an increase of more than 120,000 since the previous phase); and
the gross intake rate had reached continued to increase from 86.1 percent (and 81.2 percent among girls)
up from 85 percent (and 80 percent among girls) from just one year prior. Based on the evidence presented
above, the rating for this objective within Phase 4 is Substantial.

60.      Objective 2: Improving Quality of Basic Education. Improvements to quality continued
through Project support to this area, particularly given the additional support to this area under the 2013
restructuring (with a reallocation of funding towards quality inputs). The number of textbooks provided by
the end of project reached 7,162,393 increasing the number of textbooks available to students throughout
the country and the textbook: student ratio. An additional 1,000 teachers benefitted from in-service teacher
training as a result of the reallocation under the restructuring and an estimated 80 percent of teachers who
had benefitted from this training showed improved results from baseline (a significant increase from 54
percent just one year prior). The Government provided rewards to 554 teachers to incentivize
improvements to the quality of teaching practices. The Pooled Fund had also provided school grants to
almost all primary public schools based on their school improvement plans. The learning assessment system
which had been established had been improved upon and 79 schools were implementing annual reading
assessments. Support to girls’ education initiatives continued with the provision of private tutoring and
participation in the FIERE program (though the success rate dropped from 75 to 71 percent yet was
significantly higher than the national average). Further, the percentage of students with a passing grade in
French (grade 3) reached 15.36, which was an increase from baseline. More than 20 new programs catering
to primary school drop-outs ( as well) were set up in four skills centers that use a competency-based
approach with skills training linked to labor market demand. Further, a cohort of TVET teacher trainers
completed their training in the TVET teacher training institute. Based on the evidence presented above, the
rating for this objective within Phase 4 is Substantial.

61.      An evaluation of school grants was also completed which found that the grants were disbursed in
accordance with the procedures manual specifically developed for the purpose. The media campaign to
sensitize beneficiaries proved to be effective introducing the necessary transparency for managing the fund.
The evaluation found the following: (i) although the results cannot be solely attributed to the school grants,
nevertheless, by the end of the Project, the grants had helped to reduce repetition rate and it had contributed
to improved school participation rate and completion rate at grade 6 level, and an increased success rate at
the grade 7 entrance examination; (ii) parents, the local administrations, and the local communities were
heavily involved in monitoring the flow of the grants. Parents confirmed improved motivation and
attributed their children’s success to the school grants. They voluntarily contributed to housing and
supporting teachers, especially the community teachers; (iii) with the support of parents, new competencies
were developed especially in the management of school assets and the mediation of conflicts; and (iv)



                                                      24
community artisans and workmen volunteered their professional services to building school desks and
chairs, classrooms and sports fields.

62.     Objective 3: Strengthening Central and Deconcentrated Management of the Education
System. The achievements were maintained and further scaled up during this last phase of the Project with
all decentralized levels implementing annual budgeted action plans (PAABs). Annual sector statistics were
again made available for the start of the school year and teacher management (as described using the
deployment index, in Conakry only) had improved reaching 76.7 (R-Squared). The findings of the project
management assessment were used by the Government during this phase to develop a proposal for the new
GPE project which was submitted to DPs for their feedback/assessment and the findings from the PER and
were disseminated in the fall of 2014. Significant capacity was built in the MEPU-EC toward programmatic
budgeting and deconcentrating the budget execution to the MEPU-EC. This was a significant public
financial management (PFM) reform supported by the Project and contributed to stronger linkages with the
Ministry of Finance (MOF). Based on the evidence presented above, the rating for this objective within
Phase 4 is Substantial.

3.3 Efficiency

Implementation efficiency

63.       Although the majority of the envisioned outputs and outcomes under the restructured design were
effectively achieved by the project closing date, the efficiency of implementation was Modest given the
initial lag in launching project-supported activities due to the political situation in addition to the need to
extend the project closing date three different times in order to provide adequate time to complete activities
which were essential for the achievement of the PDO. However, it is worth highlighting that the actual
implementation period of the project was only three years.

Cost-effectiveness

64.      Primary school construction. The construction of primary classrooms under the Pooled Fund was
relatively cost-effective when analyzed against other relevant comparators. The average cost per classroom
built under the Pooled Fund ranged from US$13,104 to US$17,136 with a large portion of schools
constructed under the Project built using the lower cost approaches (see table below). The average cost of
a primary classroom in Ghana is estimated to be US$16,65133. In Sudan, an example of a post-conflict
environment, the average cost of a primary classroom is estimated to be as high as US$30,00034. By the
end of the project, the construction of the 1,644 had been completed using the three different approaches—
community-based, NGOs, and through small and medium enterprises. The following table provides the
comparisons:

65.      Textbooks. The Project financed the procurement and delivery of textbooks at an average unit cost
ranging from US$0.65 and US$1.4 for primary school core subjects. The unit cost is in line with other
projects implemented during the same time period in the Ivory Coast, Niger and Burundi where primary
school textbooks were acquired for unit costs ranging between US$1.1 and US$1.4. The procurement of
textbooks was successfully completed and the contracts were signed with savings of GNF 3 million (about
US$399). This helped with the procurement of additional textbooks. Efficiency gains (or savings) were
realized due to lower unit costs as a result of the volume of textbooks that were procured.35 and also due to
gains in the exchange rate differential between the US dollar and the GNF making it possible to procure a
larger than estimated number of textbooks.

66.     Girls academic achievement: although the scale of the intervention was small (about 4000 girls),
specifically taylored tutoring in math and french for girls in 6th grade contributed to producing higher
learning achievement and higher level of success in end of the primary examination to transition to
secondary school.

67.     The economic rationale for investing in basic education remains strong in Guinea. According to
recent PREM estimates (2014), the estimated marginal returns to education (baseline – no education) are
64 percent for an individual who has completed primary schooling and 89 percent for an individual who
has completed lower secondary schooling.

Sustainability

68.      The Project contributed to complementing and sustaining reforms that were already underway since
the early-2000s. The Project financed the purchase of textbooks on the basis of experience gathered from
implementing the IDA project. Consequently, the cycle for replacing textbooks was adopted. The approach
to civil works through the use of multiple agents helped to address key constraints and put in place viable
options for effective construction, making it possible to replicate the approach for the follow-on project36.




35
   Gains in the exchange rate differential between the USD and the GNF also made it possible to procure a larger
number of textbooks than had originally envisaged.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

80.      The Project contributed positively by adopting a clear pro-poor investment strategy, in that the
districts with the largest levels of either absolute or relative need received a great proportion of financial
assistance to improve access. This determination is based on the fact that the Project specifically targeted
prefectures with the greatest need. As the ESP and PRSP II were developed at around the same time, they
are strictly aligned. The project’s focus on promoting equitable access was a pro-poor strategy, promoting
the inclusion of underserved populations, including populations living in rural areas as well as girls. The
poverty impact of the Project was primarily in increasing access for the poorest to primary education,
requiring greater budgetary allocation for education from Government. The Project also contributed to
shifting the benefit incidence of public education expenditure in favor of the poorest quintile.

81.      Approximately 48 percent of project beneficiaries were female. The Project provided specific
incentives for girls’ education to meet education demand. A large number of schools benefited from
interventions based on the FIERE approach (strategy to keep young girls in school) and 250 teachers were
trained in French, reading and student-centered pedagogy. Approximately 3,750 grade 6 female students
benefited from private tutoring in Mathematics and French. This was intended to increase their chances of
successfully completing primary school. The expansion of the program showed encouraging results with
71.3 percent of girls participating in the program passing the exam to enter grade 7 compared to 63 percent
of girls at the national (public and private) and 58 percent for public only. The social development benefits
of greater numbers of females completing primary education is directly linked to reduced fertility, improved
healthcare, and schooling for girls.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

82.      There was strong institutional and political will to improve access and quality of education. MEPU-
EC received targeted support for institutional capacity strengthening. School grants created a positive
dynamic within the school, between the schools and communities. In addition, the deconcentrated levels
also received support to catalyze intended partnerships. Sensitization campaigns with respect to teacher
training helped to raise awareness about the importance of investing in teacher qualifications. Donor
collaboration within the pooled fund setting was strong and there was positive complementarities between
the AFD and the Bank as the SE of the FTI CF for the Pooled Fund. The successive restructurings
strengthened the focus on institutional development at central and decentralized levels. This helped to
institute the implementation of PAABs at decentralized levels. System oversight was progressively
strengthened for the activities that were retained.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

70.     The Risk to Development Outcome following the end of the Project is rated Moderate. Institutional
capacity was strengthened as a result of the training provided under the Project, specifically with regards to
FM, procurement and overall project management. This was further complemented by support of the sector
provided through the 12-year IDA-funded Project. Capacity in these areas will be further strengthened
under the new Pooled Fund operation in order to successfully manage activities in the sector and to
implement large-scale reform initiatives. Specifically, the Pooled Fund aims to strengthen overall
governance of the sector through interventions to build capacity for effective management and coordination
of the system, improved efficiency and consolidation and acceleration of interventions promoting
decentralization. The Pooled Fund is supportive of the current ESP (2015-2017) and aims to maintain gains
observed under this Project and to make more progress in terms of increasing equitable access to quality
education and in terms of strengthening overall management of the sector. The Pooled Fund also supports
a number of activities which were successfully implemented under this operation including, among others:
the provision of school grants; construction of classrooms using a variety of implementation modalities;
and training of teachers and provision of pedagogical support.

71.      In 2014, the Government pledged to increase public funding for education to 19.2 percent of the
national budget by 2017, corresponding to 4.6 percent of GDP, and increase the primary education
allocation to 46.3 percent of the education budget also by 2017. It has also pledged to accelerate public
financial management (PFM reforms). Despite the Government’s commitment, the country is facing some
fiscal constraints which could pose some challenges to scaling up some of the project activities and
continuing to ensure positive sector wide gains. In particular, the recurrent costs associated with the newly
constructed classrooms will require financial support in terms of upkeep and proper maintenance. This
issue is of particular concern in light of the recent EVD outbreak with Guinea being one of the most
significantly affected countries in the region. The longer-term development impact of this project may be
more limited than initially anticipated as the Government tries to contain and put a stop to the EVD
epidemic. In an effort to control the outbreak, it was necessary to close schools for several months in turn
limiting the instructional time of children. Though efforts are being made to recapture this time, this lapse
can have a negative impact on learning outcomes. However, within the new GPE project, funding from the
Ebola Recovery and Reconstruction Trust Fund37 is providing support to measures to limit its impact on
the education sector. Further, a number of DPs have committed support to education for this upcoming
period including AFD and UNICEF as well as IDA which is currently providing support to skills training
for youth, many of whom are unemployed, which is critical in light of the growing pressure at the secondary
level. In light of the above, the Risk to Development Outcome is rated Moderate. 

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

72.     The original FC-PSE was prepared in an environment of political and economic uncertainty. The
design and scope of the program was based on the adoption of pooled funding mechanism as an overt
expression of donor harmonization consistent with the 2005 Paris Declaration. The FC-PSE design was
innovative, ambitious and aimed to support a wide variety of activities across the entire education sector.

     Republic of Guinea. July 9, 2015. Pooled-Fund for Basic Education (FoCEB). Report No. PAD1085.

                                                       29
The operation’s design was informed by lessons learned from similar operations and drew on the Bank’s
experience within the education sector in Guinea. Despite the strong alignment of the Project’s objectives
with the Government’s own strategic agenda and sector program, the FC-PSE’s original design was overly
ambitious in terms of its scope and its estimation of the institutional and operational capacity of the
Government to implement and monitor such a large operation.

73.      Following the reduction in financing from the FTI and the reengagement of the Bank with the
country, the FC-PSE was reviewed and restructured collaboratively with the Government and DPs to ensure
that the design appropriately reflected the difficult country context at the time while also ensuring that
adequate financing would be available to support the implementation of a select number of strategic
interventions aimed at increasing equitable access to quality education and strengthening management in
basic education. On the basis of the above, Quality at Entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

74.      Throughout the implementation period of the Pooled Fund, the Bank responded appropriately at
each juncture to adjust the operation’s design in order to increase the likelihood of attaining the envisioned
outputs and outcomes of the Project. Given the Bank’s long-standing support to the sector and a proactive
task team, the operation was able to be restructured and the GA reinstated shortly after the Bank was
officially allowed to reengage with the Government. It was one of the first DPs to reengage in the sector
which was largely possible as a result of the efforts put forth to maintain continued dialogue with the
technical teams in the country. The Bank provided both the much needed technical support and guidance
in order to swiftly launch large scale project activities including construction of primary classrooms. In
addition to participating in joint supervision missions, the Bank team held periodic meetings with the
Government and DPs to discuss progress of the Pooled Fund, and more generally, progress within the sector
and strategy development. This proactivity was particularly useful as neither an HD or education-tasked
staff was in the country office at the time. The task team responded in a timely manner to requests to
restructure the FC-PSE. Though the restructuring papers clearly show changes in the RF and in planned
activities, the inclusion and exclusion of indicators in ISRs made it more difficult to systematically track
achievements during the initial phase of the Project, though M&E design and utilization improved
significantly during the course of the operation’s implementation. Supervision was carried out diligently
for the portion of the funding that was administered by the Bank, the fiduciary due diligence was executed
in a timely manner, the proceeds of the Grant were reallocated as necessary, and adherence to safeguards’
policies was monitored.

75.      As the SE, the Bank played an important role in supporting donor coordination. In addition to joint
supervision missions, the Bank ensured that M&E of the ESP was carried out and that budget planning and
expenditure analysis were carried out in a timely manner. These aspects showed the Bank’s commitment
to shared objectives with the Government and DPs active in the sector. One limitation of the Bank’s
performance during supervision was the decision not to formally track and report on all funding committed
to the Pooled Fund but rather to focus mostly on the portion for which it was legally mandated to supervise.
Based on the above, Quality of Supervision is rated Satisfactory.  
 
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.      Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This rating is based on the combined
rating of Quality at Entry (MU), Quality of Supervision (S), and Overall Outcome Rating (MS).



                                                     30
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.      Although the operation was strongly aligned with the Government’s strategy it was originally
overambitious and did not account for the capacities of the various institutions on which it relied for its
effective implementation. The difficult political and economic environment which culminated in the coup
d’etat in 2008 also undermined the Government’s ability to initially commit the resources required to
implement the activities to be supported under the Pooled Fund. The GPE Grant was reinstated in 2011
following re-engagement of the Bank with a new Government. Though the Government’s capacity to
provide support to the sector improved following the Bank’s formal reengagement, the level of resources
made available to the sector did not remain consistent. Despite the difficulties and the challenges, the
Government was proactive in its participation in supervision missions and joint annual sector reviews,
preparing all of the necessary documentation required to evaluate progress and to ensure continued
improvements. The Government also effectively carried out its fiduciary functions in particular submitting
annual financial audits and detailed procurements plans. Efforts were also made to strengthen its support
to supervision of construction activities and to strengthen adherence to safeguards requirements. Overall
Government performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory due to the strong performance notwithstanding
the challenging and shifting context in which the Project was implemented.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.      Despite the challenges, the technical teams in the ministries of education continued to function
throughout the period from 2009 to 2011 when the Bank had formally disengaged with the country. During
this period, as a result of the support of AFD and UNICEF, the PCU was able to remain intact and
functional. Soon after the Bank’s formal re-engagement, the Ministry was able to quickly refocus its
attention towards the Project and ensured its timely start up. Since many of the activities required support
and input from decentralized levels, this operation required continued support from the central ministry.
The Ministry also maintained strong dialogue with the Bank and worked collaboratively with the project
team to adjust the project design in light of financial support available and the necessary refocusing of
priorities. Once the groundwork for project activities was prepared in the Project’s initial phase, the project
momentum remained high throughout the project life. Based on the above, the implementing agencies’
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Grantee Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     Overall Grantee Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This rating is based on the
combined rating of Government Performance (MS), Implementing Agency Performance (MS) and the
Overall Outcome Rating (MS).

6. Lessons Learned

80.     Project design should consider the fragility of the economic and political environment. The
FC-PSE was designed in a politically, socially and institutionally fragile setting. The Pooled Fund approach
to supporting the Government in achieving its sector objectives was appropriate in light of the 2005 Paris
Declaration and efforts to promote sustainability of investments in the sector. The complex design of the
FC-PSE which supported activities across the sector was reliant on strong institutional capacity and inter-
ministerial coordination was ambitious. Though the project was significantly reduced in terms of scope
and implementation needs in response to reduced funding in 2011 and 2012, it may have been useful at

                                                      31
either of these times to reduce the scope even further in order to better ensure the timely and effective
implementation of project-supported activities and effective M&E.

81.     Pooled funding can be an effective mechanism for providing support to achievement of the
Government’s strategic objectives in the education sector. This project’s strong alignment with the
Government strategies and support from other DPs active in the sector including AFD, KfW and UNICEF
promoted harmonization of efforts, reduced duplication of activities, and promoted continued support to
the education sector during a period in which the Bank was only able to provide informal technical support
to the Government.

82.     The Bank’s swift engagement following periods of crisis can be instrumental in ensuring that
Governments have the necessary financial and technical support to continue to implement their
sector strategies and to provide services at a time when its own resources and capacity are more
limited. The timely reengagement of the Bank under this Project was possible, in large part, due to the
proactivity demonstrated by the Project team in maintaining technical dialogue with the Project team and
with the DPs that were active on the ground throughout the period following the coup d’etat.

83.     Building on the strengths of complementary projects and helps to avoid duplication,
cumulatively reinforce institutional capacity, and strengthen national capacity. The FC-PSE design
and implementation was able to benefit from the ongoing IDA-funded Project. In addition to ensuring
complementary in activities, it laid the foundation for strong cooperation and coordination within the sector
and a good working relationship with the Government. As a result of the Bank’s long-standing support to
Guinea, the FC-PSE was able to re-engage in the sector and begin implementation shortly after the Bank’s
formal reengagement.

84.     The establishment of a robust M&E system is instrumental in ensuring that the outputs and
outcomes of an operation are properly documented. Though the M&E system established and used in
the context of the Project required input from various decentralized levels, the information provided by this
system was critical for undertaking joint annual sector reviews and for adequately documenting and
reporting on achievements observed under this operation.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The original PDO of the Pooled Fund (FC-PSE) or Education Sector Development Program was
“part of the Recipient’s Program, which contributes to enhancing equitable access to and quality in
education at all levels, with focus on primary education and literacy training, while also strengthening
central and deconcentrated management of the education system.” 38 In the main text of the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD), ten project development objective (PDO)-level indicators39 are listed in the
three key areas (also aligned with Components 1 through 3 of the FC-PSE design):

     (i)      Improving Equitable Access: (a) access rate in first grade (total/girls) to increase from 77
              percent (to be determined) in 2007 to 88 percent (to be determined) in 2010; (b) primary GER
              to increase from 79 percent in 2007 to 90 percent in 2010; (c) ratio girls: boys in primary to
              increase from 0.83 in 2007 to 0.92 in 2010; (d) completion rate in primary (total/girls) to
              increase from 59 percent (to be determined) in 2007 to 71 percent (to be determined) in 2010;
              and (e) transition rate to lower secondary to decline from 73 percent40 in 2007 to 65 percent in
              2010.

     (ii)     Improving Quality: (a) percentage of students with a passing grade in French (year 4) to
              increase from 50 percent (2005 data) in 2007 to 55 percent (2009 data) in 2010; (b) percentage
              of students with a passing grade in Math (year 4) to increase from 51 percent (2005 data) in
              2007 to 57 percent (2009 data) in 2010; and (c) repetition rate in primary to remain stable at 9
              percent from 2007 to 2010.

     (iii)    Improving Management of the Educational System: (a) portion of recurrent State expenditures
              for education to increase from 13.7 percent in 2007 to 18.1 percent in 2010; and (b) portion of
              education expenditures for primary to increase from 33 percent in 2007 to 42 percent in 2010.

2.      The GA dated July 30, 2008 only specifies that the Recipient shall monitor and evaluate the
progress of the Program and the Project and prepare Program and Project Reports.

3.      This Program was designed in the broader context of the Government’s ESP (2008-2015)41 which
aimed to: improve the country’s education system in line with the education MDGs (E-MDGs) and the
targets of the EFA-FTI Indicative Framework support the development of human capital as well as
economic growth; and in turn contribute to poverty reduction in the country. The education strategy was
also detailed in the sector policy letter. Support to the Government in achievement of its sector objectives
would be provided through the Pooled Fund (FC-PSE) with contributions from EFA-FTI Catalytic Fund,
KfW and AFD. In addition, IDA support to the ESP and the Government’s reform program was provided
through the EFA Project which was under implementation at the time that the Pooled Fund was being
prepared (this operation was designed as a three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL) for the period 2001-
2013).



38
   In the main text of the PAD, this is worded a little bit differently with the objective of the FC-PSE being to enhancing
equitable access to and quality in education at all levels – with focus on primary education – and literacy training,
while also strengthening central and deconcentrated management of the education system.
39
   The GA does not make any references to the KPIs.
40
   In a subsequent implementation status report (ISR) this figure was described as an accurate with the accurate
baseline value listed as 65 percent.

4.       The rationale behind the Pooled Fund approach was that it would promote harmonization of donors’
support of Government efforts, improve efficiency of efforts to support the ESP while also reducing
transaction costs for Government in line with the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Pooled
Fund (FC-PSE) supported a sub-set of the ESP referred to as the ‘FC-PSE’ program. The ESP and Guinea’s
PRSP II were elaborated at the same time and as a result were strongly aligned. Further, the FC-PSE
indicators in the original design were taken directly from the ESP Matrix.

5.      The FC-PSE aimed to address a number of challenges including: (i) low access to education for the
poor (particularly in rural areas and among girls); (ii) high dropout rates, in part a result of a large number
of schools not providing the complete six-grade primary cycle. Though multigrade schooling had been
encouraged in sparsely populated areas, it had been implemented with only varying levels of success; (iii)
increase in number of students in secondary education leading to overcrowded classrooms (necessitating
improved retention at this level); (iv) limited quality of education despite investments to improve teaching
and learning, especially in primary education, to date; (v) and management methods in education
administration which were inefficiency and not likely to be sustainable without continued support from
DPs; and (vi) insufficient allocations for the sector and allocations within the sector.

6.      As described earlier, the Project was approved in 2008 and was scheduled to close on August 31,
2011. Though it was scheduled to become effective in January 2009, it did not become effective until
October of 2011. In 2008, there was a coup d’etat in Guinea which prevented the FTI Grant from becoming
effective, although project effectiveness conditions had been met. The World Bank Policy [OP7.30]
"Dealings with De Facto Governments" had been triggered and several months later, in September 30, 2009
the country fell into arrears. This led to the suspension of the Bank’s formal engagement in the country and
the sector, for the FC-PSE this meant that the Bank had not legally entered into its role as SE.42 In 2011
when the arrears were cleared, the Bank formally reengaged with the country On June 6, 2011 the waiver
to World Bank OP13.00 "Signing of Legal documents and effectiveness of loans and credits" was issued
and approximately three months later on September 22, 2011, the EFA-FTI Grant agreement was reinstated
and the Pooled Fund (with Bank as SE) became effective on October 20, 2011.

7.      The Project was restructured three separate times, as follows:

8.       Just prior to the reinstatement of the GA, the project was restructured (level 1). The FTI amount
for the Pooled Fund was reduced from US$117.8 million to US$64 million, with the World Bank assigned
to manage US$40 million as the SE and UNICEF had been made responsible for US$24 million as
Implementing Entity (IE) as it was able to continue its activities in the sector during the period of
disengagement. The PDO was revised to focus only on providing support to basic education, and the scope
of activities was reduced and reoriented. Finally, the project closing date was extended from the original
date of August 31, 2011 to January 15, 2013 as this extension was stipulated by FTI.

9.        The Project was restructured again (level 1) in 2012 in response to the withdrawal of KfW from
the pooled fund since legislative elections did not take place as anticipated. The Project activities and
relevant targets were reduced (though the PDO was not revised) and a more realistic timeframe was
introduced allowing for additional time to complete project activities) with a one year extension of the
project closing date from January 15, 2013 to December 31, 2013. The additional time was particularly
critical for the school construction activities – as it would require more than one year of implementation

  However, the first disbursement by the French Agency for Development AFD within the pooled fund, provided
sufficient funding to ensure that the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) could remain operational. The AFD also funded
the evaluation of teachers (to prepare for in-service training) and the launch of the construction of 99 primary
classrooms. Providing a total amount of funding during this period of US$2.3 million.

(and accounted for a large portion of the grant funding) although the design comprising three modalities of
construction [NGOs, Memorandum of Understanding with the Programme d’Appui aux Communautés
Villageoises Program in support of village communities (Community Driven Development Project
supported by the World Bank)], and Small and Medium Enterprises, remained fully appropriate.

10.     The last restructuring (level one) was approved on December 26, 2013. Under this restructuring,
financing from the Pooled Fund was reallocated from the construction of middle schools which could not
be completed by the project closing date to quality inputs including in-service teacher training, the provision
of learning materials for early grades and textbooks benefiting secondary schools, and for continued
technical assistance. In addition, the closing date was extended by one year from December 31, 2013 to
December 31, 2014 and indicators and targets were adjusted accordingly.

11.     Most of the FC-PSE activities were piloted or even implemented nationwide during the previous
Government-supported Education for All Program (Programme Education Pour Tous43--PEPT), and were
amended to reflect the results of various PEPT evaluations. Further, specific operational guidelines had
been developed for certain broad categories of activities, such as teacher training, school construction, and
grant-supported school improvement projects. These manuals were included in the suite of guidelines that
comprised the Operational Manual of the Education Sector Program—OM-PSE, endorsed by the
Government and donors. The original FC-PSE program comprised three main components: (i) improving
equitable access to basic and non-formal education; (ii) improving quality of basic and non-formal
education; and (iii) strengthening management of the education sector.

12.     The program and project scope of activities were amended during the first project restructuring in
2011, with some activities being retained with amendments, some new, and one activity that was dropped.
The following table highlights the changes to the Project design (as reflected in the GAs over the Project
life).

   PEPT was the Government’s education sector program prepared in 2001. It aimed to support the achievement of
the EFA goals for the period 2002-06. It was a first effort to unite all donors around a common framework in support
of the Government-led education sector program. However, it was short lived, in part, because there was no common
framework to finance the PEPT and donors continued to implement their activities independently. Under the PSE,
some donors decided to use a common funding mechanism and all donors had agreed to sign a Partnership Agreement
committing them to align their interventions in the education sector with the Government-led PSE.

13.      Under each of the restructurings, the RF was modified with indicators re-aligned to be re-oriented
from a Program perspective to a Project level reporting format through the project restructurings to make
them manageable. Further, they were calibrated (including PSRs and ISRs44) to available levels of partner
funds (especially FTI or GPE and KfW) and reduced scope of the project. Changes introduced to the Results
Framework (revised, new and dropped indicators) under the Project can be found in Annex 10. This annex
describes adjustments made to baseline values and end-of-project targets and provides a brief description
of the level of achievement for each PDO- and intermediate-level indicator.

14.      Progress made under each Project Component is described below.


Overview of Achievements by Component

Component 1: Improving Equitable Access to Basic and Non-Formal Education [Appraisal: US$119
million; Original FTI Financing: US$90.9 million; Revised FTI Financing45: US$23.7 million; Actual
Expenditure: US$22.7 million].46

15.      Objective: This Component aimed to support equitable and regulated access to basic education
and non-formal education. It aimed to increase enrollment rates in pre-school, and primary and lower
secondary education, support specific measures for disabled children, and expand access to literacy training.
In addition, this component was intended to support the creation of professional integration courses for
primary and lower secondary leavers, as well as professional training specifically oriented towards the
mining sector. Sub-components included: (a) improving pre-school, primary, and secondary level
educational infrastructure by constructing/rehabilitating and furnishing primary and secondary classrooms;
(b) expanding educational access of primary-level students with special needs, additional training for
teachers, provision of special education materials, and, in some cases, minor civil works, additional
pedagogical support, including in monitoring and evaluation, to teachers at the schools; (c) expanding
access to literacy training; (d) establishing professional integration courses for primary and lower secondary
leavers; and (e) increasing availability of skills labor for the mining sector. Over the course of the Project,
1,698 primary school classrooms were constructed. Revisions to Component 1 during the life of the Project
is presented in Table 1 below. During the first restructuring, Component 1 was revised to focus only on
basic education with a few activities including those supporting pre-school and provision of literacy training
being taken over by UNICEF and skills availability for the mining sector also no longer supported under
the revised design. Under the third restructuring, the construction of lower secondary schools was no longer
included as a Project-supported activity under this Component.




44
   The number of indicators reported in the ISRs varied across the life of the project from ten (10) PDO-level and
twenty-nine (29) intermediate-level in the first project status report (PSR) to six (6) PDO-level and eleven (11)
intermediate-level indicators.
45
   These are the values for the 2011 Restructuring Project which included revised financial figures based on the revised
FTI allocation.

Achievements

16.      During the first phase of the Project, AFD was able to fund the launch of construction of 99 primary
classrooms planned under the Project. Following the restructuring of the Project and its effectiveness in
2011, the FC-PSE aimed to increase equitable access to basic education. As the Project had only began
implementation after the first restructuring, in order to undertake a civil works program of this size,
significant preparatory activities were necessary in order to successfully roll out the civil works program
nationwide. During this period, most procurement documents were reviewed and contracts signed related
to construction. This included the signing of contracts with NGOs to construct classrooms using a
community-based approach. A contract with the Bureau d’Ingenieur (BIC) was entered into in order to
provide systematic technical support to the Ministry’s department of infrastructure (SNIES) while the study
office (bureau d’etudes) had been tasked with conducting regular visits of the construction sites. In order
to ensure quality of infrastructure, monitoring and supervision of school construction was supported by the
project through workshops for construction supervisors and also by supporting SNIES in the development
of a user friendly and pedagogic manual as a useful resource for site supervisors. In addition, during this
roll out phase, targeted rural communities had developed their annual investment plans on which they were
to financing for school construction. These preparatory activities laid the foundation for improvements in
equitable access throughout the country while also strengthening capacity to manage a large school
construction program. During this initial phase of implementation, the following trends were observed:
GER (total/girls) in the nine target prefectures increased from 47 to 49.6 percent (and from 43 to 45.7
percent for girls); gross intake rate among girls increased slightly (from 77.7 percent to 78 percent); and the
number of direct project beneficiaries reached 767,559.47 In terms of intermediate-level indicators, in
addition to the 99 primary classrooms whose construction was being funded by the AFD, an additional
1,545 were under construction.

17.      During the third phase, construction of primary classrooms continued using the three selected
approaches and concrete steps had been taken to address some of the issues identified related to monitoring
and supervision of construction sites, including the establishment of a small committee to ensure regular
follow up and reporting to donors on the status of the program. During this period, the following trends
were observed: GER for the nine targeted prefectures increased from 49.6 percent to 53 percent (45.7
percent to 47.8 percent for girls); the number of direct project beneficiaries had more than doubled,
increasing from 757,550 to 1,750,150; the gross intake rate also increased from 82 to 85 percent (and from
78 to 80 percent among girls); and construction and furnishing of 1,644 classrooms was underway with 615
of these having been fully completed. An estimated 73 percent of planned construction had been completed
by this time with the remaining primary classrooms expected to be completed by September 2013.

18.      During the last period of the Project, planned activities to support an increase in equitable access
to basic education under the operation were in their final stages of implementation. Although construction
was initially behind schedule, by the end of the Project, 1698 classrooms had been constructed and furnished.
As a result of efforts to strengthen supervision and control of the school construction program, the quality
of the structures had improved significantly. By the time of Project closing, GER for the nine targeted
prefectures had reached 57 percent (and 53 among girls), a significant increase from just one year prior
from 51 percent (and 46 percent among girls); the number of project beneficiaries reached 1,870,408 (an
increase of more than 120,000 since the previous phase); and the gross intake rate had reached continued
to increase from 86.1 percent (and 81.2 percent among girls) up from 85 percent (and 80 percent among
girls) from just one year prior.


47
  It would not be appropriate to discuss achievements during this period relative to end-of-project targets as the
restructuring was undertaken in 2012 (and reporting most recent available data at the time) and the project was
scheduled to close in January 2013.

Component 2: Improving Quality of Basic and Non-Formal Education [Appraisal: US$26 million;
Original FTI Financing: US$20.1 million; Revised FTI Financing: US$11.8 million; Actual
Expenditure: US$12.6 million.]48

19.      Objective: The objective of this Component was to improve the quality and relevance of basic and
non-formal education, with particular focus on the acquisition of pedagogical materials, provide initial and
continued teacher training, provide block grants to Primary Education Delegations (Délégation Scolaire de
l’Enseignement Élementaire--DSEE), the MEDPU-EC administrative level below the prefecture, and
student evaluations. The following six sub-components were supported under Component 2: (i) Acquiring
and supplying free textbooks and teachers’ guides for public and private primary and secondary schools;
(ii) supporting initial training for primary and secondary teachers; (iii) Supporting continued training for
primary and secondary teachers; (iv) Providing block grants to schools and DSEE; (v) Conducting nation-
wide student learning assessments at primary level (year 4—2008; year 6—2009; and year 2—2010) and
lower secondary level (2009); and (vi) Implementing curriculum reform in higher education. Revisions to
Component 2 during the life of the Project, can be found in Table 1 above. Under the first restructuring in
2011, the Component description was revised to focus only on basic education with adjustments to activities
and introduction of a few new activities. Under the third restructuring, additional funding was reallocated
to this Component for a number of activities including the provision of additional textbooks and training of
lower secondary school teachers.

Achievements

20.      During the first phase, AFD was able to support the evaluation of teachers. Following the 2011
restructuring, the FC-PSE aimed to improve the quality of basic education. Some of the key activities
undertaken during this period included: a study tour of Ministry officials to learn from experience in the
Gambia in carrying out the EGRA and efforts commenced to support the Government in undertaking the
EGRA. The Project took steps to strengthen the project approach to the grants activity – with revision to
the manual of procedures for school grants and the provision of training to local entities. The teacher trainee
recruitment process was modified to ensure greater rigor in their selection which resulted in a reduced
number of teacher trainees. To this end, the Government agreed to provide scholarships to incentivize
individuals to improve their qualifications in order to qualify to become teacher trainees. In addition, a
sensitization campaign was launched to increase the number of teacher trainee applicants. In addition, ENI
processes were harmonized and similar methodologies for training adopted while the roles and
responsibilities for administrative posts in the institutes were developed. With regards to girls’ education,
125 schools were selected for participation and 250 teachers from these schools were trained in French,
reading and student-centered pedagogy. In addition, 3,750 girls were provided supplementary private
tutoring in French, math and sexual education and learning materials were also provided to them.

21.     During the third phase of the Project, efforts supported under the Project to enhance the quality of
basic education also continued. The procurement and delivery of textbooks increased significantly with
the number of textbooks procured and delivered reaching 6,695,080 and continued to be monitored closely
using local structures. Almost all public primary schools received grants which created a positive dynamic
within the schools and a number of individuals benefited from training provided relate to their delivery.
The 3,016 teachers that had been selected to benefit from in-service training participated in a 25-day training
which took place in September of 2012. This training, which covered both academic and pedagogical skills,
was supplemented with a five-day training in December as well as a number of other activities. Some of
the supplemental activities supported included classroom observations, regional workshops, and training of

school directors in learning assessment. It was found that 54 percent of teachers benefiting from this
training had improved results compared to baseline. The sensitization campaign organized by the MEPU-
EC continued to boost recruitment of qualified candidates and to ensure continuous monitoring of teacher
trainees’ progress throughout the training. As a result, 1,321 high school graduates were elected to enter
ENI compared to only 71 two years prior to this. Activities aimed at promoting girls’ education under the
Project also contributed to the positive trends in their participation and performance on the 7th grade
entrance exam. Approximately 75.4 percent of girls participating in the program passed the exam to enter
7th grade. In terms of learning assessments, 60 schools were implementing early grade reading assessments
(EGRA); learning assessments was carried out in grade 4 and a tracer study of tertiary and TVET was
ongoing.

22.      Improvements to quality continued through Project support to this area, particularly given the
additional support to this area under the 2013 restructuring (with a reallocation of funding towards quality
inputs). The number of textbooks provided by the end of project reached 7,162,393 increasing the number
of textbooks available to students throughout the country and the textbook: student ratio. An additional
1,000 teachers benefitted from in-service teacher training as a result of the reallocation under the
restructuring and an estimated 80 percent of teachers who had benefitted from this training showed
improved results from baseline (a significant increase from 54 percent just one year prior). The Government
provided rewards to 554 teachers to incentivize improvements to the quality of teaching practices. The
Pooled Fund had also provided school grants to almost all primary public schools. The learning assessment
system which had been established had been improved upon and 79 schools were implementing annual
reading assessments. Support to girls’ education initiatives continued with the provision of private tutoring
and participation in the FIERE program (though the success rate dropped from 75 to 71 percent yet was
significantly higher than the national average). Further, the percentage of students with a passing grade in
French (grade 3) reached 15.36, which was an increase from baseline.

Component 3: Improving Management of the Educational System [Appraisal: US$9 million (6 percent
of pool-funded program); Original FTI Financing: US$6.8 million; Revised FTI Financing: US$4.5
million; Actual Expenditure: US$4.7 million].49

23.     Objective: The objective of this component was to strengthen the central and deconcentrated
management of the sector, including its infrastructure services, by supporting four sub-components were:
(i) enhancing the SNIES capacity to monitor civil works; (ii) constructing and rehabilitating regional and
prefectural administrative education offices; (iii) strengthening planning and monitoring capacity at the
regional and prefectural level; and (iv) strengthening the MEPU-EC at the central level by supporting a
number of its functions. In the Government ICR the objective is articulated as follows: to improve the
capacity for mobilizing, programming, allocating and management of resources by developing appropriate
management procedures for programming and following up on implementation. Revisions to Component
3 during the life of the Project can be found in Table 1 above. Under the 2011 restructuring, the construction
of administrative offices was dropped from this Component and increased emphasis was placed on human
resources management.

Achievements

24.     Under the 2011 restructuring, the FC-PSE also aimed to strengthen management of the education
system more generally, with an emphasis on strengthening human resource management. During this
period, an inter-ministerial MTEF team was established with an accompanying methodology and action
plan. The sector policy letter and sectoral analyses were being revised and expanded for the 2013-2015

period. An MTEF was achieved (leading the effort amongst all sectors) which benefited from the
participation of Ministry officials in a South-South learning exchange with Senegal to learn from its
experience in carrying out an MTEF. The statistical campaign for 2011 had been carried out with school
level data made available and data for all subsectors was analyzed. Improvements in annual statistical data
were noted and teacher management as measured by the allocation of teachers (deployment index) was
maintained at 0.70. Further, responsibility for budget management and execution (of resources provided
by the FC-PSE) was transferred to the decentralized levels.

25.       Important gains were observed in terms of strengthening management at the central and de-
concentrated levels during the third phase of the Project, where by this time all decentralized levels were
implementing annual budgeted action plans. Sector directorates were made responsible for executing their
own budget rather than the relying on the financial controller within the Ministry of Finance (MOF),
marking a major shift from the arrangements prevailing prior to the Project’s launch. Annual education
statistics data were made available at the beginning of the school year and teacher management had
improved (with the deployment index, for Conakry only, reaching 76.6 (R-Squared)). With the support of
TA from the Bank, training modules for the newly appointed management analysts (assistants
gestionnaires) had been developed and the manual of procedures had been further expanded to spell out the
government execution of the budget within a MTEF approach. In addition to the launch of a diagnostic
study within the PER (related to the function of the DAFs), a review of the project management system was
also under preparation.
26.
27.       The achievements were maintained and further scaled up during this last phase of the project with
all decentralized levels implementing annual budgeted action plans (PAABs). Annual sector statistics were
again made available for the start of the school year and teacher management (as described using the
deployment index, in Conakry only) had improved reaching 76.7 (R-Squared). The findings of the project
management assessment were used by the Government during this phase to develop a proposal for the new
GPE project which was submitted to DPs for their feedback/assessment and the findings from the PER and
were disseminated in the fall of 2014.

Context50

1.      The main goals of the Government of Guinea as articulated in the Education Sector Plan (ESP) for
2008-2015 are to achieve universal primary access to primary education and full gender parity and to make
progress in terms of the primary completion rate and gender parity at the secondary education level. In
addition, it aims to increase the GER at the pre-primary and lower secondary levels. Achieving both 100
percent access to grade 1 and gender parity in primary education would entail annual rate increases of 2.9
percent and 2.1 percent, respectively. The pace of improvement in other indicators would need to be greater
(between 3 percent and 7 percent annually).

2.       Analysis of implementation efficiency requires an understanding of the funding provided under the
Project. As described in the main text, the Pooled/Common Fund (FC-PSE) established by AFD, KfW, and
GPE to help finance those activities within the ESP that were most directly related to achieving the
education MDGs related to the attainment of UPE by 2015. The amount initially committed to the Pooled
Fund was US$160.2 million, of which US$117.8 million (or 74 percent) was to be provided by the Fast
Track Initiative (FTI) global program through the Catalytic Fund. The remaining funding was to be
provided by AFD (in the amount of Euros 12 million or about 9.5 percent of total funding), and the German
Development Cooperation through KfW and GTZ (in an amount of US$27 million or about 17 percent of
the total funding). During the period from 2008 (following approval of the Pooled Fund) to 2011, the coup
d’etat and subsequent fragility and difficult political environment, GPE and IDA funding was frozen while
funding from AFD was able to continue. In 2011, following a decision by the FTI Secretariat the total
envelope of funding available for the restructured project was significantly reduced from 117.8 million to
64 million (with the cancellation of US$77.8 million) with the Bank responsible for implementing US$40
million with UNICEF responsible for the remaining US$24 million. During the 2011-2014 period, a
number of activities were implemented and achievements observed. Further, the complementary infusion
of IDA funding (through the ongoing project) also provided support to the Government in the
implementation of its ESP.

           Footnotes:                Financing through pooled funding for the Guinea: EFA-FT I Project.
                                     Government fiscal year: January 1 to December 31.
                                    * IDA Financing outside the pooled funding mechanism.
                                    ** KfW withdrew from the Pooled Fund. T his resulted in the second project restructuring.
                                    *** Following the first project restructuring, UNICEF received US$24 million and served as Implementing Entity.



3.       The project was implemented over a period of three years (as it did not become effective until
2011). The majority of project activities were implemented in full (considering the reduced scope
introduced under the various restructurings) with disbursements reaching 100 percent by project closing.
Under each of the Project restructurings, the activities, indicators and targets were appropriately calibrated
to reflect available funding, implementation capacity and available timeframe. With regards to civil works,
for example, planned activities were redistributed among different actors who had comparative advantages
in specific areas. The Project added to its design a focus on improving human resource management
procedures as well as introducing innovative approaches (focused on demand-side interventions) in targeted
“prefectures” with low GERs (including among girls) and with the highest poverty rates. The revisions of
indicators (outcome and output) and targets were continually reviewed and readjusted. Each of these
modifications injected some level of realism in the overall project design. Project management might have
been more efficient if responsibilities had been assigned gradually to different entities. Notwithstanding
these limitations, implementation progress could be measured for the Project’s three years (2012 - 2014).
A large number of outputs were achieved which contributed to maintaining or to improving key outcome
indicators of the original project design.

4.       Over the life of the Program overall implementation was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory during
phase 1, Moderately Satisfactory and Satisfactory during phase 2, and Moderately Satisfactory during
phases 3 and 4 (depending on the political context and counterparts’ involvement/financing). During the
first phase, project implementation stalled as some activities were suspended due to the political situation
(and suspension of GPE and IDA funding) while others were continued with funding from AFD and KfW.
During Phase 2, the GPE funding (Pooled Fund) became effective but during this period KfW decided to
withdraw its support (one of the reasons for the 2012 restructuring). During this period, project
implementation picked up with the full commitment of the Government team and the resumption of the
World Bank’s close supervision. In addition, program coordination was streamlined and the RF was
reduced accordingly. In the next two phases (phases 3 and 4), implementation momentum gathered. Any
construction issues that had been encountered during the second phase were addressed and infrastructure-
related safeguards were closely monitored.



                                                                                              46
5.       The Pooled Fund and the IDA-funded Project, shared the same implementing unit and
arrangements, thereby assuring some level of efficiency and efficacy with implementation. The functioning
National Coordination of the Government’s ESP (CN/ESP) which was the central operational coordination
unit for the IDA-financed education Project was also responsible for the operational coordination of the
ESP and the Pooled Fund.  The  CN/ESP was also required to serve as the primary management center for
the majority of the pooled financing (FC-PSE) including procurement and financial management activities.
The detailed guidance on implementation arrangements were articulated in 13 documents. These manuals
helped foster a common understanding of project implementation and harmonize efforts.

6.       Project interventions bolstered the sector. The school system was augmented with the construction
of more classrooms, and the rehabilitation of schools with latrines and water points. The quality of education
received a boost with the additional infusion of teaching and learning materials, the strengthening of
decentralized management, and learning assessments. The absence of timely data/annual statistics prior to
the academic year posed some challenges. But overall, many activities under the quality component
contributed to pushing up the quality of education. The first restructuring in 2011 is an example of how
strong leadership is a precursor to critical reforms such as personnel management. Additionally,
implementation also showed that the use of existing structures instead of setting up parallel implementation
units (as was the case in the early years of 2000) helps to reinforce, build and increase critical institutional
capacities.

Cost-effectiveness Analysis

Implementation efficiency

7.        Although the majority of the envisioned outputs and outcomes under the restructured design were
effectively achieved by the project closing date, the efficiency of implementation was Modest given the
initial lag in launching project-supported activities in addition to the need to extend the project closing date
three different times in order to provide adequate time to complete activities which were essential for the
achievement of the PDO.

8.       The FC-PSE financed activities under three components: (i) improving equitable access to basic
and non-formal education; (ii) improving quality of basic and non-formal education; and (iii) improving
management of the education system. Table 2 provides the allocation by activities. The bulk of the financing
(80 percent) of the FC-PSE was earmarked for infrastructure activities (construction and rehabilitation)
under the first component, 18 percent for the second component (teacher training, production and
distribution of textbooks and instructional materials, and small grants for seriously deteriorated public
schools, and the remaining two (2) percent for the third component. The FC-PSE was intended to prepare
the ground for a smoother transition into further levels of education by allocating a small fraction of the
pooled funds for non-primary education levels. The following table outlines the planned sending (by sub-
sector and activity) under the original design and the actual amount spent under the Project (phases 2 – 4).

 9.      Cost efficiencies are specified for two key components: construction of classrooms and the
 procurement and delivery of textbooks and described below.

 10.      Primary school construction. The construction of primary classrooms under the Pooled Fund was
 relatively cost-effective when analyzed against other relevant comparators. The average cost per classroom
 built ranged from US$13,104 to US$17, 136 with a large portion of schools constructed under the Project
 built using the lower cost approaches (see table below). The average cost of a primary classroom in Ghana
 is estimated to be US$16,65151. In Sudan, the average cost of a primary classroom is estimated to be as high
 as US$30,00052. By the end of the project, the construction of the 1,644 had been completed using the three
 different approaches—community-based, NGOs, and through small and medium enterprises. Table 4
 which follows provides the comparisons.

11.      Textbooks. The Project financed the procurement and delivery of textbooks at an average unit cost
ranging from US$0.65 and US$1.4 for primary school core subjects. The unit cost is in line with other
projects implemented during the same time period in the Ivory Coast, Niger and Burundi where primary
school textbooks were acquired for unit costs ranging between US$1.1 and US$1.4. The procurement of
textbooks was successfully completed and the contracts were signed with savings of GNF 3 million (about
US$399). This helped with the procurement of additional textbooks. Efficiency gains (or savings) were
realized due to lower unit costs as a result of the volume of textbooks that were procured and also due to
gains in the exchange rate differential between the US dollar and the GNF making it possible to procure a
larger than estimated number of textbooks. At project closing, more than seven million had been delivered.
The reported quantities, contract values, and computed unit price of textbooks purchased under the Project
are shown in Table 4 below.

12.     Support to girls’ education. Through the FIERE initiative under this Project, around 9,000 girls
received support from 2011 to 2013. The Pooled Fund provided US$260,600 to finance this support
amounting to approximately US$28.90 per participant, which is a reasonable cost given the evidence
pointing to the positive association between girls’ participation in education and other development
outcomes (i.e., health, employment, etc.)

Benefit Incidence

13.       The analysis of the project benefits takes into account both individuals (private benefits) and society
at large (social benefits). According to the final ISR Project investments supported an estimated 1.87 million
direct beneficiaries. This was slightly over the third and final restructuring revised target of 1.82 million,
which was slightly above the second restructuring of 1.73 million. Beneficiaries comprised school students
and graduates at primary education level, teachers, school administrators, and decentralized and centralized
ministerial administrators. This had a spillover benefit at secondary education level both with respect to
intake rate and graduation rate. The future for the project primary is promising. A detailed age-earnings
profile for Guinea is presented in the PAD. Project interventions also helped to improve the quality of
primary education in terms of improving the educational environment with additional classrooms reducing
crowding, improved sanitation facilities with the rehabilitation of schools to include latrines and water
points, and a more conducive learning environment in the classroom with textbooks and trained teachers.
Without the project, fewer primary school students would have graduated, and few teachers would have
benefited from pre- and in-service training.

14.      The cumulative effects of the project inputs over time show positive social benefits for society at
large. Due to the Project longer-term health benefits are anticipated for those with literacy and numeracy.
Better health outcomes means lower duration of unemployment spells, a higher degree of civil participation,
a decrease in the crime statistics, and others. The health index for women with primary education compared
to those without is significant: a 19 percent reduction in problems related to pregnancy, including the usage

                                                             49
of contraceptive methods. Completing primary schooling and moving to secondary education extends the
health improvements a little further for women by about four percentage points. Project benefits accrued in
the domain of institutional development as well. Management, financial and procurement systems were
strengthened through capacity development and experience accrued through learning-by-doing. Individual
and group learning was fostered through collective action and commitment to goals and objectives.

RAPPORT D’ACHEVEMENT DU PROGRAMME SECTORIEL DE L’ÉDUCATION (FC-PSE)
(version allégée)

Le Gouvernement Guinéen a entamé en 2008, avec l’appui de ses partenaires au développement, la mise
en œuvre d’un programme sectoriel d’éducation, dont la vision s’inscrit dans le cadre des Objectifs du
Millénaire pour le Développement (OMD), de l’Éducation Pour Tous (EPT) et la Stratégie de Réduction
de la Pauvreté (SRP).

L'Accord de don du Fonds Catalytique (FTI) date de 2008. Le versement des fonds dépendait à partir de
cette date de conditions suspensives qui n'ont pu être remplies qu'à la fin de l'année. La création du Fonds
Commun nécessitait la ratification du cadre partenarial par l’Assemblée Nationale guinéenne après avis de
la Cour Suprême. La mise en place de ce cadre de partenariat illustré par la lettre d’entente a entraîné des
démarches longues et lourdes.

Les conditions suspensives ont été levées au moment du coup d'Etat militaire de décembre 2008 qui a
entraîné le gel des opérations de la Banque Mondiale sur les projets en cours. Par ailleurs, en octobre 2009,
toutes les opérations de la Banque ont été suspendues en raison de retards supérieurs à 60 jours dans le
remboursement de dettes à son égard.

En novembre 2009, le Comité du Fonds Catalytique, constatant ces retards, a demandé aux PTF de lui
transmettre une proposition de restructuration, fondée sur un réexamen des capacités d'exécution du pays.
Ainsi, en 2010, un plan restructuré a été soumis au comité du Fonds Catalytique dont le montant est passé
de 117,8 millions de dollars à 64 millions. Sur ce montant, 24 millions de dollars ont été confiés à l’UNICEF
comme opérateur.

Après la restructuration du programme, la KFW s’est retirée du fonds commun pour des raisons de non
tenue d’élections législatives. Cette restructuration a passé en revue chacune des activités du PSE initial et
a retenu les décisions ci-dessous:

    -    reporter à des plans ultérieurs toutes les activités pour lesquelles la procédure d'exécution n'était
         pas encore clairement identifiée (par exemple, l'entretien courant des bâtiments scolaires pour 1 %
         de leur coût de construction, les classes inclusives, les centres d'insertion professionnelle….);
    -    réduire les quantités des intrants nécessaires aux activités en les ajustant aux capacités effectives
         d'exécution. C'est le cas essentiellement des constructions de salles de classe du primaire, mais
         aussi d’autres activités connexes ;
    -    revoir la ventilation initiale de la maîtrise d'ouvrage du génie civil entre les différents opérateurs
         (ONG, PME, Communautés) conformément aux objectifs quantitatifs retenus.

C’est dans ce contexte que le PSE a été mis en œuvre pour la période 2008-2012, puis prorogé jusqu’en
Décembre 2014 pour le temps nécessaire à l’achèvement des constructions scolaires.


    I-       OBJECTIFS ET COMPOSANTES
Objectif général : L’objectif du programme est (i) d’améliorer l’accès équitable à l’éducation de base, (ii)
d’améliorer la qualité de l’éducation de base et (iii) de renforcer la gestion décentralisée du système éducatif.




                                                      54
Composantes du programme :

Composante 1 : ACCES. Les objectifs de la composante étaient (i) d’accroître les taux d’inscription aux
niveaux de l’enseignement préscolaire, primaire et du premier cycle de l'enseignement secondaire et à
soutenir des mesures spécifiques pour les filles; (ii) de favoriser l’accès à l’éducation des enfants porteurs
de handicaps en vue d’atteindre les objectifs du millénaire pour le développement (iii) de contribuer à
l’atteinte de la scolarisation primaire universelle de qualité à l’horizon 2015 à travers la
construction/réhabilitation d’infrastructures permettant l’augmentation du TBS au primaire, la réduction de
la taille des groupes pédagogiques au secondaire et la création de filières de formation courte d’insertion
professionnelle; (iv) de réduire le taux d’analphabétisme au sein de la population adulte, notamment chez
les femmes.

Composante 2 : QUALITE. L’objectif de ce volet est d’améliorer la qualité et la pertinence de
l’enseignement fondamental et non formel, en portant une attention particulière à l’acquisition de matériel
pédagogique, à la formation initiale et continue des enseignants, et à l’attribution de subventions globales
aux Délégation scolaire de l’enseignement élémentaire (DSEE)(PAD 2008).

Composante 3 : GESTION. Les objectifs de la composante étaient : (i) d’améliorer les capacités de
mobilisation, de programmation, d’allocation et de gestion des ressources à travers le développement de
procédures de gestion et la formation du personnel administratif, l’équipement des structures et le suivi de
la mise en œuvre des plans et programmes ; (ii) de mettre en place, dans le cadre de la préparation du PSE,
un système de suivi et évaluation opérationnel et fiable par le gouvernement et les partenaires. Ce système
intègre le dispositif de collecte de données statistiques existant afin d’assurer une meilleure fiabilité des
informations sur le secteur, et comporte un manuel de référence pour le suivi évaluation, des outils de
collecte de données et un cadre de concertation (commission nationale de suivi et évaluation).

    II-     REALISATIONS PAR COMPOSANTE

Composante 1 : ACCES
La mise en œuvre des différentes actions de la composante accès et équité du programme sectoriel de
l’éducation (2008-2014) a permis d’obtenir les résultats suivants:

Pour le primaire : Sur 3000 salles de classe prévues par le FC-PSE, 2791 sont achevées (93,03% de
réalisation) et les résultats obtenus par approche de construction se présentent comme suit : 1164 salles de
classes par l’approche PME; 195 SDC par l’approche ONG ; 441 SDC par le PACV ; 991 SDC avec
UNICEF comme operateur et Plan Guinée comme sous-traitant.
Pour le 1er cycle du secondaire : Dans le cadre du FC-PSE et après les études, un appel d’offres
d’entreprises a été lancé en janvier 2013, à l’issue duquel les procédures ont été suspendues à cause du
montant élevé des offres par rapport au budget. Finalement, le montant destiné à cette action a été réorienté
vers la formation continue des enseignants du secondaire 1 et l’acquisition de manuels de français pour la
10ème A.

Composante 2 : QUALITE
Manuels scolaires : La réalisation des activités a permis d’acquérir et de distribuer 6 695 080 manuels
scolaires du primaire dans les disciplines (Calcul de la 1ère à la 5ème , Français de la 1ère à la
6ème, Sciences d’observation de la 1ère à la 6ème , Instruction Civique et morale de la 3ème à la
6ème , d’Histoire- Géographie de la 3ème à la 6ème , Kits scolaires, Dictionnaires de langue française.
Pour le collège, il a été acquis et distribué des manuels scolaires de Français pour la 10ème A.

Initiale des maîtres de l’élémentaire: suite au retrait de la KFW du FC, seule la première activité a été
réalisée. Il s’agit du partenariat institutionnel d’accompagnement du CEPC international de Lyon qui visait
à accompagner les Écoles Normales d’Instituteurs (ENI) en vue d’une amélioration de la qualité de la
formation initiale des enseignants.

Réforme de la formation initiale des enseignants du secondaire: des modules de formation ont été élaborés,
validés et reproduits. Des mallettes pédagogiques ont été acquises et distribuées aux élèves-professeurs et
80 APES formateurs d’enseignants du secondaire ont été préparés. Il faut souligner que le projet de
recrutement de diplômés d’universités (ceux ayant achevé au moins 3 années d’étude) pour une formation
académique et professionnelle d’un an, suivi d’un stage pratique pour en faire des professeurs de collège
n’a pas abouti. Dans la même dynamique, la deuxième école de formation n’a pas été mise en place pour
une formation des professeurs polyvalents de collège. La principale raison est un problème institutionnel
lié au statut des sortants (reclassement à quelle hiérarchie de la fonction publique?).

Composante 3 : GESTION
Le secteur de l’éducation a bénéficié de nombreuses interventions du Gouvernement et des bailleurs de
fonds visant à renforcer les capacités de gestion de l’éducation dans les domaines de la gestion des
ressources matérielles et financières, de la gestion des ressources humaines et du suivi et évaluation. Grâce
à ces interventions, la qualité des statistiques s’est améliorée mais leur exploitation dans la prise de décision
est à renforcer. Il en est de même qu’en matière de renforcement de la stratégie de gestion des ressources
humaines. Par contre, les progrès enregistrés dans la gestion des ressources matérielles et financières tant
au niveau central que déconcentré restent mitigés notamment la lenteur dans la mise en œuvre effective de
la déconcentration budgétaire.
Gestion des ressources humaines matérielles et financières :

     21 membres de l’équipe CDMT se sont appropriés de la méthode de programmation et
      budgétisation selon l’approche CDMT ;
     Les cadres de la cellule CDMT ont été formés en Access et Excel avancé ;
     290 assistants gestionnaires de ressources des services centraux et déconcentrés du système
      éducatif ont été formés sur les procédures de préparation et d’exécution du budget de l’Etat ;
     Les cadres du SNIES et de ses Antennes et du SNIEM ont bénéficié de session de formation en
      logiciels de dessin assisté par ordinateur ;
     Un manuel de procédures de gestion budgétaire et un Document de base des PAE ont été élaborés
      et diffusés ;
     Les membres de l’équipe CDMT ont été dotés en matériels et équipements informatiques ;




                                                       56
     La préparation, la mise en œuvre et le suivi des PAAB au niveau des IRE et DPE/DCE, ainsi que
      des PAE et des plans de formation des DSEE ont été effectifs. Au total, le programme a déboursé
      4 601 547 195 GNF pour l’appui au fonctionnement des IRE et DPE/DCE et 12 078 777 173 GNF
      au titre des subventions aux écoles et aux DSEE sur la période 2012-2013. En raison du gel du
      financement du PSE, l’UNICEF en tant qu’Opérateur du programme a payé entre 2010 et 2011 les
      subventions des DSEE et Ecoles pour les montants de 3 262 688 000 et 6 303 657 955 GNF
      respectivement ;
     Le SNIES et ses Antennes régionales ont été dotés en matériel et équipement ;
     Les gestionnaires de ressources au niveau déconcentré ont été formés sur un logiciel de gestion et
      de calcul automatisé des indicateurs des PAAB conçu à cet effet ;
     Les subventions destinées au fonctionnement des structures déconcentrées (IRE, DPE/DCE, DSEE
      et Ecoles) ont été octroyées ;
     Des assistants gestionnaires (AG) ont été nommés pour appuyer les chefs de services centraux -
      administrateurs de crédits dans la préparation, l’exécution de leurs crédits sur le BND. Avec
      l’expertise des cadres du service informatique du Ministère chargé du budget, ces AG nommés au
      niveau central ont été formés à l’utilisation du logiciel de gestion de la chaîne des dépenses ;
     Le recrutement de spécialistes pour appuyer les services en charge de la programmation budgétaire,
      de la statistique et des infrastructures est effectué;
     Dans le cadre de l'amélioration de la gestion des ressources humaines dans le secteur de l’éducation,
      des équipements informatiques et bureautiques ont acquis en faveur de la Division des ressources
      humaines.

Suivi-évaluation et de la production de statistiques: (i) des bases de données et annuaires statistiques du
secteur ont été mises à jour annuellement; (ii) des indicateurs de résultats et des rapports d’analyses ainsi
que des tableaux de bord du système ont été régulièrement produits; (iii) des plans de renforcement de
capacités des acteurs ont été élaborés et exécutés.

    III-    ANALYSE DES RESULTATS

Composante 1 : ACCES

Efficacité : Les objectifs quantitatifs ont été atteints. En dépit de cette performance, les délais, la qualité
et les coûts ont été en deçà des attentes. A titre illustratif, 99 salles de classe prévues dans un cadre
expérimental pour un délai de 6 mois n’ont été achevées qu’en 33 mois. La tranche principale des
constructions sur FC/PSE (1062 salles de classe) n’ont été réalisées qu’en 24 mois environ (de Février 2012
et Décembre 2013) au lieu des 6 mois contractuels. Le non-respect des délais concerne également
l’approche ONG et PACV où il a été enregistré des retards de plus de 12 mois par rapport au délai
contractuel. Le volet UNICEF opérateur du FC/PSE a connu la même situation de dépassement des délais
impartis.

De surcroit, des cas de défaillances techniques (implantation, stabilité, et finition des bâtiments et ouvrages
connexes) ont été nombreuses, entrainant quelques fois des démolitions et des reprises voire des résiliations
de certains contrats, notamment pour l’approche PME. Ce qui a eu pour effets l’aggravation des retards et
le rehaussement des coûts des prestations (supervision et travaux). Des avenants ont été fréquents et
relativement couteux. Une réduction du nombre de classes à construire en a découlée, notamment au niveau
de l’approche PME et le volet UNICEF.

Plusieurs facteurs ont contribué au retard et au surcoût dans l’exécution des chantiers:
     La lenteur dans l’application des procédures d’approbation et de légalisation des contrats ;



                                                      57
     La succession logique des opérations prévues sur les plans d’action et autres plannings n’a pas été
      respectée;
     La mobilisation tardive du dispositif de supervision (Superviseurs, BET-Zone et BIIC) a entrainé
      par exemple le fait que les entreprises ont été chargées d’adapter elles-mêmes les plans des
      infrastructures aux terrains;
     Plusieurs prestataires n’ont pas respecté les cahiers de charges relatives aux qualifications requises
      de leurs personnels de chantier ;
     La non prise en compte de la dispersion et de l’accessibilité des sites en termes de cout et de délai,
     Les changements fréquents de sites après signature des contrats ont entrainé des charges
      supplémentaires et des retards

Pertinence : Les projets de construction d’infrastructures scolaires concourant à l’accroissement des
capacités d’accueil et par ricochet à l’amélioration de l’accès sont en parfaite adéquation avec les objectifs
du secteur.

Les stratégies de mise en œuvre de ces projets à travers le recours aux différentes approches (PME, ONG,
PACV) répondent aux besoins de renforcement des capacités endogènes et à la lutte contre la pauvreté. En
effet, environ 75 % du financement du FC/PSE ont été alloué au volet infrastructures et équipements
scolaires. Cette proportion est aussi valable pour la plupart des projets.

L’objectif et le moyen idoine de tout développement étant la décentralisation, la délégation de la maitrise
d’ouvrage aux ONG (plus proches des communautés) et aux communautés elles-mêmes par l’entremise du
PACV, était pertinente de ce point de vue. En termes d’équité et conformément aux objectifs des DSRP,
les constructions scolaires ont été réalisées prioritairement dans les zones rurales défavorisées et dans les
préfectures à faible taux de scolarisation et à taux élevé de pauvreté.

Le renforcement des capacités des parties prenantes (les services pérennes, les entreprises et les ONG)
constitue un acquis du programme et pour les actions futures, à travers les formations d’une part et
l’acquisition d’équipements et de moyens logistiques pour le niveau central et les antennes régionales
d’autre part. Face à l’ampleur des travaux, la mobilisation des bureaux d’études techniques (BET) pour le
suivi rapproché et d’un bureau international d’ingénierie et de contrôle (BIIC) au niveau central était
justifiée pour compenser les insuffisances liées au plan de charges des services pérennes. Aussi, la
délégation de maitrise d’ouvrage à L’UNICEF, ainsi que l’implication de Plan Guinée au processus de mise
en œuvre du volet infrastructures du FC/PSE se sont-elles avérées concluantes pour les mêmes raisons.

Viabilité : De manière générale, la qualité des infrastructures respecte les normes ; ce qui favorise leur
durabilité sous réserve que l’entretien et la maintenance soient réguliers. En outre, l’insertion des latrines
et des points d’eau dans les établissements construits améliore le cadre d’apprentissage des élèves en
général et favorise la scolarisation et la rétention des filles en particulier. L’entretien de ces infrastructures
est à la portée des bénéficiaires. Cependant, force est de reconnaitre que des manquements par rapport au
respect des cahiers de charges ont été observés dans l’exécution de certains ouvrages qui risquent d’entacher
la durabilité par endroit. Par ailleurs, la disponibilité d’une documentation fournie et accessible (Plans,
pièces techniques, manuels et guides divers) est un acquis pour le secteur dans le domaine de la réalisation
des infrastructures.

L’exécution du projet a été confrontée à plusieurs difficultés qui n’avaient pas été envisagées au moment
de la conception et de la planification. Les augmentations fréquentes et imprévisibles des prix des matériaux
et matériels essentiels que le plafonnement des soumissions ne prévoyait pas a entrainé la lenteur voire
l’arrêt de certains chantiers. Il en a résulté la résiliation de contrats et la reprise des travaux par d’autres
entreprises moyennant une majoration des montants initiaux.


                                                       58
L’identification et l’allotissement des sites effectués 3 ans au préalable n’ont pas été actualisés avant le
lancement des appels d’offres en raison du manque de financement des missions de confirmation des sites
pourtant indispensables pour la rationalisation des lots et l’adaptation des plans aux terrains. Ce qui a
engendré la dispersion des sites de certains lots et le changement fréquent d’autres sites ayant bénéficié
entretemps de l’implantation d’infrastructures et contribuant ainsi aux retards enregistrés et à
l’augmentation des coûts.

L’inaccessibilité de bon nombre de sites, notamment en saison pluvieuse a occasionné des difficultés
d’approvisionnement des chantiers à cause des coûts du transport plus élevé et même, le refus des
transporteurs à exposer leurs véhicules aux risques des mauvaises pistes. Des arrêts fréquents de ce fait,
entrainent la désertion des personnels de chantier ou leur démobilisation volontaire par l’entrepreneur.

Le choix des moins-disants dans l’évaluation des offres d’entreprises sans tenir compte de la structure
des prix aboutissant des fois à la sélection d’entreprises qui ont sous-estimé les coûts et ne pouvant pas
achever les travaux, appelle la révision de la procédure d’évaluation des offres financières.

Les expériences vécues et les leçons tirées de la mise en œuvre du volet infrastructure amènent à faire des
recommandations suivantes dont la prise en compte permettra l’atteinte des objectifs visés dans le respect
de la qualité, des délais et des coûts :
     Respecter les procédures visant l’identification et l’allotissement, le cas échéant, la confirmation
        des sites à prendre en compte dans les DAO ;
     Mettre en place le dispositif d’études et de suivi-évaluation avant les appels d’offres ;
     Analyser en détail la structure des prix, pas seulement les montants des offres (cf. bordereaux inclus
        dans les DAO) à l’évaluation des offres ;
     Veiller au respect strict des cahiers de charges et des clauses de contrats ;
     Prendre en compte les recommandations pertinentes de l’étude sur les approches de construction
        d’infrastructures scolaires.


Composante 2 : QUALITE

Manuels scolaires : Pertinence : En raison de l’importance reconnue des manuels dans la réussite scolaire,
les objectifs fixés visent à maintenir les quotas du primaire et du premier cycle du secondaire et d'atteindre
un niveau susceptible de contribuer à l’amélioration de la qualité des enseignements apprentissages. Si au
niveau quantitatif l’acquisition des manuels et leur distribution gratuite ont permis l’atteinte des quotas
prévus au primaire, l’impact dans la salle de classe n’est pas encore très évident comme le montrent les
résultats de l’évaluation des apprentissages en lecture et en calcul des élèves de CE2 (rapport CNCESE
2013) et l’évaluation précoce des apprentissages de la lecture dans les premières années du primaire - EGRA
(rapport bureau d’études School to school 2013). Efficacité : Les résultats obtenus ont permis d’atteindre
les objectifs initialement fixés, voire même les dépasser par endroit en termes de ratios manuels/élève (cinq
manuels par élève du CE1 au CM1). L’acquisition d’un cinquième titre au primaire (instruction civique et
morale) a été rendue possible grâce aux économies réalisées sur la commande des quatre premiers titres.
Viabilité : Des campagnes de sensibilisation des communautés sur la nécessité d’utiliser les manuels avec
grand soin ont été menées et leur estampillage pour une meilleure sécurisation a été effectué au niveau des
structures déconcentrées et des établissements scolaires. Ce qui a permis d’assurer la sécurisation des
manuels distribués aux élèves. Pour contribuer à la qualification des enseignements apprentissages, des
efforts conjugués pour la possession et utilisation effective du manuel par l’élève, sa conservation et sa
sécurisation par rapport à l’agressivité du marché illicite de manuels doivent être soutenus à travers la
poursuite des campagnes de sensibilisation des acteurs et partenaires, la disponibilité de statistiques fiables
notamment sur les effectifs, le renouvèlement des manuels usés et des acquisitions nouvelles.


                                                      59
Pour mieux sécuriser les manuels scolaires distribués dans les écoles publiques et apporter une contribution
à l’amélioration de la qualité pour tous les élèves, tous statuts confondus, il y a lieu de prévoir établissements
privés dans les futurs commandés de livres scolaires. Il en est de même des institutions de formation initiale
afin de familiariser les futurs maîtres à leur utilisation : reconduire pour le prochain PSE la commande de
manuels du Lycée avec réactualisation du nombre de manuels en fonction des nouveaux effectifs, et
compléter les titres et le nombre de manuels pour les élèves du collège publics et privés.
Formation initiale des enseignants : Education préscolaire : En ce qui concerne la Pertinence des
interventions, bien que, l’objectif d’aller à 30 % d’ici 2015 parait lointain, le taux brut de préscolarisation
a connu une augmentation sensible allant de 6, 10% en 2007 à 10, 7% en 2012. Aussi les enfants encadrés
au nombre de2776 de 3 à 6 ans, sont issus des familles pauvres très marginalisées avec un nombre de jeune
fille qui avoisine la moyenne. Ce résultat serait un peu plus significatif si le nombre de CEC initialement
prévu avait été réalisé avec 3 salles d’activités au lieu de 2.

En matière de Viabilité, le CEC, est un type préscolaire reposant essentiellement sur une participation
communautaire. Dans notre cas, les communautés ont bel et bien accueilli cette initiative, cependant elles
n’ont pas bénéficié de mesures d’accompagnement par des subventions publiques nécessaires pour combler
la pénurie des ressources. Pour pérenniser l’expérience du CEC, certaines mesures méritent d’être prises
notamment: (i) le renforcement des capacités de mobilisation et de gestion des ressources par les
communautés au bénéfice des CEC, (ii) la construction des infrastructures et leurs équipements dans toutes
les communautés villageoises et urbaines à faible revenu et (iii) la formation et l’affectation aux CEC du
personnel d’encadrement de qualité et en nombre suffisant.

Recommandations : (i) le choix judicieux PME et des ONG chargés des travaux de construction des CEC,
(ii) la dynamisation des actions /programmes d’éducation parentale et d’appui aux AGR pour mieux
promouvoir l’implication des familles et communautés, (iii) fournir des subventions aux communautés
bénéficiaires pour soutenir les CEC.

Formation initiale des enseignants - Formation Initiale des maîtres de l’élémentaire : Force est de
reconnaitre qu’en terme de qualité et de pertinence l’accompagnement institutionnel du CEPEC
international de Lyon a marqué une réelle évolution des ENI vers l’amélioration de la formation initiale des
Enseignants à travers l’établissement d’un diagnostic participatif précis mais aussi et surtout la disponibilité
de différents outils et méthodologies utiles pour les ENI en vue d’une formation professionnalisante.
Désormais il est question de réussir leur mise en œuvre qui devrait s’appuyer sur les compétences des divers
acteurs. A cet égard, des actions futures, pouvant favoriser une pérennisation dans la mise en œuvre du
nouveau dispositif, ont été identifiées à l’effet de qualifier la formation de l’élève-maître à l’ENI et
l’enseignement-apprentissage des élèves du primaire, entre autres :

         la formation des divers acteurs dans les principales didactiques et aux différentes
          méthodologies indispensables à la mise en œuvre des outils ;
         l’organisation de missions de suivi et de supervision de terrain pour l’implantation des
          référentiels et des divers outils ;
         la mise à disposition de la logistique nécessaire au suivi régulier de la mise en œuvre du modèle
          réajusté (moyens roulants et fournitures) ;
         organisation des sessions de formation et d’instrumentation sur le nouveau dispositif à
          l’intention des partenaires (DNEE, IRE, DPE, DSEE, DEA, MA) pour leur participation de
          qualité dans l’encadrement des élèves-maîtres ;
         relance du trimestriel pédagogique « MA CLASSE » comme espace d’échange et moyen de
          documentation et de vulgarisation du modèle d’une part et d’autre part support pédagogique
          pour les élèves-maîtres en stage.
         mise en place des projets d’établissement et contrat de performance ;
         initiation des gestionnaires et formateurs des ENI à la recherche pédagogique

                                                       60
        o   la poursuite du partenariat institutionnel et la mise en place d’un système de suivi des ENI sur
            une année d’ENI qui aurait pour fonction de (i) superviser l’implantation du référentiel dans
            les ENI pour une première promotion avec l’accompagnement du CEPEC international et de
            (ii) porter un regard extérieur tout en aidant à la mise en place du modèle rénové de formation
            initiale dans les ENI.

Malgré les mesures incitatives introduites par l’octroi de bourses, on a constaté une baisse du nombre des
candidatures de bacheliers pour les ENI, 929 en 2013 contre 2308 candidats l’année précédente. Cette chute
serait due aux effets pervers du concours de recrutement à la Fonction Publique ouverts aux personnes
n’ayant pas fréquenté les ENI et aux échecs massifs des diplômés des ENI au dit concours. Pour corriger
ce dysfonctionnement, il convient de développer des modalités de couplage des évaluations certificatives
des ENI et de l’ISSEG avec le concours de recrutement de la Fonction Publique.

Réforme de la formation initiale des enseignants du secondaire : le projet de recrutement de diplômés
d’universités (ceux ayant achevé au moins 3 années d’étude) pour une formation académique et
professionnelle d’un an, suivi d’un stage pratique pour en faire des professeurs de collège n’a pas abouti.
Dans la même dynamique, la deuxième école de formation n’a pas été mise en place pour une formation
des professeurs polyvalents de collège. La principale raison est un problème institutionnel lié au statut des
sortants (reclassement à quelle hiérarchie de la fonction publique?).

Formation initiale des formateurs du technique & professionnel (VOLET FORMINE) : La formation
des formateurs est une préoccupation majeure du système de formation professionnelle et technique qui fait
face à un problème récurrent de personnel dont le nombre est insuffisant et surtout vieillissant. Une bonne
frange du personnel existant a besoin d’une remise à niveau technologique. Ce qui dénote suffisamment de
la Pertinence de la relance de la formation des formateurs au niveau de l’ENPETP.

Le projet FORMINE qui appuie cette initiative permet de réactiver la formation initiale des formateurs à
l’ENPETP et au CFP de Matoto. Il s’agit de mettre à niveau les programmes et les enseignants, et de rénover
l’approche et les outils pédagogiques aussi bien à l’ENPETP (site de la formation pour la première année)
qu’au CFP de Matoto (site pour l’année de formation technologique et pratique dispensée en stage).

Les résultats obtenus sont entre autres :
     La rénovation pédagogique de la filière de chaudronnerie du CFP de Matoto;
     L’organisation de voyage d’étude à l’AFPA pour 2 formateurs de la filière chaudronnerie :
     La fourniture d’équipement informatique et l’installation de la connexion WiFi du centre de
        ressources de l’ENPETP;
     La fourniture d’ouvrages pédagogiques et techniques à l’ENPETP
     L’organisation d’un voyage d’études en Tunisie pour des gestionnaires pédagogiques de l’ENPETP
        ayant abouti à une convention de partenariat;
     La formation des formateurs en :
        o Didactique professionnelle
        o Pédagogie de la médiation
        o Pédagogie active
La Pérennisation de ces acquis appelle à renforcer les actions menées et à poursuivre dans une dynamique
complémentarité et de couvertures de tous les volets prenant en compte : (i) l’implantation de nouveaux
programmes porteurs selon l’APC; (ii) une plus grande implication des grandes entreprises et autres
partenaires; (iii) la dynamisation du Partenariat Public Privé.




                                                     61
Alphabétisation et de l’éducation non formelle : Ce volet restructuré (financement FTI/UNICEF/PSE
de 2008 à 2013) a visé 25000 personnes de différentes catégories socioprofessionnelles pour une durée de
9 mois d’alphabétisation. Ce volet mis en œuvre de 2011 à 2012 selon l’approche ‘’Faire-Faire’’, a couvert
16 Préfectures où le taux brut de scolarisation et d’alphabétisation sont les plus bas et constituent des poches
de pauvreté. Les évaluations ont démontré des résultats positifs de 27929 alphabétisés sur 25000 apprenants
prévus pour un taux de réussite de 85,5%.

Pour atteindre cet objectif, des activités de formation, de production de matériel didactique, de supervision
et d’évaluation ont été mises en œuvre. L’analyse de ces résultats fait ressortir des points forts et des points
faibles, des leçons apprises qui permettent de formuler des recommandations pour le prochain PSE.

En termes de Pertinence, ce sont les préfectures les plus nécessiteuses qui ont été couvertes en priorité.
Malgré les bons résultats obtenus au niveau de ces cibles, il est nécessaire d’élargir l’intervention aux autres
préfectures.

S’agissant de l’Efficacité, ce volet a atteint voire dépasser ses objectifs de 112%. Pour une prévision de
25 000 apprenants, 27 929 apprenants ont été alphabétisés. Sur cet effectif, on dénombre : 18 042 femmes
de 25 ans et plus (72%), 2 704 jeunes de 15 à 25 ans des CAP (11%), 2 594 élus locaux et APEAE (10%),
2 375 membres de comités de gestion(9,5%) et 2 214 d’autres catégories socioprofessionnelles (9%). Cela
dénote la diversité des cibles visées même si la prise en compte de certaines a été de faible proportion. Pour
atteindre ces résultats, 76 superviseurs et 640 alphabétiseurs ont été formés, certifiés et déployés dans les
centres sur la base d’un superviseur pour 5 à 10 centres d’alphabétisation. Cette approche d’encadrement
est à améliorer pour un rapprochement des superviseurs des centres et une meilleure définition de
mécanisme de certification et de reconnaissance des acquis.

Par ailleurs, 85% des bénéficiaires utilisent couramment des compétences en lecture-écriture et calcul, 13%
appliquent des compétences en santé-hygiène et 5% suivent les apprentissages des enfants à l’école. Outre
ces compétences instrumentales de base (Lecture, écriture et calcul) sur le plan personnel, 34,4% des
bénéficiaires affirment utiliser des compétences dans la vie courante et 38,3% attestent que cette formation
leur a permis de changer leur comportement dans la vie en société.

La stratégie ‘’faire faire’’ utilisée dans la mise en œuvre du volet a permis d’atteindre ces objectifs. Deux
ONG recrutées pour l’encadrement de 595 centres d’alphabétisation ont mené des activités de
sensibilisation, d’information et d’accompagnement des communautés.
Concernant la viabilité, l’utilisation des ONG pour l’exécution des activités sur le terrain à travers la
stratégie « faire faire » a permis d’être plus proche des communautés bénéficiaires et de mieux les
accompagner dans l’appropriation du projet. Cela se démontre dans l’appui organisationnel et la
capitalisation des acquis au niveau communautaire.

Chez les apprenants, des cotisations volontaires ont été instaurées dans certains centres et aussi des
pénalités de retard et d’absence des apprenants ont été instituées par endroit pour remplir les caisses des
COGES. Tout ceci a été ajouté aux ressources provenant des AGR53 initiées par les communautés pour la
prise en charge des frais d’entretien des centres d’alphabétisation, l’achat de lampes et des boîtes de craie.




53
     Les missions de suivi ont enregistré plus de douze millions (12 000 000 FG) de francs guinéens issus des AGR.

                                                          62
Par ailleurs, la disponibilité d’un personnel de supervision et d’animation certifié permet la poursuite et le
renforcement du prochain PSE ainsi que la valorisation des meilleures pratiques. Au niveau des collectivités,
la reconnaissance des communautés pour les services rendus par certains néo-alphabètes dans la vie des
populations. L’utilisation de plusieurs néo-alphabètes à titre de personnes-ressources dans la mise en œuvre
de certaines activités communautaires (tenue des registres de micro finances pour certaines institutions de
crédits, appui organisationnel pour les groupements féminins, respect de l’hygiène du milieu et des
aliments); la tenue de la petite comptabilité des groupements féminins qui encadrent les centres
d’alphabétisation par des apprenants sont autant d’éléments de pérennisation du projet.

Les AGR ont été développées par l’initiative des groupements féminins bénéficiaires dont les produits ont
servi à soutenir certaines charges, à améliorer les conditions de vie des membres et à favoriser le maintien
des apprenants. Cette activité intégrée aux actions d’alphabétisation est un facteur de pérennisation qui
favorise la participation communautaire.

Des progrès ont été réalisés, cependant il n’en demeure pas moins de constater des besoins de qualification
au niveau des structures étatiques y compris celles des ONG et au niveau communautaire et la production
suffisante de matériel pédagogique adéquat. Le redressement de cette situation serait un facteur de réussite.

Les Difficultés rencontrées au niveau de ce volet sont entre autres
 Sous financement des activités d’AENF
 Insuffisance de qualification des acteurs de mise en œuvre du projet ;
 Faible implication des partenaires dans le financement de l’AENF ;
 Faible capacité institutionnelle et humaine des structures centrales, déconcentrées, celles des ONG et
     des communautés ainsi que le manque de logistique pour la supervision
 Manque de base de données actuelle ;
 Manque du personnel enseignant en AENF.
Les leçons apprises
 Une bonne sensibilisation/information des communautés et des autorités locales est un facteur de
     mobilisation de celles-ci pour la mise en œuvre des projets ;
 Un accompagnement organisationnel et technique aux communautés par des ONG compétentes et une
     bonne collaboration entre les différents acteurs (ONG, Structures étatiques, autorités locales
     communautés) dans la mise en œuvre des projets est un facteur de réussite et de pérennisation des
     projets ;
 La sélection d’ONG performantes pour la mise en œuvre des activités d’AENF permet l’atteinte des
     résultats.

Recommandations
Pour le futur projet, il est fondamental de tenir compte de toutes les phases de l’alphabétisation à savoir : la
pré-alphabétisation, l’alpha initiale, le post-alpha et l’environnement lettré en y intégrant les AGR et les
activités de gestion (coordination, supervision et encadrement). Ce qui suppose l’étalement de
l’alphabétisation sur une durée de 15 mois au lieu de 9 mois pour atteindre les résultats escomptés. Une
telle planification entrainera le rehaussement du coût de l’alphabétisé. En plus de l’appui aux NAFA et aux
CAP, une diversification d’approches et de partenaires est nécessaire. Cette situation démontre le sous-
financement du sous-secteur. Spécifiquement il convient de:

     Créer une ligne budgétaire d’investissement pour l’Alphabétisation et l’Education Non Formelle ;
     Mettre en contact les institutions d’aide à la réduction de la pauvreté avec les ONG partenaires en
      vue d’une coopération élargie et renforcée en matière d’alphabétisation et d’éducation non formelle
      (AENF) ;
     Diversifier les partenaires pour la mobilisation des ressources ;


                                                      63
     Prendre en compte intégralement les cibles de l’AENF dans les 3 composantes (accès, qualité et
      gestion) du nouveau PSE ;
     Intégrer des modules en AENF dans les programmes de formation à l’ENI, à l’ISSEG et dans
      d’autres institutions d’enseignement supérieur;
     Recruter et former le personnel enseignant en AENF
     Renforcer les capacités institutionnelles et humaines (dotation en matériels logistiques roulants,
      d’informatique, de reprographie et formation des personnels) ;
     Mettre en place un dispositif de suivi/évaluation pour assurer une bonne exécution des actions ;
     Mettre en place un mécanisme de certification pour les personnels d’encadrement, de supervision,
      d’animation et des apprenants.
     Mettre en place une base de données.

Formation continue des enseignants du primaire et du secondaire : L’importance et la nécessité de la
formation continue pour l’amélioration des services rendus à l’élève et au système éducatif en général sont
deux principes qui sont aujourd’hui largement acceptés par tous. Du point de vue de la Pertinence, les
résultats atteints sont en adéquation avec l’objectif d’améliorer les compétences des enseignants en vue de
qualifier leurs pratiques de classe et de favoriser la réussite scolaire des élèves. Les formations délivrées
répondent aux besoins de développement professionnels des enseignants préalablement identifiés.
Les missions de suivi et de supervision ont observé que les enseignants investissent les connaissances
acquises dans leurs pratiques de classe. Ce qui montre que les sessions de formation ont eu une valeur
ajoutée dans la qualification des formateurs.

Sur le plan de l’efficacité, l’utilisation rationnelle des ressources allouées à l’activité a permis d’atteindre
les objectifs assignés sauf dans le cas du secondaire où le processus s’est arrêté après la rédaction des
modules et l’élaboration des plans de formation. Aussi, l’existence d’un cadre d’harmonisation de la
formation continue permet d’éviter des duplications dans les interventions des partenaires.

S’agissant de la Viabilité, il convient de mentionner parmi les éléments favorables à la poursuite et
l’amplification de la formation continue : (i) les compétences acquises en matière de conception,
l’exécution et le suivi-évaluation par les cadres nationaux; (ii) l’existence de modules de formation adaptés
aux besoins et (iii) la disponibilité des partenaires à accompagner les activités de perfectionnement des
enseignants.

Volet : FIERE- Filles Éduquées Réussissent : La Vision de FIERE est « Les filles de 5ème et 6ème années
en difficultés d’apprentissage sont mieux formées et réussissent dans leur vie future. FIERE repose sur trois
postulats qui sont : (i) les filles éduquées réussissent mieux dans leur vie personnelle, leur future vie
familiale; (ii) l’éducation des filles profite aux parents et aux familles ; (iii) l’éducation des filles profite à
toute la communauté. A ce jour, 33 préfectures sont impliquées dans la mise en œuvre des activités FIERE.

Pertinence
Les disciplines identifiées dans le cadre de FIERE pour faire l’objet de cours de rattrapage ont été reconnues
comme celles dans lesquelles les filles éprouvaient le plus de difficultés. Il s’agit des cours de français et
de mathématique. Il est vrai qu’en tant que disciplines instrumentales, leur maîtrise détermine le succès
scolaire des élèves. Quant aux thèmes de formation des enseignantes et des formatrices en français, calcul
et en pratique professionnelle eux, obéissent aux besoins de formation identifiés pendant les précédents
suivis effectués et aux contenus des fascicules 1, 2,3 et 4 en usage dans les écoles FIERE. Par rapport aux
activités para scolaires, développées dans l’approche FIERE, elles rencontrent l’adhésion totale des parents,
des cadres de l’éducation et des élèves, bien qu’elles ne soient pas poursuivies dans le cadre de l’extension.




                                                        64
Efficacité
Au regard des résultats de l’approche FIERE énumérés plus haut, on peut affirmer que l’approche a apporté
une valeur ajoutée au système éducatif. Il s’agit de la récupération des filles en difficultés scolaires à travers
des cours de renforcement en français et calcul qui permet de rattraper un investissement sur l’éducation
qui était destiné à une perte sûre. On note également l’accroissement des indicateurs d’accès et de réussite
dans les zones touchées dans un contexte de stagnation des indicateurs nationaux.

Pérennisation
La conscientisation des parties prenantes notamment des mères et des enseignantes, ainsi que l’ancrage de
l’approche au sein des structures centrales et déconcentrées est un atout de pérennisation du projet dans la
durée. La poursuite des programmes de motivation (octroi de prix, nomination d’enseignantes et de
formatrices FIERE à des postes de responsabilité) constitue un levier important pour la pérennisation de
l’approche.

Viabilité
La formation dispensée aux filles deux fois par semaine sur l’approche et la formation continue des
enseignantes dans les CAPE, permettent des échanges fructueux et une amélioration nette de la rentabilité
des enseignantes. Les effets de cette formation commence à faire tâche d’huile au niveau des autres
enseignants non FIERE. Des filles sélectionnées et admises dans les classes FIERE depuis
l’expérimentation sont à présent en voie d’achèvement ou ont achevé leurs études universitaires.

Efficience
Il est clair que pour obtenir des résultats aussi probants, un investissement financier, humain et matériel
important a été opéré dans la mise en œuvre et le suivi de FIERE. Ce coût est supporté aussi bien par
SFF/FIERE/GIZ, l’État guinéen, que par les communautés bénéficiaires. A titre indicatif, ces dépenses sur
chaque fille FIERE revient à cent quatre-vingt-seize mille neuf cent soixante-deux (196 962) GNF en 2011
au PROPEB (rapport évaluation). En considération de tous ces coûts, et des résultats de FIERE en matière
de Taux de scolarisation des filles, de taux d’achèvement des filles, d’apprentissages pour la vie et de
satisfaction morale des parents et des élèves, on peut affirmer que l’approche est efficiente. Les résultats
atteints sont considérables au regard des coûts investis.

Difficultés
      - Mutation des enseignantes FIERE sans prise de dispositions préalable pour le remplacement ;
      - Mauvais choix des filles, des écoles et des enseignantes FIERE par endroit suite à
           l’incompréhension ou à la mauvaise application des critères de sélection ;
      - Irrégularité de certaines enseignantes aux cours de renforcement.

Leçons apprises

           La formation continue des enseignantes
Elle a eu pour effet l’amélioration de leur prestation pour l’application d’une méthode active
d’enseignement. Les enseignantes ne cessent d’améliorer leurs compétences et de partager avec les autres
leurs connaissances au cours des CAPE. La formation continue doit donc se poursuivre car elle n’est jamais
de trop, bien au contraire, il faut cultiver et entretenir les connaissances acquises en vue leur capitalisation.

La fierté des enseignantes FIERE réside dans le fait qu’elles ont une pratique de classe très efficace. Elles
lient très souvent cette efficacité au matériel confectionné localement qui sert de motivation pour les enfants.
En plus de l’efficacité pédagogique, les enseignantes FIERE sont conscientisées sur la nécessité de la
réussite scolaire des filles, du rôle essentiel que jouent la méthode d’enseignement et les paramètres sociaux
et familiaux dans la survie scolaire d’une fille. Elles s’engagent, s’épaulent, et se déploient pour soutenir
les filles et les amener à poursuivre leurs études.

                                                       65
Les enseignantes FIERE, pour être performantes, ont besoin de renforcement de leurs compétences en
Français, en Mathématiques, en Pédagogie active, en confection et utilisation du matériel didactique, en
genre et équité et en droit de l’enfant.

            Les cours d’éducation sexuelle ou comportementale et de prévention du VIH
Longtemps resté tabou, la communication sur la santé sexuelle et reproductive et sur la prévention du VIH
commence à s’installer dans les habitudes des populations grâce aux cours reçus dans ces domaines mais
aussi grâce à la formation des mères. Toutefois, les résistances persistent pour la communication entre
filles et mères. Les parents sont conscients que le thème est important pour un développement sain de leurs
filles dans une société en pleine dégradation de mœurs, mais ils comptent sur les enseignantes pour le faire.
Une certaine gêne, due à la culture en présence et aux différences d’éducation entre générations empêche
bien de parents d’en parler. Cela revêt le caractère important de cet axe, afin que les enseignantes puissent
constituer de véritables éducatrices au-delà des cours académiques, et aider les filles dans leur
développement physique, moral, pour une réussite de leur vie de femmes.

Recommandations
     - Poursuite du renforcement des compétences professionnelles des enseignantes ;
     - Poursuite des cours de rattrapage en faveur des filles FIERE ;
     - Révision des documents de base FIERE en tenant compte des réalités du terrain et des nouvelles
          stratégies de mise en œuvre du programme ;
     - Poursuite de la sensibilisation des communautés ;
     - Mise en place d’un système de communication interne et externe efficace basé sur une
          diversification des canaux de diffusion ;
     - Meilleure coordination des activités relatives à la scolarisation des filles pour capitaliser les acquis
          de chaque approche ;
     - Stabilisation des enseignantes en milieu rural par l’application de mesures visant l’amélioration
          des conditions de vie dans les écoles, le suivi rapproché des enseignantes, le paiement de la prime
          d’éloignement etc.
     - Intensification du système de suivi avec implication des IRE, DPE, DSEE ;
     - Augmentation du nombre de filles dans les classes FIERE pour limiter l’exclusion ;
     - Transparence dans le choix des filles, des enseignantes et formatrices ;
     - Mobilisation de ressources humaines qualifiées et engagées ;
     - Prise en charge par le budget de l’éducation des plans d’actions pour la mise en œuvre de l’approche
          FIERE.
Pour réussir la réduction des inégalités de genre dans l’éducation et promouvoir la scolarisation saine des
filles, l’approche FIERE est une référence incontournable aussi bien pour la Guinée que pour bien de pays
en Afrique subsaharienne. Sa pertinence prouvée à travers les disciplines et activités ciblées, son efficacité
sur l’amélioration de la performance scolaire des filles et partant de la qualité de l’éducation, son originalité
au regard de ses cibles d’intervention qui sont les filles en difficultés scolaires font la fierté de ses initiateurs
et de ses bénéficiaires. Ces mêmes éléments de satisfaction contribuent à la réalisation des objectifs du
millénaire et ceux du PSE.

Évaluation des apprentissages des élèves du primaire à l'échelle nationale (CNCESE) : Pertinence : La
réalisation de l’étude a permis d’atteindre les objectifs fixés. En outre elle a généré des connaissances utiles
à la compréhension des différences de résultats observées entre élèves ainsi que les facteurs influents en
montrant clairement que « l’effet école » est à la base des inégalités entre les élèves. Elle a aussi établi que
le niveau moyen des élèves connait une baisse considérable des résultats en partie attribuable aux difficultés
de tous ordres auxquelles le pays a été confronté entre 2008 et 2011.



                                                        66
L’évaluation a donné des éclairages sur la persistance des disparités entre les filles et les garçons en faveur
des garçons, et de révéler l des différences assez significatives selon la zone, la région, le statut et le type
d’école (publiques/privées, franco-arabes ou non) et un pourcentage élevé de redoublants : 27,2% des
élèves de l’échantillon, les garçons redoublent moins que les filles (26,4% vs 28,2%). Le redoublement
affecte beaucoup plus les écoles publiques que celles privées.

Cette évaluation renoue avec le rythme des tests standardisés prévus aux niveaux CP2, CE2 et CM2
permettant ainsi d’avoir une vue globale des acquis des élèves du primaire à l’échelle nationale, donc de
disposer à temps d’indicateurs de pilotage fiables. Efficacité : Les outils utilisés et la méthodologie adoptée
pour le test de niveau des élèves ont permis d’obtenir des informations escomptées telles que planifiées.
Viabilité : Pour des fins de pilotage efficace, les évaluations des acquis des élèves du CP2, CE2 et CM2
méritent d’être systématisées et effectuées à temps. La conduite à terme de ces évaluations par la structure
nationale en l’occurrence la CNCESE, a démontré l’existence de compétences nationales capables de mener
ce genre d’exercice complexe. Autant dire que les formations reçues et les appuis techniques apportés ont
produits leurs effets. Si les moyens sont disponibles, la réalisation des évaluations ne souffrirait d’aucune
entrave.

Evaluation précoce et apprentissage de la lecture (EGRA – INRAP) : Efficacité : il faut noter que la
facilitation des partenaires, la disponibilité de l’équipe chargée de la mise en œuvre, les stratégies et
l’utilisation rationnelle des ressources allouées à l’activité ont permis d’atteindre 90 % des objectifs
assignés sauf pour le cas du suivi qui doit être réalisé durant l’année scolaire 2013-2014. Et on peut constater
aussi, que les résultats atteints sont en adéquation avec l’objectif fixé. Viabilité: s’agissant de la viabilité,
il convient de mentionner l’existence d’éléments favorables à la poursuite et l’application des activités
EGRA : (i) les compétences acquises en matière de conception, d’exécution et de suivi évaluation en lecture
par les cadres nationaux ; (ii) l’existence d’un instrument d’évaluation standardisé en lecture au CP ; (iii)
l’existence d’un module de formation adapté aux besoins des enseignants du CP (iv) la disponibilité des
émissions sur la problématique de la lecture (v) la disponibilité des partenaires à accompagner les activités
d’amélioration des compétences en lecture des élèves du CP.

La pérennisation des acquis appelle à (i) revoir à la hausse le budget pour assurer les évaluations en lecture
dans toutes les régions ; (ii) prévoir des mesures d’accompagnement permettant aux cadres et aux
encadreurs pédagogiques d’assurer avec efficacité le suivi des activités dans les écoles ; (iii) mobiliser les
ressources nécessaires pour la poursuite du processus de formation de tous les enseignants du CP en lecture ;
(iv) intégrer dans le budget de l’éducation le volet amélioration de la lecture précoce.

Point faibles : (i) le calendrier d’exécution des activités n’a pas été respecté à cause du retard dans le
recrutement du consultant, (ii) le Gouvernement n’a pas intégré le financement des activités de la lecture
dans les dépenses budgétaires de l’éducation. Ce qui engendre une dépendance par rapport aux
contributions des bailleurs de fonds, (iii) la faiblesse du suivi des activités sur le terrain.

Point forts: (i) l’existence d’une expertise nationale capable de mener les activités EGRA; (ii) la
disponibilité d’un instrument d’évaluation standardisé en lecture au CP ; (iii) la disponibilité d’un rapport
d’évaluation des compétences en lecture des élèves du CP qui pourrait servir d’intrant pour éclairer et
orienter la prise de décision en matière de remédiation.

Recommandations
    Assurer la mise en œuvre régulière (ex, chaque année) d’une évaluation standardisée telle que
     l’EGRA, pour mesurer les acquisitions des élèves en lecture-écriture, de manière scientifique :
    Respecter les calendriers établis pour les évaluations
    Assurer la maitrise des compétences fondamentales : conscience phonémique, correspondance
     graphème phonème, vocabulaire, fluidité (précision et rapidité) et compréhension.

                                                       67
     Étudier les causes des difficultés des enfants en lecture-écriture.
     Préserver l’approche partenariale entre les différentes équipes impliquées dans le projet (Ministère,
      INRAP, équipes techniques, partenaires personnes ressources) pour assurer une continuité efficace
      des actions en cours.
     Fournir aux enseignants en charge des enfants des formations adéquates
     Explorer des mesures d’appui des élèves à la maison afin d’augmenter le nombre de manuels et
      autres matériels disponibles à lire ainsi que des moyens pour assurer l’augmentation des devoirs à
      la maison
     Renforcer le système de suivi rapproché des enseignants
     Doter le volet EGRA en équipement et en moyens logistiques
     Mobiliser les acteurs, partenaires et les décideurs autour de la lecture précoce.

Composante 3 : GESTION
Gestion des ressources humaines matérielles et financières : Efficacité : la quasi-totalité des activités
programmées ont été réalisées même avec la restructuration du programme. Les acquisitions de matériels
et équipements, le développement de procédures de gestion et la formation du personnel ont permis de
renforcer les capacités de programmation et de gestion des ressources matérielles et financières sur
financement extérieur. Si auparavant les budgets du secteur étaient préparés sous la forme classique, depuis
2012 la préparation des budgets des ministères se fait selon l’approche CDMT et la déconcentration
budgétaire a été relancée. Par contre, une des faiblesses majeure qui a atténué l’efficacité est le sous
financement du secteur en général et de certains niveaux d’enseignement en particulier, notamment
l’enseignement technique, l’alphabétisation et l’enseignement primaire dû à la faiblesse de l’arbitrage intra
sectoriel. Le retard dans la mise à disposition des subventions entraine parfois la non-réalisation de certaines
activités programmées dans les plans d’action des services déconcentrés, notamment celles liées à
l’encadrement rapproché des enseignants en situation de classe. Par ailleurs, le système de communication
n’a pas fonctionné même si des missions d’information et de vulgarisation du PSE ont été assurées. Le
processus de mise à jour et de publication du site web n’a pas été poursuivi. Pertinence : les activités
réalisées notamment la programmation selon l’approche CDMT, la déconcentration budgétaire et le
renforcement des capacités des gestionnaires des services centraux et déconcentrés sont effectivement en
phase avec la réforme des finances publiques de l’État. C’est dans ce cas que l’Éducation a été prise comme
secteur pilote. Viabilité : la maîtrise des outils et de la méthodologie de programmation budgétaire par les
cadres aux niveaux central et déconcentré est un des éléments permettant d’assurer continuité de la
déconcentration budgétaire et de mieux aligner les allocations par rapport aux priorités. La publication des
allocations budgétaires, le caractère participatif de préparation des budgets et le respect des procédures du
manuel élaborés sont aussi des facteurs favorisant la gestion déconcentrée des ressources publiques et
l’efficacité de la dépense publique. Les problèmes récurrents de maintenance des matériels et équipements
informatiques posent la question de leur viabilité. La mise en place de contrats de performance incitant tous
les bénéficiaires à utiliser les moyens mis à leur disposition peut être une solution adéquate.

Leçons apprises : dans la mise en œuvre du PSE, il ressort que l’accent a été porté sur la traçabilité et le
suivi du respect des procédures de gestion des ressources extérieures. Par contre, il y’a un déficit
d’information dans la gestion des ressources intérieures et une lenteur dans l’application des procédures
visant à l’amélioration de l’efficacité de la dépense publique. Pour surmonter ces insuffisances, il est
indispensable d’appliquer la même rigueur dans la gestion des ressources publiques que celle observée pour
les financements extérieurs. Pour faire évoluer la gestion des ressources financières vers l’approche
programme, il importe de renforcer les capacités institutionnelles, organisationnelles et humaines des
Divisions des Affaires Financières. Pour améliorer la programmation et la budgétisation axée sur les
résultats, la poursuite du dialogue avec le ministère en charge des finances en vue de la prise en compte de
tous les aspects du CDMT du Secteur est nécessaire.



                                                      68
Suivi-évaluation et de la production de statistiques : Efficacité : les données statistiques et les rapports de
suivi-évaluation ont été régulièrement produits et ont servi à mesurer les performances du secteur et à
relever les écarts par rapport aux objectifs, contribuant ainsi à améliorer le pilotage du programme.
Pertinence : les statistiques scolaires constituent de nos jours un outil indispensable pour la gestion du
système éducatif. C’est pourquoi, elles méritent une attention toute particulière. Ainsi, la mise à disposition
de données statistiques fiables montre une adéquation entre la production de ces données et les besoins de
pilotage du système éducatif. Viabilité : sur le plan structurel, le dispositif de suivi-évaluation mis en place
est incorporé aux systèmes d’informations statistiques existant, ce qui du coup assure sa pérennisation.
Toutefois, le suivi-évaluation devra aller au-delà de la simple production/diffusion d’indicateurs pour
déboucher sur des recommandations aux décideurs et partenaires pour une gestion durable et efficiente du
système éducatif. Ce qui nécessite un choix judicieux du nombre et de la qualité des indicateurs.

Le financement public des activités de production des statistiques doit être suffisant et mis à disposition à
temps pour en assurer la régularité. En outre, la préservation et l’utilisation rationnelle des équipements
(informatiques, bureautiques et énergétiques) engagent les ministères à mettre en place un système de
contrôle et de sécurisation.

Le manque d’informations des structures déconcentrées sur les activités de construction et d’équipements
planifiées dans le programme en leur faveur constitue un handicap pour leur intervention efficace dans le
suivi-évaluation des réalisations d’infrastructures.

Par ailleurs, les organes de pilotage et de coordination du programme aux différents niveaux (CNE, CRPE
et CPPE) à l’exception du CSN et de quelques CPPE n’ont pas fonctionné tel que prévu par défaut de
programmation. Ceci mérite d’être corrigé par les responsables concernés dans le prochain PSE.

Recommandations : l’amélioration de la circulation de l’information intersectorielle et intra sectorielle ne
devrait pas se limiter qu’à sa planification dans les PAAB, mais plutôt être traduite en action concrète pour
permettre d’éliminer les goulots d’étranglement qui persistent. La réactivation du site Web du PSE et la
publication régulière d’un bulletin d’informations s’inscrivent dans cette perspective.

    IV-     ANALYSE DES PERFORMANCES

PERFORMANCE DE L’EMPRUNTEUR
Sur le plan de la performance des acteurs, la réalisation d’un programme complexe et nécessitant des
changements de comportements aura été un résultat majeur dénotant aussi d’une capacité d’adaptation et
d’apprentissage dans un processus contraignant sur le plan de la durée de l’exécution et de la simultanéité
des actions.

La mise en œuvre des stratégies innovantes en pédagogie et en multi gradation a été une preuve positive
de rehausser le niveau de scolarisation. Ces stratégies sont désormais inscrites en bonne position parmi les
bonnes pratiques d’amélioration de l’éducation même si elles sont à perfectionner.

Cependant, malgré les multiples efforts consentis par les acteurs et partenaires, l’amélioration de la qualité
des apprentissages des élèves demeure peu satisfaisante parce que de nombreux élèves n’ont pas les
compétences de base en lecture, communication orale et écrite ou en calcul. Un certain nombre de raisons
expliquent la faible performance du système éducatif dans ce domaine entre autres : (i) la difficulté de
vulgariser les pédagogies adéquates à cause de l’émiettement des interventions des services pérennes et des
projets sur apports extérieurs ; (ii) la lenteur de la revitalisation des inspections et suivi rapproché des
enseignants et au niveau de la classe ; la persistance de la difficulté à utiliser efficacement les manuels
scolaires par les maîtres en dispensant les cours ; (iv) l’absence de définition claire et précise des niveaux


                                                      69
acceptables de lecture, de l’écriture et de calcul en particulier et des critère d’école de qualité de l’école en
général.
En matière de financement public en faveur de l’éducation, le diagnostic du système éducatif effectué,
montre que les moyens financiers sont insuffisantes ou diminuent d’année à alors que la population scolaire
croît à un rythme soutenu (13,35 % en 2014, 17,23 % en 2005, 12,25 % en 2006 et 13,14 % en 2007). La
nécessité d’inverser cette tendance s’impose.

D’une façon général, on note : (i) des inadéquations entre différents ordres d’enseignement ; (ii) la
ventilation non optimale entre les catégories des dépenses ; (iii) la forte centralisation de la gestion des
ressources financières et matérielles au niveau des services financiers centraux ; et (iv) la rareté des
ressources au niveau des services déconcentrés.

Il a été envisagé de mener des réformes politiques et institutionnelles pour créer un cadre favorable à
l’accélération de la scolarisation, à l’amélioration de la qualité et au renforcement de la gouvernance du
système éducatif. La mise en œuvre de ces reformés exigeait une volonté politique, un leadership et des
stratégies de sensibilisation, de persuasion et de mobilisation sociale, des attitudes et activités pas qui n’ont
pas été uniformément effectives dans tous les domaines.

Dans le cas de l’abolition des frais de scolaires dans les écoles primaires, des mesures d’interdiction des
prélèvements directs ont été prises avec plus ou moins de succès. Car, les coûts directs et indirects de la
scolarité ont continué de peser sur les familles pauvres.

La gratuité des manuels scolaires a allégé les charges des parents. La privatisation de certaines fonctions de
l’INRAP par rapport aux manuels scolaires (impression, réimpression achat et distribution) a été un autre
élément de réussite.


PERFORMANCE DE LA BANQUE MONDIALE
Le FC-PSE s’inscrit dans la continuité de la coopération entre la Guinée et la Banque Mondiale en tant
qu’agence de supervision du FTI dans le secteur de l’éducation.

Dans l’ensemble, la qualité de la supervision par l’IDA a été satisfaisante à cause de son timing, de sa
pertinence et de sa contribution à la résolution des difficultés rencontrées. Les appuis conseils prodigués
dans le cadre du partenariat technique ont permis de corriger des lacunes, d’impulser le processus et
d’encourager la prise de décisions sur les questions de reformes
