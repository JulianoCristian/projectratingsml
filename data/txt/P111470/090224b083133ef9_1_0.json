      development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Grantee performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the bank\u2019s swift engagement following periods of crisis can\n            be instrumental in ensuring that Governments have the\n            necessary financial and technical support to continue to\n            implement their sector strategies and to provide services at\n            a time when its own resources and capacity are more limited.\n            Building on the strengths of complementary projects and\n            helps to avoid duplication, cumulatively reinforce\n            institutional capacity, and strengthen national capacity.\n            The FC-PSE design and implementation was able to benefit\n            from the ongoing IDA-funded Project. In addition to ensuring\n            complementary in activities, it laid the foundation for\n            strong cooperation and coordination within the sector and a\n            good working relationship with the Government. As a result\n            of the Bank\u2019s long-standing support to Guinea, the FC-PSE\n            was able to re-engage in the sector and begin implementation\n            shortly after the Bank\u2019s formal reengagement. The\n            establishment of a robust M&E system is instrumental in\n            ensuring that the outputs and outcomes of an operation are\n            properly documented. Though the M&E system established\n            and used in the context of the Project required input from\n            various decentralized levels, the information provided by\n            this system was critical for undertaking joint annual sector\n            reviews and for adequately documenting and reporting on\n            achievements observed under this operation."}, "docdt": "2015-09-30T23:40:03Z"}
