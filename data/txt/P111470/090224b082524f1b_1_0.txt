                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In 2012, KfW withdrew its commitment of US$27 million due to the fact that legislative elections had not been held by December 2012. This withdrawal of funding had an impact on
                         the scope of activities within each component, but did not affect the project objectives. To account for this change, a level-two restructuring was approved in December 2012
                         comprising a reduction in performance targets jointly with an extension of 11.5 months.

                         In December 2013, Government requested a reallocation of funds from the originally planned middle schools to activities impacting education quality and a last extension of the

                         closing date of the Project from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. All parties associated with the pooled fund were strongly in favor of this level 2 restructuring and
