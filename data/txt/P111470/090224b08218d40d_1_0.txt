                         Implementation Status Overview
                         In 2012, KfW withdrew its commitment of US$27 million due to the fact that legislative elections had not been held by December 2012. This reduction had an impact on the scope of
                         activities within each component, but did not affect the project objectives. To account for this change, a level-two restructuring was approved in December 2012 comprising a
                         reduction in performance targets jointly with an extension of 11.5 months.

                         At the government request, the team is now requesting RVP approval for a restructuring to reallocate the funds from the middle schools to activities impacting education quality, and

                         to seek one last extension of the closing date of the Project from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014. All parties associated with the pooled fund are strongly in favor of this
                         restructuring and extension.
                         With this 12-month extension, the project will have cumulatively received 54 months of extension and been under implementation for 3.3 years cumulative during a six-year period

                         To date, the project has disbursed 96 percent of total project funding since becoming effective on October 11, 2011. Project performance is currently rated Moderately Satisfactory for
                         IP and Satisfactory for DO. Three out four PDO objectives have already exceeded their targets. With the proposed extension, it is expected that the last PDO objective and most of
                         the intermediate indicators will be met. It is also expected that the grant will be fully disbursed within the proposed life time of the project. The purpose of the extension is to: (i) allow
                         the government to reallocate the funds from the construction of middle schools to quality interventions providing for quick tangible outcomes in a complex country environment; (ii)
                         and reach the projectâ€™s objectives by allowing for a more reasonable implementation period as well as opportunity for close monitoring of outcomes. It would also allow to bridge the
                         time until the approval of the new GPE project envisaged for end of year 2014.

                         To date, the project has disbursed 96 percent. Most of the activities are on track. The Government requested an extension of the closing date of one year to allow for a more realistic
                         implementation schedule and additional support for schools to implement quality of teaching and learning activities as well as provision of learning materials, and inservice teacher
                         training for lower secondary teachers.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         To date, the project has disbursed 96 percent. Most of the activities are on track. The Government requested an extension of the closing date of one year to allow for a more realistic
                         implementation schedule and additional support for schools to implement quality of teaching and learning activities as well as provision of learning materials, and inservice teacher
                         training for lower secondary teachers.
