Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project is closing on December 31, 2014. In the past year, additional support was given to schools to implement quality of teaching and learning
 activities as well as provision of learning materials, and inservice teacher training for lower secondary teachers. Due to the Ebola outbreak, missions
 were restricted; however, all of the activities were completed despite the challenging country context.
