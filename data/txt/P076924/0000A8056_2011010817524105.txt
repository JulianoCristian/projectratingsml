                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Regarding the third call for proposals 116 proposals were submitted and 27 passed the 1st screening. The total amount requested by these proposals was more than
                         twice the allocated budget of the project. The Bank had previously revised the subprojects selection process and had no-objection that the technical requirements and analysis i
                         were satisfactory. The project selected a total of 15 subprojects based on the implementation capacity with the remaining period of the loan.
                         However, the implementing agency did not receive the funds (about US$ 170,000) necessary to provide the 22% of counterpart funds to be provided by the borrower (an additional

                         10% of counterpart funds was made available by the subproject's beneficiaries). Without consulting the Bank, funds from the loan were used to cover 90% of the subproject's cost
                         and not the 68% as established in the loan agreement. As a result, the Project was able to support only 9 of the 15 selected subprojects.

                         This operation supported a total of 54 subprojects (25 urban and 29 rural) with 22% supporting youth, 20% women, 11% quilombola communities and 4% indigenous communities.
                         This exceeds the target of 10% of subprojects supporting special groups but the overall expenditure of the project reached 63% due to problem with counterpart funds and slow
                         implementation of component 2 ( institutional strengthening for poverty reduction) and component 4 (capacity building and TA).
                         The project did not address all FM and procurement related issues identified by the Bank and the external audit, which led to a downgrade of its performance.
