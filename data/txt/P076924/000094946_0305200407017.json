The\n            project has been classified as Category B in accordance with\n            the Bank's operational directives, given that overall,\n            project related interventions will prod positive\n            environmental impacts. Nonetheless, this environmental\n            assessment looks at the potential adverse impacts resulting\n            from subproject construction, and production processes,\n            which may affect groundwater, and surface waters, due to\n            excessive solid wastes, lubricants, and, sanitary and\n            medical wastes, in addition to contamination due to\n            indiscriminate disposal of fish residues along water\n            courses, all of which potentially affecting ecosystems.\n            Mitigation measures are as follows. Appropriate site\n            selection should determine construction sites, to be located\n            at a determined distance from water flows; septic tanks\n            should be available to ensure best hygienic standards;\n            treatment tanks would ensure the adequate disposal of\n            residues; waste management, and effluent treatment would\n            ensure the appropriate utilization of biodegradable\n            materials, and residues for composting activities; drainage\n            systems, and water supply and sanitation networks, should be\n            inspected to ensure water quality, and sewage treatment;\n            replanting of native species should be practiced to prevent\n            soil erosion; and, appropriate fisheries management should\n            include water quality control, determining as well the\n            adequate amount of aquatic life, within an optimum organic environment."}, "docdt": "2003-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
