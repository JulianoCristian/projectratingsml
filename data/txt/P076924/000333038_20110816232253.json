{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Amapa Sustainable\n            Communities Project (ADAP) for Brazil were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was also moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: this is\n            certainly not a new lesson, but the design of this project\n            should have followed it. Packaging an urban and a rural\n            development component, microcredit, enhancement of public\n            administration and special treatment for selected groups\n            into one rather small loan and putting that all into the\n            hands of an inexperienced, weak agency should be avoided.\n            Long delays between appraisal and project start-up may\n            require revisiting and revising the project before or after\n            signing/effectiveness. Three years passed between appraisal\n            and startup of the project. Many things changed during that\n            period, such as the disappearing of municipal forums, the\n            diminishing importance and weakening structure of the\n            executing agency, ADAP, the severe deterioration of AFAP\n            (Amapa State Development Financing Agency), and the\n            understanding of the nature and importance of the project.\n            The long delay in getting to loan signing should have been\n            understood as a signal of such changes happening. Avoiding\n            stand-alone projects. Subprojects should be linked to and\n            supported by local government and other programs of\n            government and/or the private sector, thus creating\n            synergies. Several well designed subprojects had their\n            sustainability and impact negatively affected owing to the\n            lack of such interaction. The discussion and selection of\n            subproject ideas by communities and identification of a\n            community takes time. Pressure to implement rapidly tends to\n            leave little time between a call for proposals (CFP) and the\n            deadline for submission. The first CFP under the project\n            gave only 30 days for submission. This often tends to favor\n            ideas and pet projects offered by well-meaning outsiders,\n            without the necessary internal discussion, studies of\n            markets, viability of technologies, etc., and without true\n            ownership in the community. Organizations created\n            specifically for participation in CFPs are not likely to\n            come up with viable, sustainable proposals. The project\n            should require that community agreement on a proposal be\n            documented in the Minutes of a general assembly of their\n            association. This was strengthened in the third CFP which\n            required a minimum time of prior legal existence of an association."}, "docdt": "2011-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
