Overall project impact will be gauged by\n            the extent to which useful lessons, both positive and\n            negative, have been generated, and succeeded in improving\n            the livelihood of urban and rural poor in Amapa. The project\n            components include: 1) Urban community development\n            sub-projects focusing on the poorest neighborhoods in the\n            cities of Macapa, Santana, and Laranjal do Jari through the\n            preparation, and implementation of community development\n            plans. Sub-projects will address problems related to: low\n            levels of community organization, lack of skills and\n            educational opportunities, the absence of community\n            planning, occupation of environmentally sensitive lands,\n            poor sanitary conditions, and inadequate access to\n            infrastructure and services. 2) Institutional strengthening\n            for poverty reduction, will build the capacity of the state\n            to address key issues of poverty, and development by\n            supporting a specific reform of the state micro-credit\n            provider, and a general reform of the state administrative\n            apparatus in project-related areas. This will include\n            support to the preparation of business plans, capacity\n            building, and rural finance. 3) Rural community development\n            sub-projects would build capacity in the rural areas, and\n            provide grants for sub-projects that will be identified,\n            developed, and managed by community, and producer\n            associations. Two types of sub-projects will be financed:\n            environmental and social infrastructure, and, support for\n            environmentally-sustainable productive investments. 4)\n            Capacity building for participatory management and technical\n            assistance (TA) will reinforce the operational capacity of\n            the Development Agency of Amapa State - ADAP - to coordinate\n            project implementation; develop a project management\n            information system; maintain a monitoring and evaluation\n            system for the project, including close collaboration with\n            the state Environment Secretariat (SEMA), and the national\n            environmental protection agency (IBAMA); and, undertake\n            information and promotional campaigns for public awareness."}, "docdt": "2004-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
