More specifically it will: i)\n            diversify the higher education system in order to improve\n            the output of a trained technical and managerial labor\n            force; ii) provide incentives to universities to revise\n            curricula to enhance the quality of teaching and learning;\n            and iii) strengthen the planning and managerial capacities\n            of the higher education system. Project components include\n            the creation of a new generation of Higher Institutes of\n            Technology (ISET) which would be geared towards labor market\n            needs.  Five ISETS would be developed in the main economic\n            and industrial regions (Tunis, Nabeul, Gabes, Sfax, and\n            Sousse). The ISETS would limit enrollment to 1500 - 1800\n            students per ISET and use curricula with disciplines related\n            to local industry and service sectors. Another component\n            would create a National Program for University Improvement\n            (PNRU).  This program would channel funds towards existing\n            universities with the aim of increasing their internal and\n            external efficiency, allowing resources to be used as an\n            incentive for universities to reform their programs and\n            curricula.  Reforms would include: new undergraduate study\n            programs; diversification of streams to increase career\n            options; and improvement of secondary teachers training\n            programs.  The last component involves strengthening the\n            planning and managerial capacities of the higher education system."}, "docdt": "1992-02-11T00:00:00Z"}
