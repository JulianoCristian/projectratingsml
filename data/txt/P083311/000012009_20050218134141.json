The first phase\n            will support financial sector institutional development,\n            through reforms in the following five areas: a) strategy for\n            the management of systemic risks, b) legal and regulatory\n            framework, c) anti-money laundering, and prevention of\n            terrorism financing, d) strengthening of supervision, and\n            control of systemic risks, and, e) payments system. A second\n            phase that would partially fund a systemic consolidation\n            strategy, would be triggered by key indicative actions such\n            as: a) private consensus on a consolidation strategy, b)\n            demonstrated practical relevance of the institutional\n            development supported by the first phase; and, c) a\n            diagnosis of the solvency position of the largest banks. The\n            project will support sorely needed institutional development\n            in key areas affecting the financial sector, and will also\n            strengthen the dialogue between the Bank and Honduras,\n            placing the Bank in a better position to assist in the\n            financial sector's consolidation process. While there\n            is little risk that actions required under the first project\n            might not be taken, there is however, the need for\n            substantial additional reform, built on solid analytical\n            work and consensus among stakeholders, required to support\n            the following second operation."}, "docdt": "2005-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
