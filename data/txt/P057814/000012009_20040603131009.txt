                           REFORM SUPPORT CREDIT

                            Credit andProjectSummary


Borrower:          Government of Georgia

ImplementingAgency: Ministry ofFinance

Amount:           US$24,000,000 equivalent to SDR 16,600,000

Terms:             Standard IDA terms of 40 years maturity including 10 years grace;
                   service charge 0.75% per annum on the principal amount withdrawn and
                  outstanding,

Fees:              0.5% annually on the undisbursedamount of the credit, less any waivers.

ProjectIDNumber: PO57814

Objectives:       The proposed Credit aims to provide initial assistance to the new
                   Government of Georgia inthe first phase of efforts to define and launch
                   a boldprogram of economic, legal, and social reforms. The Credit would
                   support urgent actions in the following areas: (i)improvement in
                   govemance/anti-corruption;    (ii)improvement        in public   finance
                   management; and (iii) steps to resolve crucial issues inthe energy sector.
                  Actions taken in these areas would contribute significantly to the
                   implementation of broader structural reforms over the mediumterm. At
                  the same time, the proposed operation aims to define, in broad
                  preliminary terms, a framework for future policy-based lending and
                  policy dialogue by IDA to support Georgia's medium-term economic
                   growth andpoverty reduction efforts.

Benefits:         The proposed operation would helpthe new authorities intheir efforts to
                   improve governance and invigorate the economic reform process, as
                  well as support fiscal stability and poverty reduction directly. First, the
                  proposed Credit aims to address, as central issues, governance,
                   corruption and the business environment, thereby making economic
                  activities more sustainable and facilitating the creation of new
                  businesses, and helping to create employment. Second, a stable fiscal
                  environment allows for the timely payment o f salaries, pensions, and
                   social expenditures, and thereby contributes to poverty reduction. The
                   Credit also aims to help the Government link the programs in the
                  EDPRF' to the budget process.

Risks:    The new Government inheriteda desperate fiscal situation, coupled with
          an almost completely collapsed state apparatus. It has taken decisive
          measures to begin addressingthe underlying problems of corruption and
          poor governance, which have considerably enhanced its credibility. A
          variety of measures have also been adopted that should strengthen the
          fiscal position progressively. However, in the near term,              the
          sustainability of the reform process depends critically on quick progress
          to address the problem of chronic arrears in salaries, pensions and other
          social expenditures, and the lack of financial resources could cause the
          program to fail. The proposed Credit, together with support through the
          IMF's newPRGF, assistance from other donors, and improved domestic
          revenue performance, would helpto mitigate this risk.

          The Government's reform efforts also face the following main risks: (i)
          reappearance of a deteriorated security and/or political environment
          (e.g., issues surrounding the breakaway regions--Abkhazia and South
          Ossetia); (ii)powerful special interest groups opposing reforms and
          better governance; and (iii)weak implementation capacity of the
          Government.

          The new political environment in Georgia, the overwhelming electoral
          victories of the present       Government at the Presidential and
          Parliamentary elections, and the recent return of Adjara under the
          authority of the Government of Georgia help to ameliorate these risks.
          For this operation, the lessons of past adjustment lending, in particular
          the weak implementation capacity of the government, have been
          carefully factored into the design: notably, through the narrow focus on
          priority issues and the requirement for upfront implementation of reform
          actions. Over the mediumterm, the weak implementation capacity poses
          concern on the sustainability of the reform program implementation.
          The new Government has started taking initiatives to address this
          weakness.     Donors     are  actively   supporting    these   initiatives.

                                       I.INTRODUCTION

1      In the past, Georgia undertook many reforms with some success, particularly in the
privatizationo f state enterprises, trade liberalization and modernization of its legal framework.
Although growth occurred insome years, the beneficial impact and sustainability of the reforms
was often limitedby weak implementation. The main reasons for this situation were the sharp
deterioration in governance and a fragmentation of power among competing groups in
government and betweenthe central and local authorities. Dueto the deterioration of the public
sector apparatus, particularly in revenue collection and expenditure controls, the present
situation provides few options to the new authorities.

2.     The new Government, responding to its strong mandate, is acting decisively on
improving governance/anti-corruption and public sector management. Inthe few months since
it assumed office, important progress has been achieved.          In most respects, the current
leadership has taken the agenda o f reform developed during the 1990s to a new level. This
responds to the new political reality created after the peaceful "Rose Revolution" of late
November 2003. This event was a popular uprising against years of mismanagement and
corruption in government, triggered by frustration over fraudulent abuses in the parliamentary
elections earlier inNovember 2003. Presidential elections were held inearly January 2004 and
the new President, Mikheil Saakashvili, obtained 97 percent of the votes in an election
considered by domestic and international monitors as largely corruption-free. The election
results were interpreted as a strong endorsement of the call for a deep and far-reaching fight
against corruption and poor governance. Parliamentary elections were held on March 28, 2004,

3.     The proposed Reform Support Credit for US$24,000,000 equivalent to SDR 16,600,000
to Georgia aims to provide initial assistanceto Georgia inthe first phase o f efforts to define and
launch important reforms. The proposed operation recognizes the strong reform drive in the
early months of the new leadership and is designed to be a bridge to a medium-term
engagement in designing and implementing many reform challenges facing the country. The
proposed Credit would support urgent actions in the following areas: (i)           improvement in
governance/anti-corruption; (ii)  improvement in public finance management; and (iii) to   steps
resolve the crucial issues of the energy sector. Actions taken inthese areas would significantly
contribute to the implementation of broader structural reforms over the medium term. At the
same time, the proposed operation aims to define, in broad preliminary terms, a framework for
future programmatic lending and policy dialogue by IDA to support Georgia's medium-term
economic growth andpoverty reductionefforts.

                                      11. ECONOMICCONTEXT

4.      Macroeconomic Developments. Followingthe post-independenceeconomic collapse and
hyperinflation, Georgia launched stabilization and structural reforms in 1994 aimed at restoring
economic growth. The economic response to these reforms of the mid-1990s was dramatic at
first, with real GDP growthrebounding to an average of 10.6 percent a year in 1996-97. Adverse
exogenous shocks (the Russia crisis, severe droughts in 1998 and 2000) caused growth to slow
during 1998-2000, although it reboundedto an average of 5 percent during 2001-02. The annual
rate of inflation was brought down to single digits by 1997, and has since remained at around 5
percent, except for a brief upswing inlate 1998 and early 1999 when the Russian financial crisis
triggered a substantial depreciation of the Georgian Lari.                  The exchange regime is fully
liberalized, andthe real exchange rate since 1999has beenroughly stable.

5.      The economy showed resilience in 2003, despite a weakened fiscal performance and a
political crisis that culminated in the regime change in November. Real GDP grew by 8.6
percent, ledby buoyant activity inthe industrial and communications sectors and construction of
the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and a recovery in farming from a bad harvest in 2002.
Nevertheless, the incidence of poverty remains high.' Georgia has experienced a severe decline
inwelfare since independence. Unemployment andunderemployment are high, social conditions
have deteriorated, poverty and vulnerability have increased.

6.      Inflation stayed low in 2003 averaging 4.8 percent, although end-period inflation rose to
7 percent, driven inpart by a sharp increase inwheat import prices as a result of crop failures in
the main CIS grain exporters. (See Table 2.) The 2003 target for tax revenue was missed by
some 0.7 percent of GDP, owing to a slackening intax and customs administration. As a result,
the stock of domestic expenditure arrears increased to 4.8 percent of GDP by year's end. The
government deficit on a cash basis amounted to 1.3 percent o f GDP in2003 while the deficit on
a commitment basis was 2.5 percent. While revenue collection in the first few months of 2004
increased significantly, revenue collection efforts need to be sustained and hrther strengthened
so that salaries, pensions and other social expenditure can be increased and paid on time.
Monetary policy in 2003 was broadly satisfactory, albeit some increase in inflation took place,
'  Povertymay have well increaseddue to the Government's inability to pay wages and pensionson time.

with the Lari remaining generally stable vis-his the US dollar. Georgia has run persistently
large external current account deficits inrecent years. These deficits have been largely financed
by foreign direct investment (FDI) and Paris Club debt relief in 2001 and 2002. Gross
international official reserves fell slightly to 1.5 months of imports of non-pipeline goods and
services.

7.       Structural Reforms. Progress in adopting structural reforms was quite favorable during
the mid-to-late 1990s, reflecting, among others, a generally supportive political environment.
Since then, however, while advances have been made insome areas o f structural reform, such as
the financial andjudicial sectors, results inother areas, like fiscal consolidation, tax andcustoms
administration, privatization of SOEs, and the business climate, have been slow due largely to
worsening governanceproblems and pervasive corruption. As a result, the releases of the second
andthe thirdtranches ofthe SAC3 were delayedby two years2 Similarly, the third review of the
IMF's 2001-04 PRGF program could not be completed, and the program lapsed in January
2004.3

8.       Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework. In February 2004, the IMF staff worked
closely with the Georgian authorities to develop a budget for 2004 and agreed with the
Government on a new PRGF program. An IMF Board meeting i s scheduledfor June 4, 2004.
Georgia is currently seeking debt rescheduling from the Paris Cluba4The main elements of the
medium-termmacroeconomic framework for 2004-08 are (see Table 2):

    0    Annual GDP growth: 6 percent for 2004 and 5 percent afterwards
    0    CPI inflation: 5.8 percent for 2004 and 5 percent afterwards
    0    Annual tax revenue increase: 1.6 percentage points of GDP for 2004' and 1 percentage
         points annually afterwards
    0    Expenditure and net lending: gradual increase from 20.5 percent of GDP to about 25
         percent o f GDP during 2004-08
    e    Broad money growth: gradual decrease from 19.5 percent to 13.9 percent during 2004-
         08.

Achievement of these medium-term targets will hinge critically on the Government's strong
reform efforts, especially inaddressing governance and corruption issues.

 The Credit was expectedto close by December 31,2000, but, because of delays in meetingthe tranche release
conditions, the closing date was postponedthree times. The three tranches were disbursed,the first one on
effectiveness on August 2, 1999,based on measuresadoptedprior to Board presentation, the second one on
December26,200 1, and the third one on October 17,2002.

 To addressnew fiscal pressuresthat had emerged, with tax revenue falling short o f budget targets, and an
accumulationof substantialnew budget arrears, the IMF saw the need inter aliato introduce tax reform measures,
adjust electricity tariffs and revise the 2003 budget to close the fiscal gap. The authorities achievedthe first two but
were unableto secure Parliamentary approval of arevised budget for 2003.

 The ParisClub creditors agreed on May 26,2004 to consider Georgia's request for debt rescheduling in mid-2004,
thereby providingrequisite financing assurancesfor the proposedPRGF-supportedprogram.

 As comparedto 2003 innew classification.

9.      Debt Sustainability. The Paris Club debt consolidation period for Georgia ended in2002.
It was initially planned to consider the case for further debt rescheduling in 2003, but this was
not possible given the difficulties with implementing the program supportedby the PRGF. This
resulted in a sharp increase in Georgia's external debt service due and in the further
accumulation of external arrears. To clear these arrears and achieve medium-term extemal
viability, the Government will request a rescheduling of 2003 arrears and eligible 2004-06
maturities, with comparable treatment by non-Paris Club bilaterals.            The latest Debt
Sustainability analysis for Georgia suggests that in the absence of concessional restructuring,
Georgia's heavy debt burdenwould be extremely difficult to manage.

                                111.THE GOVERNMENT'SREFORMAGENDA

11.        The new Government has come to office with considerable political stature and enjoys
the goodwill of the vast majority of the population.                         It has a unique opportunity to make
substantial progress during its five-year term, and has already made a good start. The new
authorities have been implementing a strong reform agenda, emphasizing anti-corruption,
governance, and improved public sector management. The Government has presented a first
version of its reform agenda for 2004-09 at a donor-government meeting held in Tbilisi on

                                                      7


March 1, 20046 and will be presenting a more elaborated reform agenda at the Donors Meeting
on June 16-17 inBrussels. The Government will also update, revise, and improve its Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP, i.e., PRSP) whichhas been completed in
July 2003 through an extensive participatory process, especially interms of further prioritization
and more realistic costing withinthe available resourceenvelope. Inthis regard, the Government
recently prepared a time-bound action plan for prompt renewal and commencement o f effective
implementation o f the EDPRP (see Annex 3). The EDPRP has beenembraced, inprinciple, by
the Government as laying the foundation for conducting the budgetary process, allocating
budgetary resources, and devising and implementing sector specific reforms (see paras 61-63).
The Government will submit the EDPRP progress report to the IDA and the IMF Boards to be
preparedthrough a fully participatory process by October 2004.

12.     Among the most important actions to date have beenthe Constitutional and legal reforms
which createdthe post of Prime Minister, clarifiedresponsibilities of the President and the Prime
Minister, established a Cabinet form of government with collective responsibility for policy
formulation and decision-making, consolidated and restructured ministries and remapped
numerous agencies and departments. Overall, these actions lay the basis for enhanced
coordination within the executive branch of government, something which was sorely lacking in
the past. Pensions and salaries are now being paid on time after months of arrears accumulation,
with significant positive welfare implications, a realistic 2004 budget has been developed and
approved by the new Parliament in early May 2004, and revenue performance has been
dramatically improved compared with the same period last year7. The Government has been
taking specific actions inthe diverse areas of: (i)    governance/anti-corruption/civil service reform;
(ii) financemanagementlaccountability;(iii)
    public                                                   state-owned enterprises; (iv) private sector
development; (v) energy sector; and (vi) poverty reductiodsocial protection. (See Annex 1:
Actions Supportedby the Reform Support Credit). These actions taken by the authorities are the
result of their reform drive and ownership of the reform process. However, in most instances
they can also be traced to the policy dialogue between Georgia and IDA. Most of these actions
benefited significantly from our policy dialogue, analytical work, policy-based and investment
operations, andtechnical assistance over the past severalyears.

13.     Inaddition, inareas on whichIDA does not normally focus, it is important to note major
reforms already undertaken in the military, the police and law enforcement agencies. These
changes are important for tackling some of the most difficult corruption activity in the country,
which in turn has been the single greatest deterrent to new investment and improving the
business environment.

14.     Since the new Government took power the Ministry of Defense has undergone the most
sweeping changes. The first civilian Minister o f Defense has been appointed ending the
Military's control of the Ministry. The number o f generals inthe armed forces has beenreduced
from 24 to 14andthe positionof the Chief of General Staff inthe Ministryhas been streamlined,
The Ministry i s being down-sized from about 1,000 to around 500 with remaining staff equally

dividedbetweenthe Minister and the Chief o f General Staff. Overall troop strength is expected
to be reduced by about one-third. Accompanying the downsizing initiatives are efforts to
improve personnel management, budgeting, and training. These efforts are being supported by
bilateral assistance.

15.     Structural reforms in the Ministry o f Internal affairs (MoIA) aim at realigning the
Ministry toward greater focus on the country's internal policy making and coordination of
related activities, enhancing professionalism and effectiveness o f the police force and providing
for their depolitization, and at improving the working environment and motivation o f employees
within the system. To develop and implementthe MoIA reform strategy, a Reform Agency has
been established by Presidential decree and subordinated directly to the Minister. A general
outline o f planned structural reforms was prepared and presented in January 2004. This outline
i s currently being translated into a specific action plan, including cost estimates, which i s
expected to be finalized by end o f May 2004. Certain activities envisaged by the reform have
already been launched. These include: structural reorganization by abolishing and merging a
number o f entities and streamlining the remaining ones under a single chain of command;
simplification o f some procedures (e.g., related to inspection o f vehicles and traffic control);
rationalization o f staff; introduction o f better remuneration for key high level officials and staff
(such as traffic police officers, interior troops, criminal and anti-drug police officers) by
providing them with salary supplements; and introduction o f greater transparency and
accountability in the M o I A procurement practice. Similar reform are underway in the Ministry
o f State Security.

16.     Building on the recent actions, the Government has been laying out a comprehensive
medium-term reform agenda.         As described in paras 79-80, IDA's support for medium-term
structural reform program will be selective, based on IDA's priorities and comparative
advantage, to complement the assistance o f IMF and other donors to maximize synergy. The
Government at this juncture has agreed to the following structural reform agenda pertinent to the
proposed Credit and IDA's subsequent adjustment operations in the areas of: (i)strengthening
governance/anti-corruption and public sector management; (ii)improving public finance
management and financial accountability; (iii)      taking steps to resolve crucial issues o f the energy
sector; and (iv) protecting the vulnerable. IDA's future programmatic policy-based operations
may include other reform areas such as rural development and decentralization.

       A. StrengtheningGovernance/Anti-Corruption andPublicSector Management

1. Formulating,Implementing,andMonitoringanAnti-CorruptionStrategy

 17.    Reducing corruption i s a central objective and mandate o f the Government. Corruption
has become a major constraint to public sector effectiveness and an obstacle to private sector
growth. When the new Government took office, enterprises o f every size were harassed, with
even the smallest businesses subject to frequent visits by inspectors. Larger business suffered
the added disadvantage o f attracting the attention not just o f local officials but of the entire
power pyramid, and this created an effective ceiling on enterprise growth for those without
special influence. A weak law enforcement authority aggravated this corruption. Moreover, hard
criminal activities such as murder and kidnapping o f staff, particularly o f international

                                                    9


companies, was a frequent occurrence. The size of the shadow economy is, therefore, large and,
conversely, the tax base reduced. Indicators o f perceptions of governance, derived from various
sources, indicate the gravity of the situation. Georgia, comparedwith other CIS countries, scored
lower on political stability, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption dimensions.

18.     The Government is strongly committed to fighting corruption. This is reflected invarious
changes including the development of legislation to eliminate specialrevenues, a re-focused role
of the financial police, the introduction o f civilian control inthe military, strengthened conflict of
interest provisions, and improved functioning and structure of the court system and the executive
branch of government. The Government commitment has already been translated into legal
actions, arrests and prosecutions as well as reorganizations underway in several major public
sector entities.  It is claimed that, as a result, some improvement in governance is already
noticeable. However, major challenges lie ahead.

19.     Curbing corruption will demand long-term, systemic efforts. As already noted, the
Government is implementing key steps such as the reorganization of the Ministries o f Interior,
State Security, and Defense. It is also accelerating ongoing judicial reforms which started some
years ago with IDA assistance. These steps are crucial for improving law enforcement
mechanisms. The reorganization of several ministriesbasedon a well-designed program and the
implementation o f civil service reforms to modernize the public sector are important
requirementsto improve the quality of regulations and reduce the likelihood of corruption inthe
provisionof public services.

20.     To provide a more systemic approachto implementing various anticorruption initiatives,
the Government recently prepared a report on the government's actions so far taken regarding
anti-corruption, including the identification of the mandates of core agencies, their roles and
strategies and identification of overlaps and gaps. This report was drafted with significant civil
society and NGO input. The drafting process coincided with developments in civil society, in
which NGOs (such as Transparency International and Open Society Georgia Foundation) were
re-establishing their own anti-corruption agenda. This strategy includes anti-corruption
monitoring, improving public information access and developing civil society capacity to hold
Government accountable for the implementation of anti-corruption reforms.

21.      In the medium term, the Government aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for
fighting corruption, with the participation of civil society. In order to measure progress in the
fight against corruption, the Government aims to conduct periodic surveys and use social
accountability tools (e.g., citizen report card, community score card). In order to increase
transparency, the Government also aims to ask high officials and high-level civil service
personnelto report their income sources, with the reports validated.

2. ImprovingGovernancethroughAdministrative/CivilService Reform

22.      The new Government is committed to improving public administration in order to
enhance its capacity for designing and implementing appropriate public policies and delivering
adequate services to the population. The authorities inherited a weak and disorganized public
administration (autocratic management, weak delegation o f authority, poor communication with

                                                  10


the general public, lack of transparency and accountability, and inadequate coordination among
key state agencies). These weaknesses, together with an unmotivated and poorly managed civil
service, have negatively influenced the quality o f policymaking as well as public services
delivery, andare a decisive factor contributing to corruption.

23.     Georgia has already taken initial steps to reorganize and streamline the government. It
first amended the Constitution and enacted a new Law on Structure, Functions and
Responsibilities o f the Government. The Constitutional amendments created the Prime
Minister's post and introduced the cabinet system o f government. These changes are aimed at
eliminating the fragmentation o f power that existed before.          The Law also provides for a
reduction in the number o f line ministries from 18 to 15 as well as the consolidation o f many
previously semi-independent state departments within their respective ministries. As the first
step toward implementing the Law, the former State Chancellery has been abolished and split
into the President's Administration and the Government Chancellery aiming at a more clear
delineation o f functions between the President and the Prime Minister. In addition, the statutes
o f each new ministry are being aligned with their new mandates. Within the context o f this
restructuring, the staff size within individual ministries i s being reviewed. The intention i s to
optimize the staff size inline with the new functions assigned to each ministry.

24.     The Government's objective for these interventions i s to establish a professional public
sector, boost the morale o f the civil servants, and eliminate institutional sources o f corruption. In
the short term, the Government i s providing some transitional salary increases for selected staff
through two Funds, the UNDP-administered Governance Reform Program andthe Government-
administered Development and Reform Fund. The Government hopes to reduce dependence on
these transitional mechanisms, as it progresses with its public sector reform efforts and develops
the fiscal space to be able to provide adequate salaries to a smaller and more effective civil
service. Inthe meantime, the Government i s committed to securing the transparency o f the two
funds, and thus plans to publish quarterly reports, detailing the sources and applications o f all
funds received, and refraining from accepting any further anonymous contributions. In the
medium-term, the Government will develop a comprehensive salary reform strategy which is
consistent with the medium-termexpenditure framework, its development objectives as reflected
intheEDPRP, andpublic sector reformplans.

25.     In order to develop a more orderly process of civil service adjustment and reform, the
Government i s setting up a Civil Service Council - a high level policy advisory body chaired by
the President and representing all three branches o f the Government as well as regional
authorities. A new Civil Service Bureau i s beingestablished to support the Council as a technical
 secretariat and oversee the implementation o f the civil service reform agenda. Subsequently, the
 Government i s committed to developing civil service reform guidelines. The Government has
 selected two pilot ministries (Health and Education) to start with the implementation o f the civil
 service reform guidelines. The Government i s also committed to implementing the new Law on
 Structure, Functions and Responsibilities o fthe Government inaccordance with the schedule.

 26.    Over the medium term, the Government aims to further elaborate its civil service reform
 guidelines into a more comprehensive civil service reform strategy. This strategy would aim to
 address, inter alia, the introductiodexpansion o f training and career development and would
 include progress indicators for each major activity. Inaddition, Georgia i s committed to drafting

                                                 11


and adopting a new Law on Civil Service to address shortcomings in the current legislation,
particularly the lack of a clear delineation between political and non-political positions. The
Law would also determine the role and functions o f the civil service management entity. The
Government also intends to adopt a Code o f Ethics and Discipline for civil service staff. The
Government will develop a new pay and incentive system within an agreed fiscal framework. A
Personnel Control and Information System will be developed and implemented over the medium
to long term. The Government also aims to improve the quality o f the civil service by
introducing regulations for competitive, merit-based recruitment.

3. ImprovingGovernanceto PromotePrivateSector Development

(a) PromotingPrivateSector Developmentflmprovingthe InvestmentClimate

27.     The Government is committed to improving the business environment inGeorgia through
reducing the cost for establishing and operating businesses, improving private sector
participation inpolicy making, and facilitating transport andtrade. To reachthese objectives, the
Government aims to reduce bureaucratic and non-transparent requirements it i s fully aware of
the negative impact o f unpredictability and delays in administrative procedures, combined with
uneven implementation and enforcement of regulations. In the past, institutional changes and
reform programs have been adopted but poorly implementedowing to the lack o f strong political
will and institutions. The problems inthe businessenvironment have beenfurther aggravated by
the absence o f efficient ways to communicate changes in administrative requirements to the
public, officials and enterprises.

28.     To achieve sustainable improvements in the business environment, the Government's
reform program will focus on developing effective institutions and processes. A conducive
business environment also calls for simplification o f the existing regulatory framework,
improvement in information dissemination, data sharing, staff training, and the development o f
the appeals and feedback mechanisms. A regular dialogue with the business community is
required to assist the fight against corruption and to improve governance and to provide
important input into policy decisions. In this regard, the Government recently established a
cross-Ministerial Commission with membership o f senior decision makers from the relevant
Government agencies who interact with private businesses on a regular basis, and private sector
representatives who can articulate the views o f the business community. Inaddition, a technical
Secretariat was created to carry out the day-to-day work o fthe Commission.

29.      The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS)/Government Assessment of
Administrative Procedures o f Doing Business in Georgia identified a number o f obstacles to
establishing and operating businesses in Georgia. Based on this assessment and other available
reports, the Government recently organized a commission meeting for the purpose o f developing
a new action plan for removing administrative barriers to investment and aims to hold regular
meetings. Subsequently, the Government aims to adopt the action plan which will include
measures to improve/simplify business registration, building permits, tax administration,
customs, standardization and certification, and control over businesses. More specifically, the
number o f inspections will be limited and regulated, and clear jurisdictions will be established
among various agencies. To reduce administrative costs to businesses, the Government plans to

                                                 12


require assessments of the potential justification and impact o f the proposed regulations on
affected businesses prior to their approval. Until such a formal mechanism i s in place, the
authorities would not introduce any new licensing requirements unless they are deemed
absolutely necessary. Proper publicity and public discussions would precede the introduction of
any newregulation.

30.      The Government i s fully aware o f the complexities o f the system o f VAT reimbursement
for export activities. In the past, reimbursements have been tainted by inefficiency and/or
corruption, In this context, the new Government had temporarily suspended VAT
reimbursements. Subsequently, the Government introduced changes in administration of the
system to ensure that the system is efficient, transparent, and corruption-free.          Given its
importance to export competitiveness and in light o f the recent changes in administration o f the
system, the VAT reimbursement system was recently reintroduced and the Government i s
committed to effectively implementingand monitoring it. Inaddition, the Government with the
support from IMF's PRGF program has developed a customs reform and anti-smuggling strategy
paper and would adopt a new Customs code after a consultative process.

31.      Access to non-CIS markets, especially for food and agro-processed products, is quite
difficult in the present circumstances. To facilitate such access, Georgia intends to introduce an
internationally recognized system o f product certification and to accelerate transition to the dual
(voluntary/mandatory) system o f standards inaccordance with the country's obligation to WTO.

32.      Although financial costs have decreased in recent years, they remain high in real terms
and constitute one of the major impediments to business activities. The main concerns include
highinterest rates and considerable collateral requirements (for values exceedingtwice the value
of the loan in most cases). Companies also complain about the short maturity o f loans, mostly
less than a year, which makes investment financing through credit very difficult. The country i s
committed to implementing measures over the medium term to reduce the cost o f finance
through addressing the issues underlying these high costs. Consequently, it has already
implemented measures for further bank consolidation through increases in the minimum capital
requirements o f commercial banks for which a timetable i s enforceable. The authorities are also
planning measures for strong banking supervision, strengthening o f non-bank financial
institutions, and development o f an unified national movable registry.

33.      The investment environment will need to be anchored to a legal framework that i s sound
and addresses a variety o f legal needs-company,        collateral, security, bankruptcy and anti-
monopoly laws. Above all, the legal system will need to respect creditors, property and other
contractual rights and ensure that judicial enforcement i s competent and transparent.          The
Government i s committed to these objectives but recognizes that they are medium to long-term
tasks.

(b) Facilitating Trade, Transit, and Transport

34.      The Government is strongly committed to facilitating legitimate trade, transit and
transport in Georgia, which i s regarded as a key to the development o f the private sector. The
transport corridor through Georgia has not yet succeeded incapturingm u c h o f the potential non-

                                                       13


oil transit traffic from Central Asia and the Caucasus. While official transport fees are
comparable with international benchmarks, the actual cost o f transportation i s not competitive
yet. This is due to major physical and procedural impedimentsincluding porous borders, a non-
commercially oriented railway system, corruption, and weak, cumbersome, and uncoordinated
control by the public sector bodies involved intrade.

35.      A wide range o f impediments, both physical and procedural, contributed, either directly
or indirectly, to increased transport costs. These include high unofficial payments to border
agencies (including customs) and the road police and excessive and often unnecessary
documentation, particularly for transit goods. The improved political climate has contributed to
reduce these problems. The Government has recently upgraded the information systems, through
the implementation o f the Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) system', to
harmonize procedures and reduce the scope o f personal interface between customs officials and
traders which sometimes results inillegal practices.

36.      The Government recently issued orders eliminating the requirements for (i)internal
transit document (VTT) and (ii)      non-excise consignment to travel in convoy (except for vehicles
that are unsecured), both of which had resulted in significant and costly delays to transit cargo.
The short-term benefit o f these measures is considerable; however, there is a need to implement
additional medium-termmeasuresto fully eliminate these problems.

           B. ImprovingPublicFinanceManagementandFinancialAccountabilityg

1. PublicExpenditureManagement

37.      The Government intends to pursue two key objectives for public expenditure
management. The first i s to reduce dependence on external aidborrowing. The second i s to
fundthe social and development priorities inthe EDPRP.The challenge for the Government is to
reconcile these competing goals more effectively than at present. This process will result in a
more strategic and disciplined budget formulation process which realizes the maximum social
and development benefits from the limitedamount o f resources available to the Government, and
a budget execution process which i s subordinate to the agreed budgetplan.

38.      The Government is aware that strengthening budget processes offers ample scope for
quick gains. It recognizes that budget preparation has been hasty and ill-coordinated in recent
times, with limited reference to maximizing the benefits o f budget allocations. Weak budget
preparation has been compounded by inefficient budget execution, with spending outturns
deviating markedly from the budget plan.                In both preparation and execution, the basic
institutions and processes o f sound budgetingare required.

  The authoritiesexpectto implementthis system inAdjara region, which hasrecentlycome under the authority of
the Georgiangovernment

  The CFAA, CPARand PER recommendedsignificant further reforms inpublic financial managementand
procurementsystems. These include improvinginternaland externalaudits, and financial statements consistentwith
internationalstandards. Giventhat a series of annualadjustment operations is planned, inthe periodbetween
approvalo fthis loan andpreparationofthe nextoperation, afuller medium-termplanfor public financial
managementreformwill be elaboratedthat can be monitoredthroughout the program.

                                                14



39.      Most o f the Government's public expenditure reform agenda i s contained in the Budget
Systems Law passed in April 2003. The law introduced major changes in budget preparation,
including the use o f hard ceilings for preparing ministry budgets and personnel allocations and
an activity financing approach (results-focused, agency financing that i s similar to program
budgeting). Other advances include commitment to prepare the 2005 budget in a multi-year
framework, reduce the number of special funds, eliminate protected items in legislation, and
introduce a single Treasury account.      In pursuing all these objectives, the Government is
committed to overcome the most critical challenge: the weak capacity for introducing the new
processes at the bureaucratic level.

40.      The Government recently prepared an action plan for implementing the budget
preparation reforms in the Budget Systems Law, including the following: adhering to the new
budget preparation timetable inthe 2005 budget and inthe future; developing the medium-term
fiscal forecasts and the basic directions for budget policy; establishing linkages between the
EDPRP and the medium-term expenditure framework and annual budget; setting hard ceilings
for preparing ministry budgets and personnel allocations for each spending agency and state
special fund; and reporting on quarterly budgetary execution.

41.      The Government stated its strong commitment to limit divergences between budget
outturns and budget plans and reduce arrears. The key to reducing these divergences i s a realistic
budget preparation process. The introduction o f commitment controls and the requirement for
quarterly reporting to Parliament on budget execution, under implementation, also helps limit the
divergences. Effective quarterly budget reporting will ensure prompt corrective actions when
unexpected developments in budget execution take place. Budget requests based on an activity
and economic classification will emure that policy measures are costed and adequately fundedin
the annual budget law.

42.      The Government recently established a working group co-chaired by the Ministries o f
Finance and Economy for, inter alia, establishing processes to link the EDPRP to the budget
through budgetary ceilings and activity classifications.   The Government believes that these
initiatives should also help to overcome the previous lack o f focus on reform agendas in key
social sector ministries and will encourage them to develop a policy analysis capacity.

43.      Over the medium term, the Government aims to ensure that EDPRP priorities are
adequately reflected in the annual budgets accompanied by a medium-term fiscal framework,
and underpinned by conservative macroeconomic assumptions. The Government aims to set
budget ceilings in close consultations with line ministries and EDPRP-Budget working groups
will be established in the Ministries o f Education and Health. Prompt follow up on quarterly
expenditurereviewswill take place, according to the Government's commitment.

2. FinancialAccountability

(a) PublicFinancialControls

44.     The Government is committed to improvinginternal and external audits. Audits provide
useful recommendations for operational improvement of public activities; external audits are also
important for enhancing the accountability ofthe administration vis- a- vis Parliament.

45.     Serious problems exist both ininternal and external controls which the authorities are now
addressing. The current legislative basis remains outdated, fragmented, and uncoordinated. The
Government stated that it will examine and implement the recently completed Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) undertaken by IDA in Georgia. For internal control, the
CFAA recommends that the Government develop a comprehensive approachto its internal control
framework and the resulting system of internal controls. As a first step, inconsistent legislative
proposals on components of internal control were terminated when the new Government took
office. The Ministry of Finance's Inspector General function remains, and a Head has been
recently appointed. However, the responsibilities for the Inspector General do not reflect
international standards for internal audit. Actions are being preparedto correct this situation.

46.     Over the medium term, the Government aims to improve internal and external audits.
Initially, it will prepare a comprehensive framework for internal audit and control, accompaniedby
draft legislation on internal audit and a plan for its implementation. Implementation of internal
audit units will be initiated inthe Ministries of Health, Education and Finance. The legislation will
have to be passedby Parliament and internal audit units will be implementedinthe three ministries
above. The Government also aims to establish internal audit units in another four key ministries.
According to envisagedplans, the Ministry of Finance will establish the qualifications for internal
auditor and will implement a training plan to fulfill the requirements for auditors across the
government.

47.     For external audit, the CFAA recommended strengthening the Chamber of Control,
including legislative changes to align its mandate with international (INTOSAI) standards and
eliminate from its operations internal audit policy and other operations that are the responsibility of
the Ministry o f Finance. The Government believes that the external audit functions provide an
essential oversight for the Government's system of internal control and help ensure the
Government's accountability to Parliament. It is believed that Parliament will exercise its new
role under the revised Constitution and will appoint a highly-qualified Chairman o f the Chamber
of Control. The Government is committed to work together with Parliament to ensure that the
Chamber of Control's revised role reflects international standards for State Audit Organizations
(INTOSAI). Subsequently, the Government aims to prepare and submit to Parliament a revised
Law on State Audit. The Chamber of Control will need to initiate the training necessaryto fulfill
its role as specified in the revised legislation, and therefore, increase the Government's
accountability to Parliament.

                                                    16


(b) PublicProcurementManagement

48.     The Government i s committed to introducing and promoting increased transparency and
accountability in the public procurement system. The Government plans to build on the
achievementsto date: the modern legislative base that includesthe Law on State Procurements and
the Implementing Regulations, the standard bidding documents, and the national training strategy
and program developed with assistance from international consultants,

49.     The Government has taken a number of steps to follow up on the recommendations from
the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) provided by IDA. The number of
procuring entities was reduced from an initial 8,000 to 3,000 and permanent procurement units
were introduced within each procuring entity. The procurement profession was acknowledged in
the National Roster of Professions and a system to accredit procurement officers has been
developed in consultation with the Ministry of Education. The Administrative Code and Code on
Administrative Violations were amended to make procurement fraud a punishable crime, which i s
a very important step. These draft amendments were also prepared as part o f Georgia's accession
processto WTO and to becoming a signatory to the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA).

50.     The Government recently launched the State Procurement Agency website and improved
the format and content of the procurement-related informationand publishedon website to make it
more user-friendly and complete, and started publishing tender announcements for procurements
by the central state entities. The Government is committed to making further improvements to the
website by including more              comprehensive information about bidding opportunities,
announcements regarding contract awards and administrative review decisions pertaining to
procurement-related disputes, and anupdatedregistry ofproviders for goods, works and services.

51.     Over the medium-term, the Government aims to propose an amendment to the
Procurement Law to include state-owned enterprises under public procurement procedures.
Proper provisions would be made, however, to adapt the application o f procurement procedures
to the conditions demanded by the business-nature of the enterprises. The authorities stated that
they would submit a draft legal act rationalizing the list of items subject to confidential
procurement (security related items). Their main objective i s to prevent the abuses observed in
the past. A fair and transparent administrative procedures for blacklisting companies and
individuals who engage inprocurement fraud andor corruption would be established.

(c) State-ownedEnterpriseAuditManagement

52.     One of the Government's main objectives i s to improve the governance and productivity
o f the 1,800 state-ownedenterprises (SOEs). Most o f these SOEs are small and mediuminsize;
some are not even in operation. About 1,400 SOEs provide mainly municipal functions and the
national authorities envisage transferring their ownership to the relevant municipalities.

53.     There is limited information available on the SOEs. Even for the three hundred and
seventy six SOEs, which the authorities envisage to maintain in the portfolio of the Enterprise
Management Agency, there is reported data only from 2002 and even that information is not
reliable. In this context, it i s difficult for the authorities to perform any detailed financial and

                                                         17


operational assessment of these enterprises. It is believed that SOEs have accumulated major
debt to the state and even to some extent to the private sector. However, it is not possible with
the data available to provide a reliable assessment of the situation at this stage.

54.      Inan effort to improve governance and transparency of the SOE sector, the authorities
have started an initiative to subject all the SOEs to audit, beginning with the largest ones in
accordancewith International Accounting Standards. Inthis context, since 2003,the Government
has contracted from major accountant firms the audits of the 2002 accounts for three major SOEs
(Georgian Railways, Poti Port, and Madneuli Mining Company). The audit reports will be
finalized by end-July 2004 and will be publishedwithin one month following their completion.
The authorities have also initiatedthe audit of the remaining seven largest SOEs by international
audit firms using International Accounting Standards. The remaining SOEs with a turnover of
over 100,000 Lari will be audited in the coming months by qualified Georgian accounting
professionals/firms.

55.    Using the audit reports of these SOEs, over the medium term the Government aims to
develop a time-bound action plan for improving large state enterprises which will include, inter-
alia, the elaboration of comprehensivebusiness plans, actions to comply with recommendations
contained in the audit reports; timetables for privatization and/or restructuring; actions for
strengthening the supervisory boards; plans for setting up internal control units in the largest
SOEs,and the establishment of proper procurement process and auditing procedures. Measures
will be taken so that future privatized enterprises will assess and comply with environmental and
social laws and regulations. To ensure a satisfactory implementation of this agenda, the
authorities are strengthening the capacity of the newly established State Enterprise Management
Agency (SEMA) using donor assistance.

                 C. Taking Steps to ResolveCrucialIssues of the Energy Sector                 lo


56.      Power Sector. The Government is fully aware o f the central role o f reliable electricity
services for the quality of life o f the country's citizens as well as for sustained economic
development. It inherited such a deteriorated electricity infrastructure that without additional
investments, the risk of catastrophic systemic failure will become unacceptably high within the
next two to three years. The power sector faces severe financial challenges largely owing to
problems of non-payments, theft of utility services, and corruption within the sector. Funds
raised from the end-consumers are clearly insufficient to cover even the modest service level
provided during the winter o f 2003/04 when credits and grants from bilateral donors totaling
about $20 million for electricity imports were provided.

57.      Investments of about $250 million are needed in the power sector over the next five to
seven years to improve the functioning o f the system and reduce the risk of systemic collapse to
an acceptable level. While investment funds of such magnitude have not been secured yet, the
Government and donors/IFIs are currently preparing projects worth about US$50 million.''


   Total energy imports (oil, gas, electricity) amountto about20 percent o fthe total imports.

'I IDA is proposinga supplemental operation (US$3.6 million equivalent) to the ongoing Electricity Market
Support Project.

                                                                 18


Further, the Government plans to present to the Donors Meeting in mid-June 2004 a list o f
priority investmenthehabilitation projects for the power sector for which credits and grants
would be sought. Such priority list will reflect the Government's aim to remedy the financial
crisis in the sector through, among others, investments that could improve collections, reduce
commercial losses and corruption, while also attending to critical repairs to try to avoid massive
systemic collapses in the power system investment. The private participation in the sector i s
high12,and it may be more prudent for the Government to improve sector conditions before
seeking further large-scale privatization. It i s recognized that Georgia will have to make a
significant financial contributions to the power sector for 2005 and onwards through the State
budget. Meanwhile, the authorities have increased the allocation in the State budget for the
energy sector by 11% to about US$31 million, including adequate budgetary funding to
Government agencies to pay their energy consumption bills and including subsidiesto vulnerable
groups. The Government has prepared draft legislation to address and help remedy the critical
financial situation of many utilities inthe power sector (temporary actions for debt resolution).
Further, the authorities have appointed new members o f the Georgian National Energy
Regulatory Commission (GNERC).                           It is expected that more than two dozen small,
counterproductive distribution licenses inside the service territory o f the Georgian Unified
Distribution Company (UDC) will be revoked. These measures are important for improving
governance inthe sector.

58.        The Government recently prepared a Strategic Action Plan which elaborates on, inter
alia: (i)the Government's energy policy priorities; (ii)                     investment sources and priorities; (iii)
planned structural reforms and modifications to legislation; and (iv) simulations o f electricity
service levels for the 2004/05 winter and implications in the form o f electricity imports. The
Government is aware o f the fact that a service level inU D C for the winter 2004/05 on level with
2003/04 would require substantial supplemental financing from outside the sector. Inthe coming
months, the Government will work out plans for electricity imports, if any, commensurable with
available funds. The Strategic Action Plan will be supported by the recent legislative measures to
address the insolvency problems o f electricity utilities. Inaddition, the Government will review
the electricity tariff methodology with technical assistance from IDA with a view to ensuring
adequate structure for cost recovery.

59.        Over the medium term, in accordance with the Strategic Action Plan, the Government
plans to complete agreements with IFIddonors for the above-mentioned US$50 million. The
Plan also establishes priorities for projects that will be undertaken in the sector. For new
investment projects, Environmental Impact Assessments will be undertaken as a basis for
developing environmental mitigation plans. Rehabilitation projects will be requiredto adhere to
existing environmental standards in accordance with the current laws and regulations. Other
important actions that the Plan includes are: revisiting the funds distribution model inside the
power sector; reviewing/improving the tariff methodology; moving certain assets (switchyards)
from generation to transmission; and low-voltage lines and equipment from transmission to
distribution; and improving the legislatiordenforcement concerning electricity theft. The

l2 Privatesector ownership participationinthe power sectorcomprisesthe distribution companies for Tbilisi (75% private) and
Kakheti(easternGeorgia), intotal distributing aboutone third of the country'selectricity. Georgia's largest andmost efficient
thermal power plant is 75% privately owned. Some small hydropowerplantsare privatized. About 80% of generation capacity
is state controlled, as well as the entire high-voltagetransmissionsystem. The transmissionsystemand UDC, the largest
distributioncompany, are under managementcontractswith intemationalfirms.

                                                  19


Government will communicate extensively with the population about the power crisis and
remedial measures through a public relations campaign. The intention is to obtain the
cooperation o f the whole population in order to improve electricity services, with the fight
against electricity theft and increased payment discipline being part o f the solution. With an
improvedenvironment and some concrete governance measures already taken, it is expected that
bill collections will show a clear increase inthe months to come. The Government is expected to
address social impact o f electricity prices as a part o f the overall poverty reduction strategy (see
para 72).

60.      Gas Sector. Over the medium term, the Government also aims to take measures to
improve efficiency and governance in the gas sector. It aims to hecide on an organizational
model for gas supply that ensures optimum utilization o f supply from various sources (north and
east) and secure access to gas storage facilities. In addition, the Government aims to make a
public determination o f the role that major companies would play in the sector and clarify
sources o f investment funds for emergency repairs or rebuilding o f the north-south transit gas
pipeline.

                                  D. Protectingthe Vulnerable

1. Improvingthe Implementationof the EDPRP

61.      Supported by the international community and in close cooperation with Georgian civil
society and non-governmental organizations, the country has prepared an Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP) and presentedit inJuly 2003. The new
Government i s fully committed to the implementation o f the EDPRP. The Government intends
to update, revise, and improve the EDPRP in light o f new developments, especially in terms o f
further prioritization and more realistic costing within the available resource envelope. It has
prepared a time-bound action plan to commence promptly effective implementation o f the
updatedhevised EDPRP (see Annex 3). An EDPRP progress report to be prepared through a
fully participatory process will be submitted by October 2004. Moreover, the EDPRP will be
made fully operational. The authorities see the EDPRP as laying the foundation for conducting
the budgetary process, allocating budgetary resources, and devising and implementing sector
specific reforms.

62.      The Government, in full consultation with civil society and other stakeholders, will
continue to improve the EDPRP contents and resolve the institutional and technical problems
that have limited its connections to the budget. Short-term plans involve the following. First,
the Ministry o f Finance will provide the technical instructions to establish the linkages between
the EDPRP/medium-term expenditure framework and the annual budget. Second, a working
group co-chaired by the Ministries o f Finance and Economy has been formed to make the
linkages operational. As a start, the EDPRP-budget links will be developed in at least two key
sectors (e.g., Education and Health). The Government i s committed to implement these linkages
for the preparation o fthe 2005 budget.

63.      Over the medium term, the objective i s to continue to improve EDPRP links to the
budget. The Government will also report on these links-through             a special appendix to the

                                                  20


budget and through direct improvements in allocations to key sectors. The authorities will
establish EDPRP-Budget working groups throughout government, starting in the Ministries of
Education and Health. NewEDPRP monitoring mechanismswill be promoted, so the authorities
and population can evaluate the degree to which priority programs are executed as planned. The
Government's intention i s to be more strategic on development and poverty reduction, so that
actual budget allocations reflect its objectives and goals.

2. Social Sectors and Poverty Reduction

64.     Georgia has experienceda severe decline inwelfare since independence. Unemployment
and underemployment are high, social conditions have deteriorated, poverty and vulnerability
have increased. Maternalmortality, access to health, safe water and sanitation, andthe quality of
social services have worsened in comparison with the pre-transition situation. The Government
i s concerned about the trends shown in social indicators and plans to tackle these issues through
medium and long-term actions. The government intends to design and introduce poverty
indicators. Subsequently, these indicators would be produced regularly and will guide policies
and EDPRP discussions.

65.     The Government i s undertaking a range of measures aiming at improving access to and
quality of social services, as well as at assistingindividuals and families better manage social and
economic risks. The Government is focusing particularly to the extreme poor - approximately 17
percent o fthe population.

66.     Health. Georgia initiated health reforms in 1995 aimed at improving access to quality
basic health services for the population. Nonetheless, severe funding constraints resultedinthe
deterioration of the public health infrastructure, and limited availability of essential drugs and
consumables. The public health system failed to provide an adequate level of services to the
population, especially to the poor. Georgia is at risk of not achieving some of the MDGs,
particularly those related to early childhood and maternal mortality. There i s a rapid increase in
HIV/AIDS incidence and the Government is working-with the international community to
combat the disease.

67.     To tackle the most urgent issues affecting the sector, over the medium term the
Government aims to focus on the following areas:

     0  Reforming Health Care Financing. The Government aims to improve the allocative and
        technical efficiency of the available resources by rationing basic benefit package and
        improved targeting of poor segments of population. In order to ensure that preventive
        services are adequately financed, government expenditures on health care will primarily
        be allocatedto preventive services andprimaryhealth care.

     a  Improving Access to Quality Basic Health Services. For rural and high mountain
        populations, access to quality health care is severely constrained. The Government will
        directly address this problem by supporting investments in primary health care in rural
        and high mountain areas, and supporting a conducive health care financing arrangement
        to enable the urbanpoor to seek services.

                                                 21


        Improving Health Care Delivery System. The Georgian health system is highly
        fragmented, focuses on hospital-based specialized care and is inefficient. Inthe absence
        o f an adequate primary health care system, basic services are being provided in
        specialized hospitals and polyclinics. The Government aims at shifting the orientation of
        the health system towards preventive and primary health care and realign the rest of the
        system to support primary care. It would also support restructuring and downsizing of
        existing PHC and hospital infrastructure inthe country, and realign, retrain and redeploy
        health personnel dependingon the current needs inthe country.

68.     Water and Sanitation.      Clean water is an integral part of the strategy for reducing
poverty and achieving Millennium Development Goals. According to the Government's
monitoring data, water-born diseases are mostly registered inbig towns. These diseases-gastro-
enteritis, diarrhea, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, hepatitis, etc.--are largely caused by secondary
contamination o f water in the urban distribution system. The numbers of water-related health
outbreaks are going up, as reported by the National Disease Control Center. Although the
Georgian Legislation and related programs in the field o f water supply and sanitation intendto
move towards compliance with international standards, lack of funds, complicated administrative
structure, and insufficientcoordination have often hamperedmeasurableimprovements.

69.     To improve water quality, the Government aims to: (i) a systematic attempt to raise
                                                                 make
public awareness of the health and economic impacts of poor water quality and encourage
participation in decision-making as well as a systematic collaboration and consensus building
across sectors, and among affected stakeholders, to agree on priorities and adoptable measures;
(ii) Improve wastewater management in urbanized and coastal tourist centers by expanding
service connections to cover all connectable properties, constructing sewerage facilities intarget
areas, promoting intermediate solutions, and creating smaller collection and treatment systems;
(iii)stimulate revenue and investments by increasing wastewater fees, implementing the
"polluter pays principle," creating incentives for private sector participation, and; (iv) enact
effective regulations, specifically, the Clean Water Act, with clear implementing rules and
regulations.

70.     Education. The Government has taken stock of the significant deterioration experienced
by the public education system in recent years. The central objective is to improve the quality
and relevance of students learning outcomes. To improve the quality, accessibility and relevance
of education, a number of important steps have already been taken at the primary and secondary
education level: the national curriculum i s being revised, the national system for students'
assessment and examination has been introduced, an alternative system for financing textbooks
i s being piloted, and a major effort has been launched to provide in-service training for education
professionals and raise their awareness of the needto change classroom practice.

71.     Over the medium term, the Government's central priority i s to reallocate resources to
primary and secondary education and to better target the poorest and vulnerable groups.
Therefore, the Government aims to define a program to reallocate budgetary resources which
will be based on, inter alia, entailing development of a per capita financing model and greater
decentralization of decision-making to local schools and communities, and in some cases
consolidation of schools and/or introduction of multi-grade teaching. The Government will
develop strategies to improve human resource and teacher's career development and efficient

                                                 22


and equitable allocation of financial resources through the Education System Realignment and
Strengthening Program. To monitor the impact of the ongoing reform interventions on the
quality of education, key performance indicators for the education system are being developed
by the Ministryof Educationandwill be usedfor policy making purposes.

72.     Social Protection. The aim o fthe authorities is to provide adequate poverty alleviation to
the neediest people in Georgian society. The Government has taken important measures that
resulted in timely payment of pensions and other social transfers. It has also started clearing
arrears in the pension system. Inthe mediumterm, within the overall availability of resources,
the authorities will continue their efforts to increase pensions and social assistance, as well as
significantly strengthen the targeting of social assistance benefits to the extreme poor. The
Government will consolidate various cash social assistance programs, includingthose targeted at
Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), into a single, targeted cash family poverty benefit. The
benefit would be targeted at the extreme poor and is expected to alleviate poverty more
efficiently and effectively than currently existing programs. The Government i s also planning to
develop institutional capacity for implementation of the targeted poverty benefit. At the same
time, it intends to take measures to significantly improve the capacity of local welfare offices to
deliver the targeted social assistance in a transparent manner. Inaddition, the authorities planto
initiate actions in the areas o f employment and labor markets to increase employment
opportunities. These, inparticular, aim at improving current institutions in the labor market as
well as labor market intermediation.

73.     The Government will continue its efforts to pay pensions on time and gradually increase
them. In parallel, the Government intends to analyze reform options in order to introduce an
optimal systemthat provides protection against poverty inold age, as well as offers opportunities
for private voluntary contractual savings.

74.     Poverty Monitoring. The Government is in the process of designing and introducing
living standards and poverty monitoring indicators that will be published regularly. The
indicators would guide the monitoring of the EDPRP implementation and would serve as an
information base for efficient social policy design. Household budget surveys are expectedto be
conductedregularly.

                                 IV. THE PROPOSEDCREDIT

                                   A. Rationale and Objectives

75.     The proposedCredit aims to provide initial assistanceto the new Government of Georgia
inthe first phase ofits efforts to defineandlaunchaboldprogram ofeconomic, legal, and social
reforms. The Credit would support urgent actions in the following areas: (i)strengthening
governance/anti-corruption and public sector management; (ii)improving public finance
management and financial accountability; and (iii)    taking steps to resolve crucial issues of the
energy sector. Actions taken inthese areas would contribute significantly to the implementation
of broader structural reforms over the mediumterm. At the same time, the proposed operation
aims to define, in broad preliminary terms, a framework for future policy-based lending and

                                                 23


policy dialogue by IDA to support Georgia's medium-term economic growth and poverty
reduction efforts.

76.     The Government has already undertaken a number o f actions covering diverse areas. (See
Annex 1.) Most of these actions benefited significantly from IDA'Spolicy dialogue, analytical
work, policy-based and investment operations, and technical assistance over the past several
years. The proposed operation would fully recognize and support the Government's strong
reform efforts reflected in the referred actions. To help further advance Government's reform
agenda, it i s proposed that additional short-term crucial actions also included in the Annex 1be
taken before the Board presentation. The actions taken by the new Government so far and the
few additional actions to be taken before the Boardpresentation would provide an adequate basis
for the proposedoperation.

                               B. Design of the Proposed Credit

77.     Indesigningthe proposedCredit, the following aspects were considered important: (i)      the
proposed Credit as a bridge operation, which provides timely and urgently needed assistance to
the new Government and leads toward future medium-term programmatic policy-based
operations; (ii) lessons learned from previous adjustment operations; (iii)  complementarity with
the IMF's PRGF program and other donors' assistance; (iv) the Bank's past and ongoing
analytical work, the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and the EDPRP; and (v) the
Government's ownership and implementation capacity, especially in view of the very limited
implementationperiod.

78.     Lessons Learned. This operation draws upon the lessons learned from IDA support to the
reform process in Georgia (see Annex 4). The country undertook initial reforms with some
success specifically in the area o f privatization of several state enterprises, trade liberalization
and the establishment o f a basic legal framework. Several Bank operations supported this reform
process, in particular structural adjustment credits, technical assistance, institution building and
energy reform. After a short while, however, political and governance issues emerged as
dominant problems. The country increasingly suffered from the deterioration in governance, the
fragmentation o f power, the prevalence o f interest groups and pervasive corruption. As a result,
achievements were often undermined. These negative factors are at the center o f recent political
events in Georgia and the present Government bases its legitimacy on strong actions to address
them. The success of a reform operation in Georgia will depend basically on two main factors.
First, the operation must be well defined and focused on priority issues where the medium-term
strategy is well understood and accepted by the Government. This is fully taken into
consideration in the proposed operation which covers only the most crucial areas mentioned
above. Second, any reform program must be grounded in a realistic assessment o f the
Government's implementation capacity. This also tilts in favor o f a well focused operation.
Moreover, the need to increase the Government's implementation capacity i s an important
element in the Bank dialogue and coordination with other donors, as well as in designing its
future lendingand assistanceprogram.

79.     Complementarity with the IMF Program. The centerpiece o f the IMF's PRGFprogram i s
a decisive attack on corruption that should underpin sizable gains in tax collections, thereby
allowing the Government to eliminate domestic arrears during the program period while

                                                 24


increasing spending on core social and infrastructure projects. The PRGF program also includes
selected reforms in the energy sector (including indicative quarterly quantitative targets for
average monthly electricity and gas collections), state enterprise management (audits) as well as
dismantling protectionist measures adopted in late 2002. (For IMF-Bank relations which spells
out the division o f labor betweenthe institutions, see Annex 5.)

80.     Coordination with Other Stakeholders. Inaddition to close coordination with the IMF's
PRGF program, the preparation of the proposed credit has been coordinated with other donors'
work, in particular the European Commission (administrative reform, rule of law), USAID
(budgedtreasury management, governance, anti-corruption, private sector development, energy),
UNDP (administrativekivil service reform,            poverty monitoring),   DFID (expenditure
management, governance), EBRD (investment promotion, energy), the Netherlands (overall: co-
financing with the proposed operation), and KfW (energy) as well as with the private sector
(Georgian Business Confederation, Association of Georgian Exporters, etc.) andNGOs.

                                   C. Credit Implementation

81.     Credit Disbursement. The proposed credit would be a single tranche operation in the
amount o f US$24,000,000 equivalent to SDR 16,600,000 to be disbursed in US Dollars into a
designated Deposit Account at the National Bank of Georgia. Further, disbursements would be
based on a negative list of prohibited expenditures. The specific set of actions required for the
tranche release are listed as the core actions in the Annex 1. Actions Supported by the Reform
Support Credit.

82.     Implementation and Monitoring. The implementation of the Credit program will be
coordinated and monitored at the highest level of Government. Key decisions will be referred to
the Cabinet which will coordinate and monitor the reform process. In addition, the authorities
will consult and coordinate key policy matters with the private sector through a commission
established with public and private sector representatives to promote improvements in the
business environment. IDA will also interact with the private sector (Georgian Business
Confederation, Association of Georgian Exporters, etc.), donors, and civil society to gauge the
impact on the ground.

83.     Credit Management. The Government will open and maintain an account (Deposit
Account) in the National Bank o f Georgia on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The
Ministry of Finance of Georgia will be responsible for the Credit's administration and for
preparing the withdrawal applications, maintaining the Deposit Account as required, and
arranging for its timely audit. The Credit will be subject to ratification by Parliament before it
becomes effective.     The Ministry of Finance, with the assistance of the National Bank of
Georgia, would maintain records of all transactions under the Credit in accordance with sound
accounting practices.

84.     Audits,   Upon the request of IDA, audits o f the Deposit Account will be conducted.
Audit reports should be furnished to the Association as soon as possible, but not later than four
months after the date of disbursement of funds to the account.           Terms of reference for
independentauditors acceptable to the Bank will be submittedto the Association and discussed
with the Government.

                                                25



85.     Closing Date. The expectedclosing date of the Credit will be December 31,2004.

86.     Environmental Impact. The proposedCredit is not expectedto have any direct impact on
the environment. In line with Operational Directive 8.60, the Government i s recommended to
carry out a Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment for the purposes of developing a
Strategic Action Plan for energy sector development, as well as introducing environmental
impact assessment procedures for enterprises that are potentially harmful for the environmental
or intended for privatization into its plan for improving management of the State Owned
Enterprises.

                        D. Coordinationwiththe IMFandOtherDonors

87.     The Credit's objectives will be supported by the Bank's close collaboration with the IMF
and other donors. The proposed Credit and the PRGF reform measures complement each other.
They are also part of the broader efforts to assist Georgia, including through the Donors Meeting
and the Paris Club. Important financial andtechnical support is expectedfrom bothforums. Some
donors have advanced their decisions to contribute to Georgia's program of reform in close
collaboration with the proposed Credit. The Netherlands is considering the provision of co-
financing with the proposed Credit for Euro 3 million. The UnitedKingdom (DFID) will provide
technical assistance in support o f the Government's program in areas such as anti-corruption
strategy, external audits, and EDPRP-budget linkage. Both donors consulted and coordinated with
IDA during the preparationofthis operation.

                                      E. PovertyImplications

88.     The supportto the Government's program is expectedto have severalpositive impacts on
poverty. First, it contributes to an improved fiscal situation that allows for the timely payment o f
salaries, pensions, and social expenditures. Fiscal stability also reduces the risks o f repeated
crises or inflationary processes which affect growth and the poor negatively. Second, the
Government's program embraces the central pillars of the EDPRP and will make it more
operational. The program will link the EDPRP to the budget, starting with the Health and
Education budgets and will define budgetary ceilings based on the priorities of the EDPRP.
Third, the program tackles the issue of governance and corruption. The poorest segments of
society tend to be the main victims of corruption. They are usually prevented from becoming
small business persons and end up paying a disproportional part of their benefits to corrupt
officials and rent seekers. A more transparent public administration would increase availability
of public servicesheduce the cost of administrative procedures thereby benefiting the poor.
Finally, improvements in the energy sector would make economic activities more competitive
and would facilitate the creation o fnewbusinesses and employment opportunities.

                            F. Linkageto PRSPandBankStrategy

89.     Linkage to PRSP. Georgia completed its PRSP (known as the EDPRP) in July 2003
(Report No. 26964-GE).       The EDPRP focuses on five strategic pillars: governance, fiscal
management, the business environment, human capital, and reducing the vulnerability of the
poor, It also includes specific measuresto improve major productive sectors of the economy, the

                                               26


natural environment, post-conflict zones, and science and technology. While the new
Government aims to revisehpdate the EDPRP incorporating any new element of the reform
agenda, its main elements remain valid and have been embraced by the new Government.
Moreover, the new authorities are making the EDPRP operational by linking it to the budget. It
has been emphatically stated that any revision or update will be precededby a full participatory
process. The proposed operation is consistent with the EDPRP and described in the medium-
term program o f the Government. By emphasizing fiscal stability, anti-corruption, better
governance, improved electricity services, and improved business environment, the proposed
Credit would address central issues aimed at reducingpoverty.

90.     Linkage to Bank Strategy.     The last CAS was prepared in September, 1997 (Report
No.17000-GE). A new CAS for FY04-06 hadbeendistributedto the Board inNovember 2003.
However, inview of the Rose Revolution and resulting political changes that occurred before the
CAS could be discussed,        Management withdrew the document in order to review IDA
assistance priorities with the new Government. IDA has since agreed with the authorities that
an entirely new CAS should be prepared, in the context of an updated EDPRP on which work
will start shortly. Current plans are to present the new CAS for FY06-09 inthe second half of
FY05, possibly prior to Board consideration of the first of the prospective programmatic
adjustment operations.

91.     Meanwhile, IDA will also: (i)co-chair with the European Commission a Donors'
Meeting scheduled for June 16-17 in Brussels to discuss international community support to
Georgia,; (ii)process supplemental financing for energy and a secondary and rural roads project,
for Board consideration on June 24, 2004, along with the proposed operation; (iii)provide some
limitednew investment support for rural poverty reduction inearly FY05; (iv) step up its AAA
work in Georgia, focusing on public expenditure, poverty and fiduciary issues, and (v)
restructure/accelerate implementation of several ongoing operations to address pressing needs,
particularly inthe social sectors.

92.     IDA'S ongoing and planned activities to complement the reforms supported by the
proposed operation are the following. In the social sectors, IDA is implementing projects to
improve efficiency and better targeting public resources. For example, an Education System
Strengthening and Realignment Project aims at improving learning outcomes at the primary and
secondary levels; a Primary Health Care Development Project provides support to restructure
hospitals and a Social Investment Fund would assist poor and vulnerable communities. To assist
the Judiciary, a key area for improved governance, IDA is financing aJudicial Reform aiming at
modernizing the system by providing training and equipment and improvingprocedures with the
Judiciary. In infrastructure, the Roads Project assists in improving the main road network. The
Electricity Market Support Project is now underway and complements the various initiatives to
assist this complex and crucial sector. Details of the forthcoming operations are provided in
Annex 6.

93.     For the remainder of FY04, IDA proposes to provide supplemental assistance for energy,
as the needs identified by the Electricity Strategic Action Plan are substantial, and for rural
infrastructure in the form of secondary and local road rehabilitation. For FY05, it should be
emphasizedthat the final amount and precise timing o f the proposed operations describedbelow

                                                27


would take into consideration the allocation of IDA to Georgia for next fiscal year. The
envisaged lendingprogram for FY05 would includeprogrammatic adjustment lending to deepen
our assistance to fight corruption, improve governance, increase efficiency of the public sector
and further assist in poverty alleviation. This programmatic lending would be provided in
coordination with a new technical assistance project to support reform of the public sector.
These two operations would rank high as they address the most fundamental issues faced by the
country.

94.     Several projects are proposed for FY05 in order to improve the well-being of rural
communities. First, a proposed operation would help develop private agriculture by improving
farmers' access to agricultural supply chains and better commercialization practices. Second,
support i s envisaged to improve communications through privately-provided and competitive
information, communications, telecommunications (ICT) services inunservedareas, by building
the technical capacity of the regulator and by using the existing postal network to improve ICT
access, Community-based tourism would be promoted to help communities protect their cultural
assets and promote local tourism. Finally, a transport and trade facilitation project would be
provided for border-agency modernization, integrated transit management and restructuring of
state-ownedenterprises relevant to transit trade.

95.     Regarding economic and sector work, IDA will continue with studies and policy notes
that would assist the country in key areas o f poverty reduction and public sector management.
They would includework on a public expenditure review and poverty assessment, which will be
conducted in a programmatic fashion, as well as a pension and social protection note and rural
infrastructure study. The situation of the State Owned Enterprises will be examined to advance
our policy dialogue about improving their governance, restructuring and/or privatization.
Reviews on the health sector and child welfare are about to be completed and will contribute to
the design and implementation of better policies in those areas. The proposed ESW would
provide key inputs for the implementation of the EDPRP. Annex 6 contains details o f the
proposed ESW program.

                                      G.Benefits and Risks

96.     BeneJits.  The proposed operation would help the new authorities in their efforts to
improve governance and invigorate the economic reform process, as well as support fiscal
stability and poverty reduction directly. First, the proposed Credit aims to address, as central
issues, governance, corruption and the business environment, thereby making economic
activities more sustainable and facilitating the creation of new businesses, and helping to create
employment. Second, a stable fiscal environment allows for the timely payment of salaries,
pensions, and social expenditures, and thereby contributes to poverty reduction. The Credit also
aims to helpthe Government link the programs inthe EDPRP to the budget process.

97.     Risks.   The new Government inherited a desperate fiscal situation, coupled with an
almost completely collapsed state apparatus. It has taken decisive measures to begin addressing
the underlying problems of corruption and poor governance, which have considerably enhanced
its credibility. A variety of measures have also been adopted that should strengthen the fiscal
position progressively. However, in the near term, the sustainability of the reform process
depends critically on quick progress to address the problem of chronic arrears in salaries,

                                                28


pensions and other social expenditures, and the lack of financial resources could cause the
program to fail. The proposed Credit, together with support through the IMF's new PRGF,
assistance from other donors, and improved domestic revenue performance, would help to
mitigate this risk.

98.      The Government's reform efforts also face the following main risks: (i) reappearanceof
a deteriorated security andor political environment (e.g., issues surrounding the breakaway
regions--Abkhazia and South Ossetia); (ii)powerful special interest groups opposing reforms
and better governance; and (iii)weak implementation capacity of the Government.

99.      The new political environment in Georgia, the overwhelming electoral victories of the
present Government at the Presidential and Parliamentary elections, and the recent return of
Adjara under the authority of the Government of Georgia helpto ameliorate these risks.

100.     For this operation, the lessons of past adjustment lending, in particular the weak
implementation capacity of the government, have been carefully factored into the design:
notably, through the narrow focus on priority issues and the requirement for upfront
implementation o f reform actions. Over the medium term, the weak implementation capacity
poses concern on the sustainability of the reform program implementation. The public service
inheritedby the new Government lacks adequate skills and competencies, and civil servants are
underpaid. The new Government recognizes the shortcomings o f the civil service and has taken
important steps to address the inherited deficiencies. Donors are actively supporting these
initiatives. IDA'Ssupport, in particular through the forthcoming Public Sector Reform Project,
will be directed at strengthening the legal framework and providing technical support for setting
up personnel control and information systems, elaborating pay and incentive reform plans,
establishing merit based recruitment and promotion mechanisms, improving public expenditure
management, in particular by linking the EDPRP to the budget, and improving private-public
consultation inpolicy making processfor improvingthe business environment.

              H. Prerequisitesfor FutureProgrammaticAdjustmentOperations

101.     This operation is intended to be a bridge toward a series of programmatic adjustment
operations. In the context of the preparation of this operation, preliminary discussions were
initiated on the potential reform areas that could be supported by the prospective programmatic
adjustment operations. The following could be considered key critical areas where satisfactory
progress would be needed for moving forward with subsequent programmatic adjustment
operations.

     e   Maintaining macroeconomic stability

     e   Satisfactory progress in the elaboration of a strategy for improving primary health care
         and education outcomes.

                                      1. Introduction

1.     Since the peaceful `Rose Revolution' in November 2003, the new Government of
Georgia has initiated a deep political transformation aimed at restoringthe reform process
after years o f mismanagement and corruption inthe previous Government. Reform under
the previous Government had come to a virtual standstill due to pervasive corruption and
governance problems. The new Government, which was elected with a sweeping
mandate to root out these problems, will be guided by the highest ethical standards and
will pursue the establishment of proper principles of governance with commitment and
determination.

2.      Georgia's program of national recovery aims to reverse the years o f stagnation,
fragmentation     and discord that have handicapped its development,             stability,
inclusiveness, and independence. The Government has established five pillars which
form the foundation upon which the new leadership will seek to rebuildGeorgia's future:

    0   Commitment to the principles of democracy and democratic governance.
        Obligation to construct andmanage an effective government.
    0   Duty to invest inpeople through education and the provision o f public services.
    0   Pledge to celebrate and protect its unique cultural heritage.

                                                37


      e   Responsibility to ensure territorial integrity, national security and economic
          prosperity.

  3.      The basic principles underlying our reform program include protection o f human
  rights, equality before the law, elimination of corruption and bribery, the enhancement of
  transparency, public oversight and citizens participation, clear accountability, reduction
  instate interferenceand increasedprofessionalism ofour civilservice.

  4.       By decisively addressing the principles above, Georgia will make significant
  progress toward economic growth and poverty alleviation. Our economic reform agenda
  is part o f our strong commitment to build national unity and to secure a better future for
  all members o f society, regardless of ethnic origin, faith or gender.
                                                                                               ,
  5.       To advance our objectives, we have taken important initial actions, among others,
  inthe following areas:

       e   Government structures have been simplified with several departments abolished
           ox merged;
       e   Significant changes are underway inour law enforcement and defense ministries;
       e   Initial measures to reduce corruption in Customs and key public enterprises have
           been taken, some prosecutions are underway and alleged corrupt officials have
           beenjailed;
       0   Tax collections have substantially improved and pensions and salaries are being
           paid on time.

   6.      These reforms are only the beginning o f a long process. We are fully committed
   to deepening our reform efforts over the coming months as elaborated below.

                            11. MaintainingMacroeconomic Stability

   7.      It i s our firm intention to implement policies amenable to economic growth, price
   stability and fiscal stabilization. Georgia grew by over 8 percent in 2003, and it is
   expected to grow by about 6 percent this year and about 5 percent per annum over the
   mediumterm. This projected growth reflects essentially a recovery andis consistent with
   the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP). The basic
   objective o f our program is to make this growth sustainable over the medium and longer
   term, The annual rate o f inflation has been relatively low (around 5 percent per year) in
.  recent years.      The authorities are implementing monetary policies consistent with
   inflation o f the order o f 5 percent per year. The exchange regime is fully liberalized, and
'  the real exchange rate has been roughly stable since 1999. Our macroeconomic policies
   are guided by the PRGF program with the IMF.

   8.      The precarious fiscal situation is a difficult issue facing the new Government. The
   2003 target for tax revenue was missed by some 0.7 percent o f GDP, especially because
   of weakness in tax and customs administration. As a result, the stock o f domestic
   expenditure arrears increased to 4.8 percent of GDP by the end o f the year. The

                                            38


government deficit on a cash basis amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2003 while the
deficit on a commitment basis was 2.5 percent. Gross international official reserves fell
slightly to 1.5 months o f imports of (non-pipeline) goods and services. We are dealing,
indetail, with fiscal issuesinthe context of the PRGF.

9.       The 2004 budget aims at increasing tax revenue by at least 1.6 percent o f GDP and
1 percent afterwards. The authorities understand that this target is ambitious but remain
firmly committed to reach it. Our objective is to reduce the fiscal deficit to 1.6 percent of
GDP on a commitment basis and 2.6 percent on a cash basis inthe current year. This will
result in a reduction in arrears to 3.3 percent of GDP by the end of 2004. The increase in
tax revenues will strongly depend on improvement o f tax and customs administration,
especially regarding excise, value added taxes and customs duties. This, in tum, will
demands strong actions. We have taken measures to improve tax and customs                    '
administration and are committed to fight tax fraud and other abuses. We are pursuiig
strong anti-smuggling efforts, intensifying surveillance over small-scale oil refineries and
introducing far-reaching improvements in personnel and management o f the Tax and
Customs Departments. Moreover, we are preparing an anti-smuggling strategy for prompt
implementation. This strategy, in addition to combating corruption, should result in
increasedrevenues.

 10.     We are also committed to curbing the widespread evasion o f fuei and cigarette
excises. The Government i s fully aware of the need to broaden the tax base. Inthis regard,
we will review our tax policy this year with an aim to dismantle exceptions and simplify
the tax regime. The new tax regime is expected to start in 2005. We plan to increase
budgetary expenditures and net lending gradually from 20.5% o f GDP in 2004 to about
25% of GDP in 2008. This increase will reflect the reduction in Government arrears
(particularly wages and pensions) and increase in key economic and social expenditures,
 which are consistent with the EDPRP objectives.       We will continue to pay wages and
 pensions payments on time. This is very important for public sector efficiency and,
 particularly inthe case o fpensions, for poverty reduction.

 11.      Georgia is committed to attaining debt sustainability. We know that the situation
 is difficult, and Georgia will require strong support from the intemational community.
 The Paris Club debt consolidation period for Georgia ended in 2002. It was initially
 planned to consider the case for further debt rescheduling in2003, but it was not possible
 inview ofthe difficulties thenexistingwiththe PRGF. As a result, fbrther accumulation
 of external arrears took place. To clear these arrears and achieve medium term external
 viability, the Government is requesting a rescheduling o f 2003 arrears and eligible 2004-
 06 maturities, with comparable treatment by non-Paris Club bilaterals. The latest Debt
 Sustainability analysis for Georgia suggests that without concessional restructuring,
 Georgia's heavy debt burden would be extremely difficult to manage. This reinforces our
 view about the support we need from the international community to deal with our debt
 problem.

     HI. StrengtheningPublicSector Management andGovernance/Anti-Corruption

                                               39


  A. Formulating,Implementing,and Monitoringan Anti-CorruptionStrategy

  12.      Reducing corruption is a central objective and mandate of this Government.
  Corruption has become a major constraint to public sector effectiveness and an obstacle
  to private sector growth. When we took office, enterprises of every size were harassed,
  with even the smallest businesses subject to frequent visits by inspectors. Larger
  businesses suffered the added disadvantage of attracting the attention not just of local
  officials but of the entire power pyramid, and this created an effective ceiling on
  enterprise growth for those without special influence. Weak law enforcement authorities
  aggravated this corruption. Moreover, hard criminal activities such as murder and
  kidnapping o f staff, particularly of international companies was a frequent occurrence.
  The large size o f the shadow economy has reduced the tax base.                 Indicators of
  perceptions o f governance, derived from various sources indicate the gravity of the,         `

  situation.    Georgia, compared with other CIS countries, scored lower on political
  stability, regulatory quality, rule of law andcontrol ofcomptiondimensions.

  13.      The Government is strongly committed to fightingcorruption. This is reflected in
  various changes including the developmentof legislation to eliminate special revenues, a
  re-focused role of the financial police, the introduction o f civilian control inthe security
  force, strengthened conflict of interest provisions, and improved hctioningand structure
  of the court system and the executive branch of Government. Our commitment has
  already been translated into legal actions, arrests and prosecutions as well as
  reorganizationsunderway in several major public sector organizations. .We believe that,
  as a result, some improvement in govemance is already noticeable. However, we are
  consciousthat major challenges lie ahead.

   14.      We acknowledge that curbing conuption will demand long term, systemic efforts.
   Inthis regard, the Government has implemented steps such as the reorganization of the
   Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of State Security, and the Office of Prosecutor. We are
   also accelerating the ongoing Judicial reforms which started some years ago with IDA
   assistance. These steps are crucial for improving law enforcement mechanisms. The
   reorganization of several ministries based on a well designed program and the
   implementation of a civil service reform to modernize the public sector are important
   requirementsto improve the quality of regulations. They are explained in another section
   ofthis letter.

   15.      To provide a more systemic approach to implementing various anticorruption
   initiatives, the Government recently prepareda report on the government's actions so far
   taken regarding anti-corruption, including the identification of the mandates of core
   agencies, their roles and strategies and identification o f overlaps and gaps. This report
'  was drafted with significant civil society and NGO input. The drafting process coincided
   with developments in civil society, in which NGOs were re-establishing their own anti-
   corruption agenda. This strategy includes anti-corruption monitoring, improving public
   information access and developing civil society capacity to hold Government accountable
   for the implementation o f anti-corruption reforms. Inthe mediumterm, the Government
   aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for fighting corruption, with the participation

                                              40


o f civil society. In order to measure progress in the fight against corruption, the
Government aims to conduct periodic surveys and use social accountability tools (e.g.,
citizen report card, community score card). In addition to increase transparency, the
Government also aims to ask high officials and high-level civil service to report their
income sources, with the reports validated.

B. Improving Governancethrough Administrative/CivilService Reform

16.     The new leadership of Georgia is committed to improving public administration
to enhance its capacity for designing and implementing appropriate public policies and
delivering adequate services to the population. We inherited a weak and disorganized
public administration (autocratic management, weak delegation o f authority, poor
communication with the general public, lack of transparency and accountability, and,            `
inadequate coordination among key state agencies). These weaknesses, together with an
unmotivated and poorly managed cohort of civil servants, have negatively influenced the
quality of policymaking as well as public services delivery, and turned out to be a
decisive factor contributing to corruption.

 17.    Georgia has already taken initial steps to reorganize and streamline the
Government. It has first amended the Constitution and enacted a new Law on Structure,
Functions and Responsibilities of the Govemment. The Constitutional amendments
 created the Prime Minister's post and introduced the cabinet system o f government,
 These changes aimed at eliminating the fragmentation o f power that existed before, The
 Law also provides for reduction inthe number o f line ministries from 18to 15 as well as
 the consolidation of many previously semi-independent state departments within their
 respective ministries. As the first step towards implementing the Law, the former State
 Chancellery has been abolished and split into the President's Administration and the
 Government Chancellery aiming at a more clear delineation o f functions between the
 President and the Prime Minister. Inaddition, the statutes o f the each new ministry are
 beingaligned with their new mandates. Within the context of this restructuring, the staff
 size within individual ministries i s being reviewed. The intention is to optimize the staff
 size inline with the new functions assignedto each ministry.

 18.     The Government's objective for these interventions is to establish a professional
 public sector, boost the morale o f the civil servants, and eliminate institutional sources o f
 corruption. in the short term, the Govemment i s providing some transitional salary
 increases for selected staff through two Funds, the UNDP-administered Governance
 Reform Program and the Government-administered Development and Reform Fund. The
 Government hopes to reduce dependence on these transitional mechanisms, as it
 progresseswith its public sector reform efforts and develops the fiscal space to be able to
 provide adequate salaries to a smaller and more effective civil service. Inthe meantime,
 the Government is committed to securing the transparency of the two funds, and thus
 plans to publish quarterly reports, detailing the sources and applications o f all funds
 received, and refraining from accepting any further anonymous contributions. In the
 medium-term, the Government will develop a comprehensive salary reform strategy
 which i s consistent with the medium-term expenditure framework, its development
 objectives as reflected inthe EDPFW, andpublic sector reform plans.

                                              41




the Government is setting up a Civil Service Council - a high level policy advisory body
19.     Inorder to develop a more orderly process of civil service adjustment and reform,

chaired by the President and representing all three branches o f the Govemment as well as
regional authorities. A new Civil Service Bureau i s being established to support the
Council as a technical secretariat and oversee the implementation o f the civil service
reform agenda. Subsequently, the Government is committed to developing civil service
reform guidelines.     The Government has selected two pilot ministries (Health and
Education) to start with the implementation of the civil service reform guidelines. The
Government is also committed to implementing the new Law on Structure, Functionsand
Responsibilities o fthe Government inaccordance with the schedule.

20.     Inthe mediumterm, the Government will further elaborate its civil service reform,     '

guidelines into a more comprehensive civil service reform strategy. This strategy would
address, inter alia, the introductiom'expansion oftraining and career development andwill
include progress indicators for each major activity. In addition, Georgia i s committed to
drafting and adopting a new Law on Civil Service to address shortcomings inthe current
legislation, particularly the lack o f a clear delineation between political and nonpolitical
positions. The Law will also determine the role and functions o f civil service
management entity. We also intend to adopt a Code o f Ethics and Discipline for civil
service staff. We will develop a new pay and incentive system within an agreed fiscal
framework. A Personnel Control and Information System will be developed and
implemented over the medium to longer term. Finally, we aim to improye the quality of
our civil service by introducing regulations for competitive, merit-basedrecruitment.

 C. StrengtheningPublicExpenditureManagement

 21.     T h e Government will pursue two key objectives for public expenditure
 management. The first is to reduce dependence on extemal aidhorrowing. The second i s
 to fund the social and development priorities in the EDPRP. Tne challenge for the
 Government is to reconcile these competing goals more effectively than at present. This
 will result ina more strategic and disciplined budget formulation process which realizes
 the maximum social and development benefits from the limited amount o f resources
 available to the Govemment, and a budget execution process which is subordinate to the
 agreedbudget plan.

 22.     The Government i s fully aware that strengthening budget processes offers ample
 scope for quick gains. We recognize that the budget preparation has been hasty and ill
 coordinated in recent times, with limited reference to maximizing the benefits of budget
 allocations. Weak budget preparation has been compounded by inefficient budget
 execution, with spending outtums deviating markedly from the budget plan. In both
 preparation and execution, the basic institutions and processes of sound budgeting are
 required.

 23.     Most of the Government's public expenditure reform agenda is contained in the
 Budget Systems Law passed in April 2003. The law introduces major changes in budget

                                             42


preparation, including the use o f hard ceilings for preparing ministry budgets and
personnel allocations and an activity financing approach (results-focused, agency
financing   that is similar to program budgeting). Other advances include commitment to
prepare the 2005 budget in a multi-year framework, reduce the number o f special funds,
eliminate protected items in legislation, and introduce a Treasury single account. We are
fully aware that the critical challenge to overcome is the weak capacity for introducing
the new processes at the bureaucratic level and we are determined to tackle this.

24.       The Government has taken several actions. We have prepared an action plan for
implementing the budget preparation reforms in the Budget Systems Law, including:
adhering to the new budget preparation timetable in 2005 budget and in the future;
developing the medium term fiscal forecasts and the basic directions for budget policy;
establishing linkages between the EDPRP and the medium-term expenditure framework,
and annual budget; setting hard ceilings for preparing ministry budgets and personnel
allocations for each spending agency and state special find; and reporting on quarterly
budgetary execution.

25.       The Government is strongly committed to limit divergences between budget
outturns and budget plans and reduce the scope for arrears. The key to reducing these
divergences is a realistic budget preparation process. The introduction o f commitment
controls and the requirement for quarterly reporting to Parliament on budget execution
also helps limit the divergences. Effective quarterly budget reporting will ensure prompt
corrective actions where unexpected developments in budget execution take place.
Budget requests based on an activity and economic classification will ensure that policy
 measuresare costed and adequately funded inthe annual budget law.

 26.      The Government has formed a working group co-chaired by the Ministries of
 Finance and Economy for, inter alia, establishing processes to link the EDPRP to the
 budget through budgetary ceilings and activity classifications. The Government believes
 that these initiatives should also help to overcome the previous lack of focus on reform
  agendas in key social sector ministries and will encourage them to develop a policy
  analysis capacity.

  27.     Over the medium term, we will ensure that EDPRP priorities are adequately
  reflected in the annual budgets accompanied by a medium term fiscal framework, and
  underpinned by conservative macroeconomic assumptions. We will set budget ceilings in
  strengthened consultations with line ministries and EDPRP-Budget working groups will
  be established in the Ministries of Education and Health. We will also ensure prompt
  follow upon quarterly expenditure reviews.

  D. Improving Public FinancialControls

  28.     The Government is committed to improving internal and external audits. We are
  aware that audits provide useful recommendations for operational improvement o f public
  activities. We also acknowledge that external audits are important for enhancing the
  accountability of the administration vis- a- vis the Parliament.

                                              43



  29.     There has been serious problems with internal and external controls which we are
  now addressing. The current legislative basis remains outdated, fragmented, and
  uncoordinated. We will examine and implement the Country Financial Accountability
  Assessment (CFAA) undertaken by IDA in Georgia. For the internal control, the CFAA
  recommends that the Government develop a comprehensive approach to its internal
  control framework and the resulting system o f internal controls. As a first step,
  inconsistent legislative proposals on components of internal control were terminated
  when the new Government took office. The Ministry of Finance's Inspector General
  function remains, and a Head has been recently appointed. However, the responsibilities
  for the Inspector General do not reflect international standards for internal audit. Actions
  are beingprepared to correct this situation. We are fully aware o f the critical importance
  o f resolutiono f this problem and we aim to act on this.
                                                                                              1


  30.     Over the medium term, the Government aims to take action for improvinginternal
  and external audits. Initially, we will prepare a comprehensive framework for internal
  audit and control, accompanied by draft legislation on internal audit and a plan for its
  implementation. Implementation o f internal audit units will be initiated in the Ministries
  of Health, Education and Finance. Subsequently, we anticipate that the Internal Audit
  Law will be passed by Parliament and internal audit units will be implemented in the
  three ministries identified above. We also aim to establish internal audit units in another
  four key ministries. The Ministry of Finance will establish the qualifications for internal
  auditor and will implement a training plan to fulfill the requirements fo7 auditors across
  the Government.

  31.     For external audit, the CFAA recommended strengthening the Chamber of
  Control, including legislative changes to align its mandate with international (ZNTOSAI)
   standards and eliminate from its operations internal audit policy and other operations that
  are the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. We believe that the external audit
   functions provide an essential oversight for the Government's system of internal control
   and help ensure the Government's accountability to Parliament. Therefore, we anticipate
   that the Parliament will exercise its new role under the revised Constitution and appoint a
   highly-qualified Chairman o f the Chamber o f Control. We will work together with
   Parliament to ensure that the Chamber o f Control's revised role reflects international
   (INTOSAI) standards for State Audit Organizations. Following this, we aim to prepare
   and submit to Parliament a revised Law on State Audit. We are convinced that the
   Chamber of Control will initiate the training necessary to fulfill its role specified in the
   revised legislation, and therefore, increase the Government's            accountability to
   Parliament.

'  E. EnhancingPublicProcurementManagement

   32.     We will introduce and promote increased transparency and accountability in the
   public procurement system. We plan to build on the achievements to date: the modem
   legislative base that includes the Law on State Procurements and the Implementing
   Regulations, the standard bidding documents, and the national training strategy and
   program developed with assistance form international consultants.

                                            44


33.    The Government has taken a number of steps to follow up on the
recommendations from the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR)
provided by IDA. The number of procuring entities was reduced from initial 8000 to
3000 andpermanent procurementunitswere introducedwithin each procuringentity. The
procurement professionwas acknowledged in the National Roster of Professions and a
system to accredit procurement officers has been developed in consultations with the
Ministry o f Education. The Administrative Code and Code on AdministrativeViolations
were amended to make procurement fraud a punishable crime. We regard this step as
very important. The draft amendment was also preparedas part of our accession process
to WTO and our becoming a signatory to the Government Procurement Agreement
(GPA).

34.    The Government recently launched the State Procurement Agency website and
improved the format and content of the procurement-related information and published
on website to make it more user-friendly and complete, and started publishing tender
announcements for procurements by the central state entities. The Government is
committed to making hrther improvements to the website by including more
comprehensive information about bidding opportunities, announcements regarding
contract awards and administrative review decisions pertaining to procurement-related
disputes, andanupdatedregistry o fprovidersfor goods, works andservices.

35.    Over the medium-term, the Government will propose an amendment to the
Procurement Law to include state owned enterprises under public procurement
procedures. Proper provisions will be made, however, to adapt the application of
procurement procedures to the conditions demanded by the business-nature of the
enterprises. We also aim to submit a draft legal act rationalizing the list of items subject
to confidential procurement (security relateditems). Our mainobjective is to prevent the
abuses observed in the past. We will also establish fair and transparent administrative
procedures for blacklisting companies and individualswho have engaged inprocurement
fraud and/or corruption.

F. Improving/Reorganizing/PrivatizingState OwnedEnterprises

 36.    One of  OUT main  objectives is to improve the governance and productivity of the
eighteen hundred state owned enterprises (SOEs). Most of these SOEs are small and
medium in size; some are not even in operation.About fourteenhundreds SOEs provide
mainly municipal functions and we envisage to transfer their ownership to the relevant
inunicipalities.

 37.    Since 2003, we have initiated audits of the 2002 accounts of three major SOEs
(Georgian Railways, Poti Port, and Madneuli Mining Company). The audit reports will
be finalized by end-July 2004 and will be published within one month following their
 completion. We have also initiated the audit of the remaining seven largest SOEs by
 international audit firms using InternationalAccounting Standards. The remaining SOEs

                                               45


with turnover of over 100,000 Lari will be audited in the coming months by qualified
Georgianaccounting professionals/firms.

38.     Using the audit reports of these SOEs, we aim to develop a time-bound action
plan for improving large state enterprises which will include, inter-alia, comprehensive
business plans, actions to comply with recommendations contained in the audit reports;
timetables for privatization andor restructuring; actions for strengthening the supervisory
boards; plans for setting up intemal control units in the largest SOEs, and the
establishment o f proper procurement process and auditing procedures, Measures will be
taken so that future privatized enterprises will assess and comply with environmental and
social laws and regulations. To ensure a satisfactory implementation o f this agenda, we
are strengthening the capacity of the newly established State Enterprise Management
Agency (SEMA) usingdonor assistance.

G. ImprovingEnergy Sector Services

39.      Power Sector. The Government is fully aware o f the central role o f reliable
electricity services for the quality o f life o f the country's citizens as well as for sustained
economic development. It inherited such a deteriorated electricity infrastructure that
without additional investments, the risk o f catastrophic systemic failure will become
unacceptably high within the next two to three years. The power sector faces severe
financial challenges largely owing to problems o f non-payments, theft of utility services,
and corruption within the sector. Funds raised from the end consumers are clearly
insufficient to cover even the modest service level provided duringthe winter of 2003/04
when credits and grants fiom bilateral donors totaling about $20 million for electricity
imports were provided.

40.      Investments o f about $250 million are needed in the power sector over the next
five to seven years to improve the functioning of the system and reduce the risk o f
systemic collapse to an acceptable level. While investment funds o f such magnitude have
not been secured yet, the Government and donors/IFls are currently preparing projects
worth about US$50 million. Further, the Government plans to present to the Donors
Meeting in mid-June 2004 a list of priority investmendrehabilitation projects for the
power sector for which credits and grants would be sought. Such priority list will reflect
the Government's aim to remedy the financial crisis in the sector through, among others,
 investments that could improve collections, reduce commercial losses and corruption,
while also attending to critical repairs to try to avoid massive systemic collapses in the
 power system investment. The private participation in the sector is high, and it may be
'more prudent to improve sector conditions before seeking further large-scale
 privatization. The Government recognizes that Georgia will have to make a significant
 financial contributions to the power sector for 2005 and onwards through the State
 budget. Meanwhile, the Government has increased the allocation inthe State budget for
 the energy sector by 11% to about US$31 million, including adequate budgetary funding
 to Government agencies to pay their energy consumption bills and including subsidies to
 vulnerable groups. The Government has prepared draft legislation to address and help
 remedy the critical financial situation o f many utilities in the power sector (temporary

                                             46

actions for debt resolution). Further, the authorities have appointed new members of the
Georgian National Energy Regulatory Commission (GNERC). It i s expected that more
than two dozen small, counterproductive distribution licenses inside the service territory
o f the Georgian UnifiedDistribution Company (UDC) will be revoked. These measures
are important for improving govemance inthe sector.

41.     "le Government recently prepared a Strategic Action Plan which elaborates on,
inter alia: (i) the Government's energy policy priorities; (ii)investment sources and
priorities; (iii)planned structural reforms and modifications to legislation; and (iv)
simulations o f electricity service levels for the 2004/05 winter and implications in the
form of electricity imports. The Govemment is aware, o f the fact that a service level in
UDC for the winter 2004105 on level with 2003104 would require substantial
supplemental financing from outside the sector. In the coming months, the Government,       '

will work out plans for electricity imports, if any, commensurable with available funds.
The Strategic Action Plan will be supported by the recent legislative measuresto address
the insolvency problems of electricity utilities. In addition, the Government will review
the electricity tariff methodology with technical assistance from IDA with a view to
ensuring adequate structure for cost recovery.

42.      Over the medium term, in accordance with the Strategic Action Plan, the
Government plans to complete agreements with IFIs/donors for the above-mentioned
US$SO million. The Plan also establishes priorities for projects that will be undertaken in
the sector. For new investment projects, Environmental Impact Assessments will be
undertaken as a basis for developing environmental mitigation plans. Rehabilitation
projects will berequired to adhere to existingenvironmental standards inaccordaice with
the current laws and regulations. Other important actions that the Plan includes are:
revisiting the hnds distribution model inside the power sector; reviewing1improving the
tariff methodology; moving certain assets (switchyards) from generation to transmission;
and low-voltage lines and equipment from transmission to distribution; and improving
the legislatiordenforcement      concerning electricity theft. The Government will
communicate extensively with the population about the power crisis and remedial
measures through a public relations campaign. The intention is to obtain the cooperation
o f the whole population in order to improve electricity services, with the fight against
 electricity theft and increased payment discipline being part o f the solution. With an
 improved environment and some concrete govemance measures already taken, it is
 expected that bill collections will show a clear increase in the months to come. The
 Government is expected to address social impact of electricity prices as a part o f the
 overall poverty reduction strategy (see para 66).

                                               47

  43.     Gas Sector. Over the mediumterm, the Government also aims to take measures
  to improve efficiency and govemance in the gas sector. It aims to decide on an
  organizational model for gas supply that ensures optimum utilization of supply from
  various sources (north and east) and secure access to gas storage facilities. Inaddition,
  the Government aims to make a public determination of the role that major companies
  would play in the sector andclarify sources of investment funds for emergency repairsor
  rebuiiding o f the north-southtransit gas pipeline.

                  IV. ImprovingEnvironment for Private Sector Development

  A. PromotingPrivate Sector DeveIopmentAmproving InvestmentClimate

  44.     The Govemment i s committed to improving the business environment in Georgia,      '

  through reducing the cost for establishing and operating business, improving private
  sector participation in policy making, and facilitating transport and trade. To reachthese
  objectives, we will reduce bureaucratic and non-transparentrequirements. We are fully
  aware of the negative impact of unpredictability and delays in administrative procedures,
  combined with uneven implementation and enforcement o f regulations. In the past,
  institutional changes and reform programs have been adopted but weakly implemented
  due to the lack of strong political will and institutions. The problems in the business
  environment had been further aggravated by the absence of efficient ways to
  communicate changes in administrative requirements to the public, officials and
  enterprises.

  45.      To achieve sustainable improvements in the business environment, our'reform
  program will focus on developing effective institutions and processes. A conducive
  business environment also calls for simplification of existing regulatory framework,
  improvement in information dissemination, data sharing, staff training, and the
   development and introduction of the appeals and feedback mechanisms. Inthis regard, a
   regular dialogue with the business community is required to assist the fight against
   corruption and to improve govemance and to provide important input in our policy
   decisions. In this vein, we have established a cross-Ministerial Commission with
   membership of senior decision makers from the relevant Government agencies who
   interact with private businesseson a regular basis, and private sector representativeswho
   can articulate the views o f the business community. In addition, a technical Secretariat
   has beencreatedto carry out the day-to-day work ofthe Commission.

   46.      FIAS/Govemment Assessment of Administrative Procedures of Doing Business
.  in Georgia identified a number of obstacles to establishing and operating businesses in

,  Georgia, Based on this survey and other available reports, we recently organized a
   commission meeting for the purpose of developing a new action plan for removing
   administrativebarriers to investment andaims to hold regular meetings.

   47.      Over the coming months, the Govemment will adopt the action plan which will
   include measures to improve/simplify business registration, building permits, tax
   administration, customs, standardization and certification, and control over businesses,

                                             48

More specifically, the number o f inspections will be limited and regulated, and clear
jurisdictions will be established among various agencies. To reduce administrative costs
to businesses, the Government will require assessments o f the potential justification and
impact o f the proposed regulations on affected businesses prior to their approval, Until
such a formal mechanism i s inplace, the authorities will not introduce any new licensing
requirements unless they are deemed absolutely necessary. Proper publicity and public
discussions will precede the introduction of any new regulation. Over the medium term,
the action plan will be revisited based on annual surveys which will highlight the
progress inimplementing reforms and will identify new problems ifthey exist.

48.      We are fully aware o f the complexities of the system of VAT reimbursement for
export activities. In the past, reimbursements have been tainted by inefficiency and/or
corruption.     In this context, the new Govemment had temporarily suspended VAT
reimbursements. Subsequently, the Government introduced changes in administration o f '
 the system to ensure that the system is efficient, transparent, and corruption-free. Given
 its importance to export competitiveness and in light of the recent changes in
 administration of the system, we have recently reintroduced the VAT reimbursement
 system and we are committed to effectively implementing and monitoringit. Inaddition,
 the Government with the support from IMF's PRGF program has developed a customs
 reform strategy paper and will adopt a new Customs code after a consultative process.

 49.     The Government is fully aware that inadequate standards are an impediment to
 access o f non-CIS markets, especially for food and agro-processed products. We
 therefore intend to introduce an internationally recognized system of product certification
 and accelerate transition to the dual (voluntary/mandatory) system o f standards in
 accordance with Georgia obligation to WTO.

  50.    Although financial costs have decreased in recent years, they remain high in real
 terms and constitute one o f the major impediments to business activities. The main
 concerns include highinterest rates and considerable collateral requirements (for values
 exceeding twice the value o f the loan in most cases). Companies also complain about the
  short maturity of loans, mostly less than a year, which makes investment financing
  through credit very difficult. We are committed to implementing measures over the
  medium term to reduce the cost o f finance through addressing the issues underlying these
  high costs. Consequently, we already implemented measures for further bank
  consolidation through increases in the minimum capital requirements of commercial
  banks for which a timetable is enforceable. We are also planningmeasures for strong
  banking supervision, strengthening of the non bank financial institutions, and
  development of unified national movableregistry.

  51.     We are conscious that the investment environment will need to be anchored to a
  legal framework that is sound and addresses a variety o f legal needs+ompany,
  collateral, security, bankruptcy and anti-monopoly laws. Above all, the legal system will
  need to respect creditors, property and other contractual rights and ensure that judicial
  enforcement is competent and transparent. This is as a medium to longer term task to
  whichwe are fblly committed.

                                               49


  B. FacilitatingTrade,Transit, and Transport

   52.     The Government is committed to facilitating legitimate trade, transit and transport
   in Georgia, which we regard as a key to the development of the private sector. The
  transport corridor through Georgia has not yet succeeded in capturing much of the
   potential non-oil transit traffic from Central Asia and the Caucasus. While official
   transport fees are comparable with intemational benchmarks, we understand that the
   actual cost o f transportation is not competitive yet. This is due to major physical and
   procedural impediments including porous borders, non-commercially oriented railway,
   corruption, and weak, cumbersome, and uncoordinated control by the public sector
   bodies involved intrade.

   53.     There is a wide range of identified impediments, both physical and procedural,,     '

   that have contributed, directly or indirectly, to increased transport costs. These include
   high unofficial payments to border agencies (including customs) and the road police;
   excessive and often unnecessary documentation, particularly for transit goods. The
   improved political climate has contributed to reduce these problems. We have recently
   upgraded the information systems, through the implementation of ASYCUDA system
   (except Adjara), to harmonize procedures and reduce the scope o f personal interface
   between customs officials and traders which sometimes results inillegal practices.

   54.     The Government recently issued orders eliminating requirements for: (i)the
   internal transit document (VTT); and (ii)  the non-excise consignment to pave1in convoy
   (except for vehicles that are unsecured), both of which had resulted in significant and
   costly delays to transit cargo. The short term benefit of our measures is considerable,
   however, we are fully aware o f the need to implement additional mediumterm measures
   to fully eliminate these problems.

                                  V. Protectingthe Vulnerable

   A. Improvingthe Implementationof the EDPRP

    55.    Supported by the international community and in close cooperation with our civil
    society   and non-governmental organizations,         Georgia prepared an Economic
    Development and Poverty Reduction Program (EDPRP) and presented it in July 2003.
    We are fully committed to the implementation of the EDPRP. It is our firm intention to
    update, revise, and improve this document in light of new developments, especially in
    terms o f further prioritization and more realistic costing within the available resource
    envelope, and submit the EDPRP progress report to be prepared through a fully
..  participatory process by October 2004 and make it fully operational. As such, we see the
    EDPRP as laying the foundation for conducting the budgetary process, allocating
    budgetary resources, and devising and implementing sector specific reforms.

    56.     Infull consultation with the civil society and interested parties, we will continue
    to improve the EDPRP contents and resolve the institutional and technical problems that
    have limited its connections to the budget. Our short-term plan involves two elements.

                                            50

First, the Ministry of Finance will provide the technical instructions to establish the
linkages between the EDPRP/medium-term expenditure framework and the annual
budget.   Second, we have formed a working group co-chaired by the Ministries of
Finance and Economy to make the linkages operational. To start, we will develop
EDPRP-budget links in at least two key sectors (e.g., Education and Health). This will be
implemented starting inthe 2005 budget.

57.     Inthe medium-term, we will continue to improveEDPRP links to the budget, We
will also report on these links-through     a special appendix to the budget and through
direct improvements in allocations to key sectors. We will establish EDPRP-Budget
working groups throughout Government, starting in the Ministries o f Education and
Health. We will also promote new EDPRP monitoring mechanisms, so that we can
evaluate the degree to which priority programs are executed as planned. Our intention is ,     '

to be more strategic on development and poverty reduction, so that actual budget
allocations reflect our objectives and goals.


B. Social Sectors and Poverty Reduction

58.     Georgia has experienced a severe decline in welfare since independence.
Unemployment and underemployment are high, social conditions have deteriorated,
poverty and vulnerability have increased. Maternal mortality, access to health, safe water
and sanitation, and the quality o f social services have worsened in comparison with the
 pre-transition situation. The Government is concemed about the trends shown in social
 indicators and plans to tackle these issues through medium and long-term actions. The
 government intends to design and introduce poverty indicators. Subsequently, these
 indicators would be producedregularly and will guide policies and EDPRPdiscussions,

 59.     The Government is undertakinga range of measures aiming at improving access
 to and quality of social services, as well as at assisting individuals and families better

 extreme poor - approximately 17 percent of the population.
 manage social and economic risks. The Government i s focusing particularly to the


 60.     Health. Georgia initiated health reforms in 1995 aimed at improving access to
 quality basic health services for the population. Nonetheless, severe funding constraints
 resulted inthe deterioration of the public health infrastructure, and limited availability of
 essential drugs and consumables. The public health system failed to provide an adequate
 level o f services to the population, especially to the poor. Georgia is at risk of not
 achieving some of the MDGs, particularly those related to early childhood and maternal
 mortality. There is a rapid increase in HIV/AIDS incidence and the Government i s
 working with the intemational community to combat the disease.

 61.     To tackle the most urgent issues affecting the sector, over the medium term the
 Government aims to focus onthe following areas:

     e   Reforming Health Care Financing.         The Government aims to improve the
         allocative and technical efficiency o f the available resources by rationing basic

                                           51


       benefit package and improved targeting of poor segments o f population. Inorder
       to ensure that preventive services are adequately financed,           government
       expenditures on health care will primarily be allocated to preventive services and
       primaryhealthcare.

     e ImprovingAccess to Quality Basic Health Services. For rural and highmountain
       populations, access to quality health care is severely constrained. The
       Government will directly address this problem by supporting investments in
       primaryhealth care inrural andhighmountain areas, and supporting a conducive
       health care financing arrangement to enable the urban poor to seek services.

     e Improving Health Care Delivery System. The Georgian health system is highly
       fragmented, focuses on hospital-based specialized care and is inefficient. In the
       absence of an adequate primary health care system, basic services are being'
       provided in specialized hospitals and polyclinics.     The Government aims at
       shifting the orientation of the health system towards preventive and primary
       health care and realign the rest o f the system to support primary care. It would
       also support restructuring and downsizing o f existing PHC and hospital
       infrastructure in the country, and realign, retrain and redeploy health personnel
       depending on the current needs inthe country.

62.    Water and Sanitation.        Clean water is an integral part o f the strategy for
reducing poverty and achieving Millennium Development Goals. According to the
Government's monitoring data, water-born diseases are mostly registered in big towns.
These diseases-gastro-enteritis, diarrhea, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, hepatitis, etc.--are
largely caused by secondary contamination o f water in the urban distribution system,
The numbers of water-related health outbreaks are going up, as reported by the National
Disease Control Center. Although the Georgian Legislation and related programs in the
field of water supply and sanitation intend to move towards compliance with intemational
standards, lack of funds, complicated administrative structure, and insufficient
coordination have often hampered measurable improvements.

63.     To improve water quality, the Government aims to: (i) a systematic attempt
                                                                make
to raise public awareness o f the health and economic impacts of poor water quality and
encourage participation in decision-making as well as a systematic collaboration and
consensus buildingacross sectors, and among affected stakeholders, to agree on priorities
and adoptable measures; (ii)Improve wastewater management in urbanized and coastal
tourist centers by expanding service connections to cover all connectable properties,
constructing sewerage facilities in target areas, promoting intermediate solutions, and
creating smaller collection and treatment systems; (iii)stimulate revenue and investments
by increasing wastewater fees, implementing the "polluter pays principle," creating
incentives for private sector participation, and; (iv) enact effective regulations,
specifically, the Clean Water Act, with clear implementingrules and regulations.

64.      Education. The Government has taken stock o f the significant deterioration
experienced by the public education system in recent years. The central objective is to
improvethe quality and relevance of students learningoutcomes, To improvethe quality,

                                              52

accessibility and relevance o f education, a number of important steps have already been
taken at the primary and secondary education level: the national curriculum is being
revised, the national system for students' assessment and examination has been
introduced, an alternative system for financing textbooks is being piloted, and a major
effort has been launched to provide in-service training for education professionals and
raise their awareness o f the need to change classroom practice.

65.     Over the medium term, the Government's central priority is to reallocate
resources to primary and secondary education and to better target the poorest and
vulnerable groups. Therefore, the Government aims to define a program to reallocate
budgetary resources which will be based on, inter alia, entailing development of a per
capita financing model and greater decentralization of decision-making to local schools
and communities, and in some cases consolidation o f schools and/or introduction of
multi-grade teaching. The Government will develop strategies to improve human'
resource and teacher's career development and efficient and equitable allocation o f
financial resources through the Education System Realignment and Strengthening
Program. To monitor the impact o f the ongoing reform interventions on the quality of
education, key performance indicators for the education system are being developed by
the Ministry o f Education and will be used for policy makingpurposes.

66.      Social Protection. The Government aims to provide adequatepoverty alleviation
to the neediest people in Georgian society. The Government has taken important
measures that resulted in timely payment o f pensions and other social transfers. It has
 also started clearing arrears in the pension system. In the medium term, within the
 overall availability of resources, the authorities will continue their efforts to increase
 pensions and social assistance, as well as significantly strengthen the targeting o f social
 assistance benefits to the extreme poor. The Government will consolidate various cash
 social assistance programs, including those targeted at Internally Displaced Persons
 (IDPs), into a single, targeted cash family poverty benefit. The benefit would be targeted
 at the extreme poor and is expected to alleviate poverty more efficiently and effectively
 than currently existing programs. The Government is also planning to develop
 institutional capacity for implementation o f the targeted poverty benefit. At the same
 time, it intends to take measures to significantly improve the capacity of local welfare
 offices to deliver the targeted social assistance in a transparent manner. In addition, the
 authorities plan to initiate actions in the areas of employment and labor markets to
 increase employment opportunities.       These, in particular, aim at improving current
 institutions in the labor market as well as labor market intermediation.

 67.      The Government will continue its efforts to pay pensions on time and gradually
 increase them. in parallel, the Government intends to analyze reform options in order to
 introduce an optimal system that provides protection against poverty in old age, as well
 as offers opportunities for private voluntary contractual savings.

 68.      Poverty Monitoring.      The Government is in the process of designing and
 introducing living standards and poverty monitoring indicators that will be published
 regularly. The indicators would guide the monitoring o f the EDPRP implementation and

                                             53

would serve as an information base for efficient social policy design. Household budget
surveysare expectedto beconductedregularly.

                                     VI. Conclusion

69.     The Government is fblly aware of the great challenges lying ahead, Georgia's
path to national unity, economic growth and poverty reduction will not be easy. The
initial measures outlined in this Letter and our comprehensive medium-term program
demonstrate our commitment to improving governance, reducing corruption, creating an
efficient public sector, establishing a business-fiiendly environment, and fostering
inclusiveness. As mentioned in this Letter, we have acted with promptness and
decisiveness to stabilize the fiscal situation, improve the structure o f Government, and
launch the fight against corruption. Our reform program builds on the very recent reform,
efforts and addressesthe most fundamental weaknesses. Initial responseto our efforts by
the economy, tax payers and civil society all have been encouraging. If we can fully
implement our reform program, capitalize on the support of the international community,
and strengthen our implementation capacity, we will be able lay a foundation for
sustainable development with significant poverty reduction andbroad-basedgrowth. We
are fully committed to this path and welcome the strong support of IDA in making our
vision for the future a reality.

                                                                                                                       Annex 4
I                                Lessons Learned from Previous Adiustment Operations

 In the course of previous operations, specific conditions were formally met. But, at the same time, many of those conditions
 were undermined or simply circumvented. For example, activities subject to licensing were dramatically reduced and public
 procurement legislated. But localgovernmentsand agenciesdefacto reintroducedmany of the cancelled licensingrequirements.
 Similarly, exceptions to the rule of public procurementsbecame very common. As a result, only a small fraction of publicly
 purchasedgoods were subject to competition. Inthis new stage, the Bank assistanceshouldbe guidedby an evaluationof needed
 progress not only in its formal aspects but also in spirit. Moreover, the proposed operation and any subsequent programmatic
 support would emphasize progress in the overall policy environmenthamework not only in the fulfillment of specific agreed
 upon conditions. In this operation, the agreed actions would be established on a very realistic basis that would take into
 considerationits urgent nature of bridging into a more programmatic lending. This would increase the importanceof looking at
 the big picture: effective progress in improving overall governance/policy environmentand, therefore, minimize the possibility
 of circumventionof conditionsand/or meetingthem only formally but not in substance. The creationof a public/privatesector
 forum which is partof this operation, as well as other forms of active dialogue with the civil society shouldself-monitormany, if
 not all of the credit conditions. Subsequent operations could include more specific outcome or impact indicators which could
 serve as triggers for moving from one operationto others.
I
 There is aneedto strengthenlinkages betweencredit operationsandpovertyreduction.The sustainabilityof the socialfabric will
 largely depend upon progress in the quality of social expenditures, the attainment of sound public finances to support social
  services and the long-term, sustainable nature of economic growth. Moreover, the implementation of a poverty reduction
 program should be based on a broad participatoryprocess.The proposedoperationwould support an intensive policy dialogue
 with the authoritiesto update and deepen the PRSP produced by previous authorities. While this medium term orientationcan
  not be fully reflected in the proposed operation, the Bank policy dialogue and subsequent activities will center around this
  approach

  Previous policy reforms emphasized the enactment of laws and regulations.Such enactment was and is indeed very important
  and will continue as building the necessary legal frameworkhas not been completed inGeorgia. However,the implementationof
  specific measures to advance the reform process should be given proper attention and priority. A proper balance between new
  lawsand regulations, on one hand, andpolicy implementation, on the other, needsto be achieved. This lessonis very important
  for many World Bank activities in Georgia. Inamodestmanner, given its nature, the proposedoperationis fully cognizant of this
  of this lesson. For example, this operationemphasizes policy actions such as the use of the state power to protect power sector
  assets and prevent interference by third parties in the operations of the sector, paying salaries and pensions on time, etc. There
  are, of course, other actions whose materializationwould requirethe proper legal framework, for example, reinstating the Civil
  ServiceBureau.

  The positive contributions o f previous operations should be fully taken into considerationand built upon in the new stage of
  policy dialogue with Georgia. For example, important progress in Judicial reforms was achieved. These include testing of
  judges, publicity of Supreme Court and selected appellate court decisions, elimination of the supervisorypower of prosecutors,
  training of Judges and court employees, systematic outreach to civil society, and measures to modernize Judiciary operations
  such as computerization.Inaddition, progress in land transfers were attained. Previousprogress in the Judiciary would, indeed,
  constituteabackgroundto theproposedoperationas governanceis acrucial issue in Georgia.

  The final lesson: it is also important to closely monitor effective commitment to reforms by the authorities. This will be
 Iother
  supported by the Bank dialogue with the Parliament, which we intend to intensify, civil society, the business community and
        donors.

                        PartnershipinGeorgia's DevelopmentStrategy

1.      The government's poverty reduction strategy, embodied in its first full PRSP, was
presented to the Boards of IDA and the IMF in October and November 2003. A brief a brief
summary of proposed activities will be presented to the IDA Board along with the Reform
Support Credit scheduledfor Board presentationon June 24,2004.

2.      The Fund has taken the lead in assisting Georgia in improving macroeconomic stability
and pursuing fiscal reforms. The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on
structural issues, focusing on: (i)strengthening public expenditure management; (ii)   deepening
and diversifying sources of growth; (iii) protecting the environment; and (iv) reducing poverty.
Georgia has beenthe largest IDA borrower inthe CIS, with borrowing of over US$725 million
for 34 operations. A range of instruments has been used to conduct the dialogue, including
Structural Adjustment and SRS Credits. The most recent Adjustment Credits were SAC I11and
an Energy Sector Adjustment Credit (ESAC), both approved in FY99. SAC I11 supported the
government's reform program, which includedstrengthened fiscal performance, better budgetary
provisions for core social expenditures, improved legal and regulatory framework for the private
sector, and accelerated privatization and market liberalization. Key reform objectives supported
by the ESAC included enhanced financial sustainability and management of the energy sector,
privatization, and increased poverty benefits for the socially most vulnerable. Other support has
come in the form of project support and Analytical and Advisory Assistance across a broad
spectrum: education, health, social protection, energy, roads, water and sanitation, agriculture,
agricultural research and extension, irrigation and drainage, forestry, environment, biodiversity,
enterprise development, municipal development, judicial reform, and cultural heritage. A
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) was completed in 2001,a Public ExpenditureReview
(PER) in 2002, and a Trade Study in 2003. The PER is being followed by an annual process-
based PER exercise. A Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) and a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) have beenprepared.

3.      Since Georgia joined IFC in 1995, it has approved $103.8 million of investments for
eight projects. IFC has provided equity and credit to local and international companies, including
investmentsby BritishPetroleum andother sponsors inthe construction of the Baku-SupsaEarly
Oil Pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline. IFC has also provided equity and long-term
credit lines to TBC Bank and helped establish Georgia Microfinance Bank. In the housing
finance sector, IFC has provided credit lines to the Bank o f Georgia and TBC Bank for housing
finance and for on-lending to small and medium enterprises. The Foreign Investment Advisory
Service (FIAS), a joint facility of IFC and the World Bank, carried out an assessment of
Georgia's investment climate in November 2001. It has also assisted the government with
legislation on foreign direct investmentand establishment of an investmentpromotionagency.

4.      Table 1 summarizes the division of responsibilities between the two institutions. In a
number of areas-for       example, the social sectors, rural development, environment, and
infrastructure-the   Bank takes the lead in the dialogue and there i s no related conditionality in

                                                  60


the IMF-supported program. The Bank i s also leading the dialogue on private sector reform, and
Bank analysis serves as inputs into the Fund program. In other areas-energy,              the financial
sector, public expenditure management, and civil service reform-both         institutions have worked
together. Finally, inareas like monetary policy, and inland revenue and customs, the IMF takes
the lead.

Areas inwhich the World Bankleadsand there is no directIMF involvement

5.      Inthe social sectors IDA conducts updates of Georgia's Poverty Assessment based on
quarterlyhousehold data. IDA'Sfocus has beento improve the budget execution of expenditures
for health, education and poverty benefits and to raise the efficiency inthe use of scarce public
resources. Through the Social Investment Fund credits, IDA is focusing in particular on areas
with high poverty levels to provide basic infrastructure to the poorest communities. A Self-
Reliance Fund Grant helps the authorities address the complex issues related to internally
displaced people. IDA i s also supporting a dialogue with the government on social protection
reform that will leadto an IDA-supported project.

6.       Ineducation,the Adaptable Program Credit aims at improvingthe learning outcomes of
primary and secondary students, through curriculum reform, development o f an examination
system, training of teachers, provision of learning materials, and development of capacity to
make better use of Georgia's physical, financial, and human resources. While the investment
needs of school buildings are substantially higher than i s currently affordable for Georgia, the
Social Investment Fundprojects continue to assist in financing urgent repairs to school facilities
inmany communities.

7.       In health, IDA credits support the government in improving health care financing,
exploring risk-pooling options, introducing a new system of primary health care, and improving
the focus of services funded through public funds on the poor and on priority public health
interventions. Inaddition, SAC I11andthe SRS Credit have supportedhospital restructuring.

8.       In infrastructure, support is being provided through the Municipal Development and
Decentralization Credit and the Social Investment FundCredit. These projects provide financing
at the community level for critical infrastructure needs, primarily for school and health facility
heating and repair, small hydropower schemes to provide electricity, drinking water and
sanitation rehabilitation, as well as transportation infrastructure rehabilitation.

9.       In rural development, IDA credits have supported development of private sector
farming and agro-processing improvements, agricultural credit, irrigation and drainage, and
agriculture research and extension. IDA credits have also been supporting the creation of local
institutions, such as rural credit unions and water users associations.

Areas inwhich the World Bankleads and itsanalysisserves as inputinto the IMFprogram

 10.     The Bank has been leading the dialogue on structural reforms, especially through SAC
111, approved by the Bank's Board in June 1999, and closed in October 2002, and through the

                                                  61


preparation of the proposed Reform Support Credit. Despite considerable delays, the core
conditions of SAC I11were met, but their impact was reducedby poor governance. Institution
building and technical assistance have been supportedthrough the SRS Credit, also approved by
the Bank Boardon June 29, 1999.The Bank also leadsinthe areas of:

    a) Privatizationand Public EnterpriseReforms.SAC I11supported improvements inthe
        environment for private sector development, focusing on: (i)simpler and more
       transparent licensing; (ii)   more transparent government procurement; and (iii)   reduced
        cost of entry for businesses. IDA has also been supporting private sector participation in
        other areas such as energy, urban services and agriculture. The IMF has worked with the
        authorities to initiate audits ofthe 2002 accounts ofthree major state-owned enterprises,

    b) Energy. The energy system is in poor condition, with unreliable supply, massive non-
       payment and mounting debts. IDA has been working with other donors, including the
       Fund, to encourage more private management and ownership, and to implement a series
        of short-term action plans to improve the overall functioning of the sector. The Fund has
        also been focusing on improved payments for electricity and pursuit o f tariff policies at
        cost-recovery levels, including a Bank-assisted review of the tariff policy methodology.
        The proposed Reform Support Credit would support a Strategic Action Plan for the
        Energy Sector.

    c) Public Sector Management. The proposed RSC would support, inter alia, an anti-
        corruption strategy, administrative and civil service reform, improvements in public
        expenditure management, and reductions inbarriers to private sector growth. The Fundi s
        providing technical assistanceinsupport of tax and customs administration reform.

Areas of sharedresponsibility

11.     The Bank and the Fundhave beenworkingjointly inthe following mainareas (supported
by the Bank's SAC I11and SRS Credit, several investment operations, and the Fund's PRGF-
furtherassistance is anticipated from IDA'SReformSupport Credit):

      a) Poverty Reduction Strategy. Both institutions have been working closely with the
      government to support the development of the PRSP, through seminars and workshops,
      direct staff input, and a multi-donor TrustFundto assistthe work ofthe PRSP secretariat.

      b) Budget Planning and Execution. The annual process-based Public Expenditure
      Reviews, and the proposed Reform Support Credit, will provide the underpinnings for
      systemic changes in expenditure management, and improvements in financial
      accountability. The Fundis focusing on treasury reform withinthe Ministryof Finance.

      c) Financial Sector Reforms. The joint Financial Sector Assessment Program has
      supported: (i)strengthened banking and non-banking supervision; (ii)introduction of
      international accounting standards; (iii)consolidation of banks through higher capital
      requirement ratios; and (iv) anti money-laundering legislation. The Fund has focused on
      banking supervision, anti-money laundering legislation, and improvements in monetary

                                              62


    control instruments with extensive technical assistance from its Monetary and Financial
    SystemsDepartment.

Areas inwhich the IMFleads and its analysisserves as inputinto the World Bank program

    a) Fiscal Framework and reforms in tax policy and tax and customs administration.
    The Fund's focus onprudentfiscal policy has served as an important framework for IDA'S
    work on public expenditure management. The Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department is now
    taking the lead inthe areas of tax policy andtax and customs administration reform.

Areas inwhich the IMFleads and there is no direct World Bank involvement

    a) Monetary Framework. The IMF closely collaborates with the NBG inthe design and
    implementation of a monetary program that aims at remonetization of the economy, while
    keeping inflation low andrebuilding international reserves.

    b) Economic Statistics. IMF technical assistance has beenconducive to improvements in
    national accounts, price, monetary and government financial statistics.

     PROPOSEDLENDING AND ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK PROGRAM


ProposedLendingfor the Rest of FY 04 and for FY 05

Through programmatic and investment operations, the key objectives of the proposed lending is
(i)tocontributetosustainableeconomicgrowthbysupportingthefightagainstcorruptionand
for better governance, (ii)to assist in improving efficiency o f the public sector to make it
friendly to the principles of market economy, linking it to the EDPRP process, (iii) reduce
                                                                                       to
poverty particularly in rural areas by providing vital services such as road-access,
telecommunications and community-based tourism, (iv) to gradually resolve the energy issues,
and (v) to facilitate trade by modernizing trade-related agencies and procedures. Inthis respect
the proposed IDA lending relates directly with the most fundamental problems of growth and
poverty.

FY04

    0  Reform Support Credit. This one-tranche operation for US$24 million would support
       reforms dealing with anticorruptiodgovernance, public sector management, and actions
       to improve electricity services (inthis latter area this operation complements the Energy
        Supplemental Credit). At the same time, the proposed operation aims to define, inbroad
       preliminary terms, a framework for future policy-based lending and policy dialogue by
       IDAto support Georgia's medium-termeconomic growthandpoverty reduction efforts.

    0   Energy Supplemental Credit. This investment operation would support efforts to
        improve energy services.    An Action Program with detailed business and governance
       measures on electricity has been prepared. Specifically, this supplemental operation to
       the Georgian Electricity Market Support Project (EMSP, Cr. # 3502-GE) would provide
        about US$ 3.6 million to finance key elements of the Action Program (ESBI Georgia
        managementfees andpower distribution metering).

    0   Secondary and Rural Roads Project. This project would support efforts to improve
        economic activities in poor communities and promote trade and national and regional
        integration. The proposed project of US$ 20 million would support inter alia the
        rehabilitation of approximately 250-300 kilometers of secondary roads, the rehabilitation
        of approximately 500-600 kilometers of local roads, establishment o f four regional
        offices for the Georgian Road Administration to facilitate decentralization of road
        management and community participation, technical assistance and training, revision of
        the design standards for roads, anddevelopment ofmaintenance standards.

                                                65


FY05

For FY05, it should be emphasized that the final amount and precise timing of the proposed
operations described below would take into consideration the allocation of IDA to Georgia for
next fiscal year.

   0    Programmatic Adjustment Credit. This proposed operation would follow-up on the
        adjustment program started as part of the Reform Support Credit. As such, this credit
        would focus on strengthening of anti-corruptiodgovernance, public sector management,
        and poverty alleviation. The proposedamount ofthis operation i s US$20 million.

   0    Public Sector Reform Project. The project would, incoordination with the adjustment
        credits, support measures to improve public sector management and civil service
        functioning. It would include an e-government component and support for the Parliament
        to improve/modernize procedures and accountability. IDA would provide about US$l0
        million.

   a    Rural Development Project. The project would help develop the private commercial
        agriculture sector by improving farmers' access to, and the competitiveness of,
        agricultural supply chains. ProposedIDA financing would be around US$16 million.

   a    Rural Communications Sector Support Project. The project would focus on: (i)
        supporting the deployment of privately-provided and competitive ICT services in
        unserved areas; (ii)  building the technical capacity o f the regulator; and (iii) the
                                                                                            using
        existing postal network to improve ICT access. IDA would finance around US$5 million.

   0    Community-basedTourism and CulturalAsset Management.The project would help
        communities       protect   their   cultural  assets    and     promote      local    tourism
        (continuatiodexpansion of the Cultural Heritage Project, with stronger focus on
        developing tourism around the cultural heritage sites).    IDA would finance about US$3
        mi11ion.

   a    Trade and Transport Facilitation Project.               This project would support: (i)
        restructuring o f state-ownedenterprises relevant to transit trade (especially rail-ways); (ii)
        border agency modernization; and (iii)integrated transit management. This project
        would play a very important role inimproving governance and efficiency affecting public
        enterprises and agencies responsible for transit idout o f Georgia. The proposedoperation
        would provide around US$8 million.

ProposedEconomicand Sector Work

   During the rest of the FY04 and FY 05, IDA would continue with studies and informal
   policy-notes that would assist the country in key areas of poverty reduction, public sector
   improvement, state-owned enterprises governance, and social services. Emphasis would be
   placed on assisting Georgia with strategic decisions on improving the utilization and
   targeting of public resources. The proposed ESW includes activities which would, in most
   cases, bring up to date the previous work and complement IDA present and/or prospective

                                             66


lending program. The proposed ESW would also provide key inputs for the implementation
of the EDPRP. Inaddition, it would generate the institutional knowledge necessary for future
programmatic and investment operations. Some of the pieces are about to be completed,
while some others would start inFY05.

    ProgrammaticPovertyAssessment: this updating wouldprovide newpoverty data and
    analytical elements to guide our policy dialogue and would be a major input in our
    operations.

    Programmatic Public Expenditure Review: it would make available the needed
    analytical background for programmatic and public sector credits. It would provide the
    analytical basis for policy recommendationsto improve the quality o f public services and
    delivery process.

    RuralInfrastructureStudy: this study would provide an updated analytical knowledge
    of infrastructure in rural areas. Poverty i s more acute in rural areas, therefore, this study
    would provide practical recommendations on policies and investmentsthat couldpromote
    economic growth and alleviate poverty inthese areas.

    State Owned EnterpriseAssessment: this note would an assessments of major public
    enterprises for improving governance and proving an insight for restructuring and/or
    privatization.

    Pensionand Social ProtectionNote: the purpose ofthis note is to provide the analytical
    elements neededto build a sustainable pension system and realistic, well-targeted social
    protection policies.

    Georgia HealthSector Review: this ongoing reviewwill contribute to the development
    of a short- and medium-termsector strategy and prioritized action program for the sector.
    The aim is to assist the authorities in developing viable options for enhancing the health
    services coverage ofpoor and vulnerable groups.

    Child Welfare Note: it had recently been drafted and will be discussed shortly with
    authorities and interested parties. The Note reviews child well-being in key areas of
    health and nutrition, education and social protection. It also elaborates on strategies and
    policies that may improve child well-being outcomes.

    Policy Recommendations Note: a draft was prepared recently for the new authorities.
    Its main objectives was to summarize Bank's assessments over the recent years so as to
    provide policy inputs to the new Government and advance the policy agenda. It may also
