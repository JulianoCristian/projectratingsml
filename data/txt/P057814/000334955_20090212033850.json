unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            negligible, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Ratings for the Third Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC3)\n            Project for Georgia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was high, Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Reform\n            Support Credit Project for Georgia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the experience of the Judicial Reform\n            Project shows that making the judiciary more independent,\n            effective, adherent to higher ethical standards and\n            professional requires interventions that go beyond\n            rehabilitating infrastructure, using information technology,\n            and educating the public. Establishment of an independent\n            and effective judiciary requires strong political will and\n            continuous commitment of the country authorities, which a\n            Bank operation can only complement, but not substitute for.\n            The experience of SAC3 and Reform Support Credits reiterates\n            that Bank support can be effective in promoting and\n            supporting change when the authorities are ready for reform,\n            but not otherwise. When the authorities are not ready it\n            could be argued that financial support may weaken the need\n            for change and strengthen the capacity to maintain the\n            status quo The experience of the Reform Support Credit shows\n            that simpler rules reduce opportunities for corruption. When\n            the government simplified the rules and streamlined\n            administrative procedures in organizations like the traffic\n            police, customs, and tax administration their staff\n            delivered better services and extorted fewer bribes."}, "docdt": "2008-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
