   to provide initial assistance to the new Government of\n            Georgia, in its efforts to define, and implement a program\n            of economic, legal, and social reforms. The Project will\n            support actions in the following areas: 1) improvement in\n            governance and anti-corruption; 2) improvement in public\n            finance management; and, 3) steps to resolve crucial issues\n            in the energy sector. Actions taken in these areas will\n            significantly contribute to the implementation of broader\n            structural reforms over the medium term. At the same time,\n            the project aims to define, in broad preliminary terms, a\n            framework for future policy-based lending, and policy\n            dialogue by the International Development Association (IDA),\n            to support the country's medium-term economic growth,\n            and poverty reduction efforts. This will further support\n            fiscal stability and poverty reduction directly. First, the\n            proposed project will address issues of governance,\n            corruption, and the business environment, to facilitate new\n            businesses, and create employment. Second, a stable fiscal\n            environment should allow for the timely payment of salaries,\n            pensions, and social expenditures. It will also foster\n            Government links between the Economic Development and\n            Poverty Reduction Framework programs and the budget process.\n            Despite risks, the new political environment, the\n            overwhelming electoral victories at the Presidential and\n            Parliamentary elections, and the recent return of Adjara\n            under the authority of the Government, will help ameliorate\n            these risks, while lessons of past adjustment lending, in\n            particular the weak government implementation capacity, have\n            been carefully factored into the design: a narrow focus on\n            priority issues, and the requirement for reform implementation."}, "docdt": "2004-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
