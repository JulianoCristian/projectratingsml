substantial. Lessons drawn from the project suggest the\n            following. The components of this operation emerged from\n            within the Government's overall development strategy,\n            which created ownership, and in turn recognized the extent\n            of policymakers' consensus to prod the reform agenda.\n            Moreover, participation of the civil society and the overall\n            level of public trust is an important element for\n            introducing radical reforms, and successful implementation\n            of its process. Moreover, a clear and well defined\n            assignment of responsibility within government entities\n            specified and defined the boundaries of responsibility, and\n            accountability for the implementation of various parts of\n            the reform process. This further supported the achievement\n            of program objectives, through a well coordinated effort\n            among donors, both in terms of advice and activities so as\n            to maximize synergies and improve cohesiveness. The\n            importance of Government institutional and implementation\n            capacity is emphasized, as a binding constraint for\n            successful development, and implementation of each component\n            of a reform program, and key to ensure sustainability of reforms"}, "docdt": "2005-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
