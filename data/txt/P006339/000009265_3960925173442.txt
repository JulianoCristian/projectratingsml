SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Brazil
National Health Policy Studies Project (Loan 2448-BR)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Brazil - National
Health Policy Studies Project (Loan 2448-BR) prepared by the Latin American Regional Office. No
comments on Parts I and III were received from the Borrower.
This project aimed to improve policy making and implementation processes by funding policy
research. Final reports were submitted to the Ministry of Health for only a third of the studies
initiated, and they had no effect on health policy or implementation. Reasons for this failure include
inadequate project design and supervision plus political, personnel and price changes that occurred
during implementation. Since no viable institutional mechanism was developed for undertaking and
feeding research findings into policy or implementation decisions, the project is considered to have
no sustainable consequences.
The Project Completion Report provides an accurate account of project implementation. No
audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY SIUDIES PROJECT
(LOAN 2448-BR)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the National Health Policy
Studies Project in Brazil. Loan 2448-BR for US$2.0 million was approved on
June 21, 1984. The loan amount disbursed was US$1.72 million, and the final
disbursement took place in 1990. The project was closed December 31, 1989.
This PCR was prepared by the Human Resources Division of the Brazil,
Peru and Venezuela Department in the Latin America and Caribbean Region.
Preparation of the report was based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the record
of the Board discussion of this project, the Loan Agreement, all material in
the Bank's files pertinent to this project, review of the completed research
reports and discussions with Ministry of Health and Bank staff.
The draft PCR (Parts I and III) was sent to the Borrower with a request
to prepare Part II but none was received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY STUDIES PROJECT
(LOAN 2248-BR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The National Health Policy Studies Project was a US$2.0 million loan to the
federal government of Brazil.  It was a spin-off of a larger health services
project within the state of Sao Paulo, and was an extension of the project
preparation analysis that pointed up the value of and lack of policy research in
Brazil.
Prolect Obiectives
2.    The objectives of this project were to strengthen the policy formulation
process in the health sector and to improve the implementation of policy
measures.   They were to be achieved through the funding of research studies
concerned with technical, political, institutional, and financial options.
3.    The strengths of the project were:  (a) its appropriateness, given policy
guidance needs; (b) the identification of key policy areas requiring attention;
and (c) its placement by the Bank at the center of the health policy debate as
a supportive, technical input to policy formulation.   The need for policy
research was clear, and the establishment of a federal-level initiative was a
sound decision.
Implementation Experience
4.    In retrospect, however, the institutional aspects of the project design
caused problems in project implementation. Placing management and administration
within the Ministry of Health (MOH) completely undermined the project. A lack
of understanding of the link between research and policy, the inexperience of MOH
staff with Bank administrative and disbursement procedures, and circumstances
beyond the control of the MOH (eg., political changes and macroeconomic
circumstances) also inhibited implementation. Fundamentally, however, the MOH
is not a research granting institution and lacked the necessary infrastructure
and expertise  to effectively manage  a research project.    They were  the
appropriate organ to provide policy focus, not to manage research.
5.    Bank supervision was also erratic with insufficient emphasis on research
expertise on supervision missions. However, the modest size of the loan may
explain part of this.
Results and Sustainabilitv
6.    Final studies were submitted to the Ministry of Health (MOH) for only a
third of the studies initiated. They had no observable effect on health policy
or implementation. The concept of health policy studies being integrated into



- iv -
MOH functions was never accepted or understood.  Without this the initiative
cannot be sustained.
Findings and Lessons
7.    The lessons learned from this project can be summarized as follows:  (i)
policy research projects are often needed by governments -- although
demonstration of the benefits and uses of research findings may often be
necessary; (ii) when initiating a policy research project for the first time,
intensive  technical  assistance  is  required  to  ensure  proper  project
implementation through:   establishing effective institutional arrangements,
jointly setting an appropriate policy agenda for research, and ensuring capacity
to manage research grants. Institutional development is key to ensuring proper
implementation and sustainability of project objectives.  Line ministries are
generally ill-equipped to manage research.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY STUDIES PROJECT
(LOAN 2248-BR)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Proiect Identity
1.          Project Name:      National Health Policy Studies
Loan Number:       2448-BR
Region:            Latin America and Caribbean
Department:        LAI
Country:           Brazil
Division:          Population and Human Resources Department
Sector:            Health
B.    Background
2.          The National Health Policy Studies Project (US$ 2 million) was
approved by the Board on June 30, 1984. The project was appraised jointly
with the Sao Paulo Basic Health Project (Ln. 2447-BR) and conceptually grew
out of much of the analytic work done in that project's preparation.
Originally conceived to be a subcomponent of the Sao Paulo Project, the
National Health Policy Studies project was funded under a separate Loan
Agreement with the Federative Republic of Brazil (the Sao Paulo Project was
signed with the State of Sao Paulo, which could not assume responsibility for
a national project). The National Health Policy Studies Project and the Sao
Paulo Basic Health Project were the second and third projects in the health
sector to be undertaken in Brazil.
3.          The Bank's lending objectives at the time focused on increasing
efficiency and equity within Brazil's health sector. In relation to Brazil's
overall level of development in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the health
profile of its population was extremely poor. Moreover, this poor performance
existed despite total expenditures in health comparable to many other
countries with healthier populations. Consensus was mounting within Brazil
that part of the problem lay in the structure and organization of the health
system itself. A number of national and state-level initiatives to re-design
parts of the health delivery system had already been implemented; lacking,
however, was a body of (national) analytical literature that would serve as a
guide to policy makers in evaluating changes and implementing policies based
on those evaluations. The National Health Policy Studies Project was designed
to help fill the analytical gap and establish a means for meeting
policymakers' needs for technical guidance in policy development.



- 2-
C.    Prolect Objectives and Description
4.          The objectives of the National Health Policy Studies Project, as
stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), were to: 1) strengthen the policy
formulation process in the health sector, and 2) improve the implementation of
policy measures. These objectives were to be achieved through the funding of
research studies focussing on five main areas: (i) alternative models for the
expansion of basic health service coverage; (ii) decentralization of health
service delivery and its technical, political and institutional implications;
(iii) economic and financial aspects of the health system; (iv) technological
options and their impact on cost effectiveness of the health system; and (v)
other subjects agreed on from time to time, pursuant to periodic
implementation reviews on an annual basis. These topics were identified and
agreed upon at a meeting of key Brazilian heath sector research institutions
and policy making agencies in April of 1983.
5.          The project was an outgrowth of the preparatory work for the
larger Sao Paulo Basic Health Project. The dearth of research apparent during
preparation, the need for policy research to guide policy and program
priorities, and the lack of funds and institutional structure to foster policy
research led to the design of a project component specifically devoted to
addressing these needs.
D.    Proiect Design and Organization
6.          Although many Bank loans carry special studies or research
components, the National Health Policy Studies Project remains one of the few
Bank projects aimed exclusively at funding policy research. As such, it can
be classified as both an innovative and experimental project, deserving of
careful evaluation in its implications for future Bank funding. The strength
of the project lies in (a) its appropriateness, given policy guidance needs,
(b) its timeliness, (c) the identification of key policy areas requiring
attention, and (d) its placement by the Bank at the center of the health
policy debate as a supportive, technical input to policy formulation.
7.          In retrospect, however, the institutional aspects of the project
design resulted in significant difficulties in project implementation. As
originally discussed, the project was to be administered under the aegis of
the Government Planning Institute (IPEA), or another research institution.
During negotiations, however, the Ministry of Health (MOH) expressed
discomfort with the idea of assuming the commitment of the loan without having
direct administrative responsibility. A compromise was worked out in which
the MOH would enter into a "consultative" relationship with IPEA, but would
itself be responsible for the contracting and administration of the proposed
studies.
8.          From the outset, many implementation problems can be attributed to
the fact that the MOH is not a research institution, did not have any
experience with research administration and was ill-equipped to define and use
policy research. Although IPEA did have such experience, the respective roles
and responsibilities of the two institutions were not well defined, and
coordination problems persisted throughout the project. The compromise design



- 3 -
also assigned the role of evaluating studies to a coordinating group within
the MOH (CIPLAN), which further complicated and delayed decision making. One
task manager, reviewing the project's implementation status approximately a
year before the closing date, strongly recommended that a better design for
such a project would be to locate implementation responsibility within a
research institution and try to build policy links from there, rather than
vice-versa.
E.    Prolect Implementation
9.          Overall, project implementation was slow.  From Board Approval to
Loan signing took approximately six months (from June 1984 to February 1985),
and from signing to effectiveness took nearly a year (from February 1985 to
January 1986). Six months before the project was originally scheduled to
close, 41Z of the Loan funds had been committed to the elaboration of 20
studies, and actual disbursements totaled only US$270,000 (both numbers from
May 29, 1987 request to extend closing date). The project was extended an
additional two years, and closed on December 31, 1989, with a cancellation of
US$279,000. The Bank and the MOH agreed, however, that all studies contract
by 12/31/89, the project closing date, would be submitted to the MOH by
12/31/90. At closing, the Bank had received one completed study.
10.         The studies were meant to address policy relevant economic and
financial issues in health care. The procedures for setting priority areas
for research and for identifying, contracting, tracking and paying researchers
were never clearly spelled out by either the Bank or the MOH, however, and the
process became ad hoc. Moreover, during implementation the MOH complained of
the difficulties in obtaining proposals on costs, financing and other target
areas, despite the fact that there were a number of capable and available
Brazilian researchers.
11.           The list of projects considered and supported under the project
(Table 8) reflects the lack of direction, focus and priorities under the
project.It is clear from these statistics on identified, contracted and
completed studies that problems plagued project implementation. A total of 67
studies can be identified in the files of the Bank and the Brazilian
government, although the majority of these never produced a report. Of those
67, 49 projects were submitted to and approved by the Bank. Another 49
studies were disbursed against, although many of these never resulted in a
completed study and some were never submitted for Bank approval. A total of
24 studies were received by the MOH in fulfillment of the research contract;
only 19 of these received Bank approval and only 12 of them have a record of
disbursement.
12.         There are six main reasons for implementation problems:  (i) the
above-mentioned difficulty of coordination both within and between
implementing institutions; (ii) political changes; (iii) a lack of
understanding of the link between research and policy; (iv) the macroeconomic
circumstances; (v) the inexperience of MOH staff with Bank administrative and
disbursement procedures; and (vi) the lack of continuity in both project
management and supervision. In addition, project implementation documents and
discussions with the MOH suggest a general lack of political commitment to and



- 4 -
understanding of the project. The top-down nature of decisionmaking within
the government in general may also have played a role in the poor performance
under the loan and in the political disaffection.
13.         Institutional Coordination.  The existence of a coordinating
agreement between the MOH and IPEA was written into the Loan Agreement as a
condition of effectiveness. Delays in getting this legal agreement written
and approved (by Congress) were the principal reason for the long delay
between the Loan signing and the declaration of effectiveness. Once
effective, mixed messages and an onerous review process for research proposals
caused further delays. At one point an average proposal evaluation time of
eight months was identified by the task manager.
14.         Political Changes.  1985 marked the transition from military to
democratic government in Brazil, with accompanying personnel and
organizational changes within the Ministry of Health. Moreover, the Sarney
government (1985 - 1990) proved to be a particularly unstable time for the
Ministry: five Ministers of Health were appointed within as many years.
While at least one Minister (Roberto Santos) took a personal interest in the
project, the project's relevancy to policy-making was perceived differently by
different administrations. This lack of continuity and shifts in priority at
the highest level was also mirrored at the lower levels, and ultimately within
the project. In retrospect, greater efforts to institutionalize the research
grant program and to ensure that results be presented to government
policymakers on a regular basis would have enhanced the policy impact of the
project.
15.         Research-Policy Link.  A hybrid public-private health system such
as Brazil's requires constant assessment to ensure that objectives are being
met. The decentralization of health care and the myriad of reforms and
experiments that have accompanied decentralization have been left virtually
unevaluated, and therefore are of limited use for guiding policy. The need
for and use of policy research was not made evident to health policymakers who
had limited experience with defining and using research findings. The project
failed to assist the government in obtaining and using policy research, which
was a necessary component for project effectiveness and success. In the final
year of the project the MOH's Secretary of Science and Technology overhauled
procedures and identified and funded promising, policy relevant research
studies. These studies reflect policy priorities and comply with both the
spirit and letter of the project. The findings, however, have not been used
in policy formulation or program design.
16.         Macroeconomic Setting.  Throughout the project implementation
period, inflation in Brazil was running between 59% and 1,864% annually. As
Brazilians became accustomed to living with high levels of inflation, the
value of a contract for almost any service was indexed to the inflation rate.
In the case of a number of early research contracts, however, lack of indexing
and/or long disbursement delays on the part of the Ministry of Health led to
researchers abandoning projects for lack of funds. This accounts for some of
the uncompleted contracts.



17.         Inexperience with Bank Procedures.  Owing to a misunderstanding
between the MOH's technical review committee (CIPLAN) and the Ministry's
Budget and Planning Office, contracts for several studies were not sent to the
Bank for official approval, and hence were not immediately eligible for
reimbursement. This problem was resolved during a Bank supervision mission in
1987.
18.         Lack of Continuity in Prolect Management and Supervision.
Although implementation problems caused by political turnover and the
macroeconomic setting probably could not have been anticipated, they could
have been minimized had there been greater continuity in project management
and supervision. Mid-way through the project, the Bank approved a request
from the then-Secretary of Science and Technology in the MOH to hire a full-
time project coordinator. The approved request was apparently not acted upon.
It was not until the last year of the project when the Secretary of Science
and Technology took control of the project and provided effective leadership
and management the proper implementation occurred. Indeed, the highest
quality and most appropriate studies were identified and contracted in the
last 12 months of the project.
19.         On the Bank's side, supervision was performed at different times
by four different staff members, with differing backgrounds. While the notion
of "piggy-backing" supervision of the National Health Studies Project with
other activities undoubtedly made sense in economizing on Bank resources, the
fact that the above-mentioned confusion over Bank procedures was not resolved
until 1987 would indicate that the Bank's attention to this project was
deficient. Moreover, follow up on annual audits was inconsistent at best, and
financial problems were infrequently identified and rectified in a timely
manner.
F.    Prolect Sustainabilitv
20.         The concept of the Government supporting and guiding health policy
research could have been adopted and integrated into MOH functions, thereby
ensuring the sustainability of the project's approach. The inability of the
MOH to even use or learn from the completed studies suggests both a lack of an
appropriate institutional conduit and/or a lack of understanding of the
benefits and use of policy research findings. A poor understanding of the
policy implications of findings ensured that the initiative would not be
sustained.
G.    Bank Performance
21.         In its conception, the project was innovative, and demonstrated a
commendable willingness on the part of the Bank to experiment with a new type
of project tailored to the perceived needs of the government. However, the
design of the project was inappropriate given the experience, expertise and
operation of the Ministry of Health. The last minute agreement to manage a
policy research effort out of a line ministry with absolutely no experience in
funding research was a grave error. Similarly, the failure to establish a
mechanism to present and demonstrate policy implications to the government was
a serious flaw. The Health Policy Studies Project was further hampered by



- 6 -
constantly changing Bank supervision teams. In retrospect, the Bank could
have improved the project in the following respects:
(1)   The Bank should have been more careful in the institutional
arrangements of the project, and more forceful in persuading the
government of the merits of the original design. Large design
changes are generally not advisable at the last minute. Moreover,
the MOH had no comparative advantage nor any expertise to properly
implement the project and the Bank had a strong basis for
objecting to the revised design. Experience from other countries
suggests the importance of a separate institutional responsibility
for funding policy research.
(2)   Once it was agreed that the MOH was to be the administering body,
the Bank should have provided assistance to the Government in
establishing a systematic method for setting priorities,
attracting appropriate proposals, overseeing completion of
research and eneuring that the findings and policy implications
were presented and discussed with the MOH. The lack of MOH
experience and the fact that this was a new area for them made a
technical assistance component key to an effective project.
(3)   The Bank should have been more consistent in its supervision and
follow-up. There is a sense in which, because the National Health
Policy Studies Project was originally conceived as a sub-component
of Loan 2447 (Sao Paulo Basic Health Care), that it never quite
attained the status of a "real loan". Supervision missions were
often tagged onto other activities, with little consistency of
personnel or systematic oversight.
22.         A final consideration, relevant to any future undertaking of a
similar project, is whether the Bank is willing to commit substantial staff
resources to so small a loan (US$2 million). A key lesson learned from this
project is that small loans can require (for adequate performance) just as
much attention as large ones.
H.    Borrower Performance
23.         As discussed above, the MOH gave uneven and generally minimal
attention to the management and implementation of the project until the last
year of the project. Clear authority and implementation responsibilities
should have been established at the onset. This would have facilitated
project implementation and avoided the difficulties experienced with each
change of leadership. The Borrower's performance was hampered by the lack of
such guidelines, and it made Bank supervision equally difficult.
I.    Lessons Learned
24.         The lessons learned from this project can be summarized as
follows: (i) when initiating a policy research project for the first time,
intensive technical assistance is required to: guide the establishment of
effective and sustainable institutional arrangements, help set an appropriate



policy agenda for research, and manage the advertising, technical oversight
and follow-up that are necessary to ensure proper project implementation and
long range sustainability; (ii) institutional development is key to ensuring
proper implementation and sustainability of project objectives. Line
ministries are generally ill-equipped to manage research, and other
arrangements should be explored and perhaps new institutions established to
manage research activities; and (iii) policy research projects are needed by
governments -- although demonstration of the benefits and uses of research
findings may often be necessary, and appropriate studies can be identified and
funded provided the institutional issues are resolved.

(a) The long delays between Appraisal, Post-Appraisal and Negotiations
were due in large part to changes in the State Secretariat of Health
in Sao Paulo. There were actually several Post-Appraisal missions --
see Table 8: Bank Resources
(b) The National Health Studies Project was separated from the
Sao Paulo Project at this point.
(c) The delay in entering into effectiveness was largely due to the
difficulties in getting the legal agreement between IPEA and the MOH
negotiated and approved by Congress.
(d) The project was extended because of slow implementation.
(e) All completed studies received by this date.
