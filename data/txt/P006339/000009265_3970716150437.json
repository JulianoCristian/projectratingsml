         Health Policy Studies Project are to help improve the health\n            status of the low-income population of Greater Sao Paulo,\n            and to help formulate medium-term objectives and plans for\n            the entire health sector. The project consists of two\n            subprojects, each supported by a separate loan. The Sao\n            Paulo basic health care subproject will help introduce a\n            basic health care delivery model that will: (i) emphasize\n            prevention of illness, as well as health and nutrition\n            education, while providing low-cost curative care, which\n            will cover about 90 percent of the health needs of an\n            average community; (ii) provide services through a network\n            of grassroots-level basic health units supported by\n            community hospitals; (iii) support the introduction of an\n            effective referral system and improved health service\n            payment procedures; and (iv) promote the rational use of\n            medical personnel through appropriate employment of\n            paramedical staff and well-remunerated full-time physicians.\n            It replicated elsewhere in the state and in Brazil. The\n            national health policy studies subproject will support a\n            program of studies designed to help the federal government\n            formulate and implement medium-term objectives and plans for\n            the entire health sector."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
