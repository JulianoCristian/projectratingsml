3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The Project's main objectives were to: (a) improve the reliability of the distribution system and contain
losses, while meeting the projected rapid increase in electricity demand; (b) assist in the organizational
restructuring of MEA leading to its commercialization and corporatization; and (c) introduce demand-side
management capabilities in MEA's organization.

At appraisal in 1997, rapid growth in electricity demand was anticipated in Metropolitan Bangkok, while
system reliability and efficiency were already beginning to erode. This required large investments in the
distribution network to improve supply-side efficiency and deepening of efforts (commenced under the
Bank's GEF Project ­ TH-28637) to enhance demand-side efficiency.              The stage had been set for
commercialization of the three Thai electricity utilities and it was appropriate to initiate concrete steps for
the restructuring and corporatization of MEA. The project objectives were thus aptly targeted to MEA's
needs.    The development of electricity infrastructure was fully consistent with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) to strengthen Thailand's infrastructure base to help it regain international
competitiveness. Commercialization of MEA was in line with the Bank's and the Government's sector
strategy. While the Investment components of the Project were well within the implementing capacity of
MEA, the expectation of achievement of the Policy components within a reasonable time frame was
ambitious, but this turned out to be largely due to factors which could not have been foreseen at appraisal.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The original objectives remained unchanged.

3.3 Original Components:

The Project had the following main components: (see Annex 2 for details)

Investment Components: - These comprised strengthening of MEA's network under the following heads:
(a) transmission and distribution substation system; (b) transmission line systems; and (c) distribution
system.

Policy Components: ­ (a) Major restructuring of MEA's organization leading to commercialization and
corporatization of the entity, including: (i) unbundling of MEA's "Supply" and "Distribution" functions; (ii)
establishment of a corporate center for central support functions; (iii) creation of business units for
non-core functions; and (iv) establishment of subsidiary companies; (b) introduction of DSM capabilities in
MEA's organization, comprising: (i) setting up of an Appliance Testing Laboratory; (ii) introduction of a
system-wide Load Research program; (iii) implementation of a Load Control program; (iv) establishment
of an Energy Services Company (ESCO); and (v) technical assistance for the four DSM components.

Both, the Investment and the Policy components were closely linked to the Project's objectives.
Recognizing that MEA had no previous experience in implementing the Policy components: (a) the
restructuring steps were staged to move MEA progressively towards corporatization and subsequent
privatization; (b) the DSM initiatives were tailored to suit MEA's technical capabilities and gradually
develop commercial consciousness through the ESCO route; and (c) adequate consulting assistance was
provided for both.




                                                      - 2 -

3.4 Revised Components:

The 1997 economic/financial crisis led to a reversal in demand growth and forced MEA to slash its
expansion program to maintain its financial stability. Accordingly, in 1999, MEA proposed to the Bank a
substantial restructuring of the Project's physical components, while continuing to maintain its
development objectives and economic viability (EIRR). In the face of faltering demand, MEA requested
the Bank to also review the Project's rather stringent DSM program stipulations and agree to a more
rational and manageable program. The Bank accepted MEA's proposals and approved the restructured
Project after securing a no-objection from its Board. The legal documents were amended accordingly. The
revised physical components are given in Annex 2.          A worthy addition was the Service Efficiency
Improvement component using a SCADA system.

3.5 Quality at Entry:

The quality of entry of the Project is rated as satisfactory. The project objectives were consistent with the
CAS and the Government's sector policies. While the SAR identified the risks of construction delays, this
became moot when the demand registered negative growths during the crisis years, 1997-99. Anticipation
of delays in implementation of the Project's policy components (commercialization, corporatization and
development of DSM capabilities), was well founded, but the extent of difficulties encountered could not be
foreseen. The Project fully complied with the Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:

The overall outcome of the Project is rated as satisfactory. It would have been rated as highly satisfactory,
except that the achievement of its Policy components merited only a satisfactory rating, falling short of
SAR expectations. The achievement of the objective to improve the reliability of the distribution system
and contain losses was admirably met, albeit with lower than expected demand growth, and is rated as
highly satisfactory.     This is warranted on the basis of MEA's skillful reframing of the physical
components and down-scaling of investments, as demand faltered (a task, more challenging than meeting
demand growth), so that the Project's economic viability was sustained and MEA's overall financial
position did not flounder.

Objective 1: Improve the reliability of the distribution system and contain losses, while meeting the
projected rapid increase in electricity demand.

This objective was admirably met, with dramatic improvements in reliability indices, losses and manpower
utilization (see Annex 1). While both, reliability and efficiency improvements, can in part be attributed to
low demand growth, they were brought about significantly by improvements in operation and maintenance
practices and by well-timed, well-positioned, and aptly-curtailed investments in distribution infrastructure,
in consonance with system demand. Manpower utilization (per unit of demand) was improved, even with
demand depression, due to personnel policies that stopped recruitment of non-technical staff and
encouraged early separation.

Objective 2: Assist in the organizational restructuring of MEA leading to its commercialization and
corporatization.




                                                      - 3 -

This objective is expected to be largely met. MEA is currently proceeding earnestly with restructuring and
commercialization, as a prerequisite to registering itself as the "MEA Public Company Ltd." with the
Ministry of Commerce in March 2004 and to privatize itself as a whole, by way of public offering of a
portion of its equity in June 2004.

MEA organizational restructuring fell short of appraisal expectations. At appraisal the following steps
were envisaged for the restructuring of MEA: Phase 1 ­ (i) Creation of Business Units: (Non Core Units
for divestiture); (ii) unbundling of Core Distribution activities into "Supply" and "Distribution " cost
centers; (iii) creation of a corporate center of central support units ; and (iv) creation of an ESCO business
unit. Phase 2 ­ (i) Conversion of "Supply" business unit into a profit center; and (ii) introduction of
wholesale competition with MEA "Distribution" business unit having open access to bulk supply
distributors and large retail consumers. While creating four Business Units for its Core and Non-Core
operations (Management and Finance; Supply and Marketing; Engineering; and Operation and Business),
MEA dropped the idea of spinning-off its Non-Core units, considering them too small to attract private
interest. And, while unbundling its Core businesses into "Network" and "Supply" operations, it could do
so only on an accounting basis ("Cost-Centers"). Network and Supply operations could function as
separate legal entities ("Profit Centers"), only if the Government later decides to allow wholesale
competition for bulk supply to distributors and large consumers, and subsequently retail competition as
well. There are no signs of this happening in the near future.

The less-than-expected achievement of this objective is due to vacillations in government policy for sector
reform, exacerbated to some extent by reluctance of the electricity utilities to espouse major structural
changes that could lead to the breaking up of their empires. Thus, while the basic policy for reform,
restructuring and privatization was maintained, its implementation course was checkered (see Section 10
below).

Objective 3: Introduce demand-side management (DSM) capabilities in MEA's organization.

Initially, implementation was quite seriously affected by the country's financial/economic crisis. With
demand declining and revenues falling, MEA management was (understandably) reluctant to commit
resources to the DSM effort (which would have further eroded its revenues) and wished to drop this
component. Due to the tardy progress in DSM, as also the deterioration in MEA's financial performance,
the Project's DO rating was downgraded to U in 1999 and subsequently upgraded to S in 2001. Following
Bank's persuasion and agreement to reallocate some funds from the GEF Project (TH-28637), DSM was
revived. The Bank also agreed to: (i) dropping testing facilities for Refrigerators and Air Conditioners as
adequate private facilities for these were available in Thailand; (ii) deferring development of Load Control
from MEA's scope (to be taken up by MEA when the demand in its area picked up substantially), as
EGAT was already implementing it; and (iii) moderating the demonstration of ESCO's performance to five
projects aggregating to about Baht 10 million.

With the aforementioned relaxations, the realization of this objective was fully accomplished. MEA: (i)
undertook several consulting studies (see Annex 7); (ii) installed top class motor and ballast testing
facilities at its testing center at Samsen and embarked on a marketing strategy for promoting their use; (iii)
did commendable work on load research, collecting load data of 1,142 samples, producing customer and
overall system load profiles and is now creating advanced applications to facilitate efficient utilization of
electricity and reducing demand; (iv) assisted customers in availing of TOU tariff to reduce electricity bills;
and (v) set up its ESCO Business Unit and contracted for five demonstration projects totaling about Baht
10 million.

4.2 Outputs by components:

The restructured Project's physical components were fully implemented within the six-months ­extended
loan closing date of June 30, 2003, and executed with high standards of quality, with due regard to
environmental, social, aesthetical and safety considerations. Implementation delays were largely due to
factors (way leave problems, traffic congestion, coordination with other metropolitan authorities) that were
beyond MEA's control.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

At the time of appraisal in 1997, the economic justification of the Project was based on evaluating the
EIRR of a time-slice of MEA's investment program over the years 1997-2001. The EIRR was 20.4%. At
the ICR stage in 2003, the EIRR was evaluated for time slices of MEA's investment program: (i) over the
1997-2001 period; and (ii) over the 1997-2003 period, using the same methodology as at appraisal (see
Annex 3). The EIRR's of the two time slices are 13.5% and 19.8%, respectively. This illustrates that
while the EIRR of MEA's investment program immediately following the financial/economic crisis was
adversely impacted, it still exceeded the viability threshold of 10%, and that subsequent recovery after the
crisis was over was rapid. Both performances point to MEA maintaining a high degree of investment and
performance efficiency.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

In spite of the 1997 economic/financial crisis, the financial objectives of the Project, as reflected by the
covenanted financial ratios, were substantially achieved (see Annex 1); only on one occasion did MEA not
comply with the financial covenants - SFR in FY99 was 2% instead of the covenanted 25%. As the overall
financial health of MEA continued to remain sound, the Bank allowed a one-time relaxation of this
covenant. From FY00 onwards, MEA's financial performance improved dramatically as a result of: (i)
prudent financial management; (ii) drastic reduction in capital investments; (iii) significant improvements in
operating efficiency; and (iv) recouping foreign exchange losses from consumers through the tariff
surcharge mechanism.

4.5 Institutional development impact:

The Project's institutional development impact is rated as high. As a result of several consulting studies
that MEA undertook (see Annex 7) in compliance with the Project's and the Government's mandates to
commercialize and corporatize, a distinct business-oriented culture gradually emerged. This is expected to
mature as MEA becomes a corporation and is listed on the SET. Due to the Government's decision to
select electricity utility Governors on a competitive basis and assign them time-bound performance-linked
contracts, there have been discernable improvements in the efficiency of MEA's managerial and technical
operations. Though MEA was prepared to create "Network" and "Supply" "Profit Centers", it had to stop
short and do this only on a "Cost Center" basis, as wholesale competition was put on indefinite hold by the
Government. As a distribution utility, MEA had to familiarize itself with the novel DSM concept early on,
and consequently, delayed implementation of this program. However, from 2000 onwards, it had begun to
implement the program and imbibed a DSM culture --institutionalizing the ESCO concept, creating an
ESCO unit with a staff of 15, evolving novel methods of contracting/financing and getting on with
implementation of several ESCO projects, albeit small to start with (see Annex 10).

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

Two factors can be cited: First - the1997 economic/financial crisis that struck Thailand, which led to a
dramatic reduction in power demand and severely tested the financial strength of the utilities to cope and
recover; and Second - Government concerns over the security of supply and pricing spike after the
California Power crisis and the adverse reports about operation of the British Power Pool. This led the
Government to drop the introduction of a competitive power market, as envisaged in the context of the
energy sector reform agenda.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

While committed to commercialization and privatization per se, the current Government had no compulsion
to introduce complex industry restructuring devised by the previous Government in the face of utilities'
general reluctance. In deference to their wishes, the current Government has proposed corporatization and
listing of the three utilities without breaking them up, but at an accelerated pace. Hence, creation of
MEA's Network and Supply Units as Profit Centers would be on an indefinite hold, but its listing on the
SET would be completed by June 2004. At no time did the Government agree to raise tariffs or forego
remittances when utilities could not meet Bank's financial covenants, but this did not adversely affect
MEA's financial health significantly.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

There were two significant factors: (i) initial lethargy of the organization in implementing the DSM
component; and (ii) the general reluctance of MEA management, backed by MEA's union (as was the case
with all the three Thai electricity utilities) to undertake a major organizational restructuring.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The total estimated cost of the appraised Project was US$362 million and of the restructured Project
US$331 million. The actual completion cost was US$293.4 million. The saving of US$37.6 million was
due to much lower than expected equipment costs. In all, MEA cancelled US$59.3 million from the loan
amount.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

Project overall sustainability is rated as likely. The Project has been constructed to excellent technical
standards and there is no doubt about MEA operating and maintaining it competently. Further, with the
introduction of a modern SCADA Control Center under the Project, MEA's operational efficiency would
be significantly enhanced. The physical sustainability of the Project is thus considered highly likely. With
Government's clear time-bound mandate (highly unlikely to be reversed) towards listing of the electricity
utilities on the SET and preparations well under way by MEA to abide by this mandate, the sustainability
of the commercialization and corporatization component of the Project is also rated as highly likely. The
sustainability of the DSM component is rated as likely ­ while management of a corporatized and
privatized MEA could be expected to take an entrepreneurial stance and actively support the ESCO



                                                        - 6 -

program, competition with non-profit government organizations and private agencies currently enjoying
government subsidy, could act as barriers to MEA's ESCO program.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

A summary of understandings between the Bank and MEA for reporting on the Project's operational phase
is presented below (see ICR Aide Memoire, Annex 8). MEA would furnish annually to the Bank, for the
next five years, a summary report on the following:

·        the utilization (MW and Mwh) of the substation facilities financed by the Project
·        the status of monitoring indicators for financial performance, reliability, losses and manpower
         utilization
·        the utilization of the testing facilities (numbers of motors and ballasts tested)
·        the status of the ESCO program (number and value of projects undertaken), the load research
         program and the load control activity
·        significant events in corporatization and listing
·        any events that may adversely affect the physical and policy components of the Project

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

The Bank's performance in Project formulation is rated as fully satisfactory. Of particular note are: (i) its
insistence on MEA laying out distinct steps for its corporatization and privatization - although the phasing
and content of this component changed in actual practice, it exercised a continuing pressure on MEA to
pursue this goal; and (ii) its convincing a reluctant MEA to get into the DSM business, as it was in the
national interest (even if not in the utility's narrow revenue interest) to improve the efficiency of electricity
utilization in a rapidly developing metropolis.

7.2 Supervision:

The Bank fielded adequately staffed supervision missions. It displayed extreme flexibility during the
financial/economic crisis.     Yet, while sympathizing with the utility's woes, especially on DSM, and
permitting a rational degree of relaxations, it did not allow this component to lapse. Throughout, the Bank
maintained a substantial level of dialogue, largely in an informal manner, with MEA and the Government
on pricing, sector reform, restructuring and privatization. However, it realized that it could not and hence
did not try to enforce rigid compliance with covenants on restructuring and corporatization, considering
that MEA's actions were often beyond its control, being mandated by Government policies which kept
changing. The Bank performance is rated as fully satisfactory.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

The Bank's overall performance is rated as fully satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

The Borrower's overall performance is rated as fully satisfactory. While its preparation of the physical
components (based on several studies, see Annex 7) and devising the performance monitoring indicators



                                                       - 7 -

and targets, is rated as highly satisfactory; its less-than-enthusiastic preparation of the restructuring and
corporatization and the DSM components is rated as satisfactory.

7.5 Government implementation performance:

Government performance is rated as satisfactory. The previous Government aptly handled the utilities
during the economic/financial crisis from which they emerged with sound positions. Its National Energy
Policy Office conducted several far-reaching studies on restructuring of the Power Supply Industry, drafted
the Energy Act, finalized the regulatory regime for the energy sector, formulated the Power Pool Model and
secured Cabinet approval for its proposals. It introduced a new bulk supply tariff and reformed the tariff
structure in preparation for Pool operations. When the current Government stepped in, it required (at the
behest of the three Thai electricity utilities, especially EGAT) the entire Power Industry plan to be
reviewed, particularly in regard to ushering-in of Pool operations by 2003. It later revised the original
models of restructuring and corporatization of EGAT, MEA and PEA (which called for a considerable
amount of un-bundling) and directed that the three utilities be privatized (as a whole) by listing on the
SET.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

MEA's overall performance in implementation is rated as satisfactory.           Its performance in - major
restructuring of the Project's physical components in a timely manner, its adroitness in utilizing a portion
of the savings for improving the system's monitoring and control facilities, its tenacity in resolving land
procurement and right-of-way issues and finally in devising novel ways of structuring and financing ESCO
projects- is rated as highly satisfactory. Its implementation of the restructuring and corporatization
component and the DSM component is rated as satisfactory.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

Overall, the Borrower's performance is rated as fully satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

The following are key lessons learned from this Project:

·        Preparation: Major restructuring, corporatization and privatization of a utility, should provide for
flexibility, as such actions are often beyond the utility's control, being subject to mandates which may
change with a change of Government.           Likewise, there should be flexibility in the design and
implementation of components such as DSM, for which the utility has had no past experience and little
desire to execute.

·        Economic/Financial: Sudden economic/financial crisis in a country, could severely impact power
demand and could render major distribution investments planned for high sustained growth levels, totally
unviable. Under such conditions, utilities need to take timely and drastic measures to restructure their
investment plans, exercise great financial discipline, and double efforts towards improving operational
efficiency. Under these circumstances, the Bank would do well to take a flexible and sympathetic approach
to government actions and desist from demanding rigid compliance with covenants.

·        Power Sector Reforms: Introduction of complex power pool operations in a developing country
needs to be thought through with care. Active support rather than reluctant acquiescence of the utilities is



                                                     - 8 -

necessary to push through a complex reform agenda. The Bank could best play the role of advisor and
facilitator for countries that have already embarked on the path of power sector reforms and should
recognize that restructuring proposals cannot be cast in stone and could change as Government and utility
thinking evolves.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:

MEA has accepted the findings of the ICR and thanked the Bank for its support. It has rated Bank's
performance as satisfactory. The Government has verbally conveyed that it has no comments on the ICR.
The Borrower's evaluation report is found in Annex 9.

(b) Cofinanciers:

There were no cofinanciers for the Project per se. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), who
cofinanced MEA's Eighth Plan, has conveyed a few editorial corrections which have been incorporated in
the report.

(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):

None

10. Additional Information

Course of Power Sector Reforms in Thailand

In early 2000, NEPO oriented the reform strategy for the Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) to the creation
of a "Competitive Power Pool", representing a departure over the earlier plan of unbundling EGAT and
creating a Single Buyer sector structure. It proposed a gradual restructuring of EGAT, PEA and MEA to
create an industry with wholesale competition by 2003. In regard to distribution, which acts as a natural
monopoly, it was proposed that: (i) access to the wires and tariff levels will be subject to regulation; (ii)
all but a few large consumers would purchase electricity from the Distribution Companies (DisCos) of
regulated regional monopolies or Regulated Electricity Delivery Companies (REDCOs), and pay for this
electricity either through the REDCOs, Supply Companies (SupplyCOs) or Competitive Retailers
(RetailCos); and (iii) the retail supply function would be provided by DisCos/SupplyCos or by independent
supply companies/RetailCos.

MEA reached agreement with the Government that it would become a REDCO: (i) providing both
distribution and "grey area" services at regulated costs and cost-based prices, respectively; (ii) supplying
electricity to customers only at spot market prices; (iii) adopting a decentralized approach to retail
settlement; and (iv) operating independently of RetailCos and GenCos. MEA proposed restructuring in the
following 3 stages: By FY00-01: (i) MEA would remain a state enterprise; (ii) the distribution and supply
activities would be under REDCO with separate accounting functions and clear performance targets; and
(iii) the non-core activities would be divided into four non-core service business (NSBs) and organized as
autonomous business units within MEA. By FY02-03: ESSD and PDMO would be corporatized and
partially privatized while the rest of the NSBs will remain with MEA.             By FY03-onwards:         If
performance, efficiency and reliability targets are not achieved, MEA-REDCO would be considered for
corporatization and the remaining NSBs, corporatized and partially privatized.

In May 2001 the new Government initiated a complete review of the previous Government's Power Sector
policy and decided to postpone consideration of the Energy Act approved by the previous Cabinet. In
parallel, EGAT (sensitized by the California Power Crisis) did some serious rethinking on the creation of a
Power Pool by 2003 and advocated a "Third Party Grid Access" model, wherein ownership and operation
of the grid would still be with EGAT but competitors would be allowed to use it, on non-discriminatory
terms. In February 2001 the new Government announced an Agenda on Privatization, which called for
listing 16 SOE's on the SET, from 2001 to 2003 (EGAT in the third quarter and MEA and PEA in the
fourth quarter of 2003).

A Ministry of Energy (MOE) was created on October 1, 2002 comprising five departments ­ Office of the
Minister, Office of the Permanent Secretary, Department of Petroleum Resources, Department of Energy
Business, Department of Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation and Energy Policy and Planning
Office (EPPO) which replaces the erstwhile NEPO.

Subsequently, a unanimous decision was taken by EGAT, MEA, PEA and the Government to move away
from NEPO's       "Power Pool " model. EPPO proposed a new model: (i) split            EGAT into       three
PowerGens.; (ii) create an Independent System Operator (ISO); (iii) create a Transmission Company
(GridCo); (iv) create an Independent Regulator; and (v) separate "network" and "retail" functions within
MEA and PEA. Disagreeing with EPPO's model, EGAT proposed an alternative model (i) up to 30% of
total demand to operate in a "free market" under a Power Exchange; (ii) EGAT would maintain the
generation functions, and ability to contract power under new PPAs for future GenCos; (iii) EGAT would
maintain the transmission and system control functions; (iv) MEA and PEA could buy power only from
EGAT; and (v) residential, commercial and small industrial consumers would purchase power from MEA
and PEA. While MEA and PEA broadly supported EPPO's model they strongly opposed EGAT's model.
To resolve the impasse between the utilities the Government called for a wider debate on the subject.

Government's latest decision, after evoking the Power Pool (through Cabinet Resolution of September 9,
2003) is to hire a Consulting firm to assist it in studying the appropriate ESI model, and proceed with
corporatization and listing of the three Thai electricity utilities on the SET.

The details of the economic analysis are given in Attachments 1 and 2 to this Annex.

The EIRR for the Base Case (time slice of investments, 1997-2001) is 13.5%
If the time slice of investments is extended by two years i.e., 1997-2003, the EIRR increases to
19.8%.

Introduction

1.        A World Bank Mission composed of Darayes Mehta, (Consultant, Power) visited MEA on August
18, 2003 for preparation of the Implementation Completition Report (ICR) for the above mentioned
project. This Aide Memoire presents the Mission's findings and agreements reached with MEA. The
Mission wishes to thank MEA for its excellent cooperation.

Summary of Mission's Findings

2.        The following is a summary of the Mission's findings:

Physical Implementation.

3.        Physical implementation of the Project is 100% complete as of the loan closing date of June 30,
2003. Installations visited by the Mission were found to be of high standards of quality and safety.

Disbursements.

4.        The loan is expected to be fully disbursed (barring a small residual) within the 4-month grace
period after closure, as permissible under Bank rules.

Performance Monitoring Indicators.

5.        The performance monitoring indicators are very satisfactory and reflect a significant improvement
in system reliability due to automation, better construction practices and sound maintenance management.

Financial Performance and Audit.

6.        Overall, the financial performance of MEA during the Project implementation period FY98-03, has
been satisfactory. For FY03, there is likelihood of non-compliance with the SFR (at 11.5%) and DSCR (at
1.3x) covenants. This matter is under discussion between MEA and the Government. MEA' projections of
financial performance for FY 2004-07 show compliance with the Bank's financial covenants.


Electricity Supply Industry Restructuring and MEA Corporatization and Privatization.

7.        While the restructuring of the Electricity Supply Industry is still under review by the three electric
utilities and the concerned government bodies, MEA is proceeding with its corporatization and privatization
plans which are on schedule to register it as the MEA Public Company Ltd. with the Ministry of



                                                     - 31 -

Commerce in March 2004 and to privatize it as a whole by way of public offering in June 2004. The
Mission discussed with MEA the consulting studies it had undertaken and how these had benefited MEA in
its organizational development.

Demand Side Management.

8.       The Mission discussed with MEA key actions that need to be taken to fully realize the objectives of
the DSM component and ensure its sustainability. These include: (i) focusing attention on the commercial
viability and sustainability of the Testing Facility and the ESCO Business; (ii) reviving the Load Control
Program at the opportune time; and (iii) ensuring proper staffing of the ESCO Development Project
Organization. MEA provided targets for its commercial DSM activities.

Economic Analysis

9.       The Mission discussed in detail the methodology of performing the economic cost benefit analysis
of the Project. Subsequent work done by MEA shows, prima facie, that the Project will continue to be
economically viable with EIRR exceeding the 10% threshold. Further detailed analysis will be done by the
Mission.

Agreements reached with MEA

10.      The following agreements were reached with MEA.

Borrower's Own Report

11.      MEA will furnish to the Bank the Borrower's Own Report on the Project, following the Bank's
ICR Guidelines, by September 30, 2003.

Bank's ICR

12.      The Bank will submit its ICR to MEA by November 15, 2003.

Operational Phase

13.      MEA will submit annually to the Bank, for the next five years, a summary report on the following

                METROPOLITAN DISTRIBUTION REINFORCEMENT PROJECT
                                        (IBRD LOAN NO. 4199-TH)


Introduction

1.     The Metropolitan Distribution Reinforcement Project represented an integral part of MEA's Eighth
Power Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Plan FY 1996 ­ 2001 covering part of expansion
and reinforcement of MEA's distribution work over the years 1997-2001.                The Eighth Power Plan,
approved on May 21, 1996, was in line with the Eighth National Economic and Social Development Plan
FY 1997 - 2001. However, MEA reviewed and revised its Eighth Power Plan in order to effectively reflect
the current demand and its investment plan resulting from the recession on economic crisis in Thailand.
The Revised Eighth Power Plan was approved on June 8, 1999. As part of the Bank's assistance program
in the power sector in Thailand, the Loan No. 4199-TH in the amount of US$ 145 million equivalent was
approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on June 24, 1997. The Project was later restructured to be in
line with the Revised Eighth Power Plan while the loan amount was still maintained at US$ 145 million.
Co-financing of balance was provided by the OECF Loan in the amount of Yen 14,304 million. (The Loan
was closed on January 27, 2003 as scheduled. The total disbursement was Yen 6,616.724 million.) The
loan closing date was extended by one year to June 30, 2003.

A. Assessment of Project Objectives, Design, Implementation and Operation Experience

Project Objectives and Description

2.     The Project's main objectives were to: (i) improve the reliability of the distribution system and
contain losses at current levels, while meeting the projected rapid increase in electricity demand; (ii) assist
in the organizational restructuring of MEA leading to its commercialization and corporatization; and (iii)
introduce demand-side management capabilities in MEA's organization.

3.     The objectives of the project have been satisfactorily achieved and remained unchanged throughout
the project cycle despite significant modification of project scope. The revised component was made to
obtain the least cost technically acceptable alternative to efficiently reflect the unforeseen load slump at the
early project period in MEA service area, taking into consideration of its objectives particularly system
reliability improvement. In view of institutional development and Demand Side Management capabilities,
both of them had gradually evolved to finally meet its objectives by the end of the project.

4.     The components of the project were: (i) construction and addition of subtransmission and
distribution facilities including: (a) 230-69 kV transmission substations and transmission lines; (b) 115 kV,
69 kV and 24 kV transmission and distribution substations and associated lines; (c) power supply by
underground cable; (d) miscellaneous equipment and materials; and (e) management and service efficiency
improvement with a new SCADA system; and (ii) two consulting studies regarding: (a) strategies for
corporatization and privatization of MEA's activities; and (b) energy conservation strategic plan.




                                                     - 33 -

5.    The implementation of the project was highly satisfactory and the physical targets of the project had
been successfully met, as the project was completed at the time of the extended project completion date,
albeit one year behind original schedule as stated in the SAR.

6.       During the project implementation, most of the work had been completed by the original closing
date except for SCADA project and a few subtransmission line routes.              Certain delays had been
experienced mainly due to the uncontrollable factors including the poor coordination among related public
and private utilities and the lengthy delay in obtaining permission from authorized entities, both public and
private entities. The poor coordination among related public and private utilities, namely Telephone
Organization of Thailand and Mass Communication Organization of Thailand as well as their
concessionaries, e.g., TA, UCOM, AIS and UBC etc., was experienced in implementing SCADA project.
As a result, the project implementation had been delayed for a certain period resulting in an overall project
delay and subsequent extension of project completion by one year.

7.       On the other side of implementation difficulties was the lengthy permission for subtransmission line
construction from public utilities, namely Bangkok Metropolis Administration, Highway Department etc.
significantly affected the project implementation delay. Additionally, the agreement among public utilities
including MEA, to implement the project together to reduce cost, recurrence of construction problems, as
well as traffic congestion, right of ways problems for subtransmission line construction, unintentionally
delayed the construction and sometimes reduced the subtransmission line length constructed whenever there
was any change with other utilities' projects.

8.     The overall completion of the whole project and comparison of the project scope at appraisal with
the revised and actual project scope is shown in Attachment 1. Attachment 2 provided the loading levels of
the substations built under the Project.

B. Evaluation of the Borrower's Own Performance

Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project

9.     On the whole, the performance of the borrower (MEA) was found satisfactory. Although some work
was significantly affected by the worst economic recession in the region, the project performance rating
was generally successful, albeit one year behind schedule. In other words, the implementation of expansion
activities as well as conversion of overhead lines to underground cable and SCADA projects was efficiently
managed to satisfactorily meet the increasing power demand steadily picked up since 2000 in a least cost
manner while maintaining acceptable levels of power distribution system efficiency and reliability.

10.    On the financial front, MEA recorded satisfactory financial results and fully complied with all the
Bank's financial covenants required under the Bank loan during FY 1998 - 2003 with the exception of the
SFR for FY 1999 which had been waived by the Bank considering favorable financial status of the whole
entity.

11.    During the project implementation, MEA had experienced several key lessons which would be taken
into consideration in implementing the new project. Firstly, the poor coordination with related public and
private utilities under the SCADA project, namely Telephone Organization of Thailand and Mass
Communication Organization of Thailand as well as their concessionaries, e.g., TA, UCOM, AIS and UBC
etc., was realized in removing their lines from MEA poles. Despite MEA's great effort on coordination
with mentioned utilities, not much progress had been made and MEA finally decided to deal with the


                                                    - 34 -

problems using their own workforce. Although this problem had finally been resolved at an early stage, it
certainly affected overall project implementation resulting in one-year-extension of the Project completion.

12.      Secondly, it was a lengthy delay in obtaining construction permission from public utilities. For
subtransmission line construction, the implementation had been delayed mainly due to additionally
detailed requirements to be fulfilled before obtaining permission from related utilities, namely, Bangkok
Metropolis Administration, Highway Department, Public Work Department etc.                   Despite its close
coordination with the utilities concerned, MEA still experienced certain difficulties, which were largely
attributed to the implementation delays to a certain extents. Moreover, the agreement among concerned
public utilities to implement the project together to reduce cost, recurrence of construction problems as well
as traffic congestion, right of ways problems for subtransmission line construction had considerably
affected the line construction.     The uncertainties of the other utilities' construction projects such as
highway construction not only forced MEA to delay the construction but sometimes also to reduce the line
length to be lower than planned. In addition, under the said agreement, the duct bank construction had to
be done simultaneously with relevant utilities' road construction which was well ahead of schedule. This
resulted in unforeseen obstruction for cable installation since most of the conduits had already been
filled up with sticky sand and soil consuming a lot of time and workforce in removal. A useful lesson has
been learnt to tightly seal caps at both ends of conduits ensuring that no more delay would be faced in
the coming project. In view of permission from private entities, MEA also found difficulties and delay in
arranging scheduled outages with large customers who denied any scheduled outages. As a consequence, a
delay had been realized in modifying the system to accommodate sectionalized power supply for these
groups of customers. It is worth noting that the technical arrangement on the continual power supply
should be taken into account and well planned prior to the project implementation.

13.    In regard to organization restructuring, the organization has eventually evolved throughout the
project periods. By the way, as you may know, the restructuring has not been finalized as it is dependent
on the outcomes of government policy on electricity supply industry reform and market conditions. In the
meantime, MEA is proceeding with the government policy towards corporatization and privatization
scheduled to be by March and June 2004 respectively. The restructuring of MEA has been carefully
studied and designed under the assistance of experienced consultants with the intention of building
important commercial capabilities in order to achieve a successful transition towards corporatization and
subsequent privatization. On top of that, it is worth noting that this organization restructuring must also be
flexible in responding the electricity supply industry reform to be finalized in the near future.

14.      In respect of the DSM, as the DSM capabilities was firstly introduced in MEA distribution system
for the first times, MEA had gained significant knowledge and experience in energy conservation through
its establishment of ESCO project, Ballast and Motor Testing Laboratories and Load Research while the
Load Control was agreed to be on hold should the substantial demand growth was to be materialized.
Several key lessons with the strategic and operational implications had been experienced including
marketing problem and limited numbers of skilled staff. All these major problems would be taken into
account before setting up DSM businesses in MEA.

15.    In implementing load research in distribution system, unexpected technical problems were arisen in
data collecting process which delayed the project for such a time. However, the problems arisen formed a
firm basis for load research in the future. As for the Testing Laboratory, although MEA, at initial stage,
faced some difficulties and delay involving procurement of the testing equipment, it was satisfactorily
resolved with the laboratory commencement not long after the schedule. The Ballast and Motor Testing
Laboratories have already been established providing testing services of international standard. For the last
but not least, the ESCO business, MEA undertook several useful consulting studies on ESCO feasibility


                                                     - 35 -

and ESCO Development and Training. However, putting this into practice, MEA had been faced with all
manner of problem. On the customer front, although the return on ESCO services had been recognized,
this business was still found less attractive to customers. This was mainly due to the relatively low
electricity tariff which stood in contrast to the high energy conservation equipment cost. Moreover, there
was an unfamiliarity of customers on ESCO business particularly the paying back of savings realized.
Normally, the customers were approached by suppliers for the              installation energy conservation
equipment. No cost would be charged except for the equipment cost paid once the customers were
satisfied with the results. As a result, customers may be somehow reluctant to pay for the ESCO
services.    In light of MEA itself, inadequate information/ expertise on new energy conservation
technologies particularly equipment as well as limited numbers of skilled staff rendered great effect
towards ESCO business success. The other major difficulty confronted was the marketing of ESCO
services and, in particular, closing deals.       In many cases, the customers after being approached
preferred to implement the projects on its own. Different strategies and operation had been developed
during the project period with an intention to achieve the most suitable ESCO business style with Thai
culture. All in all, the problem experienced on both testing laboratory and ESCO capabilities was identical,
that was the marketing which MEA as a monopoly public utility had no first hand experience before. And
this would be the focal point for MEA in setting up these businesses in MEA in the future. It is also worth
noting that the success of DSM capabilities in Thailand is dependent on the government support reflecting
in its policy and subsidy.

C. Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank

Bank Performance

16.      Overall, the Bank's performance from MEA's viewpoint was satisfactory. During the project
implementation, the Bank successfully maintained good working relationships with MEA. No significant
disagreements with MEA on key procurement issues severely affected the implementation procedures,
project costs and implementation schedule. Thanks to the Bank's Field Office, the implementation support
and rapid response to addressing needs were provided. With specialized knowledge and experience in
particular field covering project management, finance, organization restructuring and DSM, the Bank
missions were considered very beneficial in providing an excellent job in following up the project
implementation, giving proposed remedial courses of actions whenever confronting delays or problems,
providing constructive advice and practical recommendations on unacquainted DSM activities. Also, close
monitoring of MEA financial status, to be complied with covenant, coupled with effective remedial courses
well assisted MEA in improvement of its portfolio.         More importantly, the project leader was fully
authorized which was found key success of this project. His decisive actions taken on the overall project
implementation was considered timely, adequate and responsive pushing the project well on progress
despite a number of encountered problems.

D. Proposed Arrangements

Future Operation

17.     The future operation of the project will be closely followed up by MEA's Power System
Maintenance Department and its district offices. MEA has a very capable operation and maintenance staff
to efficiently and approximately operate and maintain its network. Comprehensive and well-documented
operation and maintenance procedures are in place to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the new
facilities. Any faulty equipment will be promptly replaced to ensure high system reliability.




                                                     - 36 -

18.    Since the project implementation commenced in FY 1996, MEA has made satisfactory improvements
in: (i) reducing energy losses from 3.83% (1996) to 3.81% (2003) (due to the unavailability of data at the
time of report preparation, this figure is then estimated to represent the total loss for 2003); (ii) increasing
reliability in terms of both SAIFI and SAIDI indices; (iii) meeting the projected electricity demand
throughout the project cycle; (iv) manpower utilization as evidenced by increasing average sales per
employee from 2.39 kWh to 3.69 kWh and by increasing number of customers per employee from 145
customers to 237 customers. These improvements reflect the more commercial nature of its operation. The
said indicators will be used to monitor our future operation of MEA.

19.      Regarding MEA Corporatization and Privatization, MEA, with the assistance of experienced
consultants in necessary fields including management, finance, legal, accounting and tax and change
management, is on schedule to register itself as the MEA Public Company Ltd. with the Ministry of
Commerce in March 2004 and to privatize itself as a whole by way of public offering in June 2004. As for
the DSM capabilities, all components covering Load Research, Ballast and Motor Testing Laboratories as
well as ESCO business will be continually implemented. As for the ESCO business, MEA has recently
signed Minutes of Understanding with Bank Thai Public Company Limited agreeing to pilot ESCO
business for a year. If the results demonstrated the effectiveness of ESCO business, close cooperation on
the ESCO business establishment will be further promoted.

Additional Annex 10. Demand Side Management (An Assessment by MEA)

Background

        In April 2002, the Cabinet passed a resolution approving the Energy Conservation Strategic Plan,
FY2002-2011. During the plan period, energy conservation will be implemented in factories/buildings and
residences, focusing on training and education. Rules, regulations and procedures on the application of the
Energy Conservation Fund (ECF) will be improved. By the next ten years, power demand will decrease by
4.21% or 1,862.8 thousand tons of equivalent raw oil /year.

        Currently, most of the energy conservation activities have been shouldered by the public sector
including government agencies and power utilities

            Ministry of Energy

        ·       Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE), an executing
                agency for the energy audits and public/private building efficiency investments as well as
                public relations and training.
        ·       Energy Policy and Planning Office, to deal with voluntary program including
                demonstrations/pilots, renewables and research and development.

        The three power utilities EGAT, MEA and PEA have mutually formulated DSM Plan FY
2002-2006, laying out the framework for DSM implementation by each.

            EGAT

        DSM Office was established within EGAT to develop, implement and evaluate energy
efficiency programs. Several programs were launched:

§       Energy Efficient Fluorescent Lamp Program, known as Thin Tube Program
§       Refrigerator Efficiency Labeling Program
§       Air Conditioner Efficiency Labeling Program
§       Commercial Building Retrofit Program, known as Green Building Program
§       High Efficiency Motor and Low Loss Ballast Program
§       Energy Efficient Street Light Program using High Pressure Sodium Vapors
§       Compact Fluorescent Lamp Program
§       Cool Storage Program
§       Pilot ESCO
§       Green Leaf
§       Brown Rice
§       Small and Medium Enterprises
§       Load Management Program through stand-by generation, interruptible load and time-of-use tariff
        schemes
§       Attitude Creation Program through public campaign Programs include a Green Learning Room in
        public school

        As of September 2001, EGAT has achieved 651 MW of peak demand savings and 3,665 GWh of
energy savings, accounting for Baht 313.8 million.

        MEA

        Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), with support of the GEF grant managed by the
World Bank has launched three major DSM programs in distribution sector including:

§       Establishment of Motor and Ballast Testing Laboratories
§       Load Research Program
§       Establishment of ESCO unit within MEA. At the beginning, MEA conducted audits of some
        government buildings. To date, MEA has commissioned ESCO projects with private sector using
        its own funds. It is now proceeding with its next step of ESCO business with financing from the
        commercial sector.

        In addition, it has implemented other projects including Power Factor Program and Double savings
double profit Program.

         PEA

Under the current plan, PEA will be responsible for:

·        Load Research Program
·        Establishment of Engineering Team for energy conservation consultancy Program
·        Energy and fuel savings Program



MEA's ESCO Program

         At the beginning of 2003, MEA developed a new strategy involving entering into a strategic
partnership with Bank Thai PLC. Limited to jointly develop programs that meet shared goals of ESCO
business. Under this partnership program, the commercial bank will extend credit directly to customers.
While the bank will develop an affordable project financing package for energy efficiency investment,
MEA will provide its expertise to convert technical energy audits conducted by third parties, mostly
equipment vendors, into a commercially-viable, investment -ready project package, suitable for Bank
financing.

         An ESCO unit of about 15 staff, established within the Electrical System Service Department, will
be responsible for - project assessment and management; equipment installation control and auditing; and
performing technical feasibility study on energy conservation, proposing energy conservation measures as
well as providing measurement and verification. Proposed financing under this project for the next five
years is as follows:

Targets for Testing Laboratory over say the next five years.

         The services will be performed by the Power Maintenance Department. The major objective of the
testing service will be to develop business marketing strategies of the testing laboratories to ensure the
laboratory's sustainability. The target for the next five years is:

Load Research

         There are 729 low voltage customers and 496 high voltage customers at the start of the beginning
of the project and MEA's first attempt would be to maintain this number. MEA would replace damaged
meter reading equipment but avoid rotating it to new samples. MEA would make use of the existing TOU
meters which also possess the load profile data and this data is also available in the PC's of the meter
reading section of all the 14 District Offices. The Load Research center would down load profile data back
to its servers using the MEA Intranet. It is expected that by 2004 onward when all the TOU meter load
profiles have been collected, there will be approximately 3,000 additional samples to the existing system
with 5% growth per year. MEA would apply the above mentioned Load Research data in its Load Research
applications.

Load Control

         To date, there exists a capacity surplus in MEA's distribution network. In respect of losses, MEA
is able to contain losses within 4%, without the load control. The TOU rate program which MEA is
supporting and which is already working well, will provide sufficient incentives to the customers to reduce
demand. MEA would, therefore, seriously consider load control after about 5 years. In the mean time
EGAT would pursue its load control activities.
