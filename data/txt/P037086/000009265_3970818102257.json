          current levels, while meeting the projected rapid increase\n            in electricity demand; (ii) assist in the organization\n            restructuring of the Metropolitan Electricity Authority\n            (MEA) leading to its commercialization and corporatization;\n            and (iii) introduce demand-side management (DSM)\n            capabilities in MEA's organization thus deepening the\n            DSM focus in the country's most rapidly growing area.\n            The components of the project are the following: 1)\n            investment component including transmission and distribution\n            substation system; transmission line systems; and\n            distribution system; 2) policy component providing for a\n            major restructuring of MEA's organization; and 3)\n            institutional development component comprising: (i) setting\n            up of an Appliance Testing Laboratory; (ii) introduction of\n            a system-wide Load Research program; (iii) implementation of\n            a load control program; (iv) establishment of an Energy\n            Service Company; and (v) technical assistance."}, "docdt":
