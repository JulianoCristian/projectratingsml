received a satisfactory outcome rating with low risk\n            to development outcome. The Bank received a highly\n            satisfactory outcome rating while the Borrower\u0092s performance\n            rating was satisfactory. There were no restructurings of\n            this project and the project components remained unchanged\n            for the life of the project. The only change that occurred\n            was a fund reallocation from Component 1 subcomponent for\n            financing of health care services for drugs and vaccines.\n            There were several lessons gained from this project and\n            include the following: (1) Simplicity of operation through\n            existing delivery mechanisms for existing services which\n            allowed for quick preparation and implementation. (2)\n            Flexibility of financial response through the inherent\n            flexibility of the newly introduced OP 10.00 helped expedite\n            preparation and the World Bank\u0092s overall ability to respond\n            with speed to an urgent need. (3) The financial managment\n            approach was streamlined and based on more simplified ex\n            ante requirements, while relying more heavily on ex post\n            requirements as additional fiduciary controls and review\n            which allowed for timely disbursements. (4) Flexibility in\n            the design mechanism which provided for disbursements\n            against payments for expenditures allowed for the project\n            design to remain relevant and be responsive to any changes\n            during implementation in policies towards health and basic\n            social needs coverage and expenditures. (5) Retroactive\n            financing for a substantial amount of 40 percent was key to\n            the success of the emergency operation. (6) Temporary\n            time-bound support in emergency situations to help meet\n            essential household needs. These pro-poor interventions\n            through subsidies and price controls can help mitigate the\n            potential for social instability. (7) A strong relationship\n            between the Bank and the government on the ground allowed\n            for a rapid response. (8) The smooth coordination between\n            the different units within the World Bank was outstanding\n            and significantly contributed to the timely project\n            preparation and as well the smooth implementation."}, "docdt": "2015-01-21T00:00:00Z"}
