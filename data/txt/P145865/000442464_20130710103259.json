{"cdata!": "The objective of the Emergency Project\n            to Assist Jordan Partially Mitigate Impact of Syrian\n            Conflict for Jordan is to help the Borrower maintain access\n            to essential healthcare services and basic household needs\n            for the Jordanian population affected by the large and\n            increasing influx of Syrian refugees. The project has three\n            components. The first component is maintaining access to\n            essential healthcare services. This component aims to\n            sustain the provision of essential healthcare services to\n            the Jordanian population which is at risk due to the stress\n            on resources resulting from the large influx of Syrian\n            refugees. It has following two sub-components: (i) provision\n            of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure adequate and\n            continuous supply at all public healthcare facilities; and\n            (ii) financing of healthcare services for Jordanians in non-\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) health facilities. The second\n            component is supporting household basic needs. The objective\n            of this component is to help the Government of Jordan (GOJ)\n            ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic household\n            commodities for poor and lower middle class households. The\n            two subsidized products financed under this component are\n            bread (wheat) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders.\n            The third component is project monitoring, auditing, and\n            verification. This component will finance: (i) the costs of\n            two special purpose audits as required for component one;\n            and (ii) the cost of an external auditor, acceptable to the\n            World Bank, who will be appointed to audit the project\n            financial statements covering the Project's 12 months\n            lifetime and for both components one and two."}, "docdt": "2013-07-03T00:00:00Z"}
