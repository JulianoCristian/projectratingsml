Five lessons stand out in the experience with\n            the Bridge Rehabilitation Project (BRP). First, in an\n            untested situation and intrinsically uncertain projects, the\n            use of pilots for the first batch of design and construction\n            contracts was essential to identify the barriers of\n            high-quality and cost-effective investments, thus speeding\n            up all the subsequent batches. Second, a corollary to the\n            first, is that the use of bilateral grant funding for the\n            pilot design studies permitted an early start of these,\n            without waiting for loan effectiveness. In the BRP, this\n            took the sting out of the wait from negotiations and\n            effectiveness. It also helped that ironing out of the early\n            problems with designs. Third, the insistence on getting\n            high-quality designs before tendering the works resulted in\n            a much better cost experience for risk-laden bridge\n            rehabilitation than with a comparatively simpler road\n            rehabilitation works funded under the Russia Highway\n            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (HRMP). Fourth,\n            passing from an implementation experience with relaxed\n            procurement rules, introduced under critical circumstances,\n            to a more rigorous regime, warranted a major, formal,\n            visible effort of communicating with the Borrower, perhaps a\n            relaunch. Fifth, in a project with geographically dispersed\n            operations such as the BRP, there were crucial trade-offs\n            between centralized and locally-based arrangements for\n            project management. Resolving the tension between high\n            implementation efficiency (especially as concerns the\n            Bank's supervision costs) and longer-term development\n            effectiveness early in the project may have made a\n            significant difference later on as the pendulum dangled\n            between the survival and cancellation of the\n            federal/regional component."}, "docdt": "2004-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
