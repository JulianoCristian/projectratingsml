MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO RUSSIAN FEDERATION
FOR A BRIDGE REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Russian Federation for the equivalent of US$350 million to help finance a project for rehabilitation
of bridges. The loan would be at the World Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
seventeen years, including five years of grace. US$50 million of the proceeds of the Bank loan will be
onlent to Moscow City and a total of US$35 million will be onlent to up to five oblasts through subsidiary
loan agreements at an interest rate 150-250 basis points above the primary Bank loan interest rate, a
repayment period of 12-15 years and a grace period of 3-5 years. Moscow City and the borrowing oblasts
will assume the foreign exchange risk.
2.    Country/Sector Background. The Bank carried out a transport sector strategy review in 1993.
One of the strategies recommended relates to the allocation of funds to high priority investments within
the transport sector. Given current economic conditions and trends, the preservation of existing transport
capabilities is considered to be the highest priority. More specifically, road and bridge rehabilitation and
maintenance has a high priority due to the insufficiency of such works during the recent past as a result
of inadequate funding. The anticipated sharp increases in road traffic in the years just ahead strengthen
the case for this emphasis. While there is a lack of funds for railways, ports, airlines and other forms of
transport, the rehabilitation of roads and bridges is particularly justified. Through the strengthening of
the federal road system, a more rational and economically efficient transport system will be developed.
In view of the poor condition of many bridges on the federal road network and the projected increase in
traffic volumes and axle loads, a program of bridge rehabilitation and reconstruction should be undertaken
over the next ten years.
3.    A second important strategic consideration in the sector concerns the need to develop a market-
based competitive contracting industry and the related need for changes in Governmental institutions that
deal with the evolving industry. While a beginning has been made in this regard through the Highway
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (HRMP, Loan 3706 RU), the tasks are formidable and
undoubtedly major efforts will be required over a period of years to obtain significant results. During this
transition period, the Bank intends to provide substantial technical assistance and training to facilitate the
important changes. The efforts begun under HRMP will continue under the proposed project.
4.    The federal road system has appropriately received priority attention in the Bank's strategy for
strengthening the transport system of Russia; these roads are the most vital road links in the country.
Under the Bank's first project in the sector, a relatively small amount of funds is also available for
rehabilitation and maintenance of some regional roads through a program of assistance from the Federal
Highway Department (FHD). Since the regions now have a considerable degree of autonomy and
responsibility for roads under the new decentralized system of Government, it seems timely that under
the proposed project the Bank provide assistance to up to five regions on a pilot basis. The inclusion of
a region in the project would involve on-lending from the federal Government to the regional
Government. Factors under consideration in selecting a region include: (i) the physical condition of the
roads and bridges; (ii) economic importance of the region; (iii) relatively high road traffic levels by
regional standards; (iv) commitment to reform of road administration and a separation of administrative
functions and the execution of works; (v) commitment to development of the private contracting industry;
(vi) the number and nature of other Bank-financed projects in the region; and (vii) financial condition of
the region and willingness to borrow for the project and bear the foreign exchange risk.



-2 -
5.    Numerous major bridges on the federal road system are in poor or emergency condition and
consequently are in need of reconstruction, rehabilitation or repair. Many of them were built in the 1950s
and 1960s and the quality of construction was generally poor. Others are reaching the end of their design
lives. A considerable proportion of the bridges are narrower than the roads linked to them and some may
warrant widening to facilitate the flow of traffic and reduce safety hazards; however, the highest priority
need is to repair and rehabilitate bridges in poor condition and prevent the further deterioration of bridges
in fair condition. Load restrictions on bridges where there is danger of collapse would require, in many
cases, the diversion of heavy traffic to lengthy, and thus costly, alternative routes because of the sparse
road network in Russia. Major bridge works were not included in the HRMP which emphasized
rehabilitation and maintenance of roads. Bridges on regional roads are generally as much in need of
remedial works as bridges on federal roads.
6.    Project Objectives. The project would contribute to the preservation of the Russian road network
through a program of bridge rehabilitation, replacement and maintenance. The principal objectives of the
proposed project are to: (i) improve the condition of selected high priority bridges on the federal and
regional road systems and of a few interchanges with high traffic levels on federal highways; (ii) assist
in reform of the institutional structure of road administration and the contracting industry, and further
the use of competitive bidding; (iii) strengthen the capabilities of the FHD to manage the bridges under
its jurisdiction; (iv) reduce a backlog of bridge rehabilitation and maintenance on regional roads for up
to five participating regions, namely Kirov, Leningrad, Novgorod, Tver and Vologda Oblasts and
Moscow City; and (v) improve the administrative, technical, and financial relationships of FHD and the
regions of the Russian Federation.
7.    Project Description. A Bridge Rehabilitation Loan of $350 million will help finance a four year
program of urgently needed bridge works on federal roads, to be procured under international competitive
bidding. The loan may also finance regional bridge rehabilitation and maintenance works in selected
regions. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$466 million equivalent, including a government
contribution of US$116 million. The main components of the project (and estimated costs) are: (i) Bridge
Works on Federal and Regional Roads (US$415 million); (ii) Bridge Management Equipment (US$19.6
million); and (iii) Design of Works, Works Supervision, Technical Assistance and Training (US$31.4
million). The main components of the project are:
a)    Bridge Works. The project will finance rehabilitation, repair, reconstruction,
replacement, and widening of about 200-300 high priority federal and regional bridges
and the improvement of 2-3 interchanges on the federal highways including grade
separation. Only if found to be among the highest priority projects, would interchange
improvements be included in the project.
b)    Bridge Management Equipment. This component will finance vehicles, equipment,
materials and supplies as an aid for better management of bridges.
c)    Technical Assistance, Design and Supervision of Works and Thining. This would
include assistance to the Project Implementation Units (PIUs) and FHD, design of bridge
works and supervision of such works, specialized consultants, and training of federal and
regional road and bridge staff. This component would continue and expand the
institution-building activities financed under the on-going HRMP, including the
improvement of the FHD bridge management system and improvement of the
administrative, technical, and fnancial relationship of FHD and the regions of the
Russian Federation.



8.    Project Implementahon. The federal component of the project will be implemented by the FHD,
and the oblast components will be implemented by the Road Administrations of the selected regions with
the assistance of, and under the general coordination of the FHD. The Moscow City component will be
carried out by the City. The Project Implementation Unit organized to implement the HRMP, Dorinvest,
has been directed by FHD to also implement the federal portion of the proposed project. It will provide
sample letters of invitation, sample bidding documents, sample bidding evaluation report and similar
materials to the respective regional and Moscow city PIUs and is expected to informally respond to their
queries.
9.    FHD, the participating regions, and Moscow City, will select the consultants responsible for the
preparation of bid documents, contractor qualifications and bid evaluation, and site supervision. FHD will
implement the project using the PIU established for the HRMP, Dorinvest. This unit has functioned well
and has the experience to both implement the FHD bridge component and assist the PIU's of the selected
regions and Moscow City. The regional PIUs will review design and bid documents, issue the invitation
to bids, receive the bids and evaluate the results. Contracts will be signed by the regional authorities, and
payments will be made by the regional PIUs.
10.   Under HRMP financing, qualified consultants, selected by FHD following Bank procedures,
carried out a feasibility study for bridges to be considered for the project. Bilaterally funded on grant
basis, Finnish and Norwegian consultants are designing rehabilitation works for three priority bridges
included in the feasibility study so that works can begin in the 1996 construction season. Additionally,
works are expected to start in 1996 on several bridges out of a set of 21 currently being designed under
HRMP financing.
11.   Project Sustainability. The project would enhance the capacity of federal and regional highway
agencies to plan, finance and implement bridge rehabilitation and maintenance and therefore ensure
sustainability by: (i) enhancing resource mobilization; (ii) increasing the efficiency of construction and
maintenance through improved design and supervision of bridge works, and improvement of the bridge
management system; and (iii) use of local contractors for rehabilitation and maintenance. The project is
the second step in carrying out the strategy for Bank assistance to the highway subsector in Russia.
12.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. Lessons learned from the Highway
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Loan and other ongoing loans in Russia highlight the importance of: (i)
identifying a committed counterpart team with sufficient authority to move the project forward; (ii)
coordinating among key interested parties at the technical and central levels on critical or controversial
project issues; (iii) early detailed attention to procurement and other implementation issues, particularly
in view of the short construction season in Russia; (iv) involving local consultants and institutes in the
process; and (v) carrying out a pilot component in the first project year. The Bridge Rehabilitation Project
will benefit from the experience of Dorinvest, the project implementation unit for the HRMP, since
Dorinvest will be responsible for the implementation of the federal component of the project and will
assist the participating regions to implement their component. The design of the project has taken account
of the above lessons through detailed plans for procurement and implementation of the project,
involvement of the oblasts and the City of Moscow in the preparation of the project and the use of local
consultants to carry out the bridge feasibility study.
13.   The Bank's experience in highway projects in other countries and in Russia with the ongoing
Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project shows that a key to successful implementation of a
project is a concerted effort to ensure that all stakeholders are involved in the project from the outset.
A series of action-planning workshops will therefore be organized and conducted by FHD staff, Bank
staff and specialized consultants. The purpose of the workshops will be twofold: (i) to develop and review



- 4 -
responsible and attainable action plans for project implementation, and (ii) develop project planning and
design and strategic management skills within the highway sector and monitor project implementation.
Experience gained by FHD and Dorinvest in the HRMP launch workshop will be beneficial for the
Project Launch Workshop.
14.   Relation to the Country Assistance Strategy. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was
discussed by the Board on June 6, 1995; a CAS Progress Report will be submitted to the Board shortly.
Since the last CAS, the Bank has continued to operate under an Intermediate Case scenario, which
remains broadly appropriate in the current environment. This scenario assumes that there will be
continued progress in macroeconomic stabilization, as evidenced by the recent agreement with the IMF
on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. In this situation, the Bank would aim to provide around
$1.2-1.5 billion annually in investment lending, including a 'core' program of relatively straightforward
projects in infrastructure and the social sectors such as the proposed Bridge Rehabilitation Project. In
addition, the Bank would be willing to provide up to $1.5 billion annually in relatively fast-disbursing
assistance if substantial progress was achieved on key structural reforms in specific areas of the economy,
such as agriculture and the social sectors, that are critical to the long-term sustainability of the
stabilization process. Over the past year, the Bank has been working with the Government, both within
the framework of the EFF negotiations and in separate discussions, to develop a consensus on specific
programs of structural reforms that would allow these latter operations to move forward. In the
meantime, the Bank has continued to prepare 6-7 priority investment projects as the basis for a sustained
program of Bank support for the Russian economy over the medium term.
15.   The proposed operation is fully consistent with the CAS described above. In particular, the
project would build on the relatively successful record of project implementation established under the
Highway Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project. By focusing on rehabilitation of critical infrastructure,
the project is contributing to a more rational use of scarce public resources in a constrained budgetary
situation. The Bank's involvement in the highway subsector of Russia will help support FHD in its efforts
to reduce the maintenance backlog, continue the introduction of competitive bidding, improve institutional
capacity, improve the financing of bridges and roads, and develop a legal, policy, and institutional
framework for the transport sector. The experience gained from foreign contractors and consultants will
help foster development of a local road and construction and consulting industry among competitive lines.
In addition, the exposure to more advanced bridge technologies and equipment, and close supervision of
bridge works contracts will help local contractors improve the quality of road construction and the
efficiency of operations.
16.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Borrower agreed on the following as conditions of the
Loan Agreement: (i) implementation of an agreed Action Plan; (ii) by December 31, 1996, discuss with
the Bank the recommendations of the road financing study carried out under the HRIvLP and, thereafter,
take measures for improving the road financing system for federal and regional roads; (iii) in consultation
with the Bank and in accordance with selection criteria and schedule acceptable to the Bank, select the
region or regions for participation in the Project from the following five subjects of the Russian
Federation: Tver region, Vologda region, Leningrad region, Kirov region, and Novgorod region; (iv)
select the federal bridges and interchanges to be included in the project in accordance with the
methodology and criteria agreed with the Bank; (v) onlend US$35 million to the participating regions and
US$50 million to Moscow City, through Subsidiary Loan Agreements, at an interest rate 150-250 basis
points above the primary Bank loan interest rate, a repayment period of 12-15 years and a grace period
of 3-5 years. Government will submit a draft subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank; (vi)
FHD will maintain and strengthen the Project Implementation Unit (Dorinvest), established under the
HRMP as the Unit responsible for implementing the federal component of the project. During
negotiations, the Borrower agreed, under the Participating Regions and Moscow City Subsidiary Loan



Agreements, to cause each of the participating regions, inter alia, to: (i) within one month of the date of
effectiveness of the relevant Participating Regions and Moscow City Subsidiary Loan Agreements, assign
to its respective regional PIU on a full-time basis at least the following: (a) a project manager; (b) a
bridge engineer; and (c) a bilingual secretary; (ii) within two months of the date of effectiveness of the
relevant Participating Regions and Moscow City Subsidiary Loan Agreements, engage consultants, under
Terms of Reference satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, for strengthening the capacity of its
regional PIU; and (iii) enter into subsidiary loan agreements, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, with the Borrower. During negotiations, agreement was reached that, as condition of effectiveness,
FHD will open a Project Account with an initial deposit in local currency of at least US$500,000
equivalent. During negotiations, agreement was reached that disbursements for expenditures incurred by
any project entity are conditional upon effectiveness of the respective Subsidiary Loan Agreement.
17.   Enviromnental Aspects. The project has a B rating since it is not expected to have any significant
negative environmental impact. Most bridge rehabilitation and reconstruction works should not have
serious environmental effects. No immediate changes in land use, river bed flows, fisheries habitats,
settlement patterns or other socioeconomic factors should occur in routine projects. All civil works will
be carried out within existing rights of way and involve no land acquisition. Because the civil works
comprise rehabilitation, reconstruction and repair of bridges, earthwork effects on slope and erosion will
be minimal. In general, the existing standards and environmental regulations are adequate provided they
are adhered to during project implementation. Normal concerns during bridge works such as adequate
drainage, erosion prevention, vegetation rehabilitation, and air and water pollution are covered by design
criteria, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) requirements and other environmental regulations.
18.   Program Objective Categories. The project supports several aspects of the Bank's program
objectives, which include: assisting in reform of the institutional structure of road administration and the
contracting industry, and furthering the use of competitive bidding; improving road safety; and reducing
environmental pollution.
19.   Participatory Approach. FHD, local consultants and Ministry of Transport (MOT) officials from
the sector have been guiding preparation of the project since its inception, including the process for
selection of participating regions. The regions are committed to the reform process, including adoption
of competitive bidding for bridge works. The participation of FHD, the regions and MOT officials is
expected to continue during implementation through periodic workshops and project mid-term review.
20.   Project Benefis. The economic evaluation of bridges compares a "do nothing" strategy with
various alternatives, including rehabilitation, reconstruction, widening, and replacement of bridges.
Benefits of the different strategies include cost savings from slowing down the rate of deterioration of
bridges, accident savings resulting from widening bridges that are more narrow than the approach road,
and time and vehicle operating cost savings resulting from (i) the lifting of weight control restrictions on
bridges, (ii) increased speed of traffic on bridges that have been widened, and (iii) avoiding diverting
heavy vehicles when bridges fail. Other benefits will be reduction of pollution, institutional strengthening
and the amelioration of social problems through employment generation. The project will also contribute
to human resources development, particularly in bridge management and technology, and assist in the
development of a private bridge consulting and contracting industry. The total NPV for the federal bridge
component is estimated at US$187 million and individual bridges have internal economic rates of return
from 12-87 percent.
21.   Risks. A risk associated with the project is the possibility that sufficient local financing, whether
from road funds or other sources, will not be available as needed. Raising road user charges to generate
more funds would be politically very difficult at this stage given current economic conditions and political



- 6 -
tensions, although funding should increase with rising domestic fuel prices. At 1994 funding levels for
the highway subsector, an average of 3.9 % of the federal road budget would be required for counterpart
funds for the Highway Rehabilitation and Bridge Rehabilitation Projects over the next four years. For
Tver, counterpart funds required for the Bridge Rehabilitation Project would average 1.5% of 1994
budgeted funds, for Vologda 2.5% and for Moscow City 4.3 %. Therefore, the projects do not represent
a significant drain on local highway resources.
22.   Another risk of the project is that the development of the local competitive industry for bridge
works may prove slow and difficult, thus delaying completion of the bridge works since international
contractors competing under ICB require strong local partners for the establishment of joint ventures. The
institutional changes or reforms required, both in FHD and regional road administrations and in the
industry, are far reaching and their realization may take much time and therefore cause delays in project
implementation. However, under the HRMP, a variety of actions have been taken to minimize this risk,
such as training programs in contract administration for FHD staff and training assistance to contractors,
and many joint ventures have been established to bid for highway rehabilitation works. To cope with the
difficulties arising during this transitional period, the project will include adequate funding for consultants
to provide FHD and the participating regions with expert advice on procurement and contract
management.
23.   Higher than estimated costs for bridge works on federal and regional roads is another risk of the
project. The experience gained under the ongoing HRMP has provided some relevant information about
costs, making the current cost estimates relatively more reliable. However, if costs do increase, then there
will be (i) a lower number of bridges included in the projects; and (ii) a change in the strategy for some
bridges following economic reevaluation in favor of lower cost strategies.
24.   Other risks include: (i) implementation delays due to slow procurement. This risk will be
minimized by a detailed procurement plan prepared for the project. Also, a large part of the project will
be implemented by an existing PIU established under the HRMP. The PIU has already demonstrated its
capacity and the project will be able to build on the PIU's successful procurement experience under the
HRMP; and (ii) delays in signing subsidiary loan agreements, although the Ministry of Finance is already
working on a draft for Moscow City and the participating regions. The major component of the project,
federal road bridge works, would not be affected by any delays in the signing of these agreements since
there is no onlending to FHD.
25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
