"The proposed project would finance a\n            broad range of medium- and medium- to large-scale\n            industries, essentially in the private sector.  The\n            subprojects will be selected and appraised by the\n            participating financial institutions (PFIs).  Broad criteria\n            for project selection have been agreed with the PFIs.\n            Projects in manufacturing, transportation, tourism and\n            commercial agriculture would be eligible.  Economically\n            justified import substituting and export promoting projects\n            will be emphasized.  It is expected that the proposed loan\n            would finance about 50-60 projects, mostly in the\n            manufacturing sector, resulting in total investments of\n            about US$250 million.  The estimated 50-60 subprojects would\n            generate jobs and produce a wide range of products for\n            import substitution as well as for exports.  A major benefit\n            from the proposed project would be the opportunity for the\n            Bank to work closely with two additional development banks\n            on the refocussing of their lending strategies and on\n            upgrading their institutional efficiency."}, "docdt": "1986-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
