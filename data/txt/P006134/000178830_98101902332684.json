project is to\n            assist the Fund to develop into an efficient mineral\n            exploration financing institution which would foster mineral\n            exploration in Bolivia and thus facilitate (i) the expansion\n            of mineral production and exports and (ii) reductions in\n            mining costs. The project would comprise the Fund's\n            1979-82 operations program, and technical assistance to the\n            Fund. The credit would finance the services of consultants\n            and contractors, and the acquisition of equipment. The major\n            risk faced by the project is that not sufficient demand for\n            Fund financing would develop, or that the deposits\n            identified might not be expeditiously developed, because\n            financial return may not be perceived as adequate by the\n            mine owners at the time."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
