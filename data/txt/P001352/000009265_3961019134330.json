The project achieved most of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            modest, sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, the Kenyan\n            experience demonstrates the critical importance of\n            macroeconomic stability, particularly fiscal restraint, to\n            the success of export promotion. Second, private sector\n            confidence is also crucial for investment. However, the\n            Kenyan Government did not inspire such confidence because it\n            failed to follow a consistent set of macroeconomic and\n            financial policies compatible with the goal of trade\n            promotion. The Government's willingness and ability to\n            control the budget deficit and prevent further appreciation\n            of the exchange rate will be the keys to future investment\n            and export growth. Third, careful design contributed to the\n            ability of the KEAS component to focus on its very specific\n            goal, to provide support services to new and emerging\n            exporters. Reliance on private sector management ensured\n            that the scheme would not be used to further unrelated\n            Government objectives. The use of a cost-sharing arrangement\n            ensured that the beneficiary enterprises would share the\n            scheme's goals. Finally, the limited time frame for the\n            scheme prevented firms from becoming dependent on its support."}, "docdt": "1995-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
