The policy reforms include\n            import liberalization and tariff reform, improved access for\n            exporters to inputs at international prices, and appropriate\n            exchange rate management. These measures will be\n            supplemented by changes in trade and enterprise regulations.\n            The investment and technical assistance components are\n            closely-integrated with the policy reforms, and are designed\n            to make them more effective and sustainable by accelerating\n            the export supply response and drawing small and medium\n            firms into the export effort. The investment component will\n            finance the construction of the first phase of an export\n            processing zone at Athi River near Nairobi, as well as the\n            upgrading of equipment for air cargo handling at Jomo\n            Kenyatta International Airport. The technical assistance\n            component finances the provision of consultancy services to\n            exporters and funds studies to help design the next phase of\n            the government's export development program."}, "docdt": "1990-11-21T00:00:00Z"}
