The request was submitted by the\n            friends of Nairobi National Park (FoNNP). The request states\n            that an export processing zone (EPZ) 'located in Athi\n            River, Nairobi, Kenya, was funded by the World Bank sometime\n            in 1994' without any stakeholder consultation. It\n            alleges that this EPZ contributed to the creation of\n            environmental and social conflicts, depleted water\n            resources, led to irregular electricity supply and abandoned\n            manufacturing operations. It further claims that 'the\n            EPZ lies waste after crippling and helping to destroy the\n            Kitengela wildlife ecosystem' and that 'local\n            communities are becoming increasingly hostile over\n            government plans to urbanize marginal lands'. Under the\n            eligibility criteria, the panel may not investigate projects\n            for which the loan has been closed or more than 95 percent\n            disbursed. Because the project closed on June 30, 1995, the\n            panel is not registering the request in the panel's\n            register, and is advising the Requester of this decision. In\n            making this determination, the panel notes the many\n            significant concerns stated by the Requesters and has\n            forwarded the request to management for its consideration."}, "docdt": "2009-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
