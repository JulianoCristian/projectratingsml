"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Export Development\n            Project (EDP) for Kenya was marginally satisfactory. The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, institutional\n            development was negligible, sustainability is uncertain, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was marginally\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, The EDP suffered significantly from high\n            turnover among task managers, resulting in inconsistent\n            supervision. It is clear that successive task managers were\n            unaware of the status of key components of the project and\n            unsure of what actions they should be taking to keep the\n            project on track. An established hand-over procedure,\n            including a detailed memo outlining the current status of\n            each element of the project and necessary future actions,\n            might mitigate this type of problem in the future. Second,\n            the experience with pre-shipment export finance in Kenya\n            should not be cause to reject similar programs elsewhere,\n            but should be viewed as an example of how an otherwise sound\n            program can be abused in the absence of adequate oversight\n            by both the Borrower and Bank. Finally, the GOK must\n            continue to improve the transparency and consistency of its\n            implementation of economic reform to achieve credibility in\n            the eyes of private entrepreneurs."}, "docdt": "1995-01-20T00:00:00Z"}
