Mlajor Project Components: (presents description of project components)
The project will assist the Government of Bulgaria to finance the clean-up of critical environrmental hazards resulting from
past operations at MDK Copper Smelter Complex (MDK), one of the most polluting industrial enterpises in Bulgaria. The
project consists of the following components:
(i) Emergency clean-up of immediate environmental hazards
This component would focus on a lagoon which has been used to store semi-liquid wastes from the smelter and is, thus,
heavily contaminated with arsenic and other heavy metals. The lagoon is both full and leaking, and there are concems
about its stability. An accident would cause the wastes in the lagoon discharge into rivers that flow directly into the
Topolnitsa reservoir which serves as the main source of drinking water for Plovdiv and other large towns in the Maritsa
valley. This component would (i) ensure temporary stabilization of the dam to prevent accidents; (ii) provide a fmal
pollution to the old settling pond; and (iii) establish a safe process waste storage facility.
(ii) Clean-up of critical past environmental damage
This component of the project would address a range of environmental problems caused by past operations of the plant to
mitigate threats to the health of workers and populations surrounding the plant, and the contamination of groundwater. It
will focus on (i) ameliorating the slag tailings; (ii) reinforcing the residue storage area; (iii) disposing solid waste and soil
contaminated by historic operations; (iv) closing the old slag dump; (v) covering all excavated areas, slag tailings, slag
dump and slime pond to prevent erosion and dust emission.
(iii) Technical assistance and training
This component would build local capacity by providing technical assistance and training to staff within and outside the
Ministry of Environment in (i) carrying out environmental assessment and audits, (ii) preparing assessments of past
environmental damage and environmental management plans; and (iii) evaluating the environmental aspects of investment
plans and bids for the purchase of state-owned industrial enterprises with significant environmental liabilities.
Major Environmental Issues: (describes major environmental issues identified or suspected in project)
The project has been designed to implement the recommendations of an environmental impact assessment to mitigate
critical environmental hazards and to clean-up toxic contamination caused by past operations of the plant. Therefore, the
project is expected to result in serious environmental benefits.
Other Environmental Issues: (describes environmental issues of lesser scope associated with project)
The project facilitates the privatization of MDK by reducing uncertainties about past environmental liabilities. The
privatization of the enterprise is expected to generate further environmental benefits due to improved management;
process changes; and investments in cleaner production and pollution abatement.
Proposed Actions: (describes actions proposed to mitigate environmental issues described in project)
See project description above.
Justification/Rationalefor Environmental Category: (reasons for env. category selected & explanation of any changes from initial
classification)
MDK is one of the largest environmental liabilities of the GOB. The risks of contamination and threat to human health
associated with past operations of the enterprise affect large areas beyond the site of the plant. Solutions to these problems
have to be carefully assessed in terms of their feasibility and expected impacts on mitigating damage.
Status of Category A Environmental Assessment: (presents EA start-up date, EA first draft, and current status)



A full EA has been submitted to the Bank and reviewed by the Environment Sector Unit. Additionally, an international
expert was hired to provide independent evaluation of the EA, the environmental damage mitigation plan, and estimated
costs on behalf of the GOB.
Remarks: (gives status of any other environmental studies, lists local groups and local NGOs consulted, tells whether borrower has
given permnission to release EA, etc)
The EA has built on several previous environmental studies, assessments and an audit of MDK. The GOB has agreed to a
timetable to review, publicly release and discuss results of the EA. The non-technical summary of the EA was made
publicly available in Bulgaria in July, and a meeting for public consultation with NGOs and local communities has been
scheduled for September 8, 1997 in Pirdop municipality. The full EA is currently under review by the Bulgarian Expert
Council on Environmental Assessments.

chimney will be specified later by the end of 1998.
7. The results of the water and air monitoring should be sent to the Regional
Inspectorate of Environment and Water Resources (RIEWR) in Sofia on a monthly basis.
