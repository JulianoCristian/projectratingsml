Ratings for the\n            Environmental and Privatization Support Adjustment Loan\n            (EPSAL) Project for Bulgaria are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: a development policy loan supporting\n            privatization with environmental remediation should include\n            strong measures by the Government to monitor and reward\n            compliance (or punish non-compliance) to ensure that\n            remediation and compliance plans are completed on schedule.\n            In the EPSAL, even though all of the policy conditions were\n            met and the remediation plan's (RPs) were signed, the\n            achievements in terms of implementation of the plans, along\n            with their environmental results, were mixed. Even in\n            well-prepared environmental impact assessments (EIAs), it is\n            difficult to include sufficient detail in the technical\n            specifications of remediation investments. Modifications in\n            design and re-negotiations during implementation should be\n            anticipated, and possibly reflected in a longer project\n            implementation period and higher than normal contingency\n            funds. Even when the state assumes responsibility for\n            remediating past environmental damages of state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs), setting a cap on the state's\n            liability creates risk for potential investors and delays\n            during re-negotiations. The possibility of letting the state\n            assume more of the risk for additional remediation costs\n            should be considered."}, "docdt": "2009-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
