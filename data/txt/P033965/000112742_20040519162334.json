Negative impacts and mitigations\n            are listed here: (1) Operate the smelter with a consistent\n            throughput of higher grade copper concentrate to reduce\n            sulfur dioxide emissions, low-level fugitive emissions, and\n            dust. At the same time modify or replace gas cleaning\n            equipment. (2) Reduce treated drainage water and runoff plus\n            water from the slag treatment process by (a) modifying the\n            existing neutralization plant; (a) installing more equipment\n            to produce a solid residue to be deposited safely in lined\n            trenches; (c) later upgrading the plant to a double stage\n            treatment process employing the best technique for treating\n            effluents; and (d) finally, optimizing the smelter operation\n            to reduce the volume of acidic effluent requiring treatment.\n            (3) Wastewater treatment sludge will be stored in a suitably\n            designed lagoon; the fayalite tailings pond, from which dust\n            emissions are blown, will be doubly protected with plastic\n            and a thick soil cover; an old slag dump will be covered to\n            prevent contaminating the sub-surface; and the variety of\n            waste materials, disused equipment, and derelict structures\n            contributing to ground and groundwater contamination will be\n            deposited in the slime pond."}, "docdt": "1997-08-05T00:00:00Z"}
