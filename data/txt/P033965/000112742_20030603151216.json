Project sustainability is\n            highly likely, with satisfactory performances by both the\n            Bank and the Borrower.  The project achieved the objective\n            of reducing environmental hazards caused by past pollution\n            and unsafe environmental management practices at MDK Copper\n            Smelter, improving the plant's environmental\n            performance and facilitating private investments in the\n            company.  All elements of the emergency remediation program\n            were successfully concluded in advance of project closure.\n            A minor factor which affected the implementation schedule\n            was the inability to carry out construction works during\n            cold winter months.  Overall, the government's\n            commitment, at the highest levels, to reforms contributed to\n            the project success.  The project was a pilot and yielded\n            many lessons, among them the critical importance of (a)\n            having the government's commitment, at the highest\n            levels, to reforms and in particular environmental\n            remediation; (b) an effective communication strategy to\n            garner buy-in and support from the public; and (c)\n            maintaining continuity of a highly skilled and committed\n            project management team throughout implementation."}, "docdt": "2003-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
