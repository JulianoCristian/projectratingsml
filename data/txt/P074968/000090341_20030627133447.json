the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and the borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            lessons learned indicate that it is better to proceed with a\n            credit to support an ongoing reform program, rather than\n            wait for elections to be held and the aftermath to be\n            resolved. The broader programs that include a wide range of\n            specific actions are important to empowering reformers\n            against reform resistance. If a program design is less\n            comprehensive with a view to focusing reform efforts on a\n            restricted, priority agenda, then many important changes may\n            be left out and, later, fall through the cracks. The Bank\n            may support a very broad program and represent that program\n            in the policy matrix, but may concentrate its energies on a\n            smaller core program. The core of SAC2 was the\n            privatization, oil and gas, power and financial sector\n            reforms, and overhaul of the CBR. A multi-tranche operation\n            would probably not have been advisable, nor effective\n            against backsliding, in the context of a country with a weak\n            implementation track record such as that of Pakistan. With\n            the upcoming elections, a multi-tranche operation might have\n            made more sense as an incentive to keep up reform momentum.\n            However, with Pakistan's checkered implementation\n            record, it was the smarter move for the Bank to lend on the\n            basis of \"track record\" (i.e., already completed\n            conditions), as opposed to commitments to carry out reforms\n            in the future. A \"homegrown\" program is desirable,\n            but places a greater burden on the donor (the Bank) to\n            verify assumptions on which the program is based."}, "docdt": "2003-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
