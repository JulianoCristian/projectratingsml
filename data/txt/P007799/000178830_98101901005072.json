is\n            designed to support the development of about 570 cattle\n            enterprises of five different types consisting of: (1) 50\n            small dairy farms with intensive production systems; (2) 300\n            beef/dairy ranches with extensive production techniques; (3)\n            200 breeding/fattening ranches emphasizing better livestock\n            herd management practices; (4) 10 breeding/fattening ranches\n            covering asentamientos; and (5) 10 purebred breeding centers\n            for upgrading the national herd. Investments would be in\n            pasture development, fencing, purchase of livestock,\n            facilities for better management of livestock, technical and\n            consultant services. The project will also include a\n            feasibility study for livestock development on the Atlantic coast."}, "docdt": "1973-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
