EXECunIVE SUMMARY
The World Bank-Liaoning Environment Project No. 2 (LEPI1) consists of a number
of individual subprojects to improve environmental quality in the province. The projects
proposed and summarized in this summary environmental assessment report will improve
surface and groundwater quality and air quality, and will enhance the water supply for potable
and industrial use.
The LEPH consists of nine components:
1.   City of Anshan wastewater treatment and recovery;
2.   City of Benxi wastewater treament;
3.   City of Fushun wastewater treatment;
4.   Smoke-dust control at the DISC Nos. 1, 2, and 4 coke ovens;
5.   Dry electrostatic precipitator installation at the BISC No. 1 and
No. 2 blast furnaces;
6.   Transmission pipeline and heat exchange stations for the Beuxi
ceral heating system;
7.   City of Dalian Malan River wastewater treatment plant and
Chunliu wastewater treatment plant improvement;
S.   City of Dalian solid waste project; and
9.   City of Jinzhou water supplylJincheng Paper Mill water pollution

The component located in the City of Anshan consists of the proposed construction
and operation of a wastewater treatment plant at the confluence of two tributaries of the Xi Da
Gou, which eventually flows into the T2izi River via the Yunliang River. This plant will
have a treatment capacity of 220.000 cubic meters per day (m3lday). The majority of the
inflow to the proposed plant is industrial wastewater. Following treatment at the proposed
plant. effluent will be returned via a proposed pipeline to the Anshan Iron and Sted Works
for reuse. Because the proposed wastewater treatment plant, whict will require a permanent
site of 15 hectares, would be located in an industrial re contiguous to the existing Anshan
steel plant, enviromnmental impacts would be minimal and no population resettlement would be
necessary. Treatment of the existing highly polluted wastewater for industrial reuse will
positively impact both the water quality of the Taizi River and the Anshan area's water
supply. Treating and Tegcling the effluent presently reaching the Taizi River by way of the
Xi Da Gou and the Yunliang River will provide a decrease in pollutant loadings entering the
Taizi River and thus enable this river section at Anshan to attain the Class V standards
targeted by the Liaoning govermnent for the year 2010.
The Benxi area wastewater treannent plant would be located on a 22. 1-hectare site
within the flood-prone area of the Taizi River, with an associated 12.37-kilometer (kin) sewer
intercptor, which would also be located within the floodplain of the Taizi River. The
proposed treatment plant will be designed to treat an average of 300,000 m3/day of waste-
water. In the Exjiao section of the Taizi River at Benxi, COD levels will be reduced by
39.2% to 30.25 milligrams per liter (mg/L), and BOD will be reduced by 46.8% to 10.12
mgfL. Even though this major improvement in pollution reduction will not bring this river
section into compliance with the Class IV standards targeted for the year 2010, such
improvements coupled with future planned pollution control projects (e.g., an industrial
wastewater treatment plant) will assist in the eventual attainment of the Liaoning water quality
goals. It is anticipated that 40 to 50 households consisting of approximately 200 people
would need to be relocated from an srea adjacent to the proposed plant site. A resettlement
office would be established with the responsibility to pay damages and provide for suitable
replacement residences.
The Fushun area proposed wastewater treatment plant would be located on a 48.75-
hectare site (19.1 hectares of which will comprise LEPII-financod facilities) in an agriculural
area. The proposed plant will treat an average of 250,000 m31day of domestic and industrial
2

wastewater and will require the construction of associated municipal and industrial waste-
water interceptors. No residential resettlement will be required for the proposed construction.
The proposed site will remove approximately 50 acres of land from agricultural production.
The environmental benefits derived from the wastewater treatment, including improved water
quality in the Hun River as well as improvements to water used for irrigation in the Shenfu
Irrigation Canal from the separate source treatment of certain industrial wastewater flows
outside of the LEPH scope, outweigh the loss in agricultural productivity as a result of the
devdopment of the wastewater treatment plant. Hun River water quality at Fushun is
currentlybelow the Class V standards. Reductions in levels of BOD by up to 82%. COD by
up to 87%, and phenols by up to 99% will result in improving the watcr quality standards to
the Class m target established by the Liaoning government for the year 2010. The construc-
tion and operation of the proposed interceptor is noi Expected to cause any significant adverse
long-term environmental effects.
The Benxi Air Pollution Abatement (APA) projects include: 1) installation of
facilities to lower the emissions of smoke and dust during coal loading and unloading at the
BISC Coking Plant; 2) installation of dry electrostatic precipitators on blast furnaces No. 1
and No. 2 at BISC; and 3) installation of a transmission pipeline and heat exchange stations to
supply hot water to the Dongfen Central Heating District. ITese pollution abatement projects
are anticipated to result in an improvement in air quality in Benxi by lowering particulate
emissions by 44,990 tonnes per year and S02 emissions by 10,219 tonnes per year. No
significant adverse long-term environmental impacts will occur as a result of implemenation
of these projects. No resettement or permanent land use changes will occur.
In Dalian, a proposed wastewater treatment plant would be located on a 5-hectare site
within an industrialized area of the city along the Malan River. This proposed treatment
plant, which would be located approximately 900 meters upstream of the mouth of the Malan
River where it flows into Heishijiao Bight, will treat up to 156,000 m3/day of domestic and
industrial wastewater. The existing Chunliu wastewater treatment project will consist of
upgrading the sewer system to transport an additional wastewater flow of 46,000 m3/day to
the existing plant. This will allow the Chunliu wastewater treatment facility to reach its
design treatment capacity of 60,000 m3/day, which is currently not being achieved. No
residential resettlement will be required for these projects. Minor land use changes will be
compatible with adjacent uses. Environmental benefits will include significant improvements

in wzer quality in Heishijiao Bight, which is used extensively for aquaculture and recreation,
and in Dalian Bay. In addition, a wat recycling portion of the Malan River proposal will
benefit the region's dwindling wat supply.
The Dalian solid waste project includes further improvements and expansion of the
Maoyingzi Landfill, as well as impvemes to the existing Suoyu Bay Transfer Station.
Development of these facilities will benefit the Dalian uea by providing controlled locations
to a     at the increasing amounts of solid waste generaed in the area (anticipated to
average 1.500 tonnes per day). This development also will mitigate impacts to groundwater
and rface waters of Jinzhou Bay and the Suoyu Bay area of Dal an resulting from runoff
from the curren landfill facilities. In addition, landfill gases emitted from the Maoyingzi
Landfill will be contolled through a flaing system. This system will prevent these gases
(which are primarily methane) from venting into the atmosphere, thereby eliminating a
possible source of global warming pollutants.
The water supply enhancement project in the City of Jizhou includes the develop-
ment of a groundwater aquifer near the Ludan village area. Development will include
installation of 17 municipal wate wells, construction of a pipeline gathering system and 21-
km supply pipeline from the Ludan area to the existing Damu treatment plant, construction of
a pump station near Baduan Village, and consction of a pump station and wat treatment
expansion adjacent to the existing Damu facility. This project will provide up to 100,000
m3/day of war, which will ameliorate a projected supply shortfall of 98,900 m3/day
anticipated by calendar year 1995. No rsestlement will be required by this proposal. The
only permanent land use changes to occur will be the result of instaHlation of the water welLs,
pump stations, and water treatment plant expansion. Environmental impacts from pipeine
installation will be short term and will occur during the construction period.
In addition to the water supply development project, the Jincheng Pap  Mill, which
is located along the Daling River upstream of the Ludan well field, will be redeveloped to
reduce the amount of pollutants presently being discharged to the Daling River. This project
will help prevent contamintion of the new municipal weU field by treating tie largest single
discharge source to the river. The proposed trtment for the Jincheng Paper Mill wastewater
will result in the recovery of approximately 66% (approximately 58 tonnes/day) of crrently
discharged suspended solids with an attendant 88% reduction of 162 tonneslday in chemical
oxygen demand.

The No Action altenative is not a feasible option for any of the proposed activities
included in the LEPII. Current and future lack of action regarding any of these subprojects
would continue to adversely ;ffect the Liaoning Province enviromnent. The negative impact
of pollutants on both water and air resources and the attendant adverse effects on human
health have become extremely serious over past decades. The pollution abatement projects
analyzed in the World Bank as,. 2 proposal are crucial elements for mitigating the adverse
effects of pollution and improving the environment at the local, provincial, and national level.

1. LE:PI DESCRITION AND GENERAL INFORMATION
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Liaoning Province is the most industrialized province in northeast China. Irdustrial
and mining complexes are primarily located in the major urban areas within the province.
Much of this industrial development occurred prior to implementation of environmental
controls. The centr3a government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the provincial
government in Liaoning Province are now mandating specific pollution abatement controls at
various industries and in municipalities within Liaoning.
The pollution abatement projects currendy planned are collectively known as LEPII.
This environmental assessment (EA) summary report has been prepared in support of the
application to obtain World Bank financing for the implementation of the various components
of the LEPI by the Liaoning Provincial Government (LPG) and the PRC. The individual
pollution abatement projects will be located in the cities of Anshan, Benxi, Dalian, Fushun,
and Jinzhou, and wil consist of nine separate components (see Figure 1-1). The nine compo-
nents discussed in this EA summary report are as follows:
1.   Anshan wastewater treatment and recovery project;
2.   Benxi wastewater treatnent project;
3.   Fushun wastewater treatment project;
4.   Smoke-dust control at the BISC Nos. 1, 2, and 4 coke ovens;
5.   Dry electrostatic precipitator installation at the BISC No. 1 and No. 2 blast
furnaces;
6.   Transmission pipeline and heat exchange stations for the Benxi
central heating system;

8.   Dalian solid waste projec; and
9.   Jin2hou water supplylJincheng Paper Mill water pollution abate-
ment project.
In general, the components proposed in Anshan, Benxi, and Fushun will result in
direct improvements in environmental conditions of the Hun-Taizi River Basin in terms of
reducing both water pollution and air pollution. The wastewater components in Fushun and
Benxi will provide improvements to their respective wastewater collection systems in addition
to the new primary and secondary treaunent plants. The Anshan wastewater component will
improve water quality and enhance water conservation efforts through the treatnent and reuse
of wastewater originating from the Xi Da Gou drainage area within Anshan. The Benxi APA
components will result in lower SO2 and particulate emissions, as well as a reduction in blast
furnace wash-water discharges into the Taizi River.
The Jinzhou components will result in a development of a new municipal potable
water supply and treatment of the largest single discharge source to maintain water quality of
the new system. Use of this newly developed, uncontaminated water supply will prevent
water supply shortfall and improve water quality.
The Dalian components will improve the water quality of the Malan River and the
near-shore areas of Heishijiao Bight and Dalian Bay in the north Yellow Sea, while the solid
waste component will improve the Dalian solid waste collection system and provide a much
needed facility for solid waste disposal.

2. BASELINE DATA - EXISTING ENVIRONMENT
2.1 DESCRIPTION OF PROJECr AREA
Liaoning Province is located in the northeast section of the PRC. Liaoning is
bordered on the north by the Jilin Province, on the east by North Korea, on the west by
Hebei Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and on the south by the Bohai
Sea. Land use in Liaoning Province is primarily industrial and agricultural.
Liaoning is a highly industrialized province with heavy industries such as iron and
steel manufacturing, cement production, nonferrous metal processing, and chemical industry.
These industries and other light industries like paper mills and textile factories are the major
pollution sources. The provincial govenmment and LEPB have made great efforts to abate the
pollution and improve the environment. The provincial government of Liaoning and the
central government of the PRC are now mandating specific pollution abatement controls at
vaious industries and in municipalities within Liaoning. Areas experiencing elevated levels
of pollution have been identified for cleanup. In order to execute the directives of the
governments to perform the necessary amelioration activities, the governments of China have
applied for loans through the World Bank to finance these cleanup projecs.
The overall project for which World Bank fuding will be used is known as the
LEPIL. The LEPII consists of nine components that will result in an abatement of current
environmental degradation in three identifiable regions within Liaoning Province. The three
regions that will benefit from the LEPH are:
* The Hun-Taizi River basin in central Liaoning Province;
* The Xiaoling-Daling River basin area in southeast Liaoning Province;
and

* The Dalian area located on the Liaodong peninsula in south Liaoning
Province.
The pollution abatement components in Anshan, Benxi, and Fushun will result in
substantial improvements to the enviromenal quality of the Hun-Taizi River basin.
Wastewater treatment plant projects in all three cities will improve overall water quality,
while air pollution abatement projects in Benxi will result in a substantial reduction of existing
air contaminants currenly being emnitted into the atmosphere. The componens proposed in
Jinwhou will provide not only an incremental addition to the city's water supply that will allow
for added economic growth but will also protect the newly developed water supply by abating
the largest single discharge point to the Daling River basin. Tne Dalian components of ihe
LEPII will provide needed imprvemets in the area's solid waste mnmagement program and
will significantly lower the levels of polluted wastewater currently being discharged into areas
of Ileishijiao Bight, a popular tourist area of Liaoning Province, and into Dalian Bay.
2.2 SOCIOECONOMICS
The proposed LEPI consists of nine separate components located within the cities of
Anshan, Beuxi, Fushun, Jinzhou, and Dalian, all of which are in Liaoning Province of the
PRC. The population of this five-city administative area is approximately 15.37 million
people and covers an area of appmximately 47,136 square kilometers (k2) (see Table 2-1).
Principal economic activities in the project area include steel and coke production,
machinery manufacturing, petroleum refining, chemical manufacturing, metallurgy, textiles,
light industry, pulp and paper manufcturing, coal mining, and oil and gas production.
Details of the individual industries in each project area are discussed in each individual
project-related environmental assessment report.
Existing land use at each of the proposed component constiuction sites is summarized
in each appropriate project description. Details can be found in each project-related environ-
mental assessment report.
2.3 ECOLOGY
The majority of the projects associated with the TEPII are located in urbanized or
agricultural settings where the majority of the native flora and fauna have been displaced by
species adaptable to these environments. Wastewater discharges in Anshan, Benxi, Fusbun,

Jinzhou, and Dalian, have impaired the aquatic environments,of the Hun-Taizi River Basin,
the Daliug River Basin, and the Heishijiao Bight area near the mouth of the Malan River in
Dalian and in Dalian Bay. In areas of high water pollution, there are reportedly no fish or
shrimp species present. ID areas of lesser water pollution, carp, crucian carp, catfish, wild
gill eel, and tiger shrimp are present.
Upland forested areas contain poplar, larch, willow, oak., dragon spruce, fir, and
northeast China ash. Animal species include badger, roe decr, pheasant, egret, ad other
urban dwelling species.
The offshore areas surrounding Dalian are presently quite diverse. The Heishijiao
Bight and Dalian Bay areas are rich marne environments. They contain numerous native
species and have highly productive aquaculture systems. Major cultivated species include
Japanese brown alga (Undaria pinnaufida), kelp (Laminariajaponica), abalone, scallops, and
mussels. The ars  of Jinzhou Bay originally contained mud flats with native populations of
aine rush and reeds covering up to 30% of these tidal areas. However, many of these
mud flats have been convred for prawn production.
24 CLIMATE
The climate in the project area of Liaoning Province is subhumid, with maritime
influences resulting in a moderating of the temperatures, more so in Dalian than the other
project cities. The area has an average annual precipitation from 500 millimeters (mm) to
1,0D0 mm, with the amoumt increasing in a southwest to northeast direction. Sixty-three
percent to 70% of the annual precipitation occurs as rain in the summer months of June to
September, while only approximately 9% to 10% falls during the winter months of December
through February. Average daily temperatures range between 6°C and 9°C. During
January, the average daily temperature ranges between -5C and -17'C, while the hottest
month of July has average daily temperatures between 230C and 24°C.
2.5 WATER QUALITY
2.5.1 Hun-Tazi River Basin
The Hun and Taizi rivers generally flow in a northeast to southwest direction through
Liaoning Province to their confluence, which eventually empties into the Gulf of Liaodong on
the Bohai Sea (see Figure 1-1). The water quality in the basin is currently being monitored
cumqo~ Da77.~ LWIOn4fflw         2-4



by the LEPB and the various municipal environmental protection bureaus. Monitoring results
are reported in the provincial Environmental Quality Reports (EQRs) that are published
annually. Appendix A contains baseline water quality standards for the PRC and Liaoning
Province.
The EPB monitors water quality at 23 locations in the Hun-Taizi River basin.
Sampling frequency is seasonal, based on water flow conditions. Table 2-2 summarizes the
water quality data for selected monitoring locations as presented in the 1991 EQR. Tbese
data generally fall within the standards as identified in Table A-I (see Appendix A). The
exceptions to this are for chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), phenols, and un-ionized ammonia levels, all of which exceed the standards identified
in Table A-I for various uses as established by the PRC's National EPA.
In general, the water quality of the Hun-Taizi River basin ranges from poor to good.
The upstream reaches of the rivers are of high quality, meeting Class I or II of the Environ-
mental Quality Standards for Surface Waters (EQSSW). These data are typical of generally
unimpactd headwater areas in a watershed. Based on water quality criteria, these waters
would be suitable for all categories of use. Water quality deteriorat as the Hun and Taizi
rivers flow through the more developed sectors of the province. Monitored parameters
exceed the standards developed for Class V waters where the Hun flows through Fushun and
where the Taizi flows through Benxi and Anshan (SAE 1993a).
Most of the surface waters in the Hun-Taizi River basin within the developed sectors
are contaminated, and exhibit substandard water quality that is generally worse than the
national Class V standards for surface water (SAE 1993d). The problem is compounded
during the dry season when virtually all flous in the rivers consist of raw wastewater. In
addition to surface water contamination from uncontrolled and untreaed domestic and
industrial wasewater, groundwater has been contaminated via surface water recharge (SAE
1993d).
The use of these polluted water sources for drinking water supplies poses a potential
threat to human health. In some areas of the Hun-Taizi basin, above-average occurrence of
liver problems, cancers, and birth defecs have been reported (BEAC 19921).
The generally poor quality of surface water at Fushun and Benxi also affects
agricultural irrigation (LEPSRI 1992a). In particular, surface water quality with respect to

Liaoning Province has established water quality targets for the year 2000 for sections
of the various rivers in the Hun-Taizi River basin based on existing and intended uses for the
specific water bodies. Feasibility studies conducted by Stanley Associates indicate that these
target levels, as proposed, are largely attainable through the implementation of pollution
abatement projects. A summary of these water quality targels and their associated water uses
are presented in Table 2-3.
2.s52 Jinzbou  a: Daling-Xlaoling River Basin
2-5.2.1 Surface Water
There are 50 rivers and tributaries in the Jinzhou administrative district. The source
of mmdt of these rivers is primarily from runoff caused by precipitation, which results in
significant fluctuations in flow volume from season to season and from year to year. Table
2-4 identifies the monthly flow of the Daling River which illustrates this seasonal fluctuation.
The Daling-Xiaoling River basin has the largest catchment basin (23,594 kn2) and the largest
flow with an average annal flow of approximatey 2,060 x 10is cubic meters (m3) (CRAES
1992). Most of the rivers within this basin flow through areas of hilly topography with steep
slopes and little vegetative cover. This situation results in severe erosion and resultant
sedimentation and siltation in the rivers.
The Daling River originates in Jianchang, a hilly region in the southwest of Jinzhou,
covering a distance of 403 km before entering the Bohai Sea. Because of severe erosion in
the upper reaches of the Daling River basin, high suspended solid loads exist in this area.
Tihis is especially evident during periods of wet and normal flows, as shown in Tables 2-5 and
2-6, which present water quality data on a yearly basis for the years 1983 to 1991 upstream

high levels of oil, cyanide, and heavy metals, reflect the impact of the discharge of waste-
water at Jinzhou City.
The high suspended solids measured in the upper reach of the Daling River are a
direct result of the upstream erosion problems during wet and normal flow periods. The data
also indicate, however, that higher levels of COD and BOD in the river sections upstream of
the City of Jincheng (location of the Jincheng Paper Mill) occur primarily during wet flow
periods. Note that during these wet flow periods, COD levels downstream of Jincheng
actually decrease from upstream levels by 7.3% for CODMn and 4.8% for CODCr This
would appear to be very unusual, given that the City of Jincheng and the Jincheng Paper Mill
contribute significant discharges to the Daling River. In fact, the Jincheng Paper Mill,
located on the Daling River upstream of the proposed municipal well field development,
discharges up to 55,310 m31day of industrial wastewater into the Daling River (SAE 1993e).
The reason for this decrease, even though the river incurs additional pollutant loading from
the city and the paper mill, is that in the lower, slower reaches of the river occars an apparent
settling out of the massive amounts of suspended solids intrduced into the upstream sections
of the river from the above-mentioned severe erosion during these wet or high flow periods
(CRAES 1992).
Further examination of the data in Tables 2-5 and 2-7 reveals that during ormal and
especially dry flow periods there are significant increases in the annual average values of both
CODMn. (124% to 280%, respectively) and CODCr (46% to 130%, respectively) in the
downstream river sections. Because the levels of erosion-based suspended solids are
significantly lower during these periods of normal and low river flow, the above-mentioned
COD increases downstream of Jincheng give evidence of the pollutant loading being intr-
duced into the Daling River at Jincheng. Thus, it is primarily during the wet flow periods,
when tremendous amounts of eroded materials are introduced into the river, tha the COD
loading at Jincheng is masked and undiscernible in the comparison of data from upstream and
downstream locuaions. It is this dterioration in surface water quality that is indeed evident
during normal and low flow periods, therefore, that necessitates instlation of a treatment
facility at the Jincheng Paper Mill.

2.522 Groundwater
Groundwater in the urban district of Jinzhou City is located mainly in the valley and
stream terrace along the bankLs of the Xiaoling and Nuer rivers, covering an area of approxi-
mately 101 kim2. The water-bearing stratum is a gritstone formation with a thickness of 4 to
12 meters. Above this gritstone formation is a sandy clay layer with an overburden of sandy
soil. Below the aquifer is bedrock. Water supply of a single well is normally 1,000 to 3,000
m3/day. Water-bearing strata in the hill, valley, and slope area are thin, and unstable,
containing very small amounts of water. Water supply of a single well in this area is less
than 50 to 100 m3/day, with minimal value for providing a central water supply..
Ibe remaining groundwater resource in the region near Jinzhou can be divided into
two subareas based on groundwater hydraulic conditions. The first subarea is known as a
groundwater-bearing area. It is located at the top of the Daling and Xiaoling rivers alluvial
fan, extending to contain the entire Xiaoling River alluvial fan. The aquifer covers an area of
approximately 400 kmn2. The water-bearing stratum is made up of gritstones with a thickness
of 30 to 60 meters. It is covered at the top by sandy clay and silty sandy soil formation with
a thickness of 3 to 10 meters. The aqueous stratum in the river valley is directly exposed and
has good water permeability. Water supply of a single well is typically 3,000 to 10,000
m3/day with capacities often reaching 10,000 to 20,000 m3/day at maximum. The second
subarea is known as the double-layer water-bearing area and is located in the miiddle of the
Daling River alluvial fan, covering an area of 410 km2. Ihis aquifer contains a shadow and a
deep aqueous stratun. The shadow aqueous stratum is composed of deposited gritstones and
has a thickness of 20 to 40 meters, the top plate of the water separation stratum being located
at a depth of 10 to 20 meters. Water supply of a single well typically ranges between 5,000
and 10,000 m3/day. Tbe deep aqueous stratum is made up of gritstones and has a thickness
of 20t 65  meters. ne separating confining layer is located at a depth of 50 to 80 meters
and is made up of clay with a thickness of 5 to 15 meters. Water supply of a single well
from the deep aqueous stratumn typically ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 m31day.
ITe new water supply project for Jinzaou will be located near Ludan in the transition-
al zone of the two groundwater subareas (see Figure 2-1).

2.53 Dalian Area
2.53.1 Surface Water
The Malan River, which is 14 km in length and has a drainage area of 95 kim2,
constitutes the major drainageway and wastewater discharge source in the southwest part of
Dalian. Water frm the Maan River is discharged to the Yellow Sea by way of Heishijiao
Bight. There are currently over 100 industrial facilities that discharge into Malan River,
resulting in approximately 40,000 to 50,000 tonnes of effluent per day being discharged to
Heishijiao Bight. This effluent is a major discharge to the Bight and is causing pollution
problems along the shoreline, which is a very popular area for tourism. The shoreline in the
area serves as the location for several public recreation beaches. Offshore areas are used for
harvesting kelp and other seafood products.
An investigation of wvater quality in Heishijiao Bight was conducted by the Dalian
Environmental Monitoring Center in 1985. Twenty-five locations in the Bight were sampled,
including sediment and water, and were then compared to the National Seawater Quality Stan-
dards. The investigation showed that the water quality in the Bight was generally good.
Elevated levels of oil exceeding the standards near Fingshuihe are likely caused by a nearby
ship yard (SAE 1993c). In addition, several water samples in the Bight had slightly elevated
levels of zinc and COD, although these levels only slightly exceeded EQSSW standards.
Bottom sediments, on the other hand, were severely contaminated, with results exceeding the
standards for all parameters. The highest levels of contamination were near the mouth of the
Malan River. The results indicated that the contamination levels decreased with distance from
the river mouth. For example, areas near Xinghai Park, Lingshuiqiao, and Fujazhuang
exhibited only slighty elevated contamination, while pollutant levels increased between these
areas and the Malan River. The Environmenrtl Impac A sseumenf Reportfor Daian Malan
Riwer Sewage Treatmen Project, prepared by Dalian University of Technology (D)UMJ details
results of the monitoring and compares these results to national standards (DUT 1992).
Seawater quality monitoring has also been conducted in Suoyu Bay and Jinzhou Bay.
Data obtained from monitoring in Suoyu Bay indicate that inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus,
and coliform bacteria have increased significantly between 1987 and 1992, which is causing a
state of eutrophication in Suoyu Bay. Most of this increase is attributed to increased
discharges of industrial wastewater and municipal sewage into the bay. Suoyu Bay is
considered the most polluted area of Dalian Bay. A detailed discussion of this analysis and

comparison to the National Sea Water Quality Standards is included in the E,wiromerl
Inzpac Report of the 7reanent Project of the Mwuucipa Refuse from the Central Area of
Dalian Cty, prepared by the Dalian University of Technology (DUT 1993).
Waer quality in the general rea of the Maoyingzi Landfill project is impacted by
discharges of nitrates, phenol, and metls from municipal sewage and from industries such as
oil refineries, galvanizing, and acid washing (presumably of steel). Jinzhou Bay, which is
near the Maoyingzi Landfill site, receives large amounts of wastewater produced by the
factories and nearby villages through the Hongqi and Beida rivers. The main pollutants found
in the bay are COD, oil, NO., and phosphate, most of which come from the Hongqi River
(DUT 1993).
Fourteen parameters were analyzed as part of the water quality monitoring conducted
in Jinzhou Bay. Tbese included dissolved oxygen (DO), COD, BOD, oil, volatile phenol.
NO,, nitrogen nitrate, nitrogen nitrite, cyanide, phosphate, lead, mercury, cadmium, and
arsenic. Salinity and pH values were also analyzed. The results of the analyses show that oil
content, phosphate, and inorganic nitrogen exceed the Class I standard specified by the
National Seawater Quality Standards. The data also indicate that the pollutants in-crease in
concenration toward the Hongqi River.
2.5.3.2 Groundwater
I-our monitoring wells exist within the proposed landfill area and one exists outside of
it. All five wells were sampled in June 1991 and again in 1992. Parameters selected for
testing were chloride, total bacterial count, fecal colifbrm count. pH, arsenic, phenol,
mercuiy, hexavalent chromium, lead, cadmium, cyanide, and fluoride. The groundwater
exceeds the levels set for chloride. total bacterial count, and fecal coliform count established
in the Chinese National Standards for Drinking Water. Based on these levels, the data
suggest that seawater intrusion is occurring and that seepage of untreated human or animal
wastes have impacted the groundwater. All three parameters that exceed drinking water
standards showed increases between 1991 and 1992. When compared to 1987 results,
chloride bas decreased slightly, while total bacteria, fecal coliform, and fluoride levels all
increased. Because of the bacterial contammation noted above, the groundwater is not used
for drinking and the local population is served by city water derived from the Biliuhe
2-18



Reservoir located 200 km northeast of Dalian. The nearest identified drinking water well is 7
km from Dalian.
2.6 BASELINSE AIR QUALITY IN BENXI
The City of Benxi has the most significantly impacted air quality in Liaoning
Province, as well as the whole of China. It is for this reason that the LEPII includes an Air
Pollution Abatement (APA) program for Benxi. Data collected from 1986 to 1990 (Benxi
EPB 1986) indicates that the major pollutants of concern in the Benxi area are pzrticulates and
S02. Annual ambient air quality particulate and S02 concentrations for seven meteorological
air quality monitoring stations around the City of Benxi (see Figure 2-2 for locations) from
1986 to 1990 are shown in Table 2-8. Appendix A contains the air quality standards
established by the PRC. These standards are the basis for comparison for air quality in Benxi
and all of Liaoning.
These ambient air quality numbers vary significantly, depending on the season and on
the locations of the six meteorological air quality staions. The seasonal variations in ambient
air quality for TSP and S% are shown in Tables 2-9 and 2-10, respectively. The most
pronounced seasonal variation for TSP and SO% occurs during the winter, when TSP
concentrations more than double and S02 concentrations increase by a factor of 10 .'or the
seasonal arithmetic average, when compared to spring and summer concentrations. This
seasonal variation is most likely due to temperature inversions, which restrict air pollutants
from dispersing upward during winter. The increased use of wal for residential heating
during the long winters in Beuxi can compound this problem for as long as six ijiunths. The
highest concentrations of S02 and particulates are recorded in the !eavy industrial areas.
Environmental monitoring data for particulates and SC' from the seven air monitor-
hg stations indicate ;hai rie industrial districts of Xihu, Chaitun, and Nandi (stations 1, 2,
and 3) and the Dongfen district (station 6) are the most polluted areas in the city. The
Dongfen area is downwind of the heavily industrialized districts; therefore, the air quality in
the district, as in the residential district (station 5), is direc^Jy influenced by emissions from
industrial sources. Thus, the ambient air quality baseline data for 1990 are as follows:
*  0.39 mg/m3 average particulate concentraticli; and
*  0.16 mg/m3 average SO2 concenration.

The above numbers were generated using the six monitoring stations data that most
likely represent the arithmetic average ambient air concentration levels to which Benxi
residents are typically exposed (e.g., monitoring stations I through 6).
The main contributor to both particulate and S02 emissions in the Benxi area is the
combustion of coal, although the production of cement and lime, and mining also contribute
to these air emissions. Industries and residences in the city of Benxi burn approximately 7.5
million tonnes of coal per year. Of the 7.5 million tonnes of coal buned, 0.5 million tonnes
per year are used for residential beating and cooking and 7.( million tonnes per year are used
by industry. Benxi's main industries are distributed over seven industrial trades. These
include:
* Metallurgy (i.e., iron and steel manufacture);
* Building materials (i.e., cement and lime production);
*  Chemicz1 manufactrng;
*  Coal mining;
* Textiles;
- Light industrial; and
*  Machinery.
The majority of the industries are concentated in the first three trades: metallurgy,
building materials, and chemical manufaring. Geographically, most of the factories are
located in the city's Pingshan, Gongyuan, and Xihu districts and thrir estimat  eissions
(major sources) are shown in Table 2-11.
Major facilities contributing to particulate and S02 emissions (m decreasing order)
are as follows:
* BISC's Gongyuan Industrial Area of which the coking ovens, blast
'furace area, and basic oxygen furnace (BOF) area have the highest
emissions. (See Sites 3 through 7 on Figure 2-2 for locations.)
* BISC's Xihu lndustrial Area of which the blast furnace and coling
oven area have the highest emissions. (See Site I on Figure 2-2 for
location.)

*  The Benxi Cement Plant adjacent to the proposed central heating
project location had large amounts of stack emissions, even though
the cunent facility incorporates electrostatic precipitators for all three
clinker production units. (See Site 2 on Figure 2-2 for location.)
*  The Gongyuan Cement Plant, located behind the BISC Gongyuan
Factory, is also a major contributor to visual particulate emissions.
(See Site 8 on Figure 2-2 for location.)
BISC's Gongyuan Factory area is the largest iron and steel industrial area in Benxi.
BISC's Gongyuan and Xihu industrial areas employ approximately 200,000 people. Based on
1990 monitoring data, includ.ng BISC's Gongyuan and Xihu iron and steel areas, coking
plants, power plants, and the Benxi and Gongyuan cement plants, the annual discharge of S02
from the two industrial areas is 82,000 tonnes, which amounts to 57% of the total S02
emiisions from the city. Total particulate emissions are 105,000 tonnes per year, which
amounts to 46% of the city's total particulate emissions.
The single largest contributor to the pollutant emissions released by the BISC
factories is the BISC Power Plant. The BISC Power Plant released approximately 38,000
tonnes of SO2 and 26,239 tonnes of particulates in 1991. These numbers represent 50% of
the total SO2 and 40% of the total particulate emitted by the BISC factories. The BISC
Power Plant has 1; boilers now in operation and two additional boilers were expected to have
been operational by the end of 1992. Three boilers were equipped with electrostatic precipi-
tators (ESPs) in 1985 and one in 1990 to improve particulate air pollution control capabilities.
Four additional ESPs were expected to have been insalled and operational by the second half
of 1992. The remaining boilers are expected to be equipped with ESPs by the end of 1993.
Design removal efficiency of the ESPs is estimated at 98%. It is expected that particulate
emissions will be reduced from 25.7 kilotonnes per year (ktWyr) from the BISC Power Plant to
0.5 kt/yr upon completion of the dust control project. This is a total reduction of 25.2 ktWyr
from the operation of the ESPs. This will result in a 11.0% redaction of particulate emissions
from the entire city.
The coling plants of the Gongyuan area and the blast furnace plants of the Gongyuan
and Xihu areas are also large contributors to the emissions of SO2 and particulates in Benxi.
The Benxi Cement Plant is the next largest source of air pollutants in the ciy second only to
the B'SC Gongyuan, and Xihu factories. The plant discharges 7,300 tonnes of SO2 annually
and 32,500 tonnes of particulates. A particulate control project at Benxi Cement Plant is
2-28
Lma_4EDA1ilF



currently under way. Substantial reduction in particulate emission is expected upon comple-
tion of the project. The next largest source of air pollutants in Benxi is the Gongyuan Cement
Plant. The annual discharge of S02 from the plant is 5,300 tonnes and total particulate
emissions are 16,551 tonnes.
The emission reduction projects currently being implemented within the City of Benxi
will affect ambient air concentrations, but are not part of the LEPII. The only impact
anticipated from implementation of these air pollution controls will be the reduction of 25.2 kt
of particulate when the BISC power plant retrofits all existing boilers with ESPs by the year
1993. Because the BISC Power Plant ESP retrofit is currently being implemented, its impact
on ambient air concentrations is considered in determining the ambient air quality baseline.
Thus, to establish an air quality baseline from which impacts for the proposed program can be
judged, a ratio of 25.2 kt to 229 kt (total city particulate emissions) or a reduction of 11%
must be subtracted from the 1990 ambient air quality particulate concentration of 0.39 mg/m3.
Thus, the ambient air quality baseline for particulate is established at 0.35 mglm3. The
underlying assumption is that, because of the topography of the Benxi area (i.e., its bowl
configuration), a bubble concept is applicable for the City of Benxi. The bubble concept is a
means of evaluating air emissions in a given geographical area (e.g., single manufacturing
facility, town, city, regional, or global area). This evaluation process places an imaginary
bubble over the geographical area of concern and evaluates all air emissions within the area as
a whole instead of on a point-by-point basis. This assumption is supported by the existing
meteorological data and documentation (e.g., still photos and video tapes) made by E & E
personnel on four visits to vantage locations in or near the City of Benxi. (Note: Data from
1990 were chosen as the baseline year because this was the most recent data published for the
six air monitoring stations- Data from station 7 were excluded because this site represents
background data.) In addition, the BISC Power Plant particulate reduction program addresses
approximately 15 boilers, which are medium-sized boilers that produce less than 240 tonnes
per hour of steam and have stacks relatively equal in height. The 15 boilers are located in
two areas, and the particulate dispersement in these areas is assumed to be applicable to the
use of the aforementioned bubble concept. Taking into account the pollution reduction
resulting from the ongoing BISC Power Plant particulate reduction program, the baseline
ambient air quality concentrations are 0.35 mg/m3 for particulate concentration and 0.16
mg/m3 for SO2 concentration.

3. HUN-TAIZI RIVER BASIN COMPONENTS OF LEPI
The current municipal wastewater treatment facilities in the Hun-Taizi River Basin are
inadequate and, as a result, varying levels of surface and groundwater contamination exist in
Anshan, Benxi, and FusSun. Development of additional water supplies is becoming exceed-
ingly difficult and expensive. Therefore, the municipal wastewater treatment systems in this
area must be upgraded in order to ensure an adequate supply of water at a reasonable cost.
3.1 ANSHAN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND RECOVERY
Ihe City.of Anshan is located within the Hun-Taizi River Basin, which is centrally
located in Liaoning Province in northeast China. The main purpose of the wastewater
treatment plant is to reduce the water pollution problem in Anshan and provide additional
water supplies for industrial reuse (SAE 1993a).
This proposed component will consist of constructing a wastewater treatment plant at
the confluence of two existing open channel interceptors, the Naihuo Bei Gou and the Shaojie
Nan Gou, which flow into the Xi Da Gou channel at this point (see Figure 3-1). lhe Xi Da
Gou is one of four major channels that discharge into the Yunliang River, a tributary of the
Taizi River. The Anshan wastewater treatment plant, which will be located on a site of
approximately 15 hectares (or 150,000 square meters), will be designed to provide primary
treatment with chemical addition to enhmance solids removal, including heavy metals and
associated oil (see Figure 3-2). 'The plant will also include sludge dewatering facilities. After
primary treatment, the proposed design will provide additional treatment using the dissolved
air flotation process, followed by filtration. The wastewater to be treated at the proposed
Anshan plant would be largely from industrial sources and would contain high suspended

solids, low BOD5, low COD, and elevated levels of oil, total salts, hardness, heavy metals,
and other organics.
It is proposed that once the wastewater is treated, it will be recycled for reuse within
the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (ANGANG), or discharged by a gravity flow
1.5-meter-diameter concrete reinforced pipeline to the adjacer,t Xi Da Gou approximately 500
meters from the plant. Discharge to the Xi Da Gou is expected to be infrequent, and will
occur only at times when there is a low water demand at ANGANG.
The proposed wastewater treatment plant also provides that the Naihuo Bei Gou and
Shaojie Nan Gou channels will be converted from existing earthen channels to covered
concrete channels for wastewater conveyance (see Figure 3-1). Each tributary interceptor will
consist of a twin-celled concrete box, each cell having internal dimensions of 2 meters by 2
meters. The two channels will meet at a common point approximately 60 meters north of the
Xi Da Gou confluence. From this point, they will extend westerly for approxnimately 650
meters to the proposed Anshan wastewater treatment plant. The north interceptor (Naihuo Bei
Gou) will connect to an existing twin-celled concrete box culvert at its north end for a total
length from the treatment plant boundary of 1,920 meters. The south interceptor (Shaojie
Nan Gou) will tie in to an existing culvert at its south end for a total length from the
treatment plant boundary of 1,950 meters.
As stated above, the proposed wastewater treatment plant will, depending on water
demand, return all treated effluent to the ANGANG mill works. The proposed return pipeline
will be instaUed adjacent to the north interceptor, and will convey the treated wastewater
(approximately 220,000 cubic meters per day Im3iday]) to ANGANG's factory cooling ponds
located approximately 1,500 metas from the proposed wastewater treatment plant (see Figure
3-1). Distribution throughout the factory complex will occur via the central location of these
ponds. Reuse areas within the plant include blast and open hearth furnaces, and sted
quenching operations.
3.1.1 Alternatives for Anshan Wastewater Treatment Component
Process alternatives for wastewater treatment at Anshan examined by the design
institutes included individual source treatment, biological treatment, and Land treatment, none
of which were considered feasible. Individual source treatment, in general, would require
higher capital investment as well as higher operational costs. In addition, individual source
3-4

treatment would not likely achieve the treatment efficiency of a centralized plant. Biological
treatrnent was examined as a process alternative. However, this method was considered
ippropriate for the treatment system at Anshan because the makeup of the waste stream
(i.e., mainly solids and oils) does not lend itself to this method of treatment. Land treatment
would require extensive conversion of land and could result in degradation of groundwater.
In addition the proposed chemical assistance to enhance solids removal is a more efficient
method than land treatment.
A suitable alternative plant site was examined on the Xi Da Gou approximately 2.5
km downstream from the proposed site. However, the project includes conversion of the
existing earthen channels of the Naihuo Bie Gou and the Shaojie Nan Gou to covered concrete
channels, and installation of a water reuse pipeline from the treatment plant to ANGANG's
facility. Because the alternative site would require an additional 2.5 km of covered channel
(of the Xi Da Gou) and water reuse pipeline, this alternative was determined to be less
feasible than the proposed site.
3.2 BENXI WASTEWATER TREATMENT
The City of Benxi is situated on the Taizi River, direcdy upstream of the Shenwo
Reservoir and approximately 40 kilometers (kn) downstrcam of th. Guanyenge Reservoir. At
this time, the City of Benxi discharges all wastewater, which is mainly untreated, directly to
the Taizi River via numerous river tributaries and open ditches. The proposed municipal
wastewater treatment project for which World Bank funding is being ought consists of a
sewage collection system or wastewater interceptor and a wastewater treatment plant
This municipal wastewater treatment system will be constructed to treat an approxi-
mately 50150 mix of domesticlindustial wastewater. A second wastewater eament plant
and associated interceptor will be constructed to treat the heavy industia flows from the
Benxi Iron and Steel Works, the nearby cement plant and other contiguous industries in
southwest Benxi along the Taizi River. Note that this industrial wastewae treatment system
is no a part of LEP H.
As shown in Figure 3-3, the municipal wastewater interceptor will collect domestic
wastewater flows beginning from the Helin Gou at its confluence with the Taizi River. From
this point, the interceptor will be located parallel to and within the undeveloped floodplain on
the south side of the Taizi River for approximately 6.14 km to an intersection with the

Cuidong Gou. At this point, the interceptor-will cross the Taizi River and remain within and
parallel to the north floodplain of the river for approximately 6.23 kan. terminating at a
proposed pump station that will be situated approximately 500 to 1,000 meters from the
proposed treatnent plant (SAE 1993b).
lTbe total length of the interceptor will be approximately 12.37 km. Recommended
design parameters indicate that the interceptor diameter should range from 1.0 meter to 2.5
meters, depending on capacity requirements as each branch sewer enters the proposed
interceptor. Table 3-1 illustrates these size requirements by interceptor section between the
individual inflows.
In addition to the interceptor sewer, the existing municipal branch collector sewers
will need to be expanded and improved. 'he existing open channel tributaries prescntly serve
as branch sewage collectors (see Figure 3-3). These drainage channels collect water from
catchmnent areas ranging in size from 0.4 kn2 to 55 km2. Tnose drainage channels serving
the larger catchment areas are proposed to have branch collector sewers constructed parallel
to the existing opeo channels. Ihis will allow separtion of stormwater to the open chatnds
and sewage to the collector sewers. Some open channels will remain as sewage collectors and
will drain to the proposed interceptor at the Taizi River. Four collector sewers are planned
for funding with this proposal and include the Zhangjapuzi Gou, Xihu Gou, Cuidong Gou,
and Shui Ni collector.
The proposed municipal wastewater treatment plant for Benxi will be limited to
primary treatment The plant will be designed to treat an average flow of 300,000 m3/day
ivith a peak flow of 600,0GG m3/day. An associated pump station will be constructed to
accommodate up to 600,000 m3/day of sewage flow. There will also be screening and
degritting, primary clarifying, sludge dewatering, and chemical addition facilities associa
with the overall wastewatcr teatment construction.
The chem:cal addition facilities will consist of alum storage, piumping, and metering
facilities to provide enhanced primary clarification and sludge conditioning. Sludge produc-
tion is anticipated to be approximately 50 tonneslday dry solids a 20% solids content by
weight. The feasibility study states that all screenings, grits. and dewatered sludge will be
disposed of to a properly designed and secured landfill (SAE 1993b).

The proposed municipal wastewater treatment plant will be located on a lowland
location within the Taizi River floodplain (see Figure 3-3). The plant will require a site of
approximately 22.1 hectares (see Figure 3-4).
3.2.1 Alternatives for Benxi Wastewater Treatment Plant Component
Process alternatives for wastewater treatment in Benxi examined by the design
institutes included individual source treatment, biological treatment, and land treatment, none
of which were considered feasible. Individual source treatnent, in general, was not a
consideration in Benxi. As stated above, it is MJready planned that the largest industries in
Benxi will discharge their wastewaters to a separate industrial wastewater treatment system.
In addition, a system of treating each domestic source separately would not provide treatment
sufficient to meet that provided by the proposed system and would not be significantly
different from the system already in place (i.e., septic tank treatment and night soil rermoval).
Stabilization pond treatment would require thousands of hectares of currently
unavailable land because of the retention time required to hold and treat the effluent. This
method would also be precluded by the low average ambient temperatures in this area during
much of the year, which would result in significantly reduced biological activity of the
wastewater in these ponds. This reduced biological activity would be further compounded by
the low proportion of biodegradable material in the wastewater and the presence of toxic
materials in the wastewater that would further inhibit the necessary level of biological activity.
Land treatment would also require exrtensive conversion of land and could result in degrada-
tion of groundwater. Both chemical and biological treatment options have been evaluated.
Biological treatment was not chosen because of the low average ambient temperature and the
low organic concentration in the wastewater.
The proposed site was chosen because of the availability of a parcel of land large
enough to accommodate t . proposed plant and possible plant expansions. Although the site
is more than a kcilometer beyond the west end of the Benxi wastewater collection area, no
closer location existed that could meet the siting requirements for size and centralization
because of the steep topography that surrounds the area.

3.3 FUSHIUN WASTEWATER TREATMENT
The City of Fushun is situated on the Hun River, approximately 50 km upstream of
Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning Province, and immediately downstream of Dahuofang
Reservoir, a major flood attenuation and water supply storage reservoir (SAE 1993c).
Fushun is heavily industrialized and the majority of wastewater generated in the city
is from industrial sources. Fushun has over 1,100 industrial sources located within the city,
representing 45 different industrial sectors. Of the total wastewater flow generated in 1990,
84% (745,000 m3/day) is from these industrial sources. Of the total wastewater flow,
approximately 55.3g% is discharged directy into the Hun River, 7.1% is discharged into the
Dahuofang Reservoir, and 37.6% is directed to the Shenfu Irrigation Canal. The Shenfu
Canal runs from east to west and conveys untreated municipal and industrial wastewater to
irrigate approximately 10,000 hectares of farmland.
This proposed wastewater treatment component will result in improvements in water
quality within the urban area of Fushun as wdl as other areas downstream along the Hun
River. It is anticipated that, following proposed treatnent, water quality can meet the
National Class ID water quality standards upstream and Class IV standards downstream of the
Yong-an Bridge. The proposed treatment plant will also result in an improvement in
irrigation water quality in the Shenfu Canal, which will reduce the amounts of pollutants
being transferred to agricultural fields during irrigation (LEPSRI 1992a).
The wastewater treatment project for which World Bank funding is being sought
consists of a proposed municipal wastewater treamnt plant and associated interceptor sewers.
Idustrial wastewater is often not able to be effectively or economically treated by processes
more ideally suited for the treatment of domestic wastewauer. It is currently anticipated that
the proposed municipal wastewater treatment plant can effectively treat a wastestream with a
50/50 domesticlindustrial wastewater mix. Presently, the ratio of domestic to industial
wastewater is approximately 2515. Therefore, 20 major Fushun industries have been
selected, on the basis of their financial and structural capability, to treat their own wastewater
in order to lower the industrial wastewater component from 75% to the treatable 50%. These
industries currently produce 32% of the total wastewater output and will discharge their
effluent into an industrial wastewater interceptor that will discharge direedy into the Shenfu
Irrigation Canal, bypassing the proposed wastewater treatment plant. Some of this interceptor
currently exists, and some of it is stil in the proposal stage. The balance of the wastewater in

Fushun will be collected in a new municipal interceptor and transported to the new municipal
wastewater treatment plant.
The proposed municipal wastewater interceptor collector system will begin at the
proposed municipal wastewater treatnent plant in Sanbaotun. It will extend easterly along the
south bank of the Hun River, parallel to and north of the existing interceptor for a distance of
14.74 kilometers, where it will interconnect with the existing interceptor (see Figure 3-5).
This proposed municipal wastewater interceptor will then incorporate the existing interceptor
along the Hun River for approximately 11.12 km. A short 0.4-km section will then be
constructed across the Dongzhou River to a proposed pump station.
The total length of the municipal wastewater interceptor for this phase of construction
will be approximately 26.26 km. Recommended design parameters indicate the interceptor
diameter as shown in Table 3-2. The new interceptor sewer capacity will allow for peak
flows in lrvh domestic and industrial areas and stormnwater flows. The interceptor will
accommodate a maximum capacity of 2.4 times dry season flows at entry to the treatment
plant, or 1,142,530 m3/day. In addition to the main interceptor sewer, the existing municipal
branch collector sewers will need expansion and improvement. Four collector sewers and
three associated pump stations are planned for incorporation into this proposal. This system
is shown in Figure 3-5.
-As noted above, an industial wastewater interceptor will be constucted to collect
wastewater discharges from 20 major industrial aciities, which currently produce 32% of the
total wastewater flow in Fushun. The proposed industrial interceptor, as shown in Figure
3-6, will use as much of the existing interceptor system in Fushun as possible. Design
parameters are shown in Table 3-2. In the western portion of the proposed system, an
existing open earthen channel that presently flows into the Shenfu irrigation canal will be
converted to an open concrete-lined channel for a distance of 3.4 km. Upstream of this
section, the existing wastewater interceptor will remain in place for the next 11.6 km.
Following this section, the Yulin Canal, which is a 3.324-n old brick arch chanmel accommo-
dating existing wastewater flows, will be removed and the new industra wastwater
interceptor will be installed within the same alignment. The industria wastewater interceptor
will then paralle the existing interceptor for 5.1 km. A 3.77-km diversion from the existing
aligment will then be necessary between discharge nodes to avoid undermining problems that
have been occurring along the existing interceptor. Following this diversion, the existing

interceptor will then be used (as is) for 1.92 km to its termination. The total length of new
construction required for the industrial wastewater interceptor and associated branch collector
sewers will be 15.59 km and 8.42 Ikm, respectively (see Table 3-3).
The entire wastewater interceptor system proposed for Fushun, including both
municipal and industrial wastewater systems, is shown in Figure 3-7. The system shown in
this figure includes the facilities proposed for I EPII, in addition to proposed facilities for the
municipal wastewater interceptor system.
The proposed municipal wastewater treatment plant for Fushun will be designed to
provide primary treatnent with chemical addition to enhanced removal of solids, BODS, and
heavy metals removal. Primary sludge dewatering facilities will also be provided. The Phase
I plant (i.e., the stage of the plant being funded by the World Bank) will be designed to treat
an average flow of 250,000 m3/day with a nominal peak flow of 1,000,000 m3/day. An
associated pump station will be constructed that can accommodate up to 1,000,000 m3/day of
sewage flow. Screening and degritting, and primary clarifying facilities designed to treat peak
flows of 500,000 m31day will also be associated with the overall municipal wastewater
treatment plant construction. Sludge dewatering and chemical addition facilities will be
provided to handle an average design flow of 250,000 m3/day. Note dLat after completion of
phases 2, 3, and 4, which are not a part of LEP II, primary treatment would be in place to
treat peak flows of 1,000,000 m3/day. Secondary treatment would also be in place to up tO
500,000 m31day with the remainder of the effluent being bypassed following primary
treatment, screening and degritting, and primary clarification.
The chemical addition facilities will consist of alum storage, pumping, and metering
facilities to provide enhanced primary clarification and sludge conditioning. Sludge
production under Phase I is anticipated to be approximately 40 tonnes/day dry solids at 20%
solids content by weight. The feasibility study states that all screenings, grits, and dewatered
sludge will be disposed of to a properly designed ad secred landfill (SAE 1993c).
'he proposed municipal wastewater treatment plant will be located adjacent to the
Shenfu irrigation canal, between the Hun River and Shenfu Canal, on a site curendy used for
agriculture. The proposed plant site, which is located west of the urban area of Fushun in
Sanbaotun, is approximately 48.75 hectares, with dimensions of 650 meters by 750 meters.
Phase I of the proposed facility will require approximately 19.1 hectares of this site (see
Figure 3-8).

FUSHUN WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT: PLANT LAYOUT



3.3.1 Alternatives for Fushun Wasteacr Treatment Plant Component
Process alternatives for wastewater treatment at Fushun examined by the design
institutes included individual source treatment, biological treatnent, and land treatment.
Individual source treatment, in general, would require higher cn4pital investment as well as
higher operational costs, especially for the smallcr industrial flows that will be part of the
50/50 wastewater mix to be treated as proposed. In addition, individual source treatment for
the smaller sources would not likldy achieve the treatment efficiency of a ceirlized plant.
Stabilization pond treanment would require thousands of hectares of land because of the
retention time required to hold and treat the effluent. Ihis method would also be precluded
bj the low average ambient temperatures in this area during much of the year, which would
result in significantly reduced biological activity of the wastewater in these ponds. This
reduced biological activity would be further compounded by the low proportion of biodegrad-
able material in the wastewater and the presence of toxic ma:erials in the wastewater from
industrial sources that would further inhibit the necessary level of biological activity. Land
treatment would also require extensive conversion of land and could result in degradation of
groundwater.
One alternative treatment plant/intercepiDr option evaluated for tee Fushun wastewater
treatmevt plan; consisted of the construction of four separate sewage treatment systems in
various sectors of the city to treat wast&water locally by sector with ultimate disposal of
treated efluent imo the Hun River. This altrnative could have realized some cost savings
based on sxial:er size interceptor design requiremets and fewer sections of the interceptor
requiring replacement. However, this alternative has several disadvantages over the selected
option. For example, the alternative would incur increased capital costs, operational costs,
and manpower requirements for construction and operation of the three ad4d-ional treatment
facilities. Smaller wastewater flows are generally more expensive to treat than larger flows,
and the cost of conactr mobiliztion on four separate sites would be grater than on one
site. It would also be more difficult to coordinate the establishment of four separate operating
teams as part of a newly established wastewater utility company. The possible relocatior. and
training of additional staff would be more complicated and expensive. The increase in the
need for operating positions would require duplication for each plant, resulting in a substantial
increase in necessary staff.

In addition, the City of Fushun is proposing a waterfront park along the Hun River
through the central part of the city. Ensuring improved water quality along this proposed
recreational development would be compromised by the alternative because these treatnent
facilities would be discharging effluent from the primary treatment facilities into the Hun
River upstream of the urban center of Fushun.
3.4 ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFiT1S OF HUN-TAIZI RIVER BASIN COMPONENTS
The proposed wastewater treatment components in Anshan. Benxi, and Fushun will
greatly improve surface water quality and water usage. Reductions in pollutant levels at each
of the three cities are presented in Tables 3-4 through 3-6. The reductions are quantified in
the following paragraphs of this section.
In Anshan, reuse of the treated wastewater by the ANGANG facilities will provide a
positive benefit in that other water supplies that would otherwise be used by industry as
cooling water will be available fo: other uses such as irrigation. The project will provide up
to if8,000 m31day of water for reuse, which is more than half of the current 300,000 m3/day
shortage. In additioc-, treatment of the wastewater for reuse rather than direct discharge will
significandy reduce the discharge of wastewater into the Yunliang River, which eventually
reaches the Taizi River. For example, as shown in Table 34, suspended solids levels in the
Xi Da Gou during normal flow conditions are 1,052 mgtL (BEAC 1992f). Following
treament, the levels of suspended solids in the effluent that will be recycled to the ANGANG
facilities will be only 17 mg/L (a 98.4% reduction). There will also be significant reductions
realized in COD and petroleum of 12.4% and 94.6%. respectively, associated with the
reduction in suspended solids. The section of the Taizi River that receives the flows from the
Yunliang River near Anshan has a water quality target for the year 2010 to mee Class V
standards, which is water suitable for cooling waer in industry and useable for irrigation.
The significant decrease in pollutant levels in the Xi Da Gou, as shown above, can only have
a positive benefi: in achieving this target level. Tberefore, this abatement of pollution will
benefit the overall water quality of the Taizi River Basin.
The Erjiao section of the Taizi River traverses the major urban sections of Benxi and
experiences COD levels of 49.78 mgAL and BODS levels of 19.04 mglL at normal flow
during the dry season (LEPSRI 1992a). Note that the current water quality classification in
this river section is Class V or below. Water quality targets for the year 2010 are for this

section of the Taizi River to achieve Class IV standards, at which level water can be used for
recreation, boating, fishing, and industrial purposes. Water quality in the river section will be
substantially improved if the Benxi wastewater project components are implemented. COD
levels are expectod to be reduced by 19.53 mglL (39.2%), while BODS levels will be reduced
by 8.92 mg/L (46.8%). This presents a substantial benefit to the water quality in this section
of the river (LEPSRI 1992a); however, the change in water quality classification to the Class
IV target will not occur immediately. This predicted improvement appears imminent
following implementation of future planned pollution coLtrol projects, e.g., the industrial
wastewater treatment plant and control of discharges from the large individual industrial
complexes located along the river in Benxi.
There will also be significant improvements in water quality in the Hun River at
Furhun. During normal tlow conditions in various river sections, BOD5 will be reduced by
between 63.43% and 82.13%; NH3-N will be reduced by between 18.27% and 62.73%;
phenols will be reduced by between 75.56% and 99.77%; and COD will be reduced by
between 69.20% and 86.69%. COD will be reduced by 42.66% in the Shenfu irrigation
canal, while BOD5 will be reduced by 59.689%  LEPSRI 1992b). Currently, water quality in
the sections of the Hun River passing through the urban section of Fushun is generally below
Class V standards for these pollutants. Thc yt-4r 2010 watar quality target for this area is to
meet Class m standards, at which lcvel water can De *icd as a drinking wvater source after
some treatment. Although NH3-N levels will slightly exceed the Class V standards, all other
pollutants shown above will meet or exceed the Class m standards shown in Table A-1
following completion of the proposed wastewater treatment project. Pollutant levels in the
Shenfu Canal will remain above the Class V standards, even though significant improvements
mn water quality will occur. However, after the largest industries implement their individual
water discharge controls, these elevated pollutant levels in the Shenfu Canal should improve
to Class V standards, which are considered adequate for irrigation.
In general, these improvements in water quality will provide for a higher standard of
beneficial use of available water resources, not only in the immediate vicinity of treatment but
in those areas downstream of the proposed water treatment projects. For example, improve-
ments in water quality in Fushun will assist in protecting the downstream water supply of
Shenyang, the provincial capitol of Liaoning, by assuring improved water quality in the Hun
River, which provides the major water recharge source for the Shenyang aquifer. There are,

however, some impacts that may result in some adversity to the local environment, especially
impacts that will result in permanent changes. These are identified and discussed in the
following section.
3S ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF HUN-TAIZI RIVER BASIN
COMPONENTS
Lund Use
All of the projects associated with wastewater treatment plant construction will result
in the permanent conversion of existing land use to that used for the individual plant sites.
Conversion of the 15-hectare site a; Anshan is not considered to pose a significant adverse
impact because the site is currendy undeveloped and is located in an industrialized area that is
compatible with the pmposed plant. The 22. 1-hectare Benxi plant site is located in a flood-
prone area. Future flooding may significantly impact operation of the plant; however,
mitigation measures will be implementod to reduce these potential impacts.
Tbe Fushun wastewater treatment plant site will be located on land currently used for
agriculture. Evei though the planned development will take this 49-hectare site out of
agricultural production, the overall effect on the region's total farm output will not be
significant.
Residential Resettlement
Impact analyses conducted by the local environmental assessment institutes indicae
that only the Benxi Wastewater treatment plant will result in any residential resetlement
requirements. t is anticipated that 40 to 50 households (totaling approximately 200 people)
will be relocated from the area contiguous to the proposed treatment plant site. This
relocation of people is necessary to provide a safe sanitary protection distance between the
plant and the nearest residence.
A resettlement office will be established temporarily and will be responsible for
preparing a resettlement plan, paying for reasonable damages, and minimizing the inconve-
niences incurred by the affected residents.

Waste Generation
Each of the proposed wastewater treatmcnt plants will produce sludge associated with
the removal of suspended solids from the wastewater. This sludge may contain elevated
levels of heavy metals and other potentially hazardous constituents.
Sludge from the Anshan wastewater treatment plant will be disposed of at an ash
disposal storage yard near the village of Heniuzhuan, which is approximately 15 km from the
treatment plant. This area is carrendy used for the disposal of slag and other industrial
wastes from the ANGANG steel works and the Liaoyang Petrochemical Plant. Even though
the site is currendy used as a landfill, it may not be suitable for landfill use. Disposal of the
sludge from the treaunent plant, in combination with the current disposal of slag and
industrial wastes at the site, could adversely affect local groundwater resources. Alternative
sites should be evaluated for disposal of the wastewater sludge from the Anshan plant.
The disposal sites in Anshan, Benxi, and Fushun should be prcp&ly designed to
contain all wastes and prevent adverse impacts to air and groundwater. A landfill site has not
yet been selected for the sludge produced at the Benxi wastewater treatment plant. Sludge
from the Fushun wastewater treatment plant will possibly be disposed of at a landfill of the
Fukua:ig Company, approx!mately 3.5 km from the plant site, although this has not been
finized.
Excess spoil and waste generation from construction activities will be minimal. All
debris will be disposed of at proper disposal sites near each wastewater treatment plant
project. Excess spoil from sewer construction will be removed from construction areas and
used or disposed of in an appropriate manner, e.g., landfill cover or construction fill.
Construction Impacts
At is expected that air quality will be affected during construction of the proposed
wastewater trment facilities. Temporary increases in dust from construction and combus-
tion products from construction machinery are inevitable. Construction impacts will be short-
term and can be mitigated. For example, construction dust can be controlled by the periodic
wetting of construction areas through the use of spray equipment and water trucks.
Ambient sound levels in the areas of construction will also increase temporarily
because of the operation of construction equipment. Sound level increases associated with
construction should be slight and confined to the construction areas. Construction acivities

are expected to result in typical ambient sound levels of 65 to 77 dB(A), with peaks of
possibly 81 to 90 dB(A) within 100 feet of heavy construction equipment. If necessary,
construction workers will wear hearing protection to mitigate the effects of construction noise
at the sites. These elevated construction sound levels will cease following the completion of
construction, resulting in no long-term adverse impacts to workers or nearby residents.
Sewer construction will result in short-term adverse effects. During construction,
strects and other construction areas will require temporary shutdowns and detours, causing
temporary inconveniences to people who use these areas. However, once construction is
completed, streets and sidewalks will be repaired and open areas will be regraded, allowing
use of these areas for activities that do not interfere with sewer operation, such as transporta-
tion and agriculture. In general, buildings should not be constructed over sewer lines because
such construction could interfere with sewer operation.

4.1    CONTROL OF EMISSIONS DUURING COAL LOADING/UNLOADING AT
BISC COKING PLANT
The BISC Coking Plant is located in the southwestern section of the City of Benxi
(see Figure 4-1). In 1991, the BISC Coking Plant, consisting of No. 1 through No. 4 coke
ovens, produced 1.5 million tonnes of coke, requiring 2.0 million tonnes of coal for
production. Smoke and dust generated during the loading and unloading of coal contain; total
suspended particulates (TSP), benzol soluble organics (BSO), and benzopyrene (BaP).
Concentrations of BaP, BSO, and TSP in the dust around the coke oven areas exceed
applicable standards. Similarly, the ambient air quality within the coking plant exceeds the
National Air Environmental Standards, Class m (AEQS) for SO, TSP, and dustfall. Studies
have linked exposure to BaP to the incidence of lung cancer in workers at the coking pla=t
(E & E 1993a).
Although the charging and pushing emission controls proposed for No. 1, No. 2, and
No. 4 coke ovens are to be generally designed to meet or exceed a 90% overall particulate
removal, the Benxi EPB has nominally stated that the pushing emission controls should
inoDrporate technology to achieve a 98% particulate removal efficiency.
The proposed project will ' ontrol smoke and dust during the loading and unloading
processes. Coal will be loaded into a coal charge car via a gravity feed system. The
proposed charging emission controls (Charging Emission Control Proposal No. 1) will include
a new charge car and design with a combustion chamber and automatic fume ignitor, jumper
valve and off-gas top-side stationary duct traversing the length of the coke oven, wansfer duct,
mass cooler/spark arrestor, baghouse, iznduced draft fan, silencer and stack, and control room
(E & E 1993a). The proposed pushing emission controls (Pushing Emission Contmrol Proposal

No. 2) will include a draft hood, third-rail support system, hood/duct connection, transfer
duct, mass cooler/spark arrestor, baghouse, induced draft fan, and silencer and stack. Both
the charging and pushing emissions will be significantly reduced and are estimated at 90%
plus reduction for pollutants from the smoke and dust (E & E 1993a).
As of September 1993, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4 coke ovens have been included in
the proposed subproject. However, there is a possibility that the No. 4 coke oven will be
eliminated from the proposed subproject. The environmental impacts of this have been
addressed in Section 4.5 of this report.
4.1.1  Altenatives for Control of Emissions During Coal Loading/Unloading at the
BISC Coking Plant
4.1.1.1 Coal Loading at Coke Ovens
Two alternatives (Charging Emission Control Proposal No. 2 and No. 3) were
evaluated to contain emissions of coal dust during the unloading of coal at the coke ovens.
As referenced above, Charging Emission Control Proposal No. I was selected and
contained the aforementioned equipment. Charging Emission Control Proposal No. 2 differed
only in tha an ambient air blower was substituted for the mass cooler. This caused the
baghouse and induced the draft fan to be larger in capacity and cost without having an effect
on emissions reduction. Thus, Charging Emission Control Proposal No. I was selected over
Charging Emissien Proposal No. 2.
Charging Emission Control Proposal No. 3 was technically much different. The vast
majority of the equipment needed for Charging Emission Control Proposal No. I would be
eliminated. Charging Emission Control Proposal No. 3 included jumper pipe technology,
which would be included in the new charge car. However, because of existing excess
particulate carryover problems (icluded in the off-gas, which is ducted to the chemical
process plant), the use of a jumper pipe was considered to have an operational risk associated
with the jumper pipe technology. Because the jumper pipe would not reduce the particulate
carryover to the chemical process plant as would the Charging Emission Control Proposal
No. 1 equipment, Charging Emission Control Proposal No. I was selected over Charging
Emission Control Proposal No. 3.
The preferred LEPII component for the reduction of emissions from coke oven
loading (Charging Emission Control Proposal No. 1) incorporates a new charging car, coke
oven topside equipment, and land-based equipment. The preferred option was selected

because it technically achieves the 90% removal efficiency requirement for removing
particulates from the system and is less expensive than Charging Emission Control Proposal
No. 2. Charging Emission Control Proposal No. 3 removes the same amount and percentage
of particulates as do the other alternatives at a lower cost; however, it contains a certain
unacceptable risk because it retains the particulates in the system, and if the redesign of the
charging car does not reduce this existing carryover problem, operations will suffer as a
result.
4.1.1.2 Coke Unloading rrom Coke Ovens
Two alternatives (Pushing Emission Control Proposal No. 1 and No. 3) were also
analyzed in the feasibility study for the containment of emissions during the unloading of coke
into the coke oven quench cars.
As referenced above, Prishing Emission Control Proposal No. 2 was selected and
contained the aforementioned equipment. Pushing Emission Control Proposal No. 2 was
selected because it technically achieves the 98% removal efficiency demanded by the Benxi
EPB. Although Pushing Emission Control Proposal No. I has a 35% lower cost per tonne of
emission reduction, it cannot technically acbieve the 98% removal efficiency required by the
current regulating agency.
Similarly, the phased approach of Pushing Emission Control Proposal No. 3, which
wouid achieve a 94% removal efficiency in Phase I and a 98% removal efficiency in Phase UI,
was omitted because Phase I could not achieve the higher removal efficiency required by the
current regulating agency. In addition, Pushing Emission Control Proposal No. 3 would have
increased the capital cost of emission rediuction at the 98% removal efficiency because of a
reliance on international equipment.
The preferred method for reducing emissions from the coke unloading process
(Pushing Emission Control Proposal No. 2), which incorporates the aforcmentioned topside
and land-based system, was selected because it technically achieves the 98%. removal
efficiency required by the Benxi EPB. Although Pushing Emission Control Proposal No. I
has a 35% lower cost per tonne of emission reduction, it cannot technically achieve the
required 98% removal efficiency established by the current regulating agency. Similarly,
Pushing Emission Control Proposal No. 3 cannot initially achieve the mandated 98% removal
efficiency.

42 DRY ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATOR INSTALLATION AT BISC NO. 1 AND
NO. 2 BLAST FURNACES
The BISC blast furnaces are located in two areas of the City of Benxi. Blast furnaces
No. I and No. 2 are located in the BISC Xihu Factory area (see Figure 4-1).
The blast furnace project consists of the retrofit of two blast firnaces with dry-type
electrostatic precipitators. These furnaces currently employ wet scrubbing technology for the
removal of particulates. The retrofit will accomplish two operational objectives.
First, the existing wet scrubber system currently achieves a particulate concentration
of 30 milligrams per normalized cubic meter (mg/Nm3) of blast mrnace off-gases. This
concentration is too high for the existing BISC processes that make use of these off-gases and
is the primary reason these off-gases cannot currently be used. Second, by reducing the
particulate concenation level to 10 mg/Nm3 or less, .hose existing processes that make use
of off-gases would alsc benefit from the higher temperature of the off-gases, which is a result
of the elimination of the existing wet scmbber system. By first lowering the particulate gas
concentration and :hen incorporating the use of the higher temperature off-gases (e.g.,
sensible heat of the off-gas stem), the ambient air quality in Benxi and Liaoning Province
will be significandy improved.
Blast furnaces No. I and No. 2 are located in the BISC Xihu Factory area. Each
blast furnace has a volume of 380 cubic meters and the total combined annual production rate
is 611,000 tonnes of pig iron. The wet scrubbers to be replaced crrendy discharge
approximately 4.2 million tonnes of water annually into the- Taizi River. Tnis water contains
over 4.7 tonnes per year of cyanide, 2.0 tonnes per year of phenol, and 5,470 tonnes per year
of particulate. This project will reduce significant amounts of air conuminant emissions, and
will also substantially reduce the discharge of these contaminants into the Taizi River (BEAC
1992b).
The direct reduction in air contaminant emissions will result from a reduction in the
blast furnace gas currently being discharged into the atmosphere (approximately 130 million
Nm3 per year), and reductions in residential coal usage (approximately 45,400 tonnes per
year). The residential coal use reduction occurs because of the use of the treated 130 million
Nm3 per year of blast furnace gas used indirectly for residential cooking gas, which will
replace existing coal use. This will result in a reduction of over 16,000 tonnes of partikulates
and 1,500 tonnes of sulfur oxides per year. This project will also result in a total energy

savings and thus reduce the total amount of coal consumed by the two BISC facilities (E & E
1993a).
4.2.1  Altenatives for Dry Electroctatic Precipitator Installation at BISC No. 1 and No.
2 Blast Furnaces
The only alternative evaluated was the use of baghouse-type filters. This alternative
was DOt considered feasible because of the higher costs associated with designing such a
systm to conform with the existing operational conditions of the blast furnaces. The details
of this option are further discusud in the Environmental Assessment Report prepared by the
Beijing Environmental Impact Assessment Corporation (BEAC 1992b).
4.3 TRANSMISSION PIPELINE AND HEAT EXCHANGE STATIONS FOR THE
BENXI CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEM
The municipal residential central heating project is one of three heating supply
projects contained in the Benxi City heat supply master plan. Existing residential areas of
Benxi currently include approximately 5.6 million m2 of residential space requiring a
centralized heat supply (BEAC 1992e). Ihe individual residences in the Beuxi area are
currently heated by single residence boilers or family stoves. The fuel used to supply heat to
these individual residences is largely coal. Fuel use in these boilers and stoves is high -
because of the inefficiency of combustion in the heating units. Because of this low efficiency
of combustion coupled with the high number of residences buning coal without adequate dust
.jntrol, air pollution levels near the ground can be quite high. In an attempt to increase fuel
use efficiency and ameliorate the resulting high air po:lution levels, the proposed heating
supply project will incorporate a thermal power St2iSo and associated peak demand heafing
boilers (see number 11 on Figure 4-1 for the proposed location of the thermal power station).
This will increase the residential heating supply area by about 0.993 million m2. The
proposed project thermal power station will be located on Meitie Street in the Chaitun district.
The Chaitun centl heating system is one of the three central heating systems planned in the
downtown area of Benxi. The central heating systems will have the capacity to supply heat to
2.5 million m2 of residential housing as follows:
* 200,000 m2 Dongfen district,
*  520,000 m2 Xifen district,
4-f
ULIUiDTh EAm.m



*  400.000 m2 Xingkai district,
*  80,000 m2 Jiefang Street,
*  500,ODO m2 Chaitun district, and
*  800,000 m2 reserved for exp=sion along east bank of Taizi River.
Figure 4-2 depicts the proposed =rasmission pipeline network as of March 1993 for
supplying the aforementioned areas with heat, including the proposed location of the thermal
power station and all beat exchange stations. lhere have been minor changes in the "rfigu-
ration shown in Figure 4-2. However, the pipeline system still requires about 16.5 km
(supply and return) of total pipeline.
As a result of the November 1992 World Bank mission, the thernml pjwer station
and equipment will not be included in the Benxi Air Pollution Abatement program. The
thermal power station and related equipment will therefore be locally funded. The implemen-
tation of emission controls in the four new boilers proposed for the thermal power station will
provide he necessary heat and power to the proposed World Bank-funded central heating
district components, while substantially redlicing the amount of particulate and S02 emitted.
The peak demand boilers will be housed in a separate building adjacent to the thermal
power station building. All housing, boiler, and auxiliary equipment will be part of the [enxi
Air Pollution Abatenent program and funding will be requested from the World Bank.
43.1 Alternatives for Transmission Pipeline and Heat E;xchange Stations for the Baxi
Central Heating System
No feasible alternative to the proposed project was evaluated. The proposed system
pipeline was routed to best meet the needs of the consumers and concurrendy meet any
requirements necessary to meet efficiencies of facility operation. Impacts on the general
project area surroundings would not be lessened by rerouting the pipeline through different
areas of this urbanized section of the city.

4.4 ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFM OF BENX AIR pOLLUTION ABATEMENT
COMPONENTS
The air pollution abatesment projes proposed for finding in Benxi City will provide
a real benefit tO the environment and human hcalth by lowering air pollution levels caused by
industry and domestic fuel burning. Implemeptation of the three air pollution abatement
projects in Benxi will result in an improvement in air quality of 19.6% for particulates and
7.1 % for S02 (see Table 4-1). These emission reductions were provided in a engineering
feasibility report and were calculated by applying the bubble concept as discussed in Sectioc
2.6 of this EA (E & E 1993a). If No. 4 coke oven emission reduction control is not included
in the proposed subprojects, the effect will be negligible for both SO2 and particulate.
All calculations for emission reduction estimates used the bubble concept to the extent
that a proposed subproject would directly impact either another in-plant (e.g.. BISC
Guangyong facility) process or directly impact residenial coal consumption. In addition, the
physical and chemical properties of coal consumed in the City of Benxi were incorporated in
all air emission reduction calculations. The better quality coals were assumed to be consumed
in the manufacturing processes including the boilers used within the manufacturing facilities,
and the lower-grade coals by residential stoves and small residential boilers. Cooking gas
supplied to residential units was assumed to contain only minute concentrations of particulate
and sulfur and these were assumed to be zero in all calculations.
Other benefits of the Benxi APA projects will include the following:
D Elimination of waste blast fiunace gas emissions totaling up to 130
million m3/year into the atmosphere. This gas is proposed to be
used for fuel, following dust removal by the proposed dry electrostat-
ic precipitators.
- Elimination of 5,039,000 tonnes per year of untreated wastewater to
the Taizi River resulting from the wet dust-removal system currently
in use on blast furnaces No. 1 and No. 2. Elimination of this ulis-
charge will result in the reduction of 3,400 tonnes/year of suspended
solids, 2.0 tonnes/year of phenols, and 4.7 tonnes/year of cyanides.
Ihe dry solids collected are proposed to be used as a raw material at
a simer plant or c:ment plant.
*  Lower dust levels from improved operations.
* The central heating project will result in the elimination of 17 obso-
lete coal boilers and innumerable small domestic stoves.

*  The combustion of coal in small, inefficient residential boilers and
stoves will be phased out. This will result in an attendant improve-
meMnt in ground-level air quality, which, at present, can be quite
severe with the low stacks normally associated with residential stove
use.
4.5 ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF BENXI AIR POLLUTION
ABATEMENT COMPONENTS
Land Use
The proposed blast furnace and coke oven air pollution abatement projects in Benxi
will be lo-ated entirely within the factory boundaries of these facilities. Thus, there will be
no impact o:n existing land use. The proposed central heating district pipeline installation will
result in significant impacts during the construction period. Current land use along the
pipeline route, especially urban traffic, will be disrupted. However, no significant impacts to
land use will occur after construction is completed and the city streets are restored.
Waste Generation
Three of the Benxi APA projects will produce waste streams as a result of operation
of the control devices. The blast furnace retrofit project will result in the production of
precipitated dust. This material will be collected and sent to a cement factory and sinter
plant. Blast furnace gas will also be used in the steel-making process and will not be vented
into the atmosphere. Coal dust collected from coke oven operations following implementation
of the coal loading/unloading project will be transported for use at a sintering plant.
Because the waste products generated from the Benxi air projects will be either recycled or
disposed of at specially designed facilities, no adverse effects will resuit.

5. DALIAN AREA COMPONENTS OF LEPII
The City of Dalian is located at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula in
southeast Liaoning Province. A primary issue regarding water quality in Dalian is the
contamination of the two high-use areas, i.e., Heishijiao Bight ard Dalian Bay. Heishijiao
Bight is a scenic andi recreational coastal area that is also used for aquaculture. The major
flow into this bay comes f.-om the Malan River. West Bay of Dalian Bay forms the harbor
for Dalian. lze major flow into this bay comes from the Chunliu River, Bulao Gou, and
Zhoushui Gou.
5.1 CEHUNLU/fMALAN RIVER WASTEWATER TREATMENT COMPONENT
The City of Dalian has tentatively identified eight wastewater treatment projects for
future development. These projects have been prioritized by flow, with the largest being the
Malan River (190,000 m3/day) followed by Chunliu (120,000 m3lday). The LEPll will
concentration on these two areas as subcomponents of its ChunliulMalan River wastewater
treatment component. At present, the only existing treatment facilities are in Chunliu; these
facilities are not being used to capacity. To maximize efficiency at the Chunliu facility, sewer
interceptor capacity will be expanded and the facility will be upgraded. The City of Dalian is
proposing to reuse a portion of the treated effluent at Chunliu in adjacent industrial plants.
The primary users will be the adjacent power plant for cooling water, as well as nearby
rubber and steel plants. Evenually, the city anticipates reuse of all Chunliu treated effluent.
5.1.1 Chunliu Wastewater Treatment Plant
The Chunliu wastewater treatment plant, which is a secondary activated sludge plant
located in the northwest part of Dalian City (see Figure 5-1), treats mainly domestic effluen,

which, following treatment, is discharged into the West Bay of Dalian Bay. Although the
existing facility is designed to treat 60,000 m31day, only 15,000 m31day of wastewater is
actually available for treatment because the current sewage collection system is inadequate.
The LEP[I upgrading will consist of the construction of interceptors that will transport a flow
of 32,000 m3/day from the Bulao Gou outfall south of Chunliu and 14,000 m3lday from the
Zhoushui Gou north of Chunliu to the Chunliu treatment plant. These new interceptors will
more than provide the increased sewage flows necessary to m et the design capacity of the
Chunliu wastewater treatment plant. Effluent mix will be approximately 50% domestic
sewage and 50% industrial sewage.
Tbe proposed interceptors will be designed to accommodate future 'lows for a Phase
1 expansion at the Chunliu facility. This expansion will increase the plant s capacity to an
average flow of 120,00D m3Jday. Tbe Phase I south interceptor, which will be a 700-mm-
diameter force main, will gather the flow of the Bulao Gou and extend 600 meters to the
existing interceptor that connects to the Chunliu plant. Flows from the Zhoushui Gou will be
collected at a proposed pump station and pumped through a 600-mm-diameter force main for
715 meters followed by a 600-mm-diameter gravity sewer for 375 meters. The gravity sewer
will then be increased in size to 1,000-mm diameter for the final 360 meters to the Chunliu
plant.
5.1.1.1 Environmental Benefits of Chunfiu Wastewater Treatment Subcomponent
Improvements in the operating-efficiency at the existing Chunliu wastewater treatment
plant will provide positive benefits for the Dalian area. Wastewater that is currendy being
discharged direcdy into Dalian Bay will be diverted to the Chuwliu plant for treatment. Thus,
the Chunliu plan; will be able to use its currently unused available capacity and prevent this
untreated effluent from reaching Dalian Bay. In addition, the proposed Chunliu subcompo-
nent of the LEPII will have a beneficial impact on local water quality.
Presently, 10,000 m3/day of treated wastewater from the Chunliu plant is recycled for
industrial use within Dalian. This same volume will continue to be recycled following
completion of the LEPI projects. Note that following completion of the Phase nI plant
expansion mentioned above (not a part of LEPIH), up to 50,000 m3iday of treated effluent
may be recycled, fuirther ameliorating the local water supply prol.lem (McRae 1993).

west side is bordered by the Malan River, while the west slope of Baiyun Hill is located to
the east.
The treatment process selected for the Malan River wastewater treatment plant will
consist of a preliminary system of screening and degritting followed by secondzry treatment.
Secondary treatment will be biological batch reaction using the oxidation ditch activated-
sludge process. Wastewater to be treated will likely consist of 50% domestic and 50%
industrial wastewaters (SAE 1993c). The major pollutants are BOD5, COD, suspended
solids, NH3, and oil with trace amounts of heavy metals, phenol, and benzene.
The plant will be designed to treat an average flow of 70,000 m3/day with a peak
flow of approximately 90,000 m3/day. Following secondary treatment, there will be
additional clarifying and sludge dewatering facilities associated with the overall wastewater
treatment construction.
Sludge production is anticipated to be approximately 14 tonnes/day dry solids at 20%
solids content by weight. The feasibility study states that all screenings, grits, and dewatered
sludge will be disposed of at a properly designed and secured landfill (SAE 1993c). It is
anticipated that the sludge will be transported to the Maoyingzi Landfill discussed herein
(DUT 1992).
The treated effluent either will be pumped into a proposed I l-kn pipeline for
industrial reuse or discharged into the Malan River. The proposed water reuse pipeline will
extend in a northerly direction parallel to the Malan River, with distribution spurs connecting
to various industrial users along the route. It is anticipated thza: approxinmely 22,000 m3/day
of treated effluent will be recycled, with the remainder discharged to the Malan River.
Eventually, up to 44,000 m3/day of treated effluent will be recycled.
5.1.2.1 Alternatives for Malan River Wastewater Treatment Subcomponent
Three system alternatives were analyzed for the Malan River subcomponent of this
project. TMese included: (1) Far-sea discharge of wastewater without treatment; (2) Offshore
discharge after primary treatment at 3.9 km from shore; and (3) Offshore discharge after
primary treatment at 1.0 km from shore. Alternative I would require a discharge pipeline
extending approximately 7 km into Heishijiao Bight. Because removing only the solid,
floatable debris prior to discharge is not environmentally sound, Alternative I was not consid-
ered further.

Both Alternatives 2 and 3 would meet the water quality standards necessary for
discharge into Heishijiao Bight. However, Alternative 3, which is within the coastal scenic
water zone as designated by the Dalian municipal government, would require additional
diffuser ports with a longer diffuser. In addition, water depth at the 1,000-meter offshore
point is only 8 meters in depth. This would result in a visible wastewater plume on the
surface at all times, which would negatively impact the coastal scenic water zone (SAE
1993c).
Alternative 2 would also require additional diffuser parts. However. even though the
wastewater plume would not be visible, the discharge point lies within the expanded aquacul-
ture zone as designated by the Dalian Municipal Government. Tberefore, this alternative was
not selected.
5.1.2.2 Environmental Benerits of Malan River Wastewater Treatment Subcomponent
Implementation of the proposed Malan River wastewater treatment plant project will
have a beneficial effect on the Dalian environment. Much of the sewage now being dis-
charged untreated to the Malan River will be intercepted and will receive preliminary and
secondary treatment prior to discharge. This will result in an immediate improvement in
surface water quality at the mouth of the Malan River and will lessen the loading of pollutants
into Heishijiao Bight. Predictions have shown that pollutant concentration in the discharge of
the Malan River to Heishijiao Bight will be below the discharge standards for seawater quality
in Liaoning Province (SAE 1993c; DUT 1993a). This positive impact will have a beneficial
effect upon the aquaculture industry in the Bight, and will prevent the deterioration of tourist
areas along the Dalian area beachfront. This improvement will include clearer water
conditions as well as lower infectious bateria concentraions.
In addition to the improved water quality in Heishijiao Bight, the Iccal water supply
will be enhanced by the recycling of up to 22,000 m3/day of treated effluent for industrial
reuse. This, in itself, will result in lower pollutant loadings to the Malan River.

5.1.23 Adverse Environmental Impacts of Malan River Wastewater Treatment
Subcomponent
Land Use
The Malan River wastewater trcatment plant in Dalian will be located in an industri-
alllight industrial area adjacent to the Malan River. Development of the 5-bectarc site will
preclude use of the site for industrial purposes. However, the new use will be compatible
with surrounding uses.
The interceptor sewers associated with these wastewater treatment projects will cause
disruption to current land use during construction. However, once construction of these
sewer facilities is completed, current land use will again be permitted.
Waste Generation
The sludge from the Malan River treaument plant and the Chunliu wastewater
treatment plant will be disposed of at the Maoyingzi Landfill. Because this landfill will be
properly designed, there will be no adverse impacts resulting from disposal of sludge from
these two treatment plants.
Construction Impacts
It is expected that air quality will be affected during construction of the proposed
facilities. Temporary increases in dust from construction and combustion products fram
construction machinery are inevitable. These will be short-tem effects, however, and should
be of no significant adverse consequence in the construction areas. Constuction dust can be
controlled by the periodic wettng of construction areas through the use of spray equipment
and water trucks.
Ambient sound levels in the areas of construction will also increase temporarily
because of the operation of construction equipment. Sound level increases associated with
construction should be slight znd confined to the construction areas. Construction activities
are expected to result in typical ambient sound levels of 65 to 77 dB(A), with peaks of
possibly 8 I to 90 dB(A) within 100 feet of heavy construction equipment. If necessary,
construction workers will wear hearing protection to mitigate the effects of construction noise
at the sites. These elevated construction sound levels will cease following the completion of
construction, resulting in no long-term adverse impacts to workers or nearby residents.

Sewer construction will result in short-term adverse effects. During construction,
strets and other construction areas will require temporary shutdowns and detours, causing
temporary inconveniences to people who use these areas. However, once construction is
completod, streets and sidewalks will be repaired and open areas will be regraded, allowing
use of these areas for activities that do not interfere with sewer operation, such as transporta-
tion and agriculture. In generao, buildings should not be constructed over sewer lines because
such construction could interfere with sewer operation.
5.2 DAIUAN SOLED WASIE COMPONENT
The City of Dalian is located in the southern portion of Liaodong Peninsula of the
Liaoning Province. Dalian has been a key city of industry, foreign trade, and economic
development. The main types of industry are machinery manufacturing, refinery, metallurgy,
textile, and light industry. Dalian has recently established a special economic development
zone and is currently experiencing rapid and extensive development in its 10-km2 area. With
the establishment of the special economic development zone and the increasing population, the
amount of solid waste generated by Dalian City will continue to increase.
Since February 1988, Dalian City area municipal wastes hve bee disposed of in the
Phase I portion of the Maoyingzi Landfill site. Prior to the stan-up of Phase I operations,
Dalian had disposed of its wastes in two main sites located along dhc western side of Suoyu
Buy, both of which have been filled to capacity. Neither the previous disposal sites nor the
first phase of the Maoyingzi Landfill site were designed or constructed with environmcntal
mitigation control features (i.e., leachate collection, bottom liner, cap, gas collection, etc.).
Problems were also noted in landfill operation, solid waste collection, and transportation
systems, which have resulted in environmental problems.
To prevent fitre envronmental problems caused by amproper solid waste disposal,
the Dalian municipal goverment is proposing to design, build, and operate an imprcved
sanitary landfill called Maoyingzi Landfill, which will be loc.ted at Jinzbou Bay, southwest of
Jinzhou Dis:rict. Ihe Dalian Municipal Government proposes tu rebuild the Suoyu Bay
Central Transfer Station, which is located near the Suoyu Bay, approximately 25 hm from the
Maoyingzi Landfill. Both of these component are pat of the LEPT -WVorld Bank project and
are shown in Figure 5-1.
eun_6 Dana.1 IA4~U~3FI                         5-8



Operation of the Suoyu Bay Central Transfer Station was initiated in February 1991.
The transfer station occupies an area of 50,000 m2 and currently is transferring about 1,300
tonnes of solid waste per day, approximately 85% of the total municipal solid waste generated
in Dalian City. The existing central transfer station was designed for open-air operation, and
provides no waste processing or compaction. The wastes are dumped onto the ground,
reloaded into larger trucks (S to 10 tonnes) by front-end loaders, and then transported to
Maoyingzi Landfill.
Tne existing transfer station was not designed for storage. However, because the
wastes cannot be transported to the landfill during bad weather conditions, solid wastes are
accumulated at the transfer station. Average detention time of wastes in the transfer station is
between 10 to 15 days before being transponed to the landfill. The existing site is very dusty
and produces very strong odors, which cause environmental problems in the area and health
problems to the employees and the 50 to 60 licensed scavengers searching through the
accumulated solid wastes for recyclable materials (E & E 1993b).
Although natural fermentation in the accumulated solid waste piles may have resulted
in some waste volume reduction, this uncontrolled process also causes serious environmental
problems. For exarmple, heat generated from fermentation causes spontaneous fires in the
waste pile. In addition, because no surface water co;iection system was constructed in the
existing central transfer station, leachate from the accumulated solid waste piles flows directly
into Suoyu Bay, causing pollution in the coastal area.
The Suoyu Bay Central Transfer Station reconstruction project has been designed to
transfer an average of 1,500 tonnes of solid waste per day with a maximum daily capacity of
2,000 tonnes. The transfer/storage building will have a 2,500-m2 storage area, which will
provide a storage capacity of 2,000 tonnes of solid waste. Two stationary compaction
systems will be used at the Suoyu Bay Central Transfer Station.
During normal operational conditions, collection trucks and transport vehicles from
local transfer stations will unload the waste to the compaction system loading heppers.
Stationary compactors will then compact the solid wastes into 20-m3 trailers, increasing the
average density of the waste from 420 kg/m3 to 800 kg/m3. The 20-m3 trailers will then be
hauled by 20-tonne tractor trucks to Maoyingzi Landfill. During bad weather conditions,
when the waste canmot be transported to the landfill, the waste will be dumped in the storage

area. Solid wastes in the storage area can then be loaded to loading hoppers using a proposed
overhead crane with a clamshell bucket.
Approximately 75 m3/day of leachate will be generated if there is compaction of the
solid waste at the transfer station. If necessary, this liquid waste will be collected and stored
in a 200-m3 leachate collection basin and then pumped and discharged to the nearby Chunliu
Wastewater Treatment Plant.
Finally, to improve the working conditions in the transferstorage building, a venting
system. will be installed. The proposed system will provide a venting capacity of 30,000 m3
air flow per hour.
The proposed Maoyingzi Landfill site is approximately 30 kin north of the Dalian
City area on the west coast of the Dalian peninsula. lt is bordered on the northwest by
Jinzhou Bay, an inlet of the Bohai Sea, and is south of the mouth of the Hongqi River. Much
of the site was formerly used for salt ponds (for salt production by the evaporation of
seawater) and prawn farm ponds. Consequently, much of the proposed landfill site is at or
below sea level and is separated from Jinzhou Bay by an earthen dike with sluice gates to the
ponds. Extensive mud flats, more than I km wide at low tide, fringe the bay.
The proposed first phase of construction will commence at the south end of the site,
which is currently being operated as a landfill area. The Phase I area will be approximatdy
5.0 km2 and will consist of a first stage and a second stage. The first stage of the landfill
will be located on the northwest side of the Shenyang-vDalian Highway and has a total area of
2.2 km2. A 1.18 km2 portion of the first stage area will be used as the area for the
construction of an engineered landfill. The second stage, which is located on the south side
of the highway and has a total area of 2.8 kn2, has been designated as an excavation area for
landfill cover materials, topsoil, and a potential clay source for use in the construction of the
liner and/or cap. This second stage area has been tentatively proposed for ftiure use as a
landfilling area.
The first stage of the Maoyingzi Landfill is expected to receive solid wastes from
1988 to 2010. The average solid waste filling heights in the first stage area will range from
4 meters to 8 meters. Based on a domestic waste generation rate of 1,500 tonnes/day and a
first stage landfill capacity totaling 12,300,000 tonnes, the remaining first stage service period
is estimated to be approximately 16 to 18 years.

eU1W DaIn EAAOUl3.F3



The 1.18 km2 area proposed for the engineered landfill has been divided into seven
major filling areas. The existing abandoned shrimp ponds will be used in the construction of
the Maoyingzi Landfill to the greatest extent possible, with each shrimp pond acting as a
landfill cell. There are approximately 25 shrimp ponds located in the 1.18-km2 area. Most
of the shrimp ponds are rectangular, varying somewhat in size and shape, but averaging
approximately 125 meters by 350 meters. Design of the landfill includes a 0.5-metr clay
liner and a leachate collection system. Landfill design also includes a day cap, methane gas
vents, and a vegetative cover.
It is anticipated that the leachate collection will consist of perforated pipe that will be
placed within a leachate collection layer of screened construction debris immediately on top of
each cell liner. Design of the system will ensure that clogging does not take place through
closure of the facility. The leachate will move through this collection system to a sump.
From this sump the leachate will then either be recycled back onto the landfill or moved to a
storage pond. Because there are two months in a normal year when precipitation exceeds
evaporation, more leachate may be produced than can be evaporated from the landfill area.
Therefore, the excess will be stored temporarily in a storage pond until dryer months,
allowing total recirculation to the landfill. At this time, no leachate treatment system is
planned.
Gas collection vents will also be installed. The largest component of landfill gases
produced during waste breakdown is metbane. Methane is generally considered by the
scientific community as a significant contributor to global warming. This gas must be
controlled so that gas pockets, explosions and fires, and general discharge to the atmosphere
can be avoided. The burning or flaring of methane produces carbon dioxide and water, which
does not contribute as much to the warming cycle as does methane. The landfill gas
collection system will consist of two i.5-meter-diameter stone-filled wells located at each
intersection of the leachate collection drains. There will be at least two wells or vents per
landfill cell. These vents will then be either fitted with a system that allows for flaring of the
methane, or connected to a gatliering system that allows for the collection and use of the
methane as a fele soufc.

5.2.1 Alternatives for Dalian Solid Waste Component
Two alternatives for solid waste disposal were evaluated by the Dalian University of
Technology (DUT). These included incineration and composting. The DUT Envirowmental
Impact Report evaluates these alternatives and indicates that landfilling is the most feasible
alternative.
The proposed landfill development includes improvements and expansion of the
existing Maoyingzi Landfili at Jinzhou Bay. Because the proposal includes the use of dhe
existing landfill area, no alternative sites were identified or reviewed. Likewise, the Suoyu
Bay Transfer Station, which is a part of this proposal, entails improvement of the existing
solid waste transfer facility at this location. Therefore, no alternative transfer station locations
were analyzed.
5.2.2 Environmental Benefits or Dalian Solid Waste Component
Further and proper development of the Maoyingzi Landfill will benefit the Dalian
area by providing a secure location for the disposal of solid wastes, including domestic waste,
construction debris, and nonhazardous industrial wastes. Over the 20-year life of the landfill,
it is predicted that these wastes will average approximately 1,500 tonnes/day, 500 tonnes/day,
and 625 tonnes/day, respectively. Without the development of the Maoyingzi Landfill, Dalian
will not have facilities necessary to properly control these waste streams (E & E 1993b).
Another benefit of proper landfill design and implementation, along with the
associated improvement in the existing landfill, is the prevention of deterioration of ground-
water quality, as well as seawater quality in Jinzhou Bay. In addition, the improvements
proposed at the Suoyu Bay Transfer Station will result in lower discharges of leachate and
polluted runoff into the Suoyu Bay area in Dalian Bay. This will have a positive impact on
the bay's fishery resource, which is of prime importance to the economy of the Dalian region.
There will be a general improvement in the Dalian urban environment upon imple-
mentation of the solid waste project. New, larger, more efficient refuse collection bins and
collection vehicles will result in less littering, a reduction in foui odors emanating from
previously uncontained refuse, replacement of overflowing open bins. and less refuse
collection traffic. Air pollution and noise caused by the presently used collection vehicles will
be reduced because larger, more operationally efficient vehicles will be used. In addition to
controlling runoff at the Suoyu Bay Transfer Station, improvements made at this location will
eaXiw_Dan-a7EA,MnGIIW FI                     5-12



also reduce the production of foul odors, as well as eliminate the smoke from fires that
frequently occur at the existing dump.
These activities will have a positive benefit upon public health by the elimination of
uncontrolled waste disposal. Smoke from uncontrolled burning, which may cause respiratory
problems, will be eliminated. The containerizing of exposed refuse and garbage will greatly
reduce breeding grounds for insects and vermin, which can become disease vectors. By
making these improvements, the Dalian urban environment will be more aesthetically
pleasing. Such improvements may actually stimulate the movement of additional businesses
and tourism into the region.
As mentioned above, the Maoyingzi Landfill will minimize runoff and leachate
flowing into Jinzhou Bay. The wastes will be compacted and placed in cells, and covered
with soil. The depth of the landfill will be increased from the present 4 me,ers to 11.5 meters
or more. This will result in preservation of valuable land, and will result -m the elimination
of smoke from wild fires, as well as the reduction of foul odors from decomposing wastes.
In addition, a buffer zone with trees and a constructed berm between the highway and the
landfill will shield the landfill from view. This will have a positive benefit of reducing or
eliminating any aesthetically displeasing aspects of the landfill operation, including the
nuisance of blowing dust, paper, and plasticz.
It is anticipated that landfill gases will be controlled via a system of wells. The gases
will be collected and either used for fuel or flared. Decomposing material contributes to the
emission of methane to the atmosphere. Methane is believed to be a significant contributor to
the global warnming phenomenon. Therefore, construction of the proposed landfill with a
landfill gas control system will provide an additional positive benefit by eliminating a current
and future source of pollutant that may be contributing to this global atmospheric degradation.
Another positive benefit of constructing improved facilities at the Suoyu Bay Transfer
Station and the Maoyingzi Landfill is the reduction or elimination of uncontrolled refuse
picking and scavenging. Although this can be an important in :hat reusable and recyclable
material is recovered from the discarded wastes, scavengers may be exposed to health risks.
More importantly, they can become transmitters of diseases that could infect a much larger
population. Thus, disease transmission will be reduced once this scavenging activity is
prohibited.

52.3 Adverse Environmental hnpacts of Dalian Solid Waste Component
land Use
Ihe Dalian solid waste landfill will be located in a 5-kmCD area that was previously
used for salt and prawn production. The change in land use to a landfill will not adversely
affect. :he area if properly designed and constructed. The Suoyu Bay Transfer Station will be
located on the site of the existing transfer station and will not result in land use changes.
Sodoeconomics
The proposed solid waste system will have a negative impact on the approximately
100 scavengers that currently make their living by remcving recyclable material from the
waste deposited at the transfer station and landfill. Upon implementation of the proposed
solid waste system, these people will lose this econorric opportunity; it is estimated that the
scavengers currently earn an average of approximately RMB 200 per month. The State will
have to incur the costs to support these individuals as well as the cost of having to replace the
materials recovered during the scavenging effort. In addition, there will be increased costs
inmrred in disposal of the waste that is presently recovered, which makes up approximately
2% of the total municipal solid waste stream.

6. JINZHOU AREA COMPONENT OF LEPH
6.1    JINZHOU WATER SUPPLYIJINCHENG PAPER MELL WATER POLLUTION
CONTROL
The City of Jinzhou is situated in the southwest part of Liaoning Province, bordered
on the east by Shenyang and Panjing and on the north by Fuxin and Jinxi. The south portion
of Jinzhou borders along Liaodong Bay of the Bohai Sea. The municipality of Jinzhou is
located approxiately 20 kn north of the Bohai Sea on the Xiaoling River. The Jincheng
Paper Mill is in Jincheng Town, which is located on the Daling River and is approximately 25
km northeast of the Jinzhou municipality.
Thbe City of Jinzhou's water supply is currently obtained from groundwater sources.
The city obtains water from seven waterworks areas or municipal well fields that can deliver a
total of 266,500 m3/day (SAE 1993g). Many of the industries in Jinzhou have also developed
groundwater wells for their own use. It is estimated that they supply approximately 350,000
m3/day (SAE 1993g).
Of the seven municipal well fields, five are drawing water from shallow aquifers
through which flow the Xiaoling and Nuer Rivers. These aquifers are primarily recharged by
river flow and are direcly influenced by runoff conditions, rainfall, fluctuations in the two
rivers between wet and dry seasonal flow rates, and industrial pollution. Four of the seven
sources are within the municipality limits and risk becoming contaminated because of
inadequate or insufficient wastewater treamnent. Groundwater pollution also goes beyond the
city limits, and the Bozi water source is now in danger of contamination in the near future
(see Figure 6-1) (SAE 1993e).
The City of Jinzhou is anticipating additional industrial development and population in
the urban area, especially in designated development zones. However, based on the existing
water system capacity tO supply domestic and industrial needs, there will be shortages in

water supply that will inhibit further industrial growth. Compounding this problem will be
the possible abandonment of existing supply areas as they eventually become contaminated.
Even though the City of Jinzhou is planning wastewater treatment projects in the near future,
a new waterworks project has been formulated that will provide new supply to enhance the
existing capacity of the city's system, as well as provide the needed capacity for future supply
requirements (SAE 1993t).
The first stage in increasing water supplies for Jinzhou is to develop a new municipal
well field near Ludan adjacent to the west bank of the Daling River (see Figure 6-2). This
waterworks project is aimed at extracion of up to 100,000 m3lday. The well field will be
constructed approximately 500 meters inland from the Daling River flood protection dike.
The proposed project will consist of the following facilities:
.* Sixteen inline wells located on agricultural land 400 meters to S0
meters apart and drilled to bedrock at depths ranging from 55 meters
to 67 meters (two of the wells will be used for standby, operating
approximately 11.75% of the time);
*  A pipeline gathering system consisting of 300-mm to 600-mm cast
iron pipe totaling a length of 7,340 meters;
* A booster pumping station located on firmland near Baduan Village
requiring a total area of 3.3 hectares, including two regulating
reservoirs of 1.500 m3 each;
* A 1,200-mm-diameter, 21-km-long water supply pipeline constructed
of prestressed, reinforced concrete pipe from the booster pumpmg
station at Baduan to the existing Daamu water treatnent plant;
* A new treatment facility and pump station on farmland adjacent to
the existing Damu water treatment plant and occupying a 2.2-hectare
site with a capacity to handle up to 70,000 m31day (30,000 m31day
of existing plant and pump station capacity will also be used for the
proposed water supply expansion project); and
*  A 1,200-mm-diameter steel pipeline approximately 275 meters long.
The Damu pump station currently pumps water through two existing
700- and 800-mm-diameter pipelines over a ridge at the Shankon
Reservoir and into Jinzhou City. A 275-meter tunnel will be con-
structed through the top of the ridge at an elevation of 65 meters to
reduce the Liead of the Damu pumps by 18 meters. Ihe 1,200-mm
diamneter steel pipeline will be laid through the tunnel to connect to
the .- o existing pipelines at each end of the tunnel.

The Jincheng Paper Mill is located on the Daling River upstream of the proposed
municipal well field development. The paper mill discharges up to 55,310 n3l/day of
industrial wastewater into the Daling River (SAE 1993e), which makes the mill the largest
single discharge point on the river (CRAES 1992). As stated above, the Daling River
provides the majority of recharge to the groundwater aquifer, including the aquifer proposed
for well field development. Continued discharge from the Jincheng Paper Mill thus places the
downstream wells at risk of contamination. Because of the possibility of contaminating the
proposed well water field, this project has been designed to include amelioration of the water
pollution from the JiLcheng Paper Mill.
-The proposed pollution abatement project will be performed in two phases, the first
of which is a part of the LEPII. This phase will consist of reducing wastewater flow from the
pulp workshop, reprocessing white water from the paper-making workshop, and the produc-
tion of charcoal in the reed-cutting process. The reed is the basic raw material used at the
Jincheng Paper Mill. The project will produce the following results:
*  Recovery of the red liquor used to produce 150,000 tonnes per year
of adhesives or lignosulphonate binders (CRAES 1992);
* Dail' purification of 30,000 tonnes of white water from paper mak-
ing, resulting in the annual recovery of 4,600 tonnes of fiber and
8,000 tonnes of talc (CRAES 1992); and
*  Recovery of reed dust, i.e., reed chip fines, to be processed into
charcoal at an annual rate of up to 4,0n0 tonnes (CRAES 1992).
Based on Stanley Engineering's feasibility study, the proposed activities will result in
a reduction in wastewater discharge from 55,310 m3/day to 31,645 m3/day, or a reduction of
42.8%. There will also be a reduction in discharged suspended solids from 87.44 tonnes/day
to 29.76 tonnes/day, or approximately 65.97%. This will effectively reduce COD from
184.77 tonnes/day to 22.65 tonnes/day, or approximately 87.74% (SAE 1993e).
It is anticipated that further reductions in pollutant discharge will result from the
installation of a wastewater treatment plant at the Jincheng Paper Mill. This Phase II
pollution abatement project, which is not a part of the current LEPI proposal, would consist
of a water treatment facility providing screening, primary clarification, and secondary
treatment using an aerated stabilization basin with secondary clarification. This system would
further reduce suspended solids discharged to 2-98 tonneslday, which is 90% less thn the

proposed LEPII reduction in suspended solids of 29.76 tonnes/day. There would also be an
attendant 66.89% reduction in COD to 7.50 tonnes/year. A Phase II project, therefore,
would result in total reductions from current pollutant levels of 96.59% for suspendod solids
and 95.94% for COD (SAE 1993e).
6.1.1 Alternatives for Jinzhou Water Supplyljincheng Paper Mill Water Pollution
Control Component
The feasibility report for this project states that the best alternative for enhancement
of an area's water supply is development of groundwater resources (SAE 1993g). These are
considered the least expensive to develop and in this particular case, groundwater develop-
ment was the first stage in a water resource development plan.
No other feasible water resource alternatives were identified for this phase of the
Jinzhou water development plan. A site known as the Jinling Reservoir, which is located
upstream of Jinzhou on the Xiaoling River, has been identified for future development. An
area east of the Daling River could be slated for development as a water supply; however,
this area is farther from Jinzhou than the proposed development near Ludan west of the
Daling River.
No feasible altemative facility locations for the water supply development have been
identified. In addition to the proposed method of reducing water pollutant discharge from the
lincheng Paper Mill as discussed in this section, three alternative methods were evaluated (see
the Environmental Impact Assessment prepared by the Chinese Research Academy of
Enviromental Sciences). These methods were: (1) Convert the existing manufcturing
process from acid pulping to sulfate pulping; (2) Install a secondary treatment system for
wastewater at the mill; and (3) Divert the wastwater flow.
Alternative 1 would allow efficiencies in the recovery of a high percentage of waste
product. However, additional renovations would be necessary for extraction, evaporation,
combustion, dust collection, and multibleaching. Because such renovations would be as costly
as construction of a completely new paper mill, this alternative was considered infeasible.
Alternative 2 was also found to be prohibitively expensive.
Alternative 3 consists of diverting the current wastewater flow via a 1.0-meter-
diameter, 35-kn pipeline into the Daling River downsteam of the proposed groundwater
development project area. Even though this method would protect the Ludan area aquifer
6-6



from polluted recharge water discharged from the Jincheng Paper Mill, it would fail to reduce
the overall amount of pollution currently entering the Daling River and the coastal waters at
the mouth of the river. Therefore, this alternative was also considered inferior to the
proposed method of pollution abatement.
6.1.2 Environmental wenefits of Jinzhou Components
The current water-supply system in Jinzhou is not able to provide necessary volumes,
and likely will not be able to meet the increasing demands as the economy develops and
additional volume is needed. It is predicted that the present water system will fall short of
required volumes by 98,900 m3 per day by 1995. The benefit of implementing the proposed
water-supply project is that this shortfall in needed daily supply will be offset and will assist
in allowing economic development to occur with attendant increases in the area's standard of
living.
The Jincheng Paper Mill pollution abatement project will have a positive benefit in
reducing the pollution load of the Daling River, which is the major recharge source of the
Xiaoling-Daling alluvial fan aquifer. 'he project will reduce the discharge of COD by 162.12
tonnes/day (87.74%), suspended solids by 57.68 tonnes/day (65.97%), and wastewater by
23,665 m3/day (42.8%) (SAE 1993c). This pollutant reduction will, in effect, protect the
Laduan groundwater source by reducing the probability of impact resulting from paper mill
effluet. In addition, following implemetation of the TLEPI facilities, fresh water consump-
tion at the paper mill will be reduced by 21,300 m3lday, which will increase the availability
of water, for which demand in the region has been increasing (SAE 1993e).
6.1.3 Adverse Environmental Impacts of Jinzhou Components
Land Use
The Jinzhou water supply project will result in adverse impacts by converting
approximately 4 to 5 hectares of farmland to use as a pumping station, a water treatment plam
addition, and water welihead facilities. However, this conversion of farmland will not signifi-
cantly affect the overall farm output of the Jinzhou region. The pipeline associated with this
project will result in no permanent change in land use. Following pipeline installation, land
uses in effect prior to construction will be allowed to resume. However, future development
6-7
recycled paper                                           colog and envronwncnl



in the water pipeline right of way will be precluded. It is not anticipated that any resettlement
will be required as a result of the proposed projects. However, farmers will be compensated
by the local authorities for any short-term reductions in crop production as a result of
installation of the pmposed water supply pipeline and gathering system, as well as for land
taken permanently out of production for the aboveground well facilities, pumping station, and
water treatment plant addition.
Waste Generation
Implementation of the Jinzhou water supply project will result in increased water use
and associated industrial developmen. The increased industrial water use will then result in
the generation of increasod wastewater. Adverse incremental effects to groundwater and
surface water quality could occur as a result of the increase in wastewater. However, these
effects would be mitigated by future improvements to the local wastewater collection and
treatment system, which are in the planning stages and will be implemented as domestic and
industrial development in the area increases. One wastewater treatment lagoon and three
separate wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are planned for future development. lt is
anticipated that the lagoon, with a planned capacity of 1,000,000 m3, would operate aerobi-
cally and provide retention of approximately 68 hours. One WWTP with a capacity of
200,000 m3/day would be located near the lagoon to assist the lagoon with primary treatment.
Two other WWTPs using secondary treatment and with capacities of 50,000D m3day each
would be situated at other sites within Jinzhou. Ihese facilities are not a part of LEPII and
are briefly discussed in the project feasibility study (SAE 1993g).
Construction Impacts
It is expected that air quality will be affected during construction of the proposed
facilities. Temporary increases in dust from construction and combustion products from
construction machinery are inevitable. Construction impacts will be short-term and can be
mitigated. For example, construction dust can be cDntrolled by the periodic wetting of
construction areas through the use of spray equipment and water trucks.
Ambient sound levels in the areas of construction will also increase temporarily
because of the operation of construction equipment. Sound level increases associated with
construction should be slight and confined to the construction areas. Construction activities
6-8
UUl W7. A4M3E)FI



are expected to result in typical ambient sound levels of 65 to 77 dB(A), with peaks of
possibly SI to 90 dB(A) within 100 feet of heavy construction equipment. If necessary,
construction workers will wear hearing protection to mitigate the effects of construction noise
at the sites. Thesc elevated construction sound levels will cease following the completion of
construction, resulting in no long-term adverse impacts to workers or nearby residents.
Pipeline construction will result in short-term adverse effects. During construction,
roads and other construction areas may require temporary shutdowns and detours, causing
temporary inconveniences to people who use these areas. However, once construction is
completed, roads will be repaired and open areas will be regraded, allowing use of these areas
for activities that do not interfere with pipeline operations, sucb as agriculture. In general,
buildings should not be constructed over water pipelines because sucb construction could
interfere with pipeline operations.

7. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING
Appropriate enviromnental controls will be incorporated into all construction contracts
to ensure that the magnitude and extent of inpacts to the enviromnent that could occur as a
result of construction will be minimized. The contraczs, under the supervision of the locally
responsible agencies or bureaus, will be committed to the implementation of any and all
mitigative measures outlined in the construction contracts. Table 7-1 identifies those agencies
responsible for assuring compliance with environmental regulations during both construction
and operation for each component project of the LEPI.
Environmental monitoring following construction will consist of air monitoring,
groundwater monitoring, or surface water monitoring during facility operation, depending on
the specific component project. Monitoring responsibilities are shown in Table 7-1. The type
and extent of required monitoring for each component project are discussed in detail in the
respective individual environmenl impact assessment reports prepared by the local Chinese
institutes and each project feasibility sudy prepared by the various consultants.

been developed by the National EPA (Naiional Standards are only used when provincial
standards have not been formulated). These standards are known as the Environmental
Quality Standards for Surface Waters (EQSSW) and are applicable to open bodies of water.
For rivers, the EQSSW apply to water quality after mixing and diluting with the river water.
nhe EQSSW are defined by five water use classifications, as follows, each of which has a set
of maximum concentrations for various pollutants (see Table A-1).
Class I  - Very dean waters, for natural protection.
Class U  - Water used for drinking water source.
Class m  - Water can be used for drinking water source after
some treatment
Class IV  - Water can be used for recreational use, boating,
fishing, and as a water source for industrial water
supply.
Class V  - Water suitable for cooling water only in industry
and can be used for irrigation.
The national standards also place further constraints on certain water quality parame-
ters for water supplies used for irrigation. Examples include standards for temperature, and
bacteriological and chemical quality applied to Class V surface waters under the EQSSW.
Maximum values for quality standards, lmown as the National Irigation Water Quality
Standards, are shown in Table A-2.
Wastewater from industries, institutional locations, and municipal wagswater
treatment plants must meet or exceed discharge requirements of the national Integrated
Wastewater Discharge Standards (IWDS). Liaoning Province has formulated its own
standrds based on the national IWDS. Liaoning's stadards, which were modified to meet
local conditions, were implemented in Febuary 1990. The Liaoning standards require that
wastewater be treated to maintain one of two standards based on the beneficial uses of the
receiving waters. These standards are:
* Standard I - For discharge to Class m surface water; and
* Standard U - For discharge to Class IV and Class V surface water.

All treated effluent must meet the discharge standards I or 11, depending on dhe
classification of the receiving stream. However, in no instance may discharges be made to
Class I or 11 surface water bodies.
The Liaoning standards for wastewater discharges are presented in Tables A-3 and
A-4. Table A-3 presents maximum concentration criteria for 32 water quality parameters.
Table A-4 shows the maximum concentration levels allowed for 11 toxic pollutants not
included in Table A-3. The Liaoning standards are considered more stringent than the
national IWUDS. The IWDS include permissible limits on only nine of the 11 toxic pollutants
listed under the Liaoning Province discharge requirements. Of the 32 pollutants shown in
Table A-3. the IWDS require permissible discharges to comply with 20 pollutant limits.
The Liaoning standards also contain the maximum wastewater flow, minimum water
reuse rate, and maximum concentration for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical
oxygen demand (COD), and suspended solids permissible to discharge under Standards I and
II from 24 industrial categories. These industries include mines, steel mills, gas plants, metal
plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, paper mills, tanneries, breweries, chemical
plants, pharmaceutical factories, bleaching and dyeing factories, fibre manufacturers, and food
processing plants.
Water quality discussions for the proposed projects address relevant information
available within the areas of concein.
A.2 PRC AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Ambient Air Quality Standards of the PRC are depicted in Table A-5. The standards
are based on three classifications as described by the PRC:
*  Class I - The air quality standard for protection of human health and
ecological resources based on long-tern exposure to contaminants.
*  Class H - The air quality standard for protection of human health and
ecological resources based on long- and short-term exposure to
contaminants.
* Class II - The minimum air quality standard for protection of human
health and ecological resources based on acute and chronic exposure
to contaminants.

As indicated in Table A-S. the annual daily average concentration limit for particu-
lates is 0.5 milligram/normalized cubic meter (mg/Nm3) for Class III and 0.3 mg/Nm3 for
Class II. The annual daily average concentration limit for SO2 is 0.1 mglNm3 for Class III
and 0.06 mg/Nm3 for Class II.
Improving the air.quality of the City of Benxi has become an example to the entire
Chinese nation. The Benxi municipal government has recently prepared a Master Plan for the
city. The environmental quality goals identified in the plan for the short term (1991-1995)
and long term (1996-2000) are:
*  Air Quality Goals for 1991-1995: particulate = 0.5 mg/m3 maxi-
mum daily average value, and S02 = 0-15 mglm3 annual average of
daily average values; and
*  Air Quality Goals for 1996-2000: particulate = 0.4 mg/m3
(particulate = 0.3 mg/m3 by end of 2000) maximum daily average
value, and SO2   0.10 mg/mr3 annual average of daily average
values.
