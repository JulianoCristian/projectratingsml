3.   Description of Proposed-Project
3.1 General
With the urban infrastructure rapidlyAdeveloped, the demand of
2



heating supply need more and more. Although the existing heating
supply have reached over 3.2 million m2, there are 5.6 million M2
waiting to be heated. In the constructed areas, the old, backward
and separate boilers and family' stoves are still being used as
certain part. Heating depending on this method are not only high
fuel required but bad dust collecting efficiency, and even no
dust collection device in some boilers system and stoves.
Moreover, low chimney and unfully burnt of fuel (coal) causes
heavy air pollution in these areas. It is necessary to adopt
advanced  central  heating  system  to  replace  the  existing
facilities.
The scale to be severe4 in this sub-project will include:
Dongfen district            (200,000 m2)
Xifen district              (520,000 M2)
Xinkai district             (400,000 M2)
Jiefang northern road       ( 80,000 mi2)
Caitun district             (500,000 mi2)
#ceserved for district at  (800,000 mz)
East bank of Taizi River
The final extent of heating supply is designed based on 2.5
million mz to be heated, including 1.507 million mz existing
waiting (urgent) areas and 993,000 M2 new development for future
demand. The detailed result are given in Table 3.1.
The content of this proposed sub-project are to be composed of
heating transmission pipeline (networks) and associated auxiliary
equipment and facilities.
Heating resource will be from newly constructed Thermal
Generation Station which located at the Caitun district on the
north bank of Taizi River (Figure 2). The proposed site will be
at the hill of the north crossing point between Caitun and Beitie
roads. It is satisfactory for selecting this site because of the
very convenient traffic, available water supply and remote for
the residential area. Furthermore, the auxiliary facilities and
equipment can be supplied from the Cement Plant nearby and the
ash (coal waste) will be comprehensively reused in the Thermal
Generation Station.
3.2  Process
According to the annual average temperature in winter and the
past heating supply experience in the area of Benxi, 245.3 KJ/mz
h is to be determined as the heat consumption quota. In this
case, the max. heating supply will be 513.25 GJ/h. the average
load of heating will be 392.786 GJ/h, So the annual heat
consumption will be 1,404,605 GJ.
Three run and indirect connection type for heating (hot water)
supply in the pipeline network will be selected and used in this

proposed sub-project. The hot water will be supplied from the
Thermal Generation Station. Heaters installed in the network will
heat the water temperature upto 120 OC and the temperature for
return water will be 65 OC. So the temperature different value is
55 OC. The water/water (W/W) exchanger in thermal power station
located on each sub-district will increase the temperature of the
hot water upto 75 OC in the three run system, and the temperature
of the return water will be 55 OC. The advantage of three run
system are mainly: The two run system is a high temperature
system with quite temperature difference in supply and return
ways, the amount of water cycling will be decreased in the
network. This will cut down not only the steel material
consumption as its construction in low temperature system but the
electricity load on cycle pumps (operation cost).
Since W/W exchanger to be adopted between the two and three run
systems the two run network can be formed as a close system and
easily adjusted during the operation so that the safety and
sensitivity performance will be gained. Meanwhile, the loss of
hot water supply in the two run system will be decreased and long
life in the network can be realized.
The indirect connection of three  run system can settle the
problems of large topography difference and lower heating
temperature in high buildings as well as new clients to be
jointed in the system. So, this is very important for the city
surrounded by mountains, suchl as Benxi.
it is estimated that 16 thermal power stations are to be
constructed in the sub-project. Because the area to be heated are
large and separate, the computer system will be used for
monitoring and management in order to form the whole network as
an inorganic unit controlling the operation performance and to
master the concerned parameters from each thermal power station.
On the other hand, the economic analysis can be computerized to
reach the eim of high efficiency, quality and low consumption.
A complete of controller will be installed on site at each
station and acted as auto-compensation device for the humidity,
pressure and wave of hot water to be supplied and the water
temperature in three run system at each station will be automatic
controlled. The optimum heating curves of out-door temperature
variation shall be imputed and stored in the controller. and then
the PID model will be started working to set out the instruction.
In this case, the temperature of hot water supply and return can
be adjusted with the variation of out-door temperature. the
supplied, in-door temperature will be kept statically.
3.3 Heating Transmission EPipeline
Outline of the heating transmission pipeline are shown on Figure
2. The total length are 15,296 m in single. The principle of the
route  selected  are  based  on  less   building  and  roads

possible. The two ways, over fly and excavation/ backfillina.
will be adopted for construction of the proposed trans;nission
pipeline. If the pipeline encountered high way or railway. the
following two methods will be used for construction: 11) jacking:
(2) over crossing; In a case of the over crossing, the lowest
part of pipe bearing brackets shall be at least 6.55 m to the
surface of the railway and 4.5 m to the surface of high way or
road. For the river over crossing, the depth of pipe buried shall
be more than 2 m under the sailing elevation.
The compensation devive will be installed in the pipeline in
order to assure static, safe operation as the pipeline itself be
affected on heating supply. When this natural compensation does
not meet the requirement, the ball type compepsator will be used.
As polyurethane adopted as thermal insulation material used on
the pipeline, the heat loss on the pipeline will be controlled
within 5 *.

4.   Environmental Conditions
4.1 General of Natural Environment
The city of Benxi is located on east part of Liaoning Province,
upstream of Taizi River Basin. The city surround by mountains,
forming long and narrow topography from east to west. The total
mountain area occupy over 85%, only 7.8 % is farmland. The city
proper are located on western part, the middle section of Taizi
River which flows through the c..ty area from northeast to
southwest.   Because of the effect of surrounded mountains and
valley topography. the annual prevailing wind is east, but
northeast wind prevail in winter time and southwest wind in
summer. The wind speed is in middle level and 2.8 m/s annual
average speed. The annual windless frequency.is 126. Rainfall is
in middle level, the annual average is 793.7 mm, occurring mostly
during July and August. Annual average temperature is 6.9°C.
January is the coldest period in a year with temperature of -
13.4 OC monthly. The annual average frozen period is 183 days,
from beginning Oct. to April next year, about half year.
Taizi River has 406 km in length that 112 km are in the range of
Benxi area, in which about 16.8 km (from Dayu to Baishilazi) pass
through the urban area. The average flow of the River is within
26.6 - 96.6 m3/s which is the main important water resource for
local industry, agriculture and drinking.
4.2  General of Social Economic
Benxi urban area includes Pingshan. Mingshan, Xihu and Nanfen
districts. According to the statistic in 1990, total population
in urban area is 919,000 includes Pingshan 320,000, Mingshan
259,000 and Xihu 242,000.
From statistic data, the total population are still in increasing
trend. Annual average increase rate is 5 /1,000 and the density
in city proper is about 12,200 person/Km.2,
The environment of Benxi is seriously polluted because of the
high centralization of heavy pollution sources, out-of-date
equipment and technology,   environmental problems rem4ined by
history. Total discharged waste air is 95,600,000,000 mz, which
includes So, 105,000 T, industrial dust 145,000 T.

5.   Environmental_Impact Analysis
5.1   Existing Air Pollution
The city proper of Benxi were considered as very heavy pol1'.S.t--d
area according to the Annual Environmental Quality Report (1991k.
Form that report, The SO- average concen.ration in Caitun area was
0.22 mg/rn, exceeding 2.7 times of that stipulated by Trational
Air Environmental  Quality  Standard  (II Class).  The average
concentration of SO. within the whole city was monitored to be as
.0.18 mg/m.3, exceedi'ng two times compared with IJational Standard.
The detailed monitoring result is given in Table 5.1.
It can be seen from the Table 5.2 that the air pollution in
winter had heavier effect than the other seasons. Apart froin
cli..ate factor, more coal consumption for heating in this season
and large, uncontrolled emission is the major reason in result of
air pollution heavier.

5.2  Environmental effects as the project implementation
Environmental effects caused during the project construction at
different stages have been analyzed and shown in Table 5.4.
The adverse effect will be from the excavation, affecting on
traffic, noise, and sightseeing. but these will be temporary, or
in some certain part. The above mentioned adversely effect can be
reduced as largest li=itation as possible when the measures to be
adopted, such as shortening the length of proposed transmission
pipeline and cutting down the number of roads destroy. For noise
effect. the pnuematic device, such as air pick, will be the main
resource which can reach uopto 110 dB. The workers shall be
equipped   with   personnel   protection   device   during   the
construction. In order to reduce this effect on the residential
area, construction will be conducted and managed on the day time.
Through the attenuation of certain distance and buildings, the
noise emissioned can generally reduced to 85.5 dB (A) as it
arrive he residential building.
5.3  Analysis of Environmental Benefits
(1) As the project completed, it will replace 17 sets of
existing separate, smaller boilers and 9,902 chimneys from
stoves of local residents. The replaced capacity will be 77
tfh. So, a great improvement for the existing air pollution
caused by ground level coal/smoke emission will be largely
managed.
(2) In the result, 98,332 t coal (with 2.01S S02 concentration)
can be saved per year. And a reduction in S02 emission of
3,162 t/yr, 38,124 t/yr waste coal ash and 1,144 t/yr
dustfll and 136,455 t/yr vehicle transportation of material
supply and wastes disposal will be cut down.

(3)  In addition, the capacity of 2.5 nilion  .: -.ill be se-rved
by proposed central heating systenr. And it will provide-
local residents a clean, convenient condition for their
living standard.
(4) The tense situation of land use in the urban area will be
settled and the noise in the certain area can be eliminated
after the small boilers and stoves replaced. The appearance
of Benxi city and sightseeing can greatly upgraded.

5.4  Analysis of Social and Economic Benefits
In general, the heatinq capacit, from th-  s-parate indi,;dul
stoves are only 38 % and 55 % for the separate smaller boil;-rA.
But  for  the  proposed  district  central  heating  system. the-
capacity will be 87 %. At present, the heating supply in Ca.tun
area (500.000 m' supplied area) are from the separate smaller
boilers and it is estimated that 9,971 t coal will be saved per
year as the proposed project completed and supply to the area:
The existing area of residents heating by individual stoves ari-
2 million m2, these also be replaced by the proposed project and
88.361 t coal can be saved per year. The total savings of the
above can amount to 98,332 t/y. equal to 63,214 ton standard
coal. According to 200 Yuan, p-r ton, the cost fror coal saving
will be 12,642.700 RMB Yuan.
Reduction of waste coal ash from saving of coal will be:
98.332 t : 38.77 % = 38,124 t
Annual amount of the coal waste  (ash) transportation will be~
reduced as: [based on 4 Km transport distance)
reduced a=ount = 4 : (98.332 t + 38,124 t) = 545,324 t!K-
The cost of transportation waste can be cut down to 1.91 million
PRBIl-Yuan on a basis of 3.5 Yuan/K'-.
Summing up the above two items (reductions of coal saving and
waste transportation),   14.552.700 RMB Yuan in total will be
saved. So the remarkable economic benefit are obviously.
5.5 Conclusions
(1)  The proposed sub-project will adopt the centralized heating
system to replace the existing separate, individual heating
system at Dongfen, Caitun and other areas. It will demolish
17 sets old and smaller boilers, better control the existing
air pollution caused by ground level coal/smoke emission,
greatly improve the local environmental air quality and
living standard of the people.
(2)  A reduction in SO- emission of 3,162 ton per year, 39,260 tly
coal slag and -136,000 t/y vehicle transportation for
material supply and wastes disposal as the proposed project
com.pleted.
(3) Savings of 12.64 and 1.91 million RBM Yuan can be gained by
cutting  of  the  coal  consunption  and  material,  waste
transportation respectively.
(4) In addition, the central heating system will sever 2.5
11



-illion  ,,2 residential  3r-a. -*rovide a clean. convenient
heating facilities for the local people. which will improve
their  livina  standard.      Therefore,  this  proposal  is
considered in favor by the public opinion.
(5) This project will save the space occupied by the existing
small boilers to resolve the problem of land shortage in
urban area and reduce the noise impact to the residents,
Also it can improve the appearance and landscape of the
city.
6.   Public/non-government involvement
As the heavy environmental pollution in the city of Benxi, the
health and life of the residents have being endangered.  The
appeal and reports, even the complaint and protest to reflect the
serious pollution event have come from the various fields in the
past and still on. According to the uncompleted statistics, the
complaint letters concerned on environnental issues were received
upto 1731 in last 12 years, and the most of them were about air
pollution. The details are shown in Table 6.1
At Fifth Meeting of the Seventh Municipal People's Political
Consultative Conference in 1992. Wo.185 committee member, Mr.
Zhao Fushen raised proposal of "Continue .to strength the
management of environmentall protection control,  to achieve a
distinct success", in which the problem of air quality on the
residential area affected on heating period included. This
proposed sub-project is one works in Benxi to resolve the above
mentioned problem for-local environmental pollution.
In order to protect the people's rights, the investigation of the
public attitudes and acceptable degree for this proposed project
have been undertaken within the part of residents who have living
in Benxi city during the project preparation period, the results
are given in Table 6.2. From the table, it can be seen that 100
% are favor for this proposed project.
