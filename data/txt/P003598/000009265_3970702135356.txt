1.6. Seal of Assessment
Reishiiiso Bay will be the main accessing area , which
receive6 the sewage from Malan River,It locat at 1210  20  '
-40 ' east longtitude and 38* 50' -53' latitude.The entry of
the bay is 16km wide and 4.8km away from the top of  the  bay.
There is about 36km2of water area within the bay.In addition,
the land part of tie sewage tretment plant, which stretch
eastern  to Nadating,that is the entry of Malan River,western
to Malan River Bridge,northern to the foot of Baizi Mountain
and southern to Sports Center with Land area of 5km2 . The
atmosphere and sea area within this region will be regarded
as what affected by sewage, thus, the environmental impact
assessment limited within this area will meet the requirment.
1.6. Target of Environmental Project
The  project  of  Malan  River  Sewage  Treatment   is   a
environmental project item in Dalian, which will be loaned ny
World Bank to completely solve the pollutant problems of
Malan River.
Chapter 2.Survey of project
2.1. Backgrounad And Importance of The Project
Malan River is mAin flood- discharging and sewage
-discharging Channel in south-west of Dalian with length of
14km and river basin area of 96 km'.Downstream of the river
are main industrial area and residential area of western
Dalian with over 80 of main sewage - discharging units. The
sewage is discharged into vhe river through 39 pollutant
-discharging points..Meanwhile,Malan River also recives the
living sewage from about 30000D residents and overland runoff
along the river.Total quantity of sewage reaches to 50000oma,
which flow into Heishijiao Bay throuth the entry of Malan
River.
Along Beishijiao Bay is the famous scenic spot of Dalian.
Its sea area are famous sea bathing and breeding farm of rare
marine organisms.Meanwhile, it also  acts  one  of  the  main
sewage-receiveing area.From  the  coastal  line  of  Lingshui
Bridge to Fujiazhuang distribute main   sewage  - discharging
points, part of sewage have been intercepted to the entery  of

Malan River and its surrounding water area have been  heavily
polluted.Therefore,improTment of the  water  quality  whithin
Beishijiao  Bay  has  become   a   imDortant   environmental
engineering problem waited to solve.
To solve the pollutant problem of NEalan River,Dalitn  City
Government has built some projects in separate periods  every
year, is 1984.4km intercepting pipe in the western line of
Malan River was built aLd  in  1989  9km  intercepting    and
sewage pumD station was built.1eanwhile, in 1990 Environmental
Protection Institute of National Ocean Breau Compiled the.
'Study cc Feasibility of Dalian  Heishijiao  Bay  Sewage- Sea
-Discharging Projectand in February, 1992 Dalian Gardens Design
institute finished 'the stuty on Feasibility of of Dalian
Malan River Sewage Sea-Discharging Project-.From above,jRe can
see,many prephase jobs of the project have been prepared,
which will provide a good basis for further studys.
leanwhile,1alian is also a city  severely  siort  of  fresh
water resource.The mean person-owned amount is 703m¶,only 28%
of the value of the whole country. In the seasons of
insufficient water,some factories  and  enterperises  had  to
limit the production due to the shortage of water, which
reduced the revenue by  about  1 billion  yuans  every  year.
Moreover, the amount of living water red:ced to 16-17 l/day
for every people,only 1/5 of the present water-consuming quota.
Although the Project of drawing the water of Biliu River   to
Dalian, which  was  invested  more  than  2  billion yuans,
temporarily  relieve the condition of shortage of  water, due
to the limit of water resouse in Bilin River, in the long term.
This project can not meet the water-consuming requirmewnt of
city development yet.
In view of above, the method of reuse of sewage after
intensive treatment has been brought into the water-consuming
plan.According to the plan ,the amount of reuse of sewage
will arrive to 9000omJ/day in 2000,and in 2010 the value will
increase to 15000Dm 'Vday.
Dalian  Chuenlin  Sewage  Treatment  Plant  has  built   a
experimental engineering to reuse the sewage after intensive
treatment with capacity of 10000m8/day.The reused  water  has                   k
been sent to Dalian Red Star Chemical Plant. The  Second  Gas
plant and Tnermal Electricity Plant etc.for  three  year. The
p.actice has fully proved  feasibility  of  reuse  of  sewage

after intensive  treatment.
Therefore,through the comparatIon of many schemes and study
of the feasibility of reuse of sewage, Maian liver Sewage
Treatment Project is regarded as optimal scheme with feasible
technique, rational economy and allowed enrironmental condition,
which is based on the meeting of the water quality target of
leishijiao Bay
2.2. SCheme for Sewage Treatment Project
Three schemes hate been proposed on how to treat the joined
sewage.
(1ILScheme I-Sewage second treatment - part of the sewage
will be under deep treatment for industry using
Through  second  treatment, the  sewage  will  reach   the
discharging standard mcde by Liaoning Province aid flow into
Milan River, of which,40000t/d sewage will meet the requirment
of industrial water.

Through primary tratment, the  main  pollutants  BOD . COD
will be reduced by 30%,- while SS will be reduced by 60%,   thus
the sewage will reach the standard of water quality for marine
discharging water, which will be discharged into sea  far  away
from seashore through sea-discharging pipe of 3.9km in leagth.

The sewage lift pumping room was designed by North- East
China  Designing  Insitute  of  China   Manicipal   Engineering
Corporation,   now  it  has  been  pat  into  use.   Thus   the
construction  of   aeration   sedimentation   pond,        primary
sedimentation  pond.   sea-  discharging   pumping   room   and
chlorinator adding room will be the emphasis of this project.
T'ne operation of adding chlorinator has  two  objectives:   one
for prevent the inner of sea- discharging pipes and the
surroundings of the distributor ejector nozzle form growing
-rine  organisms,   which  will  damage  the   pipes,        thus
:-lorinator  need  adding  periodly  and  the  other  for.  the
vzotection of the sea bathing in period of infectious  diseases
prevailing, chlorinator need not to be added in normal
epration period
In scheme 2, the sea-discharging pipe will extend to the
sea at the entrance of the tunnel at the foot of southen
=;stern part of Baiyun Mountain, which is lOiSm long with
Jlameter of 1200mm.
The sew-discharging points of the sewage locate at 121 ' 34
5 62"  east longtitude and 38a 50' 50 ' latitude.   The  sewage
wIll be lead to  the  distributor  from  the  seashore  through
submarine steel pipe of q'1224X12mm. This section of  pipe  is
'01Dm long including lOm of  distributor.   The  anticorrosion
coat zill be painted on the inside and outside wall, moreover,
lOz.- *-f inoxidizing coat will be added on the outside wall.
tne distributor is composed of steel pipes with diameter of  X
-24X 12, qqO24X 10, and ql815X8. The anticorrosion coat and
*oxidizing will be painted in the same way as the submarine

Chapter 3: A Survey of the Natural Enviroment
.S.1 The Geographical Situation:
3.1.1 Geology and Geomorphology
I.The Heishijiao Bight
Bleishijiao Bight is located  on  the  southwest  of  Dalian
City, which covers from Fujiazhuang in the east  to  Xiaopingdao
in the west and is in the triangle shape.   The  bedrock  along
the coast is constitute  of  crystalline  limestone,  slate  and.
quartzitL formed in Sinian Period. The projecting promontory
deep water near the shore,steep of bottom slope( about  %) 6ake
up  the  complex  geomorphological pattern. Because  different
topogrophy,  lithology, constructure and  water  dynamics,  the
morphology around the coast are not the same.They show various
pettern.such aE abrasion terrace  and  razing  level. Different
size of abrasion terrace and  ridge  beach  were  developed  in
front of erosion cliff, which  the  width  is   300-   40Dm  in
soft rock area and narrow in stripe from hidden    under  water
in flood tide and exposed in ebb tide in hard rock area.
In the east coast  of  Malan  liuer  estuary, the  rock  is
famouns for having the structure of lotus flower type. And now
the foot of clift is gradually abrLsed by the seawater and  big
collapsed gravel accumulated along the foot of clift.
Because  of  insufticiency  of  substances  source, the
accumulated landform is not developed well, but the pattern iB
typical and various.The tie bar of xiaopingdao in west cape  is
the accumulation of longitudinal flow in ware shadow. A closed
deperssion-modern  lagoon  depression   in   the   areas   near
xiaopingdao and the outlet of Lingshui are blocked up by
outer bar. The accumulation of gravel at the  foot  of  bedrock
cape is formed by abrasion of bedrock and the  gravel  are  not
transported long showing clearly edge and the  corners. Between
the capes, there are low and narrow sand beaches  which  che
composition are gravel, sand and silt, and most of there  beaches
-are developed and utilized now.
Around the mouth  of  Beishijiao  Bight,   there  are  many
islands which distributed in curve pattern are shape-like,  and
the islands erodes strongly by wave that cut to  the  shape  of
half side of mountain.

Fig.3-1 shows the distribution of bottom sediment  type  of
Beishijiao Bight.From this figure,we  can  see  that  the  area
around teh coast is the division of sand and gravel in reef
flat.The division of sand and gravel in reef flat is narrow in
had rock and wide in *soft rock area. From the point of
sedimentology,this division is divided into erosion division.
The area of less than 5m contour (except the division of
sand and gravel in reef flat) is the division of sand and
g:avel. The  sediment  in  strip-e  form  is  stable  deposition
derision of transition facies.In this division, due to strong
water dynamics, only coarse substances, such is gravel and fine
cand can be deposited  in  this  division. Due  to  the  direct
effects of wave from outsea, the sediment around the islands
near the mouth of Beishijiao Bight mainly is sand containing
gravel and shellfish.
On the outer side of the sand gravel division is the
division  of  claycy  silt,   which   represents   the   stable
depositionarea.                            -
In the middle part of  the  bight  are  the  deposition  of
silty clay. In this area, the  deep  water  and  stable  dynamic
surrounding  form  the  relative  stable  deposition  area   of
shallow marine facies.
The geologic history of north  Yellow  Sea  indicates  that
area used to be exposed about 18000 years ago.It was the north
edge of Yellow Sea plain at that time.About 18000 years  before
present day, sea level rose and transgression emerged the Blain,
therefore,this area became marine sediment enviroment.
(1) Source of Substances.
01 Sand Carried by Rivers.
Malan River and Lingshui River are the main river  flowing
into the bight. Lingshui  River  is  4.5km  long  and  naturil
converge area ig about 1Okm , now, the  area  around  the  river
mouth is blocked by a sand bar-lagoon accumulation body.In low
water discharge period,the silt content is  very  low  and  the
river water penetrated into  the  sea  through  the  bar. Ialan
BiTer is 8.5km long, and its discharge capacity of  a  year  is
185000t,the natural converge area is  20kM2. It  is  a  typical
seasonal river which in flood period carries a  great  deal  of
sand and gravel into the sea about  10000- 30000t  and  is  the
main resources  of  substances. But  owing  to  mang  intercept
reservoirs in  upper  reaches, the  river  is  almost  dried-tup

in most of a year,and only in flood period, there is runoff.
Therefore, there is not much substance into the sea.
In short term,the silt discharge of Lingshui River and
Malin  River  are  not   enough   to   form   characteristic
accumulation body in the entrance to the sea. The substance
carried by rivers deposits in the estuary.The fine sediment
is easily made suspended by wave and transported by tide flow.
So, only small part of sediment is deposited in the bight  and
most of the fine sediment is transported into deep sea.
$2The Transport from Adjacent Beach.
Because of the little supplying of substance, unexist of
silt flow and silt or mud beach easily eroded by seawater, this
source of silt makes no contribution to the deposit of the
bight.
:The Erosion of Bedrock.
The coast of the bight is erosion coast and the bedrock  of
the coast is hard rock of Sinian Period, which resists the
weathering.There are only small accumulation of substance  from
bedrock of coast by clenudation.
W)The Substances from Sea Bottom
The analysis of residual current of Beishijiao Bight state
that the direction of residual current along the coast is
parallel to the shoreline while points to the bight in the
mouth.The speed of residual current is small, about 5- 8em/r, so
the sand-supplying from outer sea is normally rare.
Above all,the sources of substances in the bight is mainly
from Malan River,and then from erosion  substances  of  bedrock
and sea bottom,but the total amount of substances is little.
(2) The Sedimentation Rate of Suspended Substances of Sea
Water. -
The determination of  content   of   suspended   substances
along the coast of Beishijiao Bight is that  the  mean  content
of silt is S.330-l. 20mg/l  in spring tide and is 3.95- 7.38 mg/l
in neap tide. The  distribution  kihacter  is  the  contour  of
content vZlue of silt decreases from coast to seaward. The
vertical distribution increases from surfaee to bottom It  mean
that  the  turbulence  of  bottom  water  is  strong  and   the
transportation of suspended substances  is  ecctroued  by  tide
flow.
The monitoring of stable deposition division in  thea bight

indicate that the mean sedimentation rate is 2mm/y.
(3) Shallow Seismic Refraction.
Fig.3-2 shows the section of shallow seimic refraction in
s.outh area of Malan River in this Bight.The bottom bedrock is
the stretching of coast bedrock which composite of kard rock
of Sinian Period. About 10000 years  before  present  day, with
sea level rising after glacial period, the wave eroded and
destroyed  the  bedrock, produced  a  great  deal  of   clastic
substances.Most of the substance was carried into deep water
by current and formed the bedrock level of a convex upward and
decline seaward.Then the substances were eroded from coast
rock and carried by river deposited on the bedrock level. The
sediment layer in bight mouth is about 2m and become thinner
along the coast,but in middle part of the bight is about lim.
So, the coast area and the areaof bight mouth is erosion area,
the middle part is sedimentary area, but the thickneas of
sediment is not big.

permeability coefficiency of gravel is 30m per 24 hours.
3.1.2 Regime of Climate:
I.The Air Temperature:
Dalian lies in the middle latitudes area of the Northern
Hemisphere,while is adjacent to sea on th:ee sides and is of
the characters of the maritime climate. It belongs to the
continental monsoon climate in the Warm-TemDerate Zoon.
According to the observation by Dalian Weather Station, the
annual mean temperature of -4.81t,while August is the hottest
with 24. ot as the mean temperature.The maximum temperature in
the past is 35. 3C (July 11, 1972) and the minimum temperature
in the past is -21. it (Junuary 4, 1970).
Table 3-1 shows the satistic temperature changer in each
month of Dalian.

2.Precipitation:
Mean  annual  precipitation   in  Dalian  is  668.  7mm,  the
yearly-maximum precipitation is 970mm(1951),the  daily  maximum
precipitation is  171.  lmm( July  11, 1956) . The  mean  annual
precipitation days is 78 days.Precipitation mainly occurs in
June, July and  August( about  64'  of  annual  precipitation)
.Precipitation in winter(December,Jannuary  and  february)    is
minimum(about 4% of annual precipitation).
3.Bumidity in this area is high because of the  effect  of  sea
wind.According to the satistic material in  years, mean  annual
relative humidity is 66%, its change is distiucthy regular, the
one in July is the maximum which is 85% and 86%, and then it
decrease to 55%  as  the  minimum  in  January,    and  then  it
increases again.
4. Atmospheric Pressure:
The change of presure with seasons is relatively great,
and the chang of pressure with days is relatively small.
According to the satistics of 30 years, mean monthly maximum
pressure is in January and Feburary with a maximum pressure of
1014.2mb,  while the minimum pressure is i1i July  with  a  value
of 993.5mb. The mean annual pressure is 1055.3mb.

* The Wind Condition
The monsoon change in  Dalian  is  distinct.   In  winter,
northerly and northwesterly winds prevai; corresponding to the
Mongolia High. In summer, southerly and southeasterly winds
operate in response to the  Pacific  High  presture  area.   In
spring and autumn, the wind direction is unstable because of
the alternation of monsoon. The dominant wind direction in a
year is norhtwesterly winds. Table 3-3 and Fig 3- 3 show the
wind frequency and mean wind velocity during 1980-1990.

1.3 Hydrology
Tides level
Short-term tidal observation was carried out to the east

!, Characteristics of Tidal Current
It may be concluded that the  irregular  semi- diurnal  mi2
current prevails in the bight,  and M2 component current is  t
dominant current. The depth of the bight varries between O  e
40m.
S. Forms of Tidal Current
The forms of the current may be judged  by  the  elliptici
of the M12 component current, as showing in Fig 3-6.   Rerersi
current is noticeable except at station 9 sad 11  where  rota
current  occars.  - The  major  aies  are  directed  along   t
shoreline at stations near the coast.

). Tidal Carrent Field
The feature of tbat  the  tidal  current  vrt ies  with  the
tidal stage is noticeable in the current chart   ( Fig  3- 7) .
Based on calculations according to Marine Survey Specification
. Near the shore or around islets, flood current sustains  from
4 hours before until 1 -2 hours after the high water while  ebb
current comes about between  I -2  hours  after  and  4  hours
before the high water. The maximum speeds  of  t0ie  rising  and
falling occur during 2- 3 hours before and  4 -5  hours  after
the high water respectively. Off the shore,   flood  current  i s
about in the period of 3 hours before  to  3  hours  after  the
high water while ebb current during the time left in the cycle
The durations for both rising and falling are about 6 hours.
These features indicates standing and  progressive  waves  near                   L
the shore or islets, and progressive wave off  the  shore.   As
for the rotary direction  of  the  current,    it  is  regularly
counter-clockwise on the mid-stratum and bottom but  disorderly

C5' Residual Currents
Residual current means in this section the difference
between observed current and tidal current.   Runoff,   density
current and wind-driven current are the main compositions of
the residual current in this area.  Residual  current  on  mid
-stratum at various stations are presented in Fig 3-8.  In  the
area  near  Qixianling,    stronger  residual  current  may   be
observed, with the wpeed of abount 10cm/s. It flows at a  speed
of about 7cm/s near the mouth of the bight. Inside the bight
and around the mouth of Maila River, the  residual  current  iB
very weak (about 2em/c).
4.  Temperature and Salinity
The mean water temperature of the Beishijiao Bight iB 11. 2
*C with maximum of 26. 2C  (August 29, 1963) and minimum of -1. 9C
(February 5, 1974) .   The  highest  monthly  mean  temperaturc
occurs in August which ig 22_2tC, while the lowest one occurg
in February with a value of 1.3t, and those for the other
month ranges from 2.1it to 21.1iC. The mean salinity is 30.3 %.
within the bight, ranging from 26.88%6 to 30. 8 5%.   The  mean
salinity for surface water is 30. 05.,  those  for  middle  and

In  summer ( Jane -August) , the  vertical  temperature

.42tC/m, and this, reuislts in the thermocline of water density
( density  decreaLses  with  the  depth  decreasing   which   is
advantagous  to  rising,    dilution  and  diffusion  of  sewage
discharged from sea bottom.

The  sewage  discharging  of  MRlLan  River  affects   the
fleishijiao Big1Lt directly. In order to investigaLte the present
StaILtus of marine oreganisms, 6'-11 stations  were  set  up  for 
different items, as Shown in Fig 3-9 ( boaLts  could  not  sail
.into the a.quaculture area, so the stations are all along the
seashore). The investiogation was carried out in October  1989

4. Nacrobenthic Animals
(1). Sorts and Quantity
21 species of macrobenthos (invertebrate) were  obtained  in
the surveys,  in which 10 species of Polychaeta,  5  species  of
Mollusca, 6 species of Echinodermata, and I species  of  others
were  included.   The  dominant  species   were   Lumbriconeris
Beteropoda and Audouinia Comosa. Polychaeta represented 77. 22%
of the total number of species.
T&b.3-12 shows the distribution of Macrobenthos in  quantity
samples which came from the bight in October 1989 were not
counted Decause of grab.
(2). Assessment
From Fig. a-14, stations A and  30  where  the  index  values
were between 1 and 2 were  of middle  pollution  because  they
were far from the mouth of Wan River. Stations B and  3  near
the mouth of Malan River were of heavy pollution as  the  index
values were less thin 1.

Present Status and Assessment of Bacteriology
). Present Status:
Bacteriology surveys were carried out while the organism
veys in the bight(the position of stations shown in Fig.3-e).
ed -on 66 data from three surveys,  a tendency of effect  of
'age from Nalan River and land was evident, which the  nearer
st and mouth of draining sewage,   the  higher  abundance  of
teria,  especiall.y coliform group.    Coliform  group  in  the
og-e had a high death rate after entering sea water becau-se
the  effect  of  salt  and  visible   light.    Therefore  few
iform  group  existed  offshore.          Average   abundance   of
*-fotroiDDs was over l.OX 10' indlml in the  biEht.   It  said
1i conent of organic matter was richer in the water.
The results of surveys show that seasonal distribution of
11-dance between heterotrophs and coliform group were as the
!11.  abundance in summerWautumn>spring.    Number  of  coliform
oup in summer was 1917 times of that in spring and 23 times
that in aitumnn. In summer, there are millions of  people  to

swim in the bathing beach while water quality is worse, so it
Is even more ImDortant to slove the problem of draining land
sewage.
(2). Assessment
Standards of  assessment  are:   (D  for  coliform  group,-
national GB3097-82w provides that content of coliform group
can not exceed J.OxIC4  ind/ml in the first, second  and  third
class  of  the  water  quality  standard  sea  water.   Cv  for
heterotropis, based on relevant standards of Japan, as number
in an area is less than I. OXOl  ind/ml, the sea is normal;  as
it is between 1. OX 10  imd/ml and 9. Ox lO  imd/ml,  the area  is
of light pollution; as it is from l.0X I0   itd/ml to 1. 0 X 10"
iand/ml, the area is of middle pollution; as it is over l.OX10I
ind/ml,  the sea is of heavy pollution;  as it is over 1.0 X 10Q
ind/mi, the sea is of very heavy pollution.
According to above standards, condition  of  Voliform  grou;
over standard and polluted grade are shown in Tab. 3-14 and Fig.

1. Situation
Cultivated produsts and ratural'fiskeries resource in the
bight play an important role in the fisheries culture of
dalian City.  Surveys   were  made   in  an  area   of  30km'  form
Fujiezhuang   to  Lingshui    cultivating    area.                The    total
cultivating area is 15000 mus. Unde. a pinnatifida has been a
main species, as well as some kelp and a few vsluable marine
products. Tab.3-16 lists their product amounts and bendfit.

2. Problems in Cultivation
U1). A lot or mussel and scallops were dled ror  red  tide  In
summer 1990, and the loss exceeded BMB$400000.
(2). The colour of Undaria pinnatifida changed into  greea  in
February 1990, especially areas near the mouth of Malan River
Output decreased rapidly.
(3). Rich nurtient salt in  the  bight  came  from  sewage  of
Milan River, Lingshui River, the Second  Hospital  attached  to
Medical college of Daliau.   Sunjiagou  and  cultivationg  area
itself. Content of nitrogen and phosphorus increasing  was  led
by spreading manure to cultivated kelp and U pinnatifida.
(4). An area of ten thousands mus, 5603000m from  land,   was
full of Cultivatiag rafts. Depth of water was  less  than  Tm.
Because of long-term cultrue  and  waste  water  draining  into
there, areas from Xinghai Beach to the  mouth  of Malan  River
had changed into smell mud shoal. This prevented water frcm
exchanging and red tide took place constantly.
3. Ideas
Development and protection of marine valuable species and
antural benthic shell will be the direction of marine cuture.
It is necessary to manage source of pollution and to reduce
the sewage discharge.
3.3 Social Enviroament and Value of Life Quality
Milan River, with 14km in length and 96km' in drainage area,
is the main flood-relief and waste water discharging cou:se in
southweat part  of  Dalian.   The  river  rises  in  Anziling,
northwest part of Dalian, and reaches the sea from the apex of
Beishijiao Bight. Due to the dam of Daxi9han  reservoir,   6km
upper reaches of the river, the down streams have been  dried
-up during the last decade excepting flooding  seasons.   The
drainage ares of down stream is the main industrial and
domestic area in Dalian. There are more than  100  industrial
enterprises of machinery, metallurgy, electronics,  textilem,
food and chemistry ect. and 3000o0 residents. The daily total
effluent quantity is 40000- 50000 tons, this is main source of
pollution in the bight, and polluts tke sea area nearby and do
harm to the bathing beach in Xinghai Park
The coast of Beishijiao Bight is the famous scienit
tourist spots of Dalian, Lingshuiqiao, Beishijiao, Xinghai Park
,Marine  Paradise,   Jinshatan  and  PFjiazhuang  Beach  are
distributed along the coast from  weat  to  east.   The  marine

ireia of Heishijiso Bight is famous for kelp and precious
aquatic products cultivations. On  the  bank,   there  are  the
Dalian advanced techiolohy zoon and the sports  central  base.
The Dalian University of Technology, the Ocean shipping College,
the Aquatic Products Industry of Technology,    the  Northeast
pinancial University,   the  Nedical  College,    the  Aadvanced
Technolohy Zoon, the Dalian Sports Center are distributed  from
West to  east-   After  all,   The  area  along  the  coast  of
Heishijiao Bight  is  a  key  developing  areas  for  .tourist,
technology and culture and sports.
3.4 Assessment of Environmental Quality in Beishijiao Bight
3.4.1 Present status
The  investigation  of  pollution  in  water  and  bottom
sediments of Beishijiao Bight  has  been  performed  by  Dalian
Environmental Ionitoring center with 25 sampling station ( Fig
.3-17). The determinants in water were  selected  as  suspended
matter, DO, PH, inorganic-N, inorganic- P,   oil,   organic- CL
fertilizer, cyanide, Hg,Cu,Pb,Zn,Cd and Ni. All  the  data  are
listed in Tab.3- 17.   The  data  from  the  investigation  are
compared with the first class of National Seawater Quality
Standards  and  -the  evaluating  standards  of  pollutions   in
sediments (Tab.3-18). It shows that: only  the  levels  of  oil
exceeded the standard in water, especially in the area near
Lingshuihe, which might be caused-by thee-drainage from a ship
yard.  The  contents  of  10  pcllutanta  in  bottom  sediments
e-eeded the levels of standards to different extends, where Zn,
Hg and sulfides heavily polluted the  area  of  interest  with
over 50% of the data exceeding standards and then the rates of
exceeding standards in contents of AB, organic matters and oil
amounted to 40%. The levels of Cu,Cr,Pb and Cd were  relatively
lower and the rates over standards were not  up  to  20%.   The
hajvily pollutod aroa was located at the mouth of Nalan River,
which was caused  mainly  by  the  sedimentation  of  suspended
matters sorbing various pollutants in water of Malan River and
the long-term accumulation there. The area near  the  mouth  of
Yalan River were also heavily polluted by  7  toxic  pollutants
except Cr,Pb,  and Cd. the area near Lingshuiqiao far  from  the
mouth of ?alan River showed  lightly- polluted  where  all  the
levles of 10 pollutants were lower than the standards.

3.4.2 Assessment
Based on the  present  status  of  Heishijiao  Bight,    the
indexes for assessment of water quality were designed as  oil,
organic-Cl fertilizer, COD,Hg,Cu,Pb and Zn, and for  assessment
of bottom sediments,  oil, organic matters, sulfides,Hg,Cu,Pb,Zn
,Cd,Cr and As were selected as the indexes.
First Class Water Quality StaLdards were used as the
evaluating standards for water quality(Tab.3-19 and 3-20).  The
relative criteria  from  the  Concise  Specifications  for  the
Investigation of Coast and Coastal Resources were selected as
the standards for assessments of bottom sediments (Tab.3- 18) .
Assessing models for  individual  index  was  selected  as  the
models for assessments.
P i=Ci/Si
where Pi--- pollution index of each pollutants
Ci--- determined concentration (or content of POllutants)
Si--- standard level of pollttant
The environmental  quality  in  the  area  of  interest  was
divided into 5 grades (Tab.3-21),    refering  to  the  Divisiut   1
Standards of Pollution Grades of Dalian Bay.

A ;ssessment for water quality
The pollution indexes of oil in water ranged from 0.40 to
j.4o. The heavily polluted area was located near Lingshuiqiao,
and all the other sea areas were  micro- polluted.    Fig.  3- 18
showed the  grading  of  environmental  quality  in  waters  of
interest.
The indexes of Zn and COD showed micro-pollution. The other
indexes showed unpolluted.
2. Assessment for Bottom Sediments
The bottom sediments in the sea areas of Heishijiao Bight
were severely polluted and all pollution indexes exceeded the
standards. The mouth of Malan River was heavily polluted,    the
sea areas of Xsinghai Park,   Lingshuiqiao  and  the  area   near
Fujazhuang   were    micro-   polluted.    The   middle   areas
investigated were medially and lightly polluted. Fig. 3- 19 -
Fig.3-2B showed the grading of environmental quality for  each
index of bottom sediment.

chapter 4. The Environmental Impact Prediction
of  the Sewage Treatment-Drainage  System
The physical  process  of  the  waste  discharged  from  the
diffuser into the sea is divided into three phases.  The  first
phase is the initial dilution of sewage buoyant jets.   In  the
first phase,  the time scale lasts from  a  few  minutes  up  to
half an heur, the apace scale is the same order  as  diffuser.
In this phase, mixing of the waste water is primarily effected
by the  buoyancy  and  momentum  of  the  discharge  and  their
interaction with the local current and density stratification.
The  second  phase  is  the  sub- dilution  and  transport   of
contaminant plume. The time scale is about a few hours ap to  a
day. The space scale is about a few miles.  In this phase,    the
waste field is adrected by local carrent and diffused by
oceanic turbulence. The rate of dilution  is  very  slow.   The
third phase is passive diffusion process. This .process  occurs
on time scale of ten plus to tens tidal cycles.   The  area  is
larger and is far  from  the  pollutant  plume  disappears  and
forms a smooth and raried concerntration field.
Corresponding to above mentioned three phases,  to  decribe
the physical processes  of  different  time  and  space  scales
needs different models.
4.1 Tnitial Dilution Prediction for Sewage Buoyant Jets
4. 1. 1  The Methods for Initial Dilution Prediction
For water quality control  and  environmental  assessment,
the important factors are initial dilution  of  waste  field
(generally is represented by the minimum dilution),  the  waste
field thickness, and the rise height to the top  of  the  waste
field  as  stratified.       Those   are   called   waste   field
characteristics.  But the  factors  affecting  the  waste  field
characteristics are very complex,  the semi-emPirical and  semi
- theoretical  formulae  or  curves  generally  are  given   by
experiments. This papar adopts Robert's results.
1. Unstraitifid Ambient
Under the condition of unstratified, the  sewage  from  the
diffuser goes to the water surface. It forms the surface waste
field (Fig.4-l). The surface waste field spreads  each  side  of-

Roberts gave the empirical eurve(Fig.4-3) of  Formula  4- 1  by
experiments. It can ie applied for disign.
For staignant (F?-D), the thickeuss of  surface  waste  field
is about 1/3 of the water  depth.   When  F> 0. 2  and  current
direction is perpendicular to the diffuser,  the  thickness  of
the surface waste field is Lbout a half of water depth.
The surface waste field width W can be expressed ae this:

Under the  condition  of  denditV' stratification,    sewage
buoyant jets rise to a certain height forming  submerged  waste
field. On the basis of stagnant, submerged waste  field  spread
out each side of the diffuser summetriciLly (Fig.4-4) .   Under
the circumstance of unstagnant, submerged waste field is  swept

Roberts and others consider that the waste water out of the

the range of 0.078<lM/lb<0.6 and 0.31<s/lb<1.92.    Under  these
circumstances,    the  waste  field  characteristics  are   only
decided  by  initial  buoyancy,    Froud  Number,    and  current
eirecition. The initial momentum and nozzle spacing exert a
slight influence.   Hypothesis  density  stratified  in  linear
variation, the normalized form of waste field characterisitics

4.1.2 Results
1. The choosing of the diffuser length
In the design of waste water discharge engineering,
referring to those of USA and HongKong, the design criteria of
initial dilution is decided as : S",  of  surface  waste  field
is greater than 100 for long- term  mean  discharge.   S.DO  is
defined as Sm quantity to match 90% accumulation frequency at
accumulation frequency curve of initial dilution.
Applying the above models on the base of this design
criteria.   the  diffuser  length  thct  satisfies  the  design
criteria is calculated to be 96m. In the practice design,   tie
diffuser length is l1m.

2.  The Annual Variation of the Wabte Field Sm and Zt
In  the  initial  dilution  phase,    the  waste   field
cfharacteristics are primarily  effected  by  the  bucyancy  and                  !
gomentum of the discharge and their.interaction with the  local
current   and   density    stratification.             Weste    field
characteristics change with the density changing  in  a  year.
to, the purpose of understanding the properties of waste field
we calculate the rise height Zt and minimum dilution Sm -at
mean water level. At the maximum speed, 0O  93m/s,   Z.t  is  the
minimum and Sm is the maximum. For  stagnant  current,    Zt  is
maximum and Sm reaches its munimum. From above  mentioned,    wq
can determine the range of the maximum rise height and minimum
initial dilution of the waste field.    The  prediction  results
are shown in Tab. 4-1 and Fig.4-10, 4-11.

The waste water discharge will  form  the  cubmerged  waste
Id in June, July and August.  In the other  months,   it  may

ending upon the change of the current  speed,   The  minimum

Sub-dilution of Contaminant Plume and  Forecasting  of  its
itation Freanency
Sewage,  released to ocean from diffuser ,   will  form  the
te water field(surface or submerged) after initial  dilution
se, and the concerntrations are still high. The waste  water
Id will form contaminant plume under  action  of  currents.                   I
iously,    it  must  be  considered  that   the   contaminant
certration where contaminant plume visits,ie. sub-dilutionm
-nd frequency of contaminant plume riSitRtion during the
'luation of environmental quality being taken for  the  coast
the area protected. Certainly, High concerntration and  high
-quency are more harmful to the environment,    and  for  some
an animaIs,  the high visitation frequency is very dangerous.                 f
1.2 Forecasting *ethods of Plume Sub-dilution
Aim of forecasting sub-dulition  is  to  give.  the  maximum
cerntrations of contaminants in the  contaminact  plume  and
cerntration distribution when the contaminant  plume  visits
shore or areas protected.       -!
In  plume  transport  processes,    the  concerntration  of
taminant will  decrease  under  action  of  ocean  turbulent                 'I
fusion. The sub-dilution is defined as:
Sd= C4/C..                           (4-8)
ere, Sd: sub-dilution;   Ci:   concertration  of  a  kind  of
'ntaminant at the end  of  initial  dilution;   Cam:   maximum
-cerntration of this kind of contaminant in plume. Here, one
nd of plums model, contaminant plums cogmmnt model,  is  u6ed
simulate the waste water field.  Fig. 4- 12  Is  a  shematic
agram of contaminant plume segment method.   The  latitudinal
'urdinate that is  normal  to  plume  middle  is  £  and  the
-itudinal distribution of a concertration of conserTation  of
'nservation vontaminant in the plume segment formed by the
.taminants discharged at t=tO is controlled by the error

4. 2. 3 Method to Calculato Visitation Fraquancy
Visitation frequency is defined as the probability that
the parts, which concerntration is over the  value  specified,
visit the Doint. The plume concerntration method is used tQ
calculate visitation frequency.
The basic principle of calculation of visitation  frequency
is the ratio of accumulated time of contaminant concerntration
over the value specified at grid node to total simulation time,
which the concerntration field is obtained after the processes
introduced in section above are done under the aid of computer.
4. 2. 4 Forecasting Results
According to the  methods  above,   the  sub- dilution  and
visitation frequency are  forecasted  for  the  plan  of  ocean
outfall in  Heishijiao  Bight.    In  this  calculation  ,   the
quantity of waste water discharged ig 120,000  t/d,   which  is
long-term average design discharge quantity,   and  colibacillus
is as index contaminant and the concerntration of colibacillus
in waste water is 1.6XiOTfl.
The damping rate I of colibacillus is defined from the time
Too in which it decays 90% under certain condition.
1=-1nD. 1/To,
The value Too changes greatly in a  day,   it  relates  to  the
illuminance and  other  environmental  characteristics  of  the
area  where  sewage  is  discharged  at  different  time.   The
costinuodS measurement  on  sewage  from  Malan  River  at  the
selected  discharge  suot  is  carried  out  referring  to  the
experiment of the Parsley Bight (Canada) by Bellair,    and  the
results are shown in Tab.4-2. Because Too is the function of
time t, it should be considered that the different dinitial
discharge time how to influence the results and 4 different
initial times are taken to release sewage, which are 0:00,8:00,
12:00 and 18:00.

According to the water quality criterion  for  bathing  beach,
the concerntration of colibacillus is 1.0x104/1 and its  speed
of diffusion is 0.6 cm/s
Current field for calculation is obtained by  interpolation
of the measurement data in 13 stations from 19S87 to 1990.
Fig.4-10 - 4-20  are  the  visitation  frequency  fields,
qhich the initial discharge time is different for the  selected
plan, and dffectire simulation time Ts is  12h  and  24h.   The
isograms of visitation frequency are lines valuing 0. 01, 0. 06,
0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 5 respectively from outside to inside.
It can be found that the area  of  visitation  frequency  is
minimum in day time (12h) for the  waste  water  field,   which
sewage is discharged at 6:00,  it  is  because  of  the  damping
coefficient bigger in day time.
The  frequency  of  the  outside  isogram  of  visitation
frequency is 0.01, that means contaminant  plume  visitB  the

the concerntration of colibacillus around this line  is  over
10000/1. The shorest distance from the isogram of  visitation
frequency, which  value  equals  0. 01,   is  about  700m  to

criterion at different situations. It can be found in the
table that the maximum area over criteria value  are  0. 663km2
and 0. 725 km2 at 3h ard 6h after discharge.
From the analysis above, and for the selected plan. the 0.01

Numerical Modelling of the Tidal Current in Heishijiao
ght
For  a  certain  sewage- bearing  sea  area,    the  physical
iz-icatioc of sea water is decided by the environmental
*AMlic conditions, such as circulation and exchanging rate of
water. So. current field should be  calculated  to  provide
dynamic  condition  for  the  prediction  of   contaminant
tusion and water quality.
Heishijiao Bight is situated in the northern part of the
,Li Strait.  The  topography  .s  very  complex  because  of
tuous coastline and many islets. The current in the bight
mainly subject to the westward progressive tidal wave in
strait. Because the mouth of the bigh- is open  widely  and
distance from the mouth to the top is short,    no  seperate
DI! system can be formed in the bight. The tidal curront in
bight  is  discrepant  greatly,    particularly  near   the
-els and the islands, because of the effect of the  complex
graphy.
From the harmonic analysis of tides, the tide in the  bight
'ute dominant  constituent,    and  the  characteristics  of
-  current is irregular semi-diurnal mixed  tidal  current.
the numerical modelling of N2-tide is carried out in the
The ADI method is adopted because of its good verification
the results.
1   Governing Equations and Conditions
Heishijiao Bight is a shollow water near coast where the
water is well mixed in the vertical direction,  Bo  the  two
asional depth-averaged motion and continuity equations are

Huanghai sea, h is depth of water, C is Chezy' s coefficient,
C=H"'/n, n is Manning  coefficient,    g  is  acceleration  of
gravity, f is Coriolis  coefficient,   U,   V  are  vertically
-averaged velocities at X-axis and Y-axis, respectively,   t  is
time variation.
The boundary condition of Equations (4-17)    (4- 19)   are
following: the velocity componment perpendicular to  the  coast
is zero at the close boundary. Along the  open  boundary,    the
value of sea level is given as following:
(4- 20)
where   ( (t) is the tidal level at any time;  and  cr    is  the
angular velocity of M2-tidal: 12 is the amplitude of M2-tidal
gu2 is the lag of M2-tide.
The initial conditions are as following:
t (z1t, y o) =O,    u (X, y, to) =v (, y, to) G0  (4-21)
4.3.2 The Results
l. Verification of the Model
In order to illustrate  the  validity  of  the  model,    the
results of computation were compared with the observation data
. The amplitude of M2-tide from the obserred data at the mouth
of Malan River is 0. 98m, and the computed value is 0. 97m,  that
is to say,  that  both  vaoues  are  considerabley  closed.    A
comDarision between the computed balies and obser7ed values  of
M2-tida' current is listed in Tab.4-3. It is shown in Tab. 4- 3
that the absolution deriation of  M2- tidal  current  speed  is
less than 3.3 cm/s,  the  deviations  of  current  direction  in
most areas are less than 10 degrees.   That  is  to  say,   the
numerical results by the model  are  agreement  with  the  real
tidal current in Heishijiao Bight.
2. The Tidal Circulation in Heishijiao Bight
In order to illustrate the  evolution  process  of  the  M2
-tidal current with the lapse  off  time  and  in  the  space,
pictures of distribution of  tidal  current  in  one  12- tidal
cycle were drawn and shown in Fig. 4-29- 4-4o. Thbse 12 figures
illastrate in detail the circulation and distribution in  space
of M2-tide in Heishijiao Bight. The turn of tidal current  from
ebb tidal current to flood tidal current occurs about one  hour
before high water, na shown in Fig.4-31. And  another  turn  of

*'  current occurs about on hour before low water,  as  shown
Fig.4-37. The phase of flood-tidal current is from t-3 to t
-The phase of ebb tidal current is from t=9 to t=1  of  next
Ie. Along the coast and near the islands,    the  speed  and
--tion of current varies complexly  due  to  the  effect  of
:-itry and topograDhy,  near  the  islands,   circum- currents
re formed.
The Distribution Characteristics of Tidal Current Field

The Tide-induced Residual Currents
The tide-induced residual currents calculated in the paper
is  the  Dermanent  currents  caused  by  the   non-  linear
interactions of the  complex topography and the tidal  motion
without considering the residual currents caused by seasons,
and they are one of the constant acting forces  on pollutant.
Fig.4-42  shows  the  results  of  calculation. Especitlly, a
clockwise closed eccentric vortex is formed near the center
of-Beishijiso Bight.The current at the west side of the center
of the vortex is weaker with a velocity of 4cm/s,while,that at
the east side is stronger with a maximum velocity of up to
l9cm/l.The strong current occurs at the 6outhwest side of
Dalian Islands.
4.4.The Prediction of Construntion Field Corresponing  to  the
Sewage   Discharge Plan
This section deals with  the  equilibrium    concentration
fields that are formed by pollutant under the influence of
anviromental dynamics in the long term to predict the effect
upon  the  enviromental  quality  in  the  selected   sewage
discharge scheme.
The pollutant mixing and transportation are caused by the
tidal current and other dynamic factors.The tidal current  is
the main dynamic and  cauges  the  cyclist  movement  of  the
pollutant.At the  same  time, the  turbulence  in  the  tidal
current leads to the waste water mixing with the sea water.
Due to the tidal current is the dominant factor in the
shallow water and the mixing is sufficient in thr Tertical
direction,therefore,we adopt the  two  dimensional  adrective
-dispersion model.and the ADI method is still used in the
numerical simulation.
4.4.1.The Governing Equation and Conditions
In shallow bays,the convective diffusion of pollutants
under the tidal currents is expressed as following equation:

where, x, y: the components of the rectangular coordinate system.
U,V: the vertically average velocity components in the  x
and y direction respectively.
P:the rertically averaged concentration.
S.:the external source of pollutant.
K.,K,: the dispersion coefficients in the x and y
directions respectively

current velocity components.
C:Chezy's coeffieient,C=SH1//n,I  is the depth of water,n
is Manning'  coefficient.
The boundary conditions far the equation in the water-land

When the sea water flows out,the oven boundary is:

When the sea water flows in,it is:
P~=P. (X, y)                                 (4-27)
We assume the initial concentration is zero.
4.4.2.Total Pollutant Discharge into the Sea
Sorting  out  the  original  information  of  waste  water
discharge provided by the Dalian Construction  Bureau  obtain
pollutant fluxes for prediction and assessment(shown in Table
4-4).

.4.3.The Water Quality Prediction of the Plan
In shallow water,tidal current is the dominant factor in
the dispersion process.The wind and the surface current play
the second roles.The wind has a grest effect upon the water
surface,especially for the oil slick and drift pollutants it
the dispersion process. Here, we regard the pollutants as
conservative matters. It is soluble or suspensible, i.e.
Degradation or soluble very slowly. We should point out that
the pollutants are not conservative exactly,especially oil.The
-hysical and chemical processes in the dispersion are very
compleL.We only consider the oil in water in the dispersion
and look upon as the soluble pollutant.Due to the mode does
not include degradation- attenuation  process,  therefore, the
prediction  concentration  is  a  little  higher  than   the
practical concentration.
Using the above medol predicts the concentration field.
under the long-term influenceof mean tidal current(Fig. 4- 43
-Fig.4-82).These figures show:water discharge according to the
selected plan, the water quality is improTed essentially.
Even under the circumstance  of  long- term  discharge,    the
effect upon the Xinghai Park and Fujiazhuang Beach is little.
The characteristic values of prediction concentration
field are summed up in Table 4-5. The  table  shows  clearly:
maximum concentrations of the water quality indexes--COD,BOD.,
and SS--are far bellow the  allowable  concentration  in  the
standard for the first class near the outlet. The inorgnic
nitrogen has the -great influence upon the enviroment by
compare. Under the circumstance of short term discharge, the
maximum concentratiot near the outlet is 0.17mg/I.It is  1. 7
111



times as much as the allowable concentration in the standard
for the first class.Since the water is deep and the current
is stroag near the outlet. The physical purification is
powerful. The minimum dilution time is  248. Tjerefore,   the
area of exceeding the standard is small. The area of exceeding
the standard limit in the scenic spot is zero. The main
pro;ection  area- - linghai  Park,   Fujiazhuang  Beach  and
aquaculture area along the coast1 the concentrayion is O. Olmg/l,
hardly has effect.Under the condition of long term discharge,
the maximum concentration near the outlet is near standard
limit for the  third  class.   However1    the  area  of  high
concentration exceeding the standard limit for class  is  far
away from the main protection area, and the area exceeding the
standard for the first class in the scenic spots is only 0.21km
2.The concentration in standard limit for the first class.
Chapter 5 The Prediction of Concentration Field
Corresponding to the Secondary Sewage
Treatment and Discharge Plan
After secondary treatment, the sewage  from  Milan  River,
except those deeply treated to be industrial recovery water
of low quality, is drained to the mouth of Malan River through
pipeline and discharged. In order to prevent sewage from
polluting the beach because of the tide, the outlet of
pipeline iS 110 meters  far  away  from  the  seashore.   The
concentration of pollutant in the sew-go from Malan River
after- secondary treatment is lower than the discharge
standards of Liaouing Province. Therefore,   this  paper  only
deals with the equalibrium concentration field of pollutants
under the long-term influence of the enriromental dynamics to
predict the influences of this scheme on the enviromental
quality of the sea area.
5.1.Total Pollutant Amount Discharged inte Sea
According to the design water amount and quality in the
concerned report offerred by Dalian Garden Plan institute,
the pollutant fluxes are obtained as shown in table 5-1.

5.2.The Prediction of Water Quality Corresponding to the Sewage
Discharge
After the secondary treatment, most of the  oil,   SS  and
drift matters are treated,  so, off slict can not be rormee on
the sea surface and there are no drifting matter. The models
in  Section  4. 4  are  used  to  predict  the   equilibrium
concentration field of every main indexes of water quality
under the tidal current influence of different discharge
amount in short and long term, as shown in Fig. 6-1-Fig. 6- 32.
These figures show: after  secondary  treatment,    the  water
quality is improved essentially, even under the circumstance
of long term discharge, the effect upon the Xinghai Park and
Fujiazhuang Beach is little.
The characteristic values of the prediction concentration
field are summed up in table 6-2.The table shows:   sewage  is
discharged near the coast, the water is shillow near the coast,
the dischargo outlet is at the top of  the  bight,    and  the
current velocity is lower, about 10 cm/s,so,   the  pollutant
concentrtion near the discharge outlet is  higher,    but  the
pollutant concentration gradually decreases because of the
transportation of the sea currents, so the extent of high
concentration is small, about 0.26km'. Even so,   because  of
the secondary treatment, the discharge of pullutant is small,
the water quality indexes of BOD., COD and SS are below the
allowable concentration of water quality standards for firsst
class sea area except in area of 0. 25km near discharge outlet.
By comparison, the influence of total inorganic nitrogen on
environment is greatest, under the sizuation  of  short- term
discharge, ehe area exceeding the water quality standaras  of
first class sea area is 0.36km2, and that exceeding the water
quality standards of secondsiry class sea  area  is  0.- 25km2.
113



Under the situation of long-term discharge, the area exceeding
the quality standards of first class ssea area is 1.Olkm2, and
the area exceeding the quality standards of second class  sea
area is 0.72kmn. All this four kinds of pollutants hardly has
effect  on  the  main  protection  areas-  -  Xinghai   Park,
Fujiaxzhuang Reach and aquacutture area.

Chapter 6.  The Analysis of  the Alternin A&n
a. i The Teehno1ogy Analysie
(1) Fir sea dischu  3t;io*   r"tmt.r
The third treatment scheme of sewage from Malaan  River  is:
the sewage is directly drained to far sea area through 7km
pipeline and discharged without any  treatment.    The  sewage
quality demands are:
Of No drifting matters exist on the surface of sea after
being discharged iato sea.
@3No oil films are formed on the sea surface.
q®No pathogen exists in sewage.
9Foreign matters such as sand and fruit-stone must be
removed.
Although the. mechanical  grilles  are  installed  in  the
existing Malan River Sewage Pump Station, it only can remove
large drift matters such as plastics, clod and waste paper,
and sand, oil film and small solid mstter are difficult to be
removed,  and this can not meet the demands of  water quality.
In the meantime, they can block the pipeline and diffuser. So
we think that this scheme is not a practical one.
(2) Far-sea- Disektrego tftitr Pttunu   ?iuta-.
rhe experience on the far- sea  disciharge  of  sewage  has
accumulated form the application in the east and west coast of
the U.A.S, the coast of the North Sea in Europe and BongKong.
The concerned study has been carried out successively in
ShenYang, Yantai and Shanghai, and the first sewage -discharge
=into-sea project has been constructed in Ningbo. By learning
from and using the foreign and domestic successful experiences,
a plenty of basic studies on  Malan  River  sewage  discharge
project have been carried out since 1987, and we have mainly
mastered the key technology such as the structire disign,
process, manufactive and construction of drainage pipeline and
3ffuser. The foreign and domestic practice prore that it is
feasible in technology.

Third Treatment
After being treated to reach the national and provincial
discharge standards by secondary treatment,    the  sewage  is
131



discharged offshore, and part of the sewage is recovered to be
industrial water of low quality by third deep  treatment.   At
present, a systematic project ----The Chunliu Sewage Treatment
Plant has been set up to recover the water. It is  successful,
and the-technology is proved to be ripe.
6.2 The Cost and Benefit Analysises of the Schemes
The Malan River Sewage Treatment Project is a public
welfare item that inproves environment and benefit the people.
Therefore, the comprehensive index of economic environmental
and social benefits of the scheme should be taken into account
in the multi-scheme comparison. That is , the cost and benefit
analysis should not be limited within the project,    and  the
social benefit should be considered.
Cost refer to the environmental protection investment and
operation costs of the installations. Benefit refer to direct
economic benefits and environmental benefit (indirect economic
benefit) resulting from the improvement of environment after
the environmental protection installations are put into use.
Because the scheme of far-sea discharge without treatment has
been negated, the cost and benefit analysises are carried out
only on  the  scheme  of  far- sea  disechrge  after  primary
treatment and the scheme of secondary treatment with part
being recovered by third treatment.
According to the scheme analysis of Malan liver Sewage
Treatment Project, The costs benefits and caleualtion methods
of each scheme are as following:
(1) The Cost of the Scheme
The costs mainly inciude the total investment of project
and operation costs, the calculation methods and results are
obtained from the feasibility study report.
(2) The Benefits of the Scheme:
(DThe charge for sewage treatment
After the Malan River Sewage Treatment Project has been fin
ished and put into operation, a sewage discharge company should
be founded and operated as an  enterprise.   Sewage  discharge
will be charged with a price of 0. 3013$ per ton sewage.
C)The charge for recycle water by third treatment
The 10- 1-5 benefit is added to the costs of third
treatment, and then the price of recycle water is 0.50 RMB $
*/ton.

2rThe saved diversion project investment
In order to meet the demand of long- term development of
municipal water supply, the third-period diversion project of
Dalian will co0t 2420RMB $ per ton water. Applyiag the shadow
project method in  environmental  economy,    the  benefit  of
recycle water by third treatment is equal  to  the  diversion
project investment of same amount of water.
C©The sarved charge for increase of water consumption
According to the formulate of Dalian Government, 800 RMB $
of the charge should be paid for increasing per unit of tap
water, which is equal to the investment of same scale

ffo)The benefit of increase of water resources
Dalian is a city which is short of freshwater resource, in
dry  seasons,    some  industrial  enterprises  determine  the
production according to the water supply.  And  this  reduces
financial income by  about  a  billion  RMB $ .   The  water
consumption for a EMB$ output value is 0.33 ton per day, that
is increasing 0. 33 ton water every day will increase a 1MB $
benefit. The opportunity cost is 311B3$ per ton water.
i'The environmental benefit of Milan River control
The Malan River Sewage Treatment Project is mainly to solve
the pollution problem in Beishijiao Bight, and to recover the
functions of scenic spots and bathing beaches  in  the bight.
The reccier cost method is used to calculate the  en,ironment
benefit, that is, the minimum costs of Malan River Sewage
Treatment -the investment of far- sea discharge after
primary treatment-is regarded ai minimum estimate value of
the founction loss in Heishijiao Bight.
TiThe method of cost and benefit analysis:
nB1-C1
NPV method:       NPV=E
t=l(l+r)'
n   B1
t=J (l+r)
Benefit rate method:   b

wcoa ro0,   r is tio diacaunt rita    (6S)
t Is time   (year)
Bt is the benefit in the ith year
C1 is the costs in the ith year
In the comparison of benefit and cost,    the  bigger  the
values of NPV and 6 are, the better the benefit is . When NPV
>0 and 6 >1, the project io feasible; when NPV<o and   6 < i,
the project is not feasible.
- The calculations of benefit and cost are based on the long
-term project scale, that is, sewage amount of third treatment
is 40, 000 tons per day. Tab. 6-1 and Tab. 6-2 show the result.

From Tab.6-3,   - th of  the  two  schemes  can  satisfy  the
demands of water quality in Beishijias Bight,   and  can  ensure
the enviromental safe of aquaculture area and bathing beach.
Their main differences are as following.
(DFor both of the two schemes;  the  core  ranges  of  high
concentration  are  all  near  the  discharge   outlet,            the
concentration of scheme 2 is bigger than that of scheme 1,  but
the area of scheme 2 is smaller than that of scheme 1.
-  (2)The outlet of scheme 2 is 4km  farther  away  from  coast
than that of scheme 1, and scheme 2 has less pollution  on  the
scenic protection area, even so, the two schemes both satisfy
the demands of first class water quality.
6. 4 Summary
From  the  analysises  of  technology,          economic   and
environmental benefits of the schemec, the  influences  of  the
schemes on environment are same basicly, they all  satisfy  the
demads of environmental protection. In teehnology, scheme 1  is
riper than scheme 2.

Chapter 7 Measures to Prevent the Disadvantagous
Effects
7.1.Perfecting the Intercepted Drain System
The coastline of Heishijiao Bight is complicated and of
many sewage discharge outlets.   Because  of  the  many- year
construction since 1984,most of the industrial waste water
and living sewage is drained to the west,    south  and  north
inter cepted drain pipelines, and this provides am advantags
to the centralized treatment of sewage of Malan River. But in
recent years,because of the development of  resideatal  areas
and more sewage outlets, there is still part of sewage that
directly discharged into the sea, and this will influence tie
results of sewsee treatment.So. according to the municipal
planning, the intercepted drain system should be perfected to
ensure the result of sewage treatment.
7.2.Strengheaing the Primary Treatment inthe Key Pollution
Sources    Factories
At present, the water quality indexes in the design of
sewage treatment project is the yearly or daily averaged
values, in fact, the water quality changes with seasins and
production load. In order to ensure the result of the sewage
treatment plant and  the  quality  of  recovery  water,    the
management in the key pollution sources with large  discharge
load should be adopted within the factories( suck as Dalian
P4armaceutical Factory, Dalian Brewary, Dalian  Winery,    and
Dalian Paict Factory). The sewage is treated within the
factories  to  reach  the  water  quality  standards  od  the
municipal sewage treatment plant(GJI8-86) (COD is 600 mg/l,BQDD
is 300mg/1).
7.3.StreDgihening the Comprenehsive Treatment of Eeishijiao
Bight
According to  municiple  pianning,    Heishijiao  Bight  is
determined ti be the scenic spot area with a funtion of class
two sea area. No new factory are allowed to be set up along
tne coast, and it is not suit for aquaculture.
At present, feishijiao Bight is  in  a  constant,    stabIr
137



condition of eutrophication. One reason is that a plenty of
fertilizer is added for the kelp culture, this results in the
high concentration of eutrophic salts in the water. . Another
reason is the barrier formed by plenty of kelp, this  reduces
the exchanging ability of sea water, and reduce  the  current
velocity in the bight, this results in the pollation  of  sea
water. The aquaculture rafts should be dismantled to make the
sea water with great exchanging ability.
7.4.The Enviromental Protection within  the  Sewage  Treatment
Plant
(l)Scenery Construction
Because the plant is located  in  the  s:enic  area,   the
feature design of the buildings should  payattention  to  the
shaue  and  art  style, they  must  be  harmonious  with  the
surroudings, giving people a wonderful scenery and showing
the modern characteristics. In  the  mean  time,   the  green
project shoald be strengthened to ensure the green corering
rate to be 30%.
(2)The Sludge Treatment Measures
The sludge from the treating process will be transported
to be sanitary landfilled in Maiyingzi refuse landfill field
after concentrating and machenic dehydration,  tl,is  prevents
the secondary pollution on evriromeat.
(3)The Flue Gas Treatment Measures
The heating source of the plant is from the boiler house,
and the Model 99 ceramic multi-pipe dust remover is equipped
there, its efficiency is up to 90%, the dust concentration at
outlet is less than 300mgfma, the  hight  of  chimney  is  25
meters, all of these ensure the flue  gas  discharge  satisfy
the provincial standards and can lot pollute the air.
(4)The Measures to Prevent Noise
The noise soures in the plant are mainly from the air
-blower kouse, pump house and boiler house. In model selection
of equipments, the centrifugal blowers and pumps with low
noise and hign efficiency are selected.   In  the  design  of
struture and constrution, the sound-proof and damper measures
are adopted,decorating acoustic boards are ased on the inside
walls and doors. All of these ensure  the  noise  within  the
plant to satisfy the standards(790BWU in day,6OdB(A) at night).

Chapter 8    The Conclusions
According to the comprehensive analysises and comuarison of
technology,  econocy,    and  enriromental  benefits  among  the
schemes of Malan River sewage treatment project, the scheme
of secondary treatment with part recovered is recommanded to
the most reasonable and feasible scheme. The project is one
that improve -the enviroment, and its farour effects are more
than its disadvantages greatly. First of all, it not only can
solve the pollution problem in Heishijiao Bight, but also CIn
provide new water resource, and it will play an important
role in the municipal constritction and economic development.
Itt  disadvantages (such P3 sludge, flue  gas,   noise) can  be
solred by strengthening thr project measures to thr level of
the enviromental tolerance.
