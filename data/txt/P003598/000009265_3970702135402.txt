4 blast furnaces are located 4&*&Pingshan District. In
1991, No.3 blast furnace produced 648000 tons of ironKOI$v(
No, 4 blast furnace produced        0 tons,-LLg ?':er 4
shifts with 10 taps eac             Ld: .The
technical specificatic?prfA these four blast furnaces
are listed in Table 5.1.1. Process data of blast
furnace gas are listed in Table 5.1.2. Dedusting OfABF
gas is achieved byvAconventional wet process,  i.e.
washing  tower,  Venturi  tube) and  electrostatic
precipitation process.BF gas washing water is directly
discharged into,XTaizi River without any treatment, so
that water in Taizi  River is heavily polluted.
Furthermore, poor BF gas dedusting efficiency makes
high dust content BF gas which can not meet the
reu-irequirement cl fg squality standard. -      gas is

6    ANALYSIS OF COMPARATIVE ALTERNATIVES
Besides the DEP alternative, the bag filter alternative
is acceptable. These two alternatives are compared as
follows:
1) The dry electrostatic precipitator is characterized
by high temperature resistance (350 degrees C, <30
min.)and   is suitable for the nature of Chinese
/.practic where the BFG temperature is higher.
However, the working temperature of$ ag filter is
limited by the mat  jal of filter bag of teflon fiber
with temperature .-not more than 200 degrees C.The
operation practice ofAChinese blast furnace is on
/,lower burden grade, lower hot blast temperature (1100
Asa, c
degrees C),and lower top pressure.         result, the
fuel rate is higher and the BFG temperature before
cleaning is higher (80-270 degrees C in general, 100-
350 degrees C for hot burden). Obviously, the teflon
type filter bag (including NOMEX, CONEX, HT-1) is not

must be equipped with two butterfly valves and three

problems.
3W~~~~~~~~3



1)  The  c-oizi rco  devic-e  for  the  stability  of, BFG
temperature is the second important component to the
dry type gas cleaning system.  Actually,  the BFG
temperature is        fluctuating.-  at      I .i. i.''wen
the blast furnace is under abnormal operation,  the
BFG temperature may rise as high as 400 degrees C
/,XYTW  higher. For the bag filter,  water  spray.W#
cooling home to be equbpPe4 to coolie* down the BFG
1&r to the required temperature. As r.h.e result,
secondary energy source *-a*imnot be reasonably used
and-%great amount of electricity           be consumed
of~..the high pressure water pump. On the contrary,
the DEP is capable jua solvp-the problem of BFG
temperature fluctuation because it is equipped with a
heat accumulator buffer. When the BFG temperature -am
I000 C  'within 5 minutes), the precipitator m*p
.CLLL           maintain the BFG inlet temperatureAlower than 350
degrees C. In addition, no power is required and no
heat loss will occurshe"
The major disadvantageh    accumulating buffer
is not capable to, --AR  e   .temperature for a long
period. -should such a circumstance e-"g.-   the
accumulation will be out of control as soon as the
heat accumulated reaches saturation point.  But the
new heat exchanger buffer may have function like a
bufffer when the BFG temperature is fluctuated in
short time.
36



Whhen tihe bLlast furnace is not operated in  favorable
condition thus the BFG will be in over temperature
for long period. At this moment,  the buffer may
L     guarantee the BFG temperature at inlet of deduster in
line with the regulated value. The heat exchanger
buffer is therefore the ideal device for heat buffer
4)  The DEP may have service life as long as 8 years
which -hvueW equals to the campaign life of the blast
furnace. However, the service life of bag filter will
depend to a great extent on the quality of/,filter
bag. For example, the NOMEX bag may work fore2fSears,
in-C
5)  As to 1.he power consumption, the DE           to 0.45
kWh/t.Fe ands'l.33 kWh/t.Fe for *W.e bag filter/C4>e-.
6) The operating cost ofADEP is quite low owing to its
advantages of higher temperature resistance,  longer
service life, lower power consumption and easier
maintenance"which is the attractive point to the
operators), But the cost of/,DEP is about 20% higher
than that of bag filter. Based on the above mentioned
analysis,7selection ofADEP for BFG cleaning system in
Benxi's No.1-4 blast furnaces is             .

7    ENVIltONMENI'AL IMP'ACT tE6-V+G  PROGRAM
In order to pei..-e the environmental impact of the
project during constructibn and operation, some points
are now recommended as follows:
1) For nainimizing the noise pollution during
construction of the project, ±he lower noise
fni equipment should be used for construction. During
operation, silencer and sound insulation facilities
should be used to minimize the harm of noise to the
human    e health.
2) In order to prevent the dust flying up to pollute the
environment', ,     closed 4discharge and transpo=
should be used for the DEP and dust catcher.
