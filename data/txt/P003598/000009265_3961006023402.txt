MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A LIAONING ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for the equivalent
of $110 million to help finance the Liaoning Environment Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20
years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent
to Liaoning Province (LP) for 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at a rate
equivalent to 70 percent of the rate payable to the Bank by the Borrower, with
a 0.75 percent commitment charge on the outstanding balance. LP would bear
the foreign exchange risk. LP would onlend part of the proceeds to the par-
ticipating manicipalities of Anshan, Benxi, Dalian, Fushun, Jinxi and Jinzhou
on the same terms as between the Borrower and LP and a commitment charge of
0.75 percent, and to the Liaoning Environment Fund (LEY) for 15 years includ-
ing 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and a
commitment charge of 0.75 percent, the municipalities and LEF bearing the
foreign exchange risk. The municipalities would onlend to (a) the implement-
ing public utilities for 15 years including 5 years of grace at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent, with
the utilities bearing the foreign exchange risk; and (b) industrial enter-
prises for 10 years including 3 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate plus a spread of 1.5 percent per annum and a commitment charge
of 0.75 percent, with the enterprises bearing the foreign exchange risk. LEF
would onlend for eligible pollution control subprojects for between 3 to
5 years, including 1 to 2 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate plus a spread of 1.5 percent per annum and a commitment charge
of 0.75 percent, with the enterprises bearing the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  Liaoning Province, in northeastern China, has a popula-
tion of about 36 million including some 25 million urban. The province has a
strong urban industrial base, but relies for its basic food supply on farming
undertaken in several large river basins. The most important of these are the
twin basins of the Hun and Taizi Rivers, comprising 20 percent of the land
area, producing about 40 percent of its agricultural and 60 percent of its
industrial output, and containing about 13 million people. Water supply for
industrial, domestic and agricultural purposes is heavily dependent on flows
from the two rivers, either from direct extraction or from groundwater
recharge. Rapid industrial development combined with inappropriate wastewater
management has heavily polluted both surface and groundwater resources with
organic matter, toxic chemicals, oils and heavy metals, seriously affecting
drinking, industrial and agricultural water quality.
3.        There is therefore an urgent need to raise the quality of the water
in the two rivers to a standard that is environmentally safe, economically
usable and sustainable. The Liaoning Provincial Government (LPG) has begun to
curb the discharge of heavy metals and toxic chemicals from the major pollut-
ing industries, and some success in this area has been achieved; addressing
the remaining po'llutants has to be dealt with at the city level, work which
most cities have still not been equipped to do.



- 2 -
4.        Responsibility for water resources in Liaoning is shared among five
agencies--Water Conservancy, Construction Commission, Environmental Protec-
tion, Public Health, and Geology and Mining--each of which has been assigned
specific functions. The work of these agencies in water resource development,
allocation and management is coordinated by the Liaoning Water Resource Man-
agement Committee headed by a provincial Vice Governor. There is a sound
environmental legislation and regulatory framework in place at the central,
provincial and municipal levels. The Liaoning Environmental Protection Bureau
(LEPB) and its subordinate environmental protection bureaus (EPBs) in munici-
pal and lower levels are responsible for maintaining environmental and water
quality. The EPBs set environmental and discharge standards, assess and levy
pollution charges, monitor all discharges and environmental quality, and pro-
secute serious pollution offenders. Each city has a wastewater unit under the
city's Construction Commission, which operates sewerage facilities to collect,
treat and dispose of domestic and industrial wastewater and domestic night-
soil; in some cases, industrial wastewater is discharged directly into rivers
or the sea, independent of the city's collection system.   Municipal solid
waste is collected and disposed of by municipal sanitation bureaus.
5.        Strategies for the effective utilization of the Hun-Taizi water
resources were identified through the Bank-managed Hun/Taizi River Basin Man-
agement Study completed in 1988, which identified a ranked set of investments
required for water resource development and water pollution abatement measures
in specific cities designed to improve water resource protection and utiliza-
tion; the study highlighted deficiencies in institutional arrangements for
water resource management, inadequate urban environmental services, and the
need for focused water and wastewater investments. A first Bank-financed
project, the Liaoning Urban Infrastructure Project (Credit 2219-CHA) approved
in FY90 and implemented by the Liaoning Urban Construction and Renewal Project
Office (LUCRPO) supports water supply in the basin cities of Shenyang, Fuxin
and Yingkou, and measures to strengthen industrial pollution control; imple-
mentation is satisfactory. This project would finance a priority set of
investments focusing on environmental management and pollution abatement.
6.        Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Operations.  The proposed project
draws and builds on the experience gained through the ongoing Liaoning Urban
Infrastructure Project; the ongoing Shanghai Sewerage Project (Credit 1779-
CHA), which finances the collection and removal of wastewater from the city
and strengthens institutional capacity for wastewater and water resource man-
agement; and the Zhejiang Multicity Development Project (Credit 2475-CHA),
whicei addresses the problem of water supply, environmental management and area
development in the major cities of Zhejiang Province. Our experience from
these and other environment and urban infrastructure investments in China has
demonstrated high implementation capacity, but a tendency to postpone the
Implementation of cost-recovery policies and the adoption of long-term plans
for the provision of essential urban environmental services.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  This operation is consistent with
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on August 3,
1993; the project supports economic reform while assisting environmentally
responsive infrastructure modernization, addressing the needs identified in
the Strategy. Our recent environmental sector work identified improving envi-
ronmental protection in major urban areas as a national priority. Being
familiar with key sector issues and institutions through involvement in the
first Liaoning project, the Bank is in a good position to assist the Govern-
ment to address the main provincial environmental issues through the project,



- 3 -
optimizing investments needed to achieve river basin objectives. The resolu-
tion of provincial environmental problems requires the concerted effort of and
cooperation among central, provincial and municipal governments, in consulta-
tion with the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and the local
environmental protectior. bureaus. LUCRPO has played and would continue to
assume an effective sector coordination role. The project would support
adopting wastevater, air pollution and municipal solid waste management tech-
nologies with vhich China still has limited experience, and international
expertise provided through the Bank's support would underpin these initia-
tives.
8.        Project Objectives.  The project objectives are to:  (a) protect the
main water resources in Liaoning Province including the Hun-Taizi River Basin
to allow their sustained economic and safe use for drinking, industrial, and
agricultural purposes; (b) strengthen pricing policies and institutional
arrangements for environment protection, water pollution control, wastewater
and municipal solid waste management; and (c) institute measures for air pol-
lution control and cultural heritage asset management.
9.        Prolect Descrintion.  The project would provide physical works and
technical assistance for institutional development in water supply, wastewater
treatment, air pollution control, wastes management, water conservation and
process improvements, and cultural heritage asset management. A series of
prioritized investments would comprise: (a) Wastewater Managemer. in Anshan
and Fushun comprising sewers, pump stations, secondary wastewatet reatment
and effluent reuse facilities; (b) Wastewater and Air Quality Mane.ement in
Benxi comprising sewers, pump stations and primary wastewater treatment
facilities, an air quality management program including equipment and facili-
ties to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency on two blast furnaces
and three coke ovens, and district central heating to serve some 20,000 house-
holds over an area of some 300 hectares; (c) Wastewater. Municipal Solid Waste
and Water Conservation Manatement investments in Dalian, comprising sewers,
secondary wastewater treatment (new plant and existing plant upgrading) and
effluent reuse facilities; solid waste management investments comprising mod-
ernization of the municipal collection, transfer and transportation system,
upgrading of the existing landfill to sanitary standards, and providing for
future landfill gas utilization; and a pilot water conservation and clean
technology program; (d) Water Supply System Enhancement and Protection in
Jinzhou comprising groundwater development and trunk supply, treatment plant
upgrading and distribution system strengthening, supported by a major pollu-
tion reduction and water conservation program at the nearby Jincheng General
Paper Mill; (e) Environmental Rehabilitation and Reconstruction comprising the
recording, rehabilitation, conservation, protection, restoration and presenta-
tion of prioritized cultural heritage assets (of world significance) including
the Liaoning Great Wall at Jiumenkou, archeological sites at Niuheliang and
Jieshi Gong, and the Shenyang Provincial Museum; (f) Liaonina Environment Fund
for the provision of short-term finance for focused high environmental-impact
investments of in-plant clean technology process change, supporting the core
investments in air and wastewater management; and (g) Institutional Strenath-
ening through Technical Assistance and Trainint for supporting and strengthen-
ing environmental, financial and utility management and performance monitor-
ing, training, feasibility studies and future project preparation.
10.       The institutional development and policy strengthening components
would enhance policies and operational experience in environmental protection,
wastewater reduction, water pollution control, and heri  ,a asset management.



- 4 -
These initiatives would comprise: (a) establishing appropriate pricing poli-
cies for wastewater, solid waste and cultural heritage asset management (water
resource and water supply pricing policies are dealt with in the Liaoning
Urban Infrastructure Project-Credit 2219-CHA); (b) improving measures for
water pollution monitoring, enforcing water pollution regulations, and estab-
lishing appropriate water pollut.ion charges; (c) creating an environment fund
to support industrial wastewater treatment facilities, process modernization
and clean technology; (d) training staff engaged in financial management,
water pollution control, and wastewater and municipal solid waste management;
and (e) providing technical assistance for studies and future project prepara-
tion including measures to alleviate air pollution, and environmental infra-
structure master planning.
11.       Prosect Implementation.  LPG has appointed a Leading Group headed by
a Vice-Governor to direct project implementation; LUCRPO has been responsible
for project preparation, and would undertake project management, overall
implementation and coordination, and monitoring. Municipal-level project
offices have been established in the project towns of Anshan, Benxi, Dalian,
Fushun, Jinxi and Jinzhou, in the Liaoning EPB and in the Liaoning Cultural
Relics Department; the offices have been appropriately staffed, and would
second additional staff to match project implementation needs. Appropriate
urban service companies are in place which would assume ownership and opera-
tional responsibility of the major infrastructure assets to be financed.
Technical assistance and project monitoring would be implemented according to
an agreed time-bound Action Plan, and project impact monitoring undertaken
against an agreed range of indicators. The project would be carried out over
six years. The total project cost is estimated to be $338.1 million, with a
foreign exchange component of $179.0 million (53 percent). The total finan-
cing required, which includes $12.7 million of interest during construction,
is $350.8 million. To assist the early sta-t expected to be made by LPG on
some works, it is recommended that retroact we financing of up to $11.0 mil-
lion be provided for expenditures incurred srom September 1, 1993, covering
initial civil works, goods and services contracts. A breakdown of project
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12708-CHA, dated
June 14, 1994, is being distributed separately.
12.       Sustainabilitv.  The proposed water, sewerage and urban service
charge enhancements, together with the investments to improve the air quality
in Benxi would provide a framework for project and environment management sus-
tainability. The operations and maintenance costs to support the investments
would be provided through the formation of vastewater companies and improved
revenue arrangements; the companies would be strengthened and revenues
enhanced under the project. The technical assistance and training components
would underpin utility management and strengthen sector institutions.
13.       Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were obtained
regarding onlending and project organizational requirements, and assurances
obtained that: (a) the implementing agencies would carry out the resettlement
of persons affected by the project according to a plan satisfactory to the
Bank and report annually on the progress of resettlement, using agreed moni-
toring indicators; (b) Jinzhou Water Supply Company would generate revenues
from its water supply operations to cover operating and maintenance costs



(before depreciation), increases in working capital, debt service, and 30 per-
cent of three years' average investments; (c) the wastewater companlies of
Anshan, Benxi, Dalian and Fushun, the Benxi District Heating Center and the
Dalian Solid Waste Company would (i) generate revenues from their operatior.s,
sufficient to cover total operating expenses (including depreciation), and the
amount by which debt service requirements exceed the provision for deprecia-
tion; and (ii) have a debt service coverage of at least 1.3 timesl (d) Benxi
Iron and Steel Company would maintain a current ratio of at least 1.0 for
fiscal year (FY) 1995, 1.3 for FY96 and 1.5 for each FY thereafter, and
Jincheng General Paper Mill would maintain a current ratio of at least 1.5;
and (e) agreed time-bound Action Plans would be implemented fort (i) connec-
tion of buildings and septic tank and nightsoil facilities in Anshan, Benxi,
Dalian and Fushun that are within 100 m of the sewerage systems; (ii) river
training and other necessary works in Benxi to protect the proposed wastewater
interceptor culvert; (iii) Benxi and Fushun to undertake wastesrater treatment
to national discharge standards for the industrial wastewater discharges not
included in the wastewater components; (iv) in-plant pollution control and
water conservation by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Anshan; (v) expan-
sion by Benxi Gas Company of its gas distribution network to accommodate the
additional gas supplies generated by the Benxi blast furnace component;
(vi) improvement by EPBs of collection of pollution levy fees; and
(vii) implementation of the institutional development and training component.
Contracts have been signed with consulting firms, satisfactory to the Bank,
for financial management improvements and for construction supervision and
management of project works. The execution of subsidiary loan agreements
between project municipalities and implementing agencies, satisfactory to the
Bank, is a conditicn of Loan effectivenesa. Conditions of disbursement for
the LEP component would be the establishment of LEN, and the execution of an
acceptable financial agency agreement for subloan processing.
14.       Environmental Assessment snd Resettlement.  The proposed project
would have a positive environmental impact and is a Category A project. Water
quality of the main river basins would be improved by one grade (Chinese water
quality standard) after the completion of the project. Chinese regulations
require the preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) report at the time
of project design. LPG has prepared a comprehensive EA Report, approved by
LEPB and NEPA; the report was reviewed by the Bank and found to be satisfac-
tory. While the project would remove substantial pollution loads, some possi-
ble side effects have been identified and mitigative measures developed during
the EA process. Appropriate arrangements have been made for the disposal of
excess wastewater treatment plant sludge. In additien, the proposed waste-
water treatment plants would be located at sites which would have minimum
impact on communities, and where the receiving watercourses would have ade-
quate assimilative capacity.
15.       Major resettlement or land acquisition would not be required.  An
estimated 603 households would require reemployment, with only 85 households
requiring rehousing; these would be done under well-documented Chinese policy
and practices that were recently reviewed by the Bank and found to be satis-
factory. A satisfactory resettlement plan was submitted before negotiations.
16.       Prolect Benefits.  Improvement of the water quality in the Hun-Taizi
Rivers brought about by the wastewater collection and treatment components of
the project would, in addition to enhancing environmental quality, enable the
sustained use of existing water resources for social and economic growth in
the region. This would postpone high cost water resource transfers from other



- 6 -
river basins, estimated to cost Y 2.00 ($0.4) per mi3. Improvements in munici-
pal solid waste management in Dalian would reduce service costs, protecting
and improving urban environment and public health conditions. The Benxi air
management investments would significantly improve air quality, lowering plant
operating costs while reducing the air pollution damage currently caused to
public health, buildings, vegetation and city infrastructure. Bank support of
the project would provide China with valuable replicable experience in envi-
ronmental planning, responsive design, and construction and operations of
large wastewater and air pollution management facilitles. The innovative
heritage conservation components would protect from further damage, and dis-
play and restore unique world-class cultural property for sustained public
use.
17.       Risks.  There are three main risks.  Firstly, the lack of experience
in large-scale wastewater project implementation and management, and the need
to master new management and financial policies and techniques, imply that the
cities might not be able to operata the constructed facilities as efficiently
as planned, thereby diminishing expected project benefits: technical assis-
tance and training would be financed under the project to mitigate this risk.
Secondly, a reluctance by LPG to implement and maintain economically efficient
wastewater tariffs would undermine municipal utility company financial viabil-
ity: project design requires meaningful tariff action early in project pro-
cessing, and before appraisal the Municipal Governments implemented substan-
tial tariff increases, thereby lessening this risk significantly. Thirdly,
investments to fully control water pollution in the entire Hun-Taizi River
Basin would be high, requiring considerable follow-on investments if the long-
term environmental benefits were to be maximized.  While LPG proposes to carry
out the program in its entirety, this commitment would necessitate diverting
funds from other productive purposes, which may be difficult. However LPG and
the municipal governments are fully aware of the importance and potential
economic benefits of environmental protection, and the project-generated bene-
fits would be significant even without these additional long-term investments.
In addition, the careful formulation of supervision would ensure regular moni-
toring and effective quality assurance by LPG and the Bank.
18.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
