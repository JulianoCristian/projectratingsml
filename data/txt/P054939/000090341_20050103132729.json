The lessons\n            learned indicate that the social investment fund concept can\n            work as vehicle to achieve poverty reduction in small island\n            countries. Communities can manage key aspects of the\n            subproject cycle, and this contributes to local capacity and\n            ownership. Building lasting and greater social capital is a\n            long-term process. Capacity building is critical, but should\n            be linked as much as possible to the labor market. Project\n            design should consider the long start-up time for new\n            entities. Good managers with decision-making autonomy, and\n            adequate staffing, are key to successful implementation.\n            Community participation fosters the appropriate selection of\n            subprojects. Appropriate design and timing of monitoring and\n            evaluation instruments is crucial to monitoring project\n            impacts. A communications strategy would benefit the Poverty\n            Reduction Fund (PRF). Duplication of donor efforts continues\n            to be a concern and requires careful consideration by the\n            World Bank.
