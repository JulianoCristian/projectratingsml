The project will thus contribute to a\n            sustainable infrastructure, fostering community-led\n            development. The project components include: 1)\n            institutional strengthening for poverty reduction, to\n            further increase the role and responsibilities of\n            communities in the subproject cycle development, including\n            subproject management, and strengthening promotion\n            mechanisms. This component will include the establishment of\n            appropriate methodologies and criteria of the subproject\n            cycle, in accordance with all relevant parties involved in\n            poverty reduction; 2) subproject financing, which will\n            mobilize external co-financing, with possible support from\n            other agencies, such as the Caribbean Development Bank and\n            the European Union. Subproject implementation will include\n            social and economic infrastructure, technical assistance and\n            capacity-building for social assistance programs; 3) project\n            management costs, to cover the execution of the design\n            phase, and implementation, as well as monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1999-07-15T00:00:00Z"}
