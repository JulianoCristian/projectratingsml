   CHINA: SECOND BEIJINGENVIRONMENT PROJECT(Ln. 4566-CHA, GEF
                                  TRUST FUNDTF024121)

 1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval ofthe ExecutiveDirectors to introduce the
following changes inthe China Second Beijing Environment Project (Ln.4566-CHA,
GEF Trust FundTF024121) and accompanying amendments to the project's legal
documents: (a) adding seven new components to the project; (b) canceling $26,512,600
o f loan savings; (c) increasing the disbursement percentage to 75% for civil works o f new
components; (d) extendingthe loan closing date to March 31,2009; and (e) reallocation
o f loanproceeds consistent with the above. The proposed changes will enable Beijing
Municipal Government to utilize most o f the substantial loan savings inthe boiler
conversion component o f Part A, Air PollutionControl, and Part B, Wastewater
Management, for priority additional activities which will improve water quality in
Beijing. The additional components are consistent with the objectives o fthe project.
They represent a substantially higherloan allocationto reduce water pollution and will
contribute to enhanced water quality inthe sections o f the rivers covered by the
additional components.

BackgroundandReasonsfor Restructuring

2.       Project Background. The projectwas approved on June 20,2000 andbecame
effective on May 11,2001, The objective o f the project i s to support visible and
sustained alleviation o f air and water pollution in Beijingby helping to: (a) convert
scattered coal-fired boilers to natural gas boilers; (b) promote energy conservation in
heating systems; (c) construct key wastewater trunk interceptors and associated treatment
facilities; and (d) strengthen environmental management institutions inBeijing.

3.       The original project comprises four parts:

         (a) Part A, Air pollution control, through (1) conversion or replacement o f
             medium-sizedcoal fired boilers to or with gas fired boilers, (2) technical
             capacity and market development, (3) heating energy conservation, and (4) air
             quality monitoring and management.
         (b) PartB,Wastewater management, to improve water quality inthe Liangshui
             and Qing River Basins through the construction o f secondary wastewater
             treatment facilities, and collectionnetworks.
         (c) PartC, Institutional strengthening inthe wastewater sector.
         (d) Part D,Resettlement, addressing the resettlement and rehabilitation of
             affected persons in connection with the carrying out o f Part B o f the project.

4.       The project i s financed by an IBRD loan o f $349 million and a GEF Grant o f $25
million. The GEF Grant finances goods and consultingservices under Parts A (2) and A
(3) o f the project.

5.       ImplementationStatus. Theproject is achievingits development objectives and
i s beingimplemented in a satisfactory manner, as discussed below. Disbursement as o f
end-July 2006, was about $109 million. Procurement has been carried out inaccordance

with BankProcurement Guidelines. A procurement post-review inJune 2006 confirmed
that procurement under the sampled contracts was carried out ina satisfactory manner.
The Environmental Management Plan(EMP) i s beingimplementedsatisfactorily. The
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) implementationhas been completed (see paragraph 11
below). Project accounts are being audited on a timely basis, and there are no
outstanding issues relatingto the audits. Audit reports from the project implementing
agencies are also beingreceived inthe Bank on a timely basis; these audit reports do not
indicate any significant issues.

6.       Part A, Air Pollution Control. The loan funded Boiler Conversion component -
Part A (1) - suffered long delays becauseo f the start-updifficulties experienced by the
new institutions established to manage the component. However, market forces (which
the project helped to initiate and strengthen) have provided financing for conversion o f
coal burningboilers to cleaner fuels, and about 70% o f the city's boilers have already
been converted to cleaner fuels. About 70 million squaremeters of floor areainthe
center city area i s still heatedby small and medium coal fired boilers. Their conversion
to cleaner fuels has beendelayed by constraints to natural gas supply; however most o f
them are expected to be converted to cleaner fuels before the start o f the Beijing
Olympics in2008, usingmarket based arrangements, rather than loan funds. As a result,
while the project objective of air pollution control throughboiler conversion will be fully
achieved, there is a substantial loan saving o f almost $150 million.

7.       The GEF Grantfunded components Parts A (2) andA (3)
                                              -                      - also suffered delays
similar to the boiler conversion component. However, Grant implementationhas gained
momentum inthe last two years, andprogress i s now satisfactory.

8.       Implementationo f the air quality management and monitoringcomponent Part
A (4) is nearingcompletion andhasproceeded satisfactorily.
       -                                                                             -

9.       Part B, WastewaterManagement. Implementation o f the wastewater
management component i s essentially complete. The Xiaohongmen Wastewater
Treatment Plant (WWTP), the last o f the three project WWTPs (and, at 600,000 cubic
meters per day, one o f the largestinthe country) was commissioned inlate 2005.
However, consistent with the experience o f other China urbanprojects, the appraised cost
estimates provedto behigher than the value o f contracts awarded, and there i s a loan
saving o f about $50 million.

10.      Part C, Institutional Strengtheningin the wastewater sector. The technical
assistancestudies financed by the loan are at an advanced stage o f completion and have
been effective. Beijing Municipal Government i s finalizing plans to bringwater supply
and wastewater activities under a Water Affairs Group, which would strengthen
coordination between the two closely linked utilities. Beijing Drainage Company, the
implementing agency for Part B, Wastewater Management, o f the project, i s a well run
utility, and is able to operate and maintainthe wastewater facilities ina satisfactory
manner.

11.     Part D,Resettlement and Rehabilitation under the wastewater component. All
resettlement activities have been completed satisfactorily, as confirmedby the external
monitoringreport and by task team reviews o f documents and through site visits.

12.     Reasonsfor Restructuring. As indicatedinparagraphs 6 and9, the original
project will have loan savings o f about $200million. The success o f the wastewater
management components o f the project, focusing on the Liangshui and the Qing River
basins, has highlightedthe remainingdeficiencies o f the Beijing river basins:
considerable unaddressedpollution and risk o f flooding. Inthe context o f the high
priority attached to improvingthe urbanenvironment inBeijing (especially because o f
the upcoming Olympics) Beijing Municipal Government (BMG) has proposed and
prepared additional components under Part B o f the project to extend wastewater
management and rehabilitate the river systems o f Liangshui, Qing, and connected urban
rivers, as well as related flood and ground water protection, andwater re-use. The
proposed investments will enhance achievement o f the objective o f improving water
quality inthe major river basins inBeijing by improving the water quality inthe sections
o frivers improvedby the additional components by at least one level.

ProposedChanges

13.     The proposed additional components include: (a) rehabilitation o f selected
sections o f the Liangshui River; (b) rehabilitation o f selected sections o f the Qing River;
(c) rehabilitation o f selected sections o f the Beihuan River system; (d) rehabilitationo f
selected sections o f the Ba River, the Beixiao River, the Xiaotaihou River, and the
Shuidui and the Honglingjin Lake areas in Chaoyang district; (e) rehabilitation o f
selected sections o f the Xinfeng River inDaxing district; (f) construction o f wastewater
re-use facilities inthe Beijing Economic Development Zone, and the distribution system
for re-use water; and (g) protectiono f groundwater through the reconstructiono f the
Datun Solid Waste Transfer Station.

14.     Other changes include: (a) extension o f the closing date from December 31,2006
to March 31,2009 (see paragraph 19) to enable the new components to be completed;
and (b) a higher disbursement percentage o f 75% for the civil works category for the
additional components, compared to 40% for the civil works category o f the original
components to reduce the pressures on counterpart funding (see paragraph 28).

15.     Implementationarrangements. Additional components (a) to (c) will be carried
out by the Beijing Water Affairs Bureau; additional component (d) will be carried out by
Chaoyang District Water Affairs Bureau; additional component (e) will be carried out by
Daxing District Water Affairs Bureau; additional component (f) will be carried out by the
Beijing Economic and Technological Investment Development Corporation (BETIDC), a
State owned enterprise; and additional component (g) will be carried out by the Beijing
SiqingEnvironmentaland Sanitation Group Company Limited (SiqingGroup), a state
owned limited liability company. These agencies will be able to implement the their
respective components with assistancefrom consultants, andguidance from the existing
BeijingProject Management Office, complemented by enhancedsupervisionby Beijing
basedmembers o f the Bank task team.

16.     RevisedProjectCosts andFinancingPlan. Annex 1shows the project cost and
financing plan o f the restructured project.

17.     FinancialManagement. The FinancialManagement Specialist (FMS)
conducted an assessment o f the adequacy o f the financial management system
surrounding the new agencies o f the restructured project, as per the guidelines issued by
the Financial Management Sector Board on November 3,2005. The FMS concluded that
the financial management system o f the restructuredproject, including the proposed
additional components, meets minimum Bank financial management requirements, as
stipulated inBP/OP 10.02. Inthe FMS' opinion, the restructured project, including the
proposed new components, has inplace an adequateproject financial management
system that can provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on
the status o f the project inthe reporting format agreedwith the project and as required by
the Bank.

18.     Procurement. Procurement arrangements for the additional components and the
procurement planfor these components havebeen reviewedby a Procurement Accredited
Staff and have been found acceptable. The original procurement plan has been updated,
incorporatingthe procurement plans for the additional components. The revised
procurement plani s available inthe project files.

19.     ImplementationSchedule and ClosingDate. Projectagencieshaveprepared
detailed implementation schedules for each o fthe additional components. These have
been appraised and found to be demanding; however, given the priority attached by
Government to the project, it should be possible to complete the project inabout two
years. Accordingly it i s proposed that the loan closing date be extended from the current
date of December 31,2006 to March 31,2009.

AppraisalSummary

20.     The feasibility studies, procurement plans, environmentaland social reports, etc.
preparedby the project agencies for the additional components were appraised usingthe
same procedures as for the original project. The restructured project would have a
positive impact overall, as a result o f the additional reduction inwater pollution.

21.     Environmentaland SocialAspects. Theoriginal project is Category A, andthe
restructured project will continue to be Category A. The project agencies prepared
separate environmental assessments and environmental management plans (EAs and
EMPs) for the additional components. These have been appraised and the final versions
are consistent with Bank requirements.

22.     Special efforts were made duringthe design o f the additional components to
minimize land acquisition and resettlement. Six sub-projects require land acquisition and
resettlement, and resettlement action plans (RAPS)were prepared by the project agencies
for each. These have been appraised and the final versions are consistent with Bank
requirements.

23.     All EAs/EMPs andRAPs havebeendisclosed as per Bank requirements.


                                               4

24.      Policy Exceptions. The restructured project will not require any policy
exceptions.

Expected Outcomes

25.     The development objectives o f the restructured project will remainunchanged
from those o f the original project. As discussed earlier, the additional components will
contribute to a further improvement o fthe urban environment inBeijing through a further
reduction o f water pollution inBeijing. Additional output indicators (length o f
interceptors installed, lengths o f river banks rehabilitated, amount o ftreated effluent re-
used, and utilization o f transfer station capacity) and outcome indicators (water quality
improvements inthe sections o f the rivers rehabilitated) have been established for the
new components. These indicators will be monitored on the same basis as the indicators
for the original project, Le., through halfyearly progress reports.

Risks

26.     The major risk for the restructured project i s the capacity o f the implementing
agencies o f the additional components to complete the substantial amount o f new work
within aperiodo f lessthan three years, especially as these agencies are new to working
with the Bank. A further risk is the availability of the significant amount o f counterpart
fundingrequiredfor the additional components.

27.     The risk o fweak capacity to implementlarge components o f a Bank project for
the first time will be mitigatedthrough: (a) intensivetraining programs on Bank
procedures; (b) involvement o f the Beijing Project Management Office (which has
successfully coordinated implementation o f the current project) inproviding on-going
guidance and coordination support to the new implementingagencies; (c) support fiom
project management consultants, who are being appointed inselected cases; and (d)
guidance from the Beijingbased members o f the task team on an as requiredbasis, and
through quarterly supervision missions. Inaddition, inview o fthe upcoming Olympic
Games, Beijing Municipal Government (BMG) leaders will take a strong interest in
ensuring timely completion o f the new components to highquality standards.

28.     The risk o f shortage o f counterpart funds i s mitigatedby the fact that BMG,
which i s relatively strong financially, has committedto allocate adequate funds for
environmentalimprovements to the city and inparticular, has committed to providing the
required counterpart funds for the project. Inaddition, inorder to reduce the burdeno f
counterpart funding for the additional components, the disbursement percentage for civil
works for the additional components has been set at 75% (compared to 40% for the
original components).
