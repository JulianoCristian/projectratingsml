The project consists of nine\n            components: 1) The first component will support the\n            conversion of medium-sized heating boilers from coal to\n            natural gas. 2) The Gas Boiler Market and Technology\n            Development component will support activities to develop\n            industry-wide technical capacity, remove market information\n            gaps, facilitate and aggregate market demands, reduce excess\n            costs incurred by early converters, and structurally reduce\n            the costs of gas boiler equipment and services. 3) The\n            Heating Energy Conservation component will support the\n            establishment of the technical and institutional basis to\n            encourage sustained market-based energy conservation in\n            various elements of the heating systems. 4) The Air Quality\n            Monitoring and Decision Support System Improvement component\n            will upgrade and renovate the existing monitoring stations.\n            5) The Liangshui River System Sewers will be constructed. 6)\n            The Liangshui River System Wastewater Treatment Plants will\n            be constructed. 7) The Qing River System Sewers will be\n            constructed. 8) The eighth component will support the\n            institutional strengthening of the Beijing Drainage Company\n            and its implementation support and training. 9) The Land\n            Acquisition and Resettlement component will finance the\n            compensation provided to the people and entities affected by\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2000-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
