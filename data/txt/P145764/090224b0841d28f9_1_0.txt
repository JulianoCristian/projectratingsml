interventions for malaria prevention and treatment by the target population." The project
targeted all of Zambia’s population; the country had 72 districts, all with endemic malaria.
The priority groups among this target population were children under the age of five years,
pregnant women and all those infected with malaria.

The specific objectives of the project (reflected in the three original PDO Indicators) were
to: (i) increase the percentage of children under 5 years of age who sleep under a treated
bed net from 30% to 40% by 2008; (ii) increase the percentage of pregnant women who
receive a complete course of intermittent presumptive treatment for malaria from 45% to
55% by 2008; (iii) increase the percentage of people in Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS)
eligible district areas who sleep in appropriately sprayed structures from 40% to 60% by
2008. These objectives were derived from the National Malaria Program objectives, to
which the project contributed.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
A Level 1 restructuring approved on August 31, 2009, revised and broadened the PDO: "to
increase coverage of interventions for malaria prevention and treatment and other key
maternal and child health interventions." The target values and end dates for the first two
PDO indicators were changed and a fourth PDO indicator was added. The revised
indicators were as follows: (i) To increase the percentage of children under 5 years of age
who sleep under a treated bed net from 41% to 55% by 2012 (baseline and target values
and date changed); (ii) To increase the percentage of pregnant women who receive a
complete course of intermittent presumptive treatment for malaria from 66% to 75% by
2012 (baseline and target values and date changed); (iii) To increase the percentage of
people in IRS-eligible districts who sleep in appropriately sprayed structures from 40% to
60% by 2008 (slight change in wording only); (iv) To increase the percentage of women
delivering in facilities by skilled birth attendant from 34% to 50% by 2012 (new indicator).

Additional Financing and restructuring approved on December 9, 2010 retained the PDO,
but changed indicator definitions to align with revised definitions in the Malaria Indicator
Surveys and more accurately reflect the revised project scope, updated baseline and target

January 31, 2013, and added a required new indicator for the number of direct project
beneficiaries (details are noted in the table below).

                          xvi
1. Context at Appraisal

1.      Country and Sector Context: 1 At appraisal in 2005, poverty among Zambia’s
population of approximately 12 million was high, persistent and worsening: around 69%
of the population was poor (much higher than the Sub-Saharan Africa average of around
53%) with considerably higher poverty in rural than urban areas. Zambia’s GDP per capita
of US$726(Purchasing Power Parity, constant 2005 dollars) was four-fifths of the regional
average of US$905. Few health indicators had improved in Zambia in the prior decade and
some had worsened. In 2006, life expectancy at birth was 49 years, 4 years below the
regional average.

2.       Malaria and the Government’s response: Malaria is endemic country-wide. It
peaks in the rainy season, but transmission continues all year. At appraisal, malaria caused
an estimated 50,000 deaths annually - the second highest cause of death overall, and up to
40% of under five deaths and perhaps 20% of maternal deaths.2Also a leading cause of
morbidity, malaria accounted for 50% and 47% of the disease burden of children under
five years and pregnant women respectively, and45% of all hospitalizations and outpatient
hospital visits in 2005. New reported cases of malaria had risen in the preceding decades
but started to fall from 2001 onward3after Zambia began scaling up prevention -- indoor
residual spraying (IRS), distribution of insecticide treated bed nets (ITN) and intermittent
presumptive treatment (IPT) of pregnant women. In response to national studies of
treatment efficacy that indicated high levels of drug resistance, in 2003 Zambia was among
the first countries to switch from chloroquine to artemisinin-based combination therapies
(ACT) to treat malaria, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

3.      The rationale for the World Bank’s involvement was to reduce the negative
impact of malaria on Zambia’s disease burden, on household productivity and well-being,
on health care costs and poverty, and on economic development. In 2005, malaria was
estimated to reduce GDP in Zambia by 1.5% each year.4Investments in malaria prevention
and treatment were calculated to be highly cost-effective, with each US$1 spent gaining
1.23 healthy life-years. The Government (GRZ) requested IDA funding to fill critical gaps
in financing the national malaria program, complementing grants from USAID, the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), other funders and domestic resources.
IDA is valued for funding flexibility and technical advice. Reducing malaria was an
important part of the National Health Strategic Plan2006-2011 goals, which was aligned
with the National Development Plan 2006-2011 whose main theme was “Working towards
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)”. Improved malaria outcomes is a
key goal for MDG 6, and an important contributor in Zambia for the MDG goals of

  Ministry of Health, Government of Zambia. One study at the University Teaching Hospital indicated that
malaria caused up to 20% of maternal deaths. Until 2012, no nationally representative causes of death
surveys were done, and deaths/cases occurring outside facilities remain poorly recorded outside the MIS.

reducing infant and child mortality and maternal mortality. The Malaria Booster Project
(MBP) objectives and focus were aligned to the Country Assistance Strategy 2004-2007
strategic pillar 2, which focused on improving lives and protection of the vulnerable. The
Bank was well positioned to convene a wide range of partners, integrate malaria control
into overall health system strengthening, and contribute expertise in health sector financing,
budgeting and planning, supply chain management, and human resource development. The
national malaria response was well-coordinated, with the Bank being one of several major
donors helping fund and support implementation of the National Malaria plan, so the
project’s contribution to these goals is the appropriate benchmark for the project, and this
report does not try to assess the results that might be attributed to the project independently.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators)

4.      The project development objective stated in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
was “to increase access to, and use of, interventions for malaria prevention and treatment
by the target population. The PAD clearly indicated that the target population was national,
and that the project supported the national malaria program. The Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) worded the PDO a little differently from the PAD to make these points
explicit: “The objective of the Project is to increase access to, and use of, interventions for
malaria prevention and treatment by the population of Zambia, within the context of the
Recipient’s National Malaria Control Program (the Program).”

5.       The key indicators referred to in the PAD as “specific objectives” derived from the
overall objectives of the National Malaria Program, to which the project contributed, were
to: (i) increase the percentage of children under 5 years of age who sleep under a treated
bed net from 30% to 40% by 2008; (ii) increase the percentage of pregnant women who
receive a complete course of intermittent presumptive treatment for malaria from 45% to
55% by 2008; (iii) increase the percentage of people in IRS-eligible districts areas who
sleep in appropriately sprayed structures from 40% to 60% by 2008.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification
 
6.       The 2009 Level I restructuring introduced the following changes to the original
project: (i) revised the PDO to broaden its scope, and changed “access to and use of” to
“coverage”, so that it read: “to increase coverage of interventions for malaria prevention
and treatment and other key maternal and child health interventions”; (ii) in line with the
broader PDO, added a key PDO indicator: “increase the percentage of women delivering
in facilities by skilled birth attendants from 34% to 50% by 2012”;(iii) reset the baselines
and revised the targets for two of the three original PDO indicators. In 2010, when the
Additional Financing was approved, the PDO was not changed, but a new core indicator
was added for the number of direct project beneficiaries, with a target set at 8 million by
2013 of whom 60% should be female, consistent with new Bank project monitoring
guidelines; the existing three PDO indicators were updated to change the year by which
the targets were to be achieved from 2012 to 2013, update baseline values, and change the
targets for two indicators (spraying and pregnant women delivering in facilities) in the light



                                               2
of new data. The indicator for spraying was changed from its original focus on people and
structures in IRS-eligible districts only, to households reported sprayed in the previous 12
months nationwide, to be consistent with the changes in the Malaria Indicator Survey
indicators (the primary data source) between 2008 and 2010.

7.      Rationale: By the end of 2008, most project targets had been reached, and
disbursement was well ahead of schedule. Despite Zambia’s functionally decentralized
health delivery system with elaborate processes for policymaking and donor coordination
as well as Cooperating Partners’ earlier support through a Sector-Wide Approach
(SWAp)5which had streamlined and strengthened health policy implementation, there was
little improvement in health outcomes not related to malaria. Coverage of effective
interventions to prevent maternal and child mortality such as immunization, family
planning, iron supplements during pregnancy, delivery by skilled birth attendants, and
postnatal visits remained limited, partly attributable to health worker absenteeism,
tardiness, poor morale and low productivity. Emerging experience with Results Based
Financing (RBF) in Zambia and other countries suggested that RBF could improve
coverage of core interventions through increased motivation and productivity of health
workers. The Government welcomed the opportunity of using grant funding through a
newly established Health Results Innovation Grant (funded by Norway and administered
by the Bank) to scale-up coverage of effective interventions to prevent maternal and child
mortality, and to continue support to the National Malaria Program. The rationale for the
Additional Financing approved in 2010 was to enable Zambia to address recent increases
in malaria cases in several provinces, sustain the achievements of the malaria program in
the rest of the country, and scale-up activities to contribute to the Government’s target of
80% population coverage of malaria prevention and treatment activities.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8.       The project aimed to benefit the whole population (“all 72 malarious districts of the
country”) because malaria is endemic throughout Zambia, by reducing malaria
transmission and improving treatment for people with malaria. The priority groups were
children under the age of five years and pregnant women who are especially vulnerable to
malaria, and all those infected with malaria. The National Malaria Control Center (NMCC)
would benefit from strengthened capacity to provide technical leadership and coordinate
implementation of the national program. The 2009 Level I restructuring included grant
financing for an RBF pilot through which health care providers in 180 RBF pilot facilities
in 11 districts would benefit through performance-based bonus payments, additional
training and supportive supervision. Their patients would benefit from improved quality
and quantity of services delivered by more motivated providers and better equipped health
facilities (facilities received a package of essential health equipment for Emergency
Obstetrics and Newborn Care (EmONC)). Providers in 224 facilities in ten districts in
“control group 1” that also received the EmONC package and an infusion of cash of the
same average amount as the performance bonuses paid to RBF district facilities, would
benefit from improved working conditions; their patients also would benefit to the extent

and child health outcomes.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

9.     The project had three components, derived from the national malaria strategic plan.
The PDO aimed for increased access to, and use of malaria interventions – Component 1
focused on increasing access, the second component focused on increasing use.

Component 1. Strengthening the health system to improve service delivery.
(Original allocation US$13.42 million, 67% of total; final allocation US$43.38 million,
88% of IDA total, plus HRITF grant of US$ 16.76 million and Russia TF of US$6.85
million, adding to 89% of total funding).There were two subcomponents:

(a)Strengthening the Health System to improve malaria service delivery in all 72 districts,
by providing funds through the district basket pooled funding, and supplies to all 72 district
health teams to improve and expand malaria service delivery, specifically:

  (i)   Additional financing through the District Basket mechanism for non-salary
        recurrent costs of district malaria action plans, linked to performance on malaria
        outcomes;
 (ii)   Supply and distribution of insecticide treated bed nets (ITN);
(iii)   Increase coverage of IRS in eligible areas, providing insecticides and other
        equipment, training, guidelines, and community outreach;
(iv)    Scale up laboratory diagnostic capacity by providing rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs),
        microscopes, training and protocols;
 (v)    Activities to scale up IPT of pregnant women;
(vi)    Strengthen MOH human resource capacity to scale up malaria activities by
        providing training, transport and communications equipment; and
(vii)   Support ITN and IRS activities by other government, private and non-profit actors.

(b) Improved environmental health management: Activities to improve management of
health care waste from malaria control and monitoring possible environmental impact of
insecticide use, through technician training, vehicles and equipment, renovating research
facilities, and environmental and vector susceptibility studies.

Component 2. Community Malaria Booster Response (US$3.0 million, 15% of
original funding, Final IDA allocationUS$1.8 million,3.7% of final IDA total, plus
US$1.57 million from Russia TF, adding to 4.7% of total funding). Small grants to local
NGOs, community-based organizations (CBOs) and communities were intended to boost
demand for and appropriate use of malaria prevention and treatment, complementing the
supply-side support to increase uptake, and the impact and reach of other malaria program
implementers

Component 3. Program Management (US$2.1 million, 10.5% of original funding,
final IDA allocation of US$4.0 million or 8.0% of total IDA total, plus US$0.71 from



                                              4
Russia TF, and US$3.5 from RBF TF, adding to US$US$8.234, 11.2% of total
funding) This component provided support to the National Malaria Control Center for
improved implementation, procurement and financial management, and monitoring and
evaluation of the national malaria program, and support for the RBF pilot Implementation
Team.

1.6 Revised Components

10.     The Board-approved restructuring in 2009 which included RBF and the AF in 2010
retained the same components, but added the following activities in component 1a in order
to achieve the broader PDO: (i) provide a free package of preventive and curative services
especially antenatal, delivery and postpartum care for pregnant women, services for
children under 5 years, and family planning services through results-based payments and
provision of reproductive health commodities, equipment and training; (ii) activities to
improve MOH staff capacity to supervise and provide the RBF package; (iii) external
validation of results reported by facilities. Component 3 was revised to provide for the
appointment of an independent fiduciary review agent to strengthen fiduciary oversight, in
response to broad corruption reported in MOH in 2009.6

1.7 Other significant changes

11.     Co-financing added: The early strong results achieved attracted attention and
additional funding: a grant of US$6.85 million from the Russian Federation Trust Fund
(Russia TF-91376) which became effective in 2008 (as a matching dollar-for-dollar grant
with IDA); a US$3 million grant in 2008from DfID (as a Bank-executed TF) to implement
and evaluate public and private sector strategies for improving access to ACTs and other
essential medicines as parallel funding. In 2009Zambia successfully competed for a grant
from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) 7of US$16.76 million (which only
became operational in early 2011 with the country grant agreement backdated to be
effective as of December 31, 2010). In December 2010, IDA provided US$30 million of
Additional Financing (Credit No. 48510) to extend the project duration by two additional
years to sustain its results and address a resurgence of malaria in parts of the country. Table
1 shows the allocation of the IDA credit and AF and TFs.

 See Annex 10 for details; also discussed later in the ICR.

 The HRITF is a multi-donor TF, financed mostly by Norway and the UK that promotes a results-based
approach to health sector strengthening.

12.      Funding reallocations: Minor reallocations of the original IDA credit, the Russian
TF, the AF credit, and the HRITF Grant were made on three occasions (July 2010, January
2013, July 2014) to move funds across components and expenditure categories from areas
where spending was lower than originally expected, to categories where more funds than
originally anticipated were needed to carry out the planned activities. (See Annex 1 for
initial and final allocation of funds by components). The main change was to increase
allocations for supplies for malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment, especially
insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs).

13.     Procurement Methods: In 2007, the Credit Agreement was amended to add two
procurement methods, National and International Shopping, and Procurement from United
National Agencies (IAPSO), which were not envisaged to be required at the time of
appraisal and negotiations. The Bank and Government agreed they made sense for timely,
efficient and cost-effective procurement, for example, of small locally available items
required by districts or CBOs (in the case of shopping), and bed-nets, ACT drugs and
diagnostic supplies in the case of IAPSO.

14.     Closing date extensions: As part of the 2009 level one restructuring, the project
Closing Date was extended by 2 years to January 2012to allow time to use the additional
resources to enable the broadened goals to be achieved and the gains in malaria outcomes
to be sustained. In late 2010, the Closing Date was extended by another year to January
2013 after resolution of disruptions caused by a broader corruption issue in the health sector.
The disruption had resulted in a 15 month delay in signing the HRITF country grant
agreement - in December 2010, at the same time as the US$30 million AF Financing
Agreement, instead of in 2009 as originally planned. In August 2012, a third extension was
granted for five months to June 2013 to enable delayed large procurements and associated
activities to be completed. In June 2013, the successful ongoing RBF activities financed
by the HRITF were administratively delinked from the MBP project code (P096131) to
allow the MBP IDA and Russian TF co-financed portion of the project (approved in 2005)
to close as those resources were nearly 100% disbursed. A new project code was created
(P145764) and a Closing Date of July 2014 was set for the RBF activities. In July 2014, a

final extension of the Closing Date for the RBF code was granted to October 31, 2014 to
allow RBF activities to be fully completed.

15.     Changes in Implementation Arrangements:

(i) In 2008, a minor change in the project implementation arrangements was made,
    transferring responsibility for the community grants (COMBOR) from the AIDS
    Response Program which was closing, to the National Malaria Control Program and
    integrating the grants with the other community based activities of the National
    Malaria Program.

(ii) Following the broad sectoral corruption allegations in 2009 and subsequent
     investigations, new fiduciary controls were put in place as part of governance and
     financial management action plans. An independent Fiduciary Review Agent (IFRA)
     was contracted to review all financial management and procurement transactions; IDA
     funds, though minimal from the outset, were no longer disbursed through the pooled
     funding mechanism for districts.

(iii) New implementation arrangements and procedures were established for the RBF
      activities funded through the HRITF grant. Participating health facilities were eligible
      for payment by the project using an agreed schedule of payments against verified
      volumes of selected services delivered free to patients. Facility payment amounts were
      adjusted depending on facility quality scores. The facility staff could decide how to
      spend RBF payments, except that at least 40% had to be reinvested in the facility and
      no more than 60% paid to staff as performance incentive bonuses. Monitoring and
      evaluation arrangements were enhanced to enable a carefully designed impact
      evaluation of the RBF pilot. The payment schedules, quality adjustment calculation,
      and maximum share that could be paid to staff were adjusted after the first year of the
      RBF pilot.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.     Strong WB team and donor partner technical input: The original project was
prepared in about 10 months.9. Project design benefitted from a strong Bank team led by a
highly respected expert and experienced senior health staff, strong technical contributions
from WHO and others, and a technical quality enhancement review (QER) in July 2005,
shortly before appraisal.

17.     Government policies and planned activities were guided by a strong National
Malaria Plan that embodied best practice. Implementation of the National Malaria
Strategic Plan 2000-2005, with funding and support through a strong national Roll Back

technically competent leadership by the NMCC had already begun to reduce malaria
incidence and mortality before the project began. The follow-on “Strategic Plan for Rapid
Scale up of Malaria Control Interventions, A Road Map for Impact on Malaria in Zambia
2006-2010” was a “bold, evidence-based approach for bringing the enormous health and
economic burden of malaria in Zambia under control” (Minister of Health, Foreword to the
Strategic Plan).

18.     The original project design was straightforward and coherent, with just three
mutually reinforcing components. The programmatic approach ensured full alignment of
project goals with national goals. The project design was clearly focused on helping to
implement the national malaria plan, which had been developed in a highly participatory
way. The activities align with the objectives, with a clearly identified and strongly linked
results-chain.

19.    The PAD describes in detail the partnership and participatory engagement
across government agencies, donors, NGOs and the private sector. Strong government
commitment and stakeholder engagement are evident in the PAD and list of references,
ISRs and Aide Memoires, role of the RBM partnership, co-financing from DfID and
coordinated complementary financing through the SWAp framework (notably from the
GFATM and USAID), and annual joint malaria program reviews.

20.     Project design was well guided by lessons from the Zambia Health Sector Support
Project (IDA-26600) and projects in other countries, and grounded in the work of the
Zambia RBM partnership. The design reflected international evidence-based good practice,
carefully applied to Zambia’s situation. Key lessons noted in the PAD included the need to
strengthen MOH capacity and institutions for procurement, financial management and
M&E, the coordinating value of working within the SWAP framework and supporting the
national Malaria strategic plan, that even modest costs of bed nets deterred use, and noted
the need for better diagnosis, availability of inputs and more operational research, and to
alleviate human resource constraints; actions on all of these areas are strongly reflected in
the project design and implementation.

21.     The assessment of risks was vindicated by events, and mitigation measures
were thoughtfully designed. Eight critical risks were identified, most relating to MOH
capacity, with well-identified, relevant mitigation measures that served the project well.
The risk of corruption was rated as high; mitigation measures relied strongly on new
legislation, ongoing prosecutions and strong high level political assurances of ‘zero
tolerance” for corruption, combined with a decision to ensure clearly documented and
enforced project guidelines and procedures. The lingering impact on staffing levels,
capacity, and risk-aversion that slowed decisions and processes that resulted from the
corruption investigation in MOH after 2009 was not anticipated, it would be hard to fault
the team for not considering this possibility. Risks to the project of human capacity and
staffing bottlenecks had been considered and mitigating measures had been agreed and
were carried out.

2.2 Implementation

22.     Although the initial credit was almost fully disbursed within just over two years, a
PDO change in 2009 and additional funding from the Russian Trust Fund and HRITF, the
integration of a new design component (RBF) and the AF in 2010 contributed to a full
implementation history of nine years from the November 2005 approval to the closure of
the RBF portion of the project in October 2014.

Factors that contributed positively to implementation

23.    Clearly defined activities for malaria prevention: As noted above, the project was
simple in design and scaled up the key proven malaria prevention activities (distributing
ITNs, spraying against mosquitoes, IPT for pregnant women). The Government was
following the “catch-up/keep-up” approach endorsed by the RBM/WHO for very high
malaria burden countries, so the focus was strongly on prevention in the early project years.
With adequate and timely input supplies –especially in the initial project years– the planned
substantial scale-up was achieved. The early evidence of impact from the 2006 and 2008
surveys attracted considerable favorable attention, which fed morale and commitment.

24.     The emergence of a new technology - Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets
(LLITNs) during project implementation. Around 2007, long-lasting insecticide-treated
nets (LLINs) that maintain effective levels of insecticide for at least 3 years (even after
repeated washing) became available for mass distribution. Previously, nets had to be
retreated every 6 to 12 months (more frequently if the nets were washed), by dipping them
in a mixture of water and insecticide and drying them in a shady place. The cost of the
insecticide and lack of understanding of its importance resulted in very low retreatment
rates in most African countries and was a major barrier to widespread and effective use of
ITNs. The switch to LLITNs as the most prominent malaria preventive measure for large-
scale deployment in Zambia (and other highly endemic areas) was a very positive
development.

25.      Competent Technical leadership of NMCC: The quality of the National Malaria
Strategic Plan and its implementation as well as various peer-reviewed scholarly articles
attest to the technical competence of the NMCC. Although the NMCC had no experience
of Bank procedures when the project began, they were “keen to learn and enthusiastic”
(ISR#1) and, with good support from the WB, and decisive action by the Government to
hire additional staff when management and procurement gaps became evident in the first
year, NMCC gained the needed competence to achieve strong initial project performance.
Successive ISRs comment on the improving capacity; soon after the May 2008 Mid-Term
Review (MTR) two years into implementation, the Zambia Country Director noted that the
project had made “important strides…against malaria in Zambia,” and “commended
Government for the leadership shown in implementing the program.”

26.    Well-coordinated, joint engagement by all malaria partners. Project identification
and annual reviews were done jointly by all major partners working together, led and
coordinated by NMCC. Funding through the Bank project was complemented by funding



                                             9
from the Global Fund (GFATM) and other sources. Other partners were heavily supporting
case management/treatment activities, so the Bank financing was focused on prevention
and complementary health system strengthening efforts. Another example of the funding
complementarity was that Bank funding paid for operational costs that PMI was not able
to cover but that were essential for making effective use of the inputs funded by PMI.
Targets took account of the inputs provided or funded by all partners.

27.     Program and project procedures and guidelines were available when
implementation began: Completion of a project implementation manual was a Condition
of Effectiveness, and helped ensured early clarity on and readiness to undertake funded
activities.

28.     Being focused, and also flexible in responding to MTR findings: The project was
strategic and selective during implementation, resisting the temptation to try and do
everything at once, but then assessing progress and moving decisively to adjust the priority
focus. The May 2008 MTR noted the strong success in prevention, and suggested that the
program differentiate prevention efforts by need, with particular attention to malaria “hot
spots”; enhance monitoring of resistance; and give much more attention to improving
diagnosis and case management, sound advice which was then followed.

29.     Substantial sustained increases in funding (apart from 2009/2010) from various
sources and good coordination and collaboration among donor partners. Table 2 shows
the sustained increase in funding for malaria in all years of project implementation except
2009.The donors all participated in joint reviews and annual malaria planning, contributing
to government’s national malaria strategic plan. The close coordination and collaboration
and WB flexibility helped smooth variability – for example, in 2007, when a GFATM grant
was delayed, the Bank team agreed to “front-load” project disbursements and pay for time-
sensitive supplies for prevention. In 2008, when the MTR found that drug stock-outs
contributed to poor case management, DfID provided an additional grant of US$3 million
to increase ACT supply and try out new strategies for combined efforts by the private and
public sectors to increase access to ACTs.

30.    Strong Government commitment also reflected in Ministry of Finance decisions,
notably the substantial US$24 million government contribution to the malaria program in
2013(see Table 2), and willingness to borrow an additional US$30 million from the Bank
in 2010 to respond to the malaria resurgence in high-endemic parts of the country.

31.     Continuity, appropriate skill mix and responsiveness of the Bank team: There
was good continuity in Bank leadership, with only one change of team lead during
implementation, with an overlap that enabled good handover. Implementation support
missions visited regularly about every six months, and included technical health experts
and procurement and financial management specialists who were also available in-country
during most of the project life to provide guidance and support between missions. The
project files show how assiduously the team worked to provide training in Bank procedures,
resolve bottlenecks, and seek additional grant funding for Zambia. The managers’
comments on ISR#3 note that “the team’s relations with MOH remain excellent”; and “the
team is to be congratulated” (ISR#9) for “staying the course…through an unusually
difficult period over the past 12-18 months”, being able to “walk a fine line between caution
and increased financial controls versus ensuring that the work continues in a proper and
efficient manner” (ISR#7), and intensive follow-up to ensure that misappropriated funds
were repaid and measures defined and taken to prevent recurrence (ISR#9).

32.    Good expertise, emerging knowledge, and pre-piloting, all informed the design
of the RBF pilot, monitoring was strong, and adjustments were made during
implementation. The RBF pilot and design was inspired by growing interest in and
optimism about the potential of RBF in the global health community, and emerging
evidence of its successful impact in Rwanda. The Bank team of experts who led the RBF


                                                    11
pilot design in Zambia had good knowledge of emerging experience from Rwanda and
other countries adopting RBF approaches. A pre-pilot (2008-2010) in Katete district to test
the proposed design before roll-out in 10 pilot districts showed judicious caution in
introducing new practices. The pilot design was changed and refined in response to the pre-
pilot experience. 10 Extensive internal monitoring and rigorous independent external
evaluation was part of the design, the pilot was monitored carefully and payment details
adjusted along the way, although the Bank team was careful not to make changes that
would undermine the evaluation design and power.

Factors that contributed negatively to implementation

33.      Some skepticism about RBF and decreased MOH engagement in the RBF pilot
after 2009. The RBF pilot was developed soon after the discontinuation of Zambia’s own
controversial performance-based contracting (PBC) approach, which ran from 1996 to
2006. During this period, Zambia used cascading contracts from the MOH to the Central
Board of Health (CBoH) and, in turn, contracts with provinces, hospital boards, districts,
and fixed-term employment contracts with individual staff, in which the risk of contract
non-renewal was a powerful incentive to meet contract performance targets.11 By contrast,
the RBF approach used monetary rewards at individual and facility level to incentivize
improved performance. Although the RBF and PBC approaches differed, both aimed to
improve health system performance. One person interviewed for the ICR said that some
MOH staff saw the design team as having unwarranted enthusiasm for and confidence in
the RBF approach and not sufficiently open to differing views, including skepticism about
RBF, which some saw as “paying staff extra to do the jobs they are hired to do”. On the
other hand, the RBF pilot design was developed jointly with the Government and other
partners in a participatory and exploratory way. Many consultative meetings were held to
discuss what approach to take; leading to decisions to: (i) pre-pilot the RBF in Katete before
expansion to 10 additional districts so as to contextualize the RBF to the Zambian
situation;(ii) use part of the RBF funds to buy EmONC equipment for 20 districts (RBF
and Control 1); and (iii) implement the RBF using the former CBoH structures through the
public system to enhance institutional sustainability. However the transfer of most of the
key MOH staff involved in the initial RBF design (the Minister, Permanent Secretary,
Directors, Chief and Principle Planners, mostly in response to the 2009 corruption scandal
described below),undermined engagement and ownership by the MOH and lost
institutional memory. In addition, disagreement between the MOH and Bank about the
selection of the leader for the RBF Implementation Support Team, posed challenges.

34.     The 2009 corruption scandal, investigation, reactions and aftermath disrupted
project implementation. In May 2009, the Zambia Anti-Corruption Commission reported



10
   “Using Evidence to Scale Up Innovation: Insights from a Results-Based Financing (RBF) Project for
Health in Zambia”, May 2013, SmartLessons, World Bank, describes seven changes to the pilot design as a
result of the pre-pilot learning.
11
   After the repeal of this politically contentious approach, the 2007 Demographic Health Survey (DHS)
results found unexpectedly strong improvements in the health sector to which the PBC may have
contributed.


                                                  12
fraud in the MOH that triggered extensive investigations, forensic audits for 2008 and 2009,
stringent new fiduciary procedures, criminal charges and suspension of 47 staff including
all but one of the MOH officials overseeing the RBF pilot, many of whom were not
reinstated. This had immediate and enduring effects on MOH that also affected the Bank
project. As noted above, suspension of funding by some donors greatly disrupted MOH
activities, especially affecting “basket funding” for districts. Maternal and child health
intervention campaigns had to be cancelled. Staff suspensions, distraction, and changes in
procurement and fiduciary procedures greatly slowed processes and payments, disrupting
time-sensitive supplies of bed nets and insecticide, and other procurement, including of the
essential equipment for RBF facilities. The RBF-related processing was disrupted which
delayed effectiveness of the grant and harmed implementation momentum, although the
RBF implementation team itself (hired using project funds allocated to support the pilot)
was able to continue work and ensure that the pilot was implemented as planned.

35.      Approval of the AF in 2010 was contingent on the GRZ repayingUS$1.3 million
of inadequately documented project disbursements and ineligible expenditures. The Bank
used the investigation into the MOH corruption allegations as an opportunity to strengthen
Zambia’s Office of the Auditor General, which was later able to provide documentation to
justify reimbursing the Government of Zambia US$0.9 million of the2010 repayment. The
aftermath of the corruption and response included nervous risk-aversion across the MOH
that further slowed decision-making and intensified the impact of the loss of
knowledgeable and experienced staff, an impact that continued to be felt throughout the
rest of the project.

36.     Inadequate Human Resources. Initial capacity and personnel gaps for effective
and efficient project implementation noted in early ISRs were quickly resolved by hiring
and training. The MOH-wide terminations and suspensions during the corruption
investigation abruptly reduced capacity again in 2009, and the loss of experienced MOH
staff who knew the project and Bank procedures had a lasting effect on implementation.
The NMCC, many malaria activities, and the RBF pilot (with its dedicated Implementation
Support Team) were affected less than some other MOH areas. However, the person
handling malaria procurement moved to head all MOH Procurement, and his replacement
did not last long in the job, exacerbating malaria input procurement delays that persisted
through 2013.

37.     The Malaria Community grants (COMBOR) were affected by the initial reliance
on the AIDS teams to administer the grants, delays in getting alternative arrangements
in place after the AIDS project ended, inadequate supervisory attention by the Bank, and
loss of clarity of purpose. It was a sensible decision to ask the Zambia AIDS team to
oversee the malaria small grants component – AIDS grants were the model for COMBOR,
the AIDS team had extensive experience and well-functioning systems and processes for
these kinds of grants and a good track record. However, the AIDS project team may not
have had enough motivation, “ownership” or appreciation of the purpose of the malaria
grants to give them the attention they needed, on top of their own large program of AIDS




                                            13
grants.12 There was a surge in the number of grants after responsibility for COMBOR was
transferred to the NMCC, but implementation lagged for most of the project and comments
about the need for improvement and closer attention recur in many ISRs. The component
was well-justified by the clear need to mobilize communities to reduce mosquito breeding
grounds, sleep under ITN, and seek care promptly in response to symptoms typical of
malaria. However, hundreds of small grants country-wide to groups with little formal
capacity or experience pose a formidable implementation challenge. There was no
systematic independent review of the grants or effort to assess their impact, and slow
resolution of the persistent obstacles to implementation (lack of transport to visit sub-grant
sites, inability of grantees to pay bank fees and the minimum account balance, and delays
in grant processing and funds transfers).

38.      A ministerial reorganization moved some MOH functions to a new Ministry of
Community Development, Mother and Child Health (MCDMCH).Planning and
discussion of a possible MOH reorganization started in 2011. The changes were made in
2012, but the disruption lingered for the rest of the project. Reorganizations are often
(perhaps always)disruptive, and the project team noticed a negative impact on morale in
the MOH, and delays as new decision-making, reporting and coordination arrangements
took time to be set up. The MCDMCH was brought in as a partner with MOH for the RBF
pilot because of its responsibility for district-level facilities and teams. However, the
MCDMCH did not receive adequate funding to carry out all of its district-level activities
and oversight, and the recent GRZ decision (in late 2015) to reverse the reorganization
attests to its disappointing impact.

Other factors that affected implementation with mixed impact

39.      The HRITF grant required that the RBF activities it funded be linked to an
existing project. At the time the HRITF grant was awarded, the Malaria Booster Project’s
performance was exceeding expectations (an unusual context for restructuring). The RBF
pilot was a justified extension of the original MBP design: it built on improved malaria
outcomes, and broadened the project focus to other priority maternal and child health
outcomes and service quality improvements, after the MBP had been so effective that
malaria no longer dominated Zambia’s burden of disease and preventable causes of deaths.
But if instead, the MBP had closed early, it likely would have been rated highly satisfactory
– it had disbursed almost completely in only two years instead of four, and achieved or
exceeded most of its targets within only 3 years, a full year before the planned closing date.
The decision to restructure and extend the MBP diluted its laser-like focus on malaria,
added complexity, and, most important, extended implementation into the difficult and
disruptive years of the MOH corruption investigation and its aftermath, and into a time of
resurgence of malaria in parts of the country, reversing some of the dramatic gains between
2006 and 2008. On the other hand, the decision to expand and extend the project enabled
the Bank to ensure that anti-malaria activities still had some funding when many other
donors cut off funds in 2009/2010, causing a sudden and dramatic funding shortfall for

  The ICR for the ZANARA Project notes that the CRAIDS team very successfully managed a $20 million
program of 1264 grants to NGOs, CBOs and communities for community-based AIDS response.


                                                14
malaria and other MOH programs, especially at district level. The corruption affected
relatively small amounts of Bank financing, and the Bank’s decision not to suspend the
malaria project provided vital funding for malaria and other activities within the expanded
project scope. This prevented a far worse malaria resurgence than occurred.

40.     Rainfall. Malaria incidence is partly determined by climate which affects mosquito
breeding conditions. It is not easy to analyze or summarize this factor across the country
given the substantial variability in rainfall and climate. A superficial assessment is that the
relatively shorter rains in 2007/08 contributed to the dramatic fall in incidence seen in the
2008 Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS), and the long and productive rainy season in 2010
contributed to the resurgence in 2010. However, it is not possible to quantify the impact
of the complex relationship among malaria, rainfall and temperature (see Annex 11 for
more details).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

41.     M&E Design was reasonably good. The Results Framework in the PAD (and in
the Restructuring and AF documents) follows a clear results-chain logic. It includes the
inputs needed for malaria prevention and treatment (nets, diagnostic kits, drugs, grants to
engage and inform communities);output indicators (distribution of nets, availability of
drugs, number of houses sprayed, people trained, etc.);and outcome indicators(children and
pregnant women actually sleeping under the nets, better knowledge, appropriate and timely
treatment received, etc.). There is a clear statement that the desired impact is reduced
mortality and morbidity from malaria, but that the PDO is defined at an outcome level more
closely linked to successful project implementation. A good balance is struck between
monitoring all of the most important items, and keeping the number of indicators
manageable. The Intermediate Outcome Indicators are complete and generally well-chosen.
Most indicators are “SMART13,” with baseline data for most in the PAD, and data sources,
responsibility and frequency of collection clearly noted. The project included support for a
“gold standard” Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) every two years, to supplement the DHS
and routine MOH HMIS data. The PAD includes, as one explicit indicator of project
success, having “an effective M&E system in place”.

42.     Some M&E design decisions can be questioned. (i) There is a Project Outcome
Indicator (POI) for each of the three core prevention activities, but no POI for treatment
access – which is included in the PDO. Perhaps the intention was to give a strong signal
that prevention was the highest priority for the Bank project (other donors were funding
treatment), but it could be seen as an unwise omission. (ii) The POI targets were set for
2008 – a full year before the original project end date, probably because the MIS was
scheduled for that year. It would have been better if the project end and final targets
coincided with an MIS. This is mitigated by the yearly targets for all POIs and intermediate

  SMART is a mnemonic acronym, giving criteria to guide in the setting of objectives, for example in
project management. The letters S and M usually mean specific and measurable with the other letter having
different meanings depending on the field of study. For public health the following is usually the case: A is
for achievable, R is for relevant, and T is for time-bound.

indicators in the table of Arrangements for Results Monitoring in Annex 3 in the PAD --
including for 2009, which was expected to be the fourth and final year of the project, except
that data for 2009 would have to come from the HMIS rather than a more reliable MIS or
DHS. (iii) Some targets could have been more ambitious, others were unrealistic
aspirational targets from the National Plan. For example, the POI for children sleeping
under bed nets was achieved within the first year of the project; and the POI on IRS was
exceeded 18 months into the project. On the other hand, achieving 80% of patients with
malaria receiving treatment according to protocol within 24 hours of fever onset, remains
far out of reach given many supply and demand-side barriers to access. (iv) It would have
been better to ensure that the precise wording of all indicators was consistent with the
definitions used in the data sources, to avoid the need to make minor changes during project
implementation. The numerous changes in the results framework complicate judgments
about the achievement of the project indicators. (v) The indicators for the program
management component were vaguely defined without clear plans for measuring them. (vi)
The wording of the revised PDO implied unwarranted confidence that the RBF pilot would
succeed in expanding coverage for the maternal and child health interventions it
incentivized; it might have been better for the objective to be to learn whether PBF could
be effective in expanding coverage and improving the quality of incentivized and other key
maternal and child health interventions.

43.      The RBF pilot M&E was carefully designed by an expert team, and extensive
M&E was a core and integral part of the pilot. Data on baseline and potential service
increases were assessed as the basis for setting performance payment levels. Sound
monitoring is a crucial part of RBF – the services being rewarded must be reliably reported
and verified. In addition to the routine monthly and quarterly data reporting and monitoring
that is necessary for RBF, there was also a technical review carried out by independent
consultants during implementation, a process evaluation, and an Impact Evaluation
comparing pilot facilities with two control groups (an “as usual” group, and a group that
received similar amounts of additional resources not tied to results). The incentivized
services were measured using data from patient registers and were designed to be aligned
with HMIS reporting. However, changes made to the HMIS in some definitions and then
the switch to a new system14 disrupted the alignment. Although HMIS staff were fully
involved in the RBF design and initial implementation as important stakeholders, there was
high turnover of HMIS staff in 2009/2010. This created difficulties for the pilot’s smooth
implementation and was a missed opportunity for strengthening the HMIS. The Technical
Review in 2013 found that RBF reporting for calculating payments required considerable
additional work. By the end of the pilot, three of the nine RBF indicators had no “matching”
item in the HMIS, and the definitions of three others were not quite the same as the
corresponding HMIS data item. This caused confusion and discrepancies and undermined
rather than helped to strengthen the HMIS system – the Review team found that some
facilities reported the RBF measure to HMIS instead of following the HMIS definition.



14
  Zambia switched to the District Health Information Software (DHIS) open source software platform used
in more than 40 countries, developed by the Health Information Systems Programme (HISP), coordinated
by the University of Oslo.


                                                  16
44.    About one third of the quality score came from “structural” items (e.g. delivery bed
and equipment) that are necessary for quality care, but do not reflect staff effort or
performance, and tend not to vary, reducing the power of the quality incentive.

45.     M&E Implementation: All planned M&E activities for malaria were completed
on schedule and to a high quality. The NMCC published a comprehensive and coherent
M&E plan for 2006-2011, easily found on its well-organized website, along with data from
the “gold standard” Malaria Indicator Surveys(MIS) done in 2006, 2008, 2010and 2012
with project funding. Monthly malaria data from 10 sentinel districts across the country are
collected for the MIS, which began to be upgraded to provide real-time data through a rapid
reporting system piloted in 9 facilities in early 2011. The project M&E also relied on the
2007 DHS and 2013 DHS data (not funded by the project). The project helped fund a
National Malaria Health Facility Survey in 2011, to assess the quality of outpatient malaria
case management at various levels of health facilities.

46.     Incomplete reporting on indicators in many ISRs. In the early years of the project,
ISRs were required to report on only one indicator per component, rather than the entire
Results Framework, as is now the practice. The choice of the indicator in ISRs for each of
the smaller two components was poor, and reporting was incomplete. For the community
malaria response, an uninformative output indicator was selected: “percent of malaria-
prone districts with at least one CBO/NGO receiving a grant for community-based malaria
control activities.” No data were entered in ISRs until June 2012 (despite being reported
on in detail by MOH/NMCC during supervision visits), and then the total number of grants
was stated, not the percentage of districts with at least one grant. The program management
indicators were vague, not readily measureable, and generally not reported on at all (these
were intermediate outcome indicators).

47.     The project also developed plans for improving the quality of routine district level
reporting, and better integrating various monitoring and data collection systems. Some, but
not all planned improvements in the HMIS were achieved. HMIS data is collected at the
health facility level on paper forms, and aggregated and computerized at district level,
feeding into the national electronic data base. The HMIS was comprehensively revised in
2008, and converted from DHIS 1.0 to the web-based DHIS 2.0 in 2013. However,
transmitting and entering the data in the districts remains slow, services delivered in the
community are not captured, and nor are data from level 2 and 3 hospitals included yet.

48.    The RBF pre-pilot and pilot included careful and detailed process evaluation and
technical evaluations, carried out as planned. During the pilot, relevant performance data
were extracted regularly directly from provider and facility records and registers (also the
source for data reported through the HMIS). Data on the quality of facilities and services
were collected as planned through quarterly assessments by the supervising district hospital
team, using a detailed project quality checklist of numerous items under ten topic areas.

49.     M&E data use: The NMCC made extensive and careful use of data from various
sources that contribute to malaria monitoring – Surveys (MIS, DHS), studies (drug efficacy
and resistance, vector susceptibility, GIS studies of special patterns) and routine data (from



                                             17
the HMIS, daily spraying reports, net distribution records, etc.). A number of analytical
papers assessing malaria trends and the impact of malaria program activities, authored by
staff of the NMCC and MOH, were published in scholarly journals during the
project15showing the careful analysis and use of data to inform program activities and
strategies. The 2010 MIS gave particular attention to the regional differences in changes in
levels of malaria transmission and parasite prevalence since the previous survey. In
response to these data, the Zambia Malaria Prevalence Report 2010 recommended
stratifying the country into three malaria epidemiological zones. While IRS had always
focused on selected districts (15 districts from 2005 to 2008, expanding to 36 districts in
2008-09), NMCC decided in 2010 to differentiate project (and national program) activity
levels across the three zones, and to target malaria “hot spots” especially. The malaria
interventions proposed in the National Malaria Strategic Plan 2011–2015 are largely based
on the data from the 2010 MIS.

50.     There are other examples of important use of data to drive policy and program
decisions and project activities: IRS had been thought to be useful only in urban areas, and
was initially focused in cities, but when new data showed that IRS was also useful for mud
houses, spraying was expanded into rural areas as well. At the 2008 MTR, the decision was
taken to shift the focus of the project to improving diagnosis and access to appropriate
treatment for confirmed malaria cases, requiring a significant change in MOH treatment
guidelines, noting that it was “no longer appropriate to consider all fever cases to be malaria”
(ISR#5).In response to 2010 MIS data showing greater differences in parasitemia rates than
in intervention patterns, and funding shortfalls in 2009 and 2010, the MIS team
recommended further refinement and differentiation of interventions across districts.

51.    The project also supported district malaria control activities through the multi-
donor basket funding for districts. Health managers at the districts and health facilities used
HMIS malaria indicator data to develop their annual District Action Plans. However, the
value of planning – and hence of data use– are likely to be undermined by the frequent
uncertainty, delays and shortfalls in funding reaching districts that have been a major
constraint on districts being able to implement their plans.

52.      By definition and inherent design, RBF monitoring data were used to determine
the payment amounts to the participating health facilities. The quarterly monitoring of
facility quality by the district hospital using the quality checklist had the desired result of
achieving improvements. The 2014 technical review by the ETC Consulting Group notes
that “the combination of assessment, supervision and coaching on the job (e.g. introduction

and use of a partograph during delivery) appeared to have a strong positive influence on
staff motivation. In all intervention districts the graphs displaying the quality scores show
clear positive trends”.16The Review found that the quality checklist was used to suggest
improvement which were followed up the next quarter.

53.     The technical review facility visits found a few examples where facilities that did
not have the qualified staff required to participate in the pilot yet remained enrolled. The
review also noted that monthly visits to facilities by district teams focused mostly on data
relating to the incentivized RBF services, rather than also on enhancing the broader
performance and quality of services delivered by the facility. These criticisms do not
detract from the achievements of the RBF intervention, but perhaps point to missed
opportunities for greater impact.

Quality and reliability of data

54.    The quality and reliability of the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) and
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) - main data sources for measuring project
indicators - are high. MIS data are collected through standardized survey tools and
protocols developed by teams of global and national experts. Survey reports show efficient,
on-time data collection every two years from 2006 through 2010, supported by strong
technical teams from the RBM partners. These, like the DHS, are considered highly reliable,
and the MIS reports comment carefully on data quality.

55.     The quality and reliability of the HMIS and RBF data are not as good. Periodic
assessments of Zambia’s HMIS (most recently in 2012) rate it highly by regional
standards,17 but identify numerous weaknesses: poor data management, inconsistent and
inadequate feedback on data quality down the chain of data reporting, high turnover of
HMIS staff, limited technical capacity in data analysis, and inadequate coordination and
harmonization of various data sources run by donors. A major problem in using the HMIS
for this project evaluation was the change in the system which disrupted data collection
from April 2012 to December 2012, and seriously hampered comparisons in service trends
between RBF intervention and control districts.

56.     The RBF data were externally verified by independent contractors (initially
EuroHealth, then the University of Zambia, and the Zambia Institute for Policy Analysis
and Research (ZIPAR), helping ensure quality and reliability. Major deficiencies were
identified during verification in both data recording and data verification resulting in
discrepancies (usually acceptance of services for payment that should not have been

   The HMIS in Zambia was set up in 1996 (one of the earliest in Africa). It covers all health posts, health
centers, and District Hospitals across the country. It captures data on disease-specific morbidity and
mortality, maternal and child health services, and other aspects of service delivery (staff workload, health
facilities utilization, availability of essential drugs, etc.). An EU evaluation in 2012 rated it as meeting 85%
of benchmarks, one of the best performing in Africa.


                                                      19
accepted) that inflated the RBF benefits paid to the facility. The Technical Review
compared the RBF data with HMIS data and found variable consistency. The team judged
that most facilities did their best to report accurately, with only isolated cases of facilities
appearing to inflate their service volumes. Most discrepancies were attributed to: (a)
cumbersome and error-prone manual counting of eligible services recorded in patient
registers, sometimes requiring cross-checking, back-tracing and matching patient records
from several different sources; (b) inadequate training in the nuances of eligibility criteria
and how to compute two of the RBF indicators; and (c) confusion and duplication in
reporting introduced by differences in the definition of three of the nine RBF indicators
compared to HMIS definitions (another three indicators do not have matching data
elements in the HMIS aggregation form).18Reporting for the three indicators with the same
definition in the HMIS and RBF was “rarely the same” (Technical Review) in the HMIS
form used for malaria reporting and RBF verified indicator reports. The labor-intensive
RBF verification seems not to have had spill-over benefits for the HMIS data system.

57.     An RBF Web Application Management System was developed to facilitate
accurate and reliable data consolidation and transmission from the health facility to the
national level. It was meant to continuously provide information on how health facilities
and districts were performing so that solutions could be found promptly to assist under-
achievers to meet their targets. At the project level, the system performed well. However,
this effort was not extended beyond the RBF pilot.

58.     Sustainability of M&E beyond project. The most recent Malaria Indicator Survey
for which there are results was in 2012. Data from the 2015 MIS were not available when
this report was written, with results expected in early 2016. The last issue of the informative
Malaria M&E newsletter was July 2011, neither boding well for sustaining the excellent
standards of malaria M&E achieved during most of the project. On the other hand, five-
yearly DHS surveys are expected to continue (the 2013 survey was completed on time and
to the usual DHS high standards). Improvement in the HMIS are likely for two reasons: (a)
the Health Services Improvement Project (HSIP), effective March 2015) is relying on
HMIS data for results-based payments; these data will be independently verified, and the
HSIP intends to help upgrade data collection systems at facilities and districts; and (b) The
GRZ is continuing efforts to improve the HMIS, working with the Health Metrics Network.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

59.     The environmental impact of the project was rated as category B because it
involved procurement and use of insecticides and also would increase health care waste by
financing supply and use of commodities already in use in the health sector. Issues relating
to the relevant safeguard policies (OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, and OP/BP
4.09, Pest Management) were carefully discussed in the PAD, and implemented in a mostly


18
  (1) Percent of pregnant women who completed at least four ANC visits by 34 weeks and before delivery,
(2) Number of female clients who visit a facility for postnatal care between 6 days and 6 weeks after
delivery. (3) All users of modern contraceptives at the end of evaluated month – which differs from the
project intermediate results indicator of number of new acceptors. Source: Technical Review, Table 5


                                                  20
satisfactory way. Safeguard compliance was rated satisfactory consistently in ISRs, with
careful attention from a Senior Environmental Specialist on some supervision visits.

60.      Health Waste Management: The project did not create any new categories of
health waste. The additional volume was handled as per the National Health Waste
Management Plan, which was reviewed during appraisal and found satisfactory. The Plan
was updated in 2009 and disclosed in 2010 as part of preparations for the restructuring and
AF. However, the 2014 RBF Technical Review team found instances of poor medical
waste disposal. (“Health centers were seen using open pits for burning waste and even used
pit latrines for deposing placentas.”)

61.     Pesticides: No environmental assessment was required given the detailed
assessment already done by WHO, which had found Zambia’s vector control activities to
be acceptable. OP/BP 4.09 prohibits funding insecticides unless they have “negligible
adverse human health effects”. Zambia completely banned DDT in the early 1980s, but
faced with a malaria resurgence, reauthorized its use in 2000– but only for malaria vector
control. In 2005, WHO reviewed Zambia’s Integrated Vector Management and found the
policy, guidelines, protocol, resources and capacity adequate. Project component 1(b)
responded to WHO recommendations to enhance resources, training, facilities, protocols
and coordination. When alternative insecticides effective against malaria-carrying
mosquitoes became available, Zambia moved away from using DDT, and the AF was used
only for other, safer insecticides.

62.    Procurement: Early delays in procurement were quickly resolved. The 2007
change in the DCA to allow procurement by shopping and IAPSO is noted earlier. After
2009/2010, turnover of procurement staff exacerbated capacity constraints, and there were
delays of some large procurement packages. A procurement specialist consultant was hired
under the project, and supervision missions gave careful attention and intense
implementation support to help resolve specific problems and suggest ways to address
underlying causes. Senior MOH management also worked to speed up processing of large,
time-sensitive procurement packages.

63.     Financial Management was not a strength of the project. The MTR in May
2008found the project financial accounting working well, but other FM components
performing poorly, which persisted for at least 3 years. Budgeting and internal audit for the
project were weak, FM reports were consistently late and incomplete. The project stopped
using the FM software system in October 2008 and reverted to unreliable excel sheet
manual accounting, which, together with staff shortages, resulted in continued weak FM.

64.     In response to the corruption allegations in the MOH made in 2009, the government
and the World Bank carried out extensive investigations. In response to an in-depth review
of the project FM by the Bank in 2009, a FM improvement plan was developed, and the
FM arrangements for the AF were revised. The MOH hired a Senior Accountant for the
project, and the Bank intensified supervision attention to all aspects of FM and provided
additional training in WB guidelines .An Independent Fiduciary Review Agent (IFRA) was
contracted to review all financial management and procurement transactions and build



                                             21
capacity of MOH teams. No further IDA funding was provided through the pooled funding
(“basket”) mechanism, and direct payment to suppliers was encouraged. ISRs in 2011
report improved FM, and the very detailed 2012 and 2013 FM supervision reports show
most issues fully resolved, including unqualified audits, timely reporting and
replenishment requests, and much improved budgets and record keeping. (Additional
details are provided in Annex 10.)

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

65.     The national malaria program has continued at strength, relying on funding from
the GFATM (total current grant commitments are $80 million for 2015-2017), USAID,
DfID and the Government. The National Malaria Strategy 2011-2016 was revised and
updated in 2014, interventions are more targeted and differentiated across the zones and in
response to surveillance data, and 3,039 community health workers (CHWs) and
community health assistants(CHAs) have been recruited and trained to improve
surveillance, case detection and rapid and appropriate treatment seeking and access. LLINs
are being distributed through schools and communities, and improvements in the supply
chain management and distribution – including to the “last mile” are underway. Continued
success in reducing malaria incidence and mortality will be monitored through the HMIS
and DHS.

66.     From 2010-2012the government and IDA carried out an extensive review of the
health sector, with a careful focus on health financing, costing the National Health Plan
and tracking public expenditures on health. Discussion of the findings and
recommendations of these studies and the emerging results of the RBF evaluation informed
the preparation of the US$67 million IDA project (HSIP, P145335) to sustain and expand
efforts to improve health delivery systems and use of maternal, newborn and child health
and nutrition services. The HSIP appraisal and approval was timed to enable a smooth
transition as the RBF project ended in October 2014. HSIP was approved in March 2014,
but only became effective in March 2015, making the transition less smooth than intended.
HSIP includes US$27 million (US$12 million IDA, US$15 million HRITF grant) for
supporting RBF at primary care level in five provinces of the country and for testing
community based RBF approaches. As with the RBF pilot, HSIP includes an Impact
Evaluation component so the country can assess new mechanisms before deciding whether
to scale up. The design of the RBF mechanisms at primary care level are being informed
by the Impact Evaluation findings funded under the project that is the subject of this ICRR.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

67.     The assessment of project outcomes is based on analysis of two project phases:
phase 1 (March 13, 2006 to August 31, 2009) covers the original project design from
effectiveness until the Level I restructuring that changed the PDO and incorporated
activities and the allocation of funding from the Russian TF and expected from the HRITF;
and phase 2 (September 1, 2009 to October 31, 2014) during which the RBF grant became
effective and US$30 million in AF from IDA was added. Disbursement of IDA and Trust




                                            22
Funds during phase 1 was US$23.58 million (33% of total project disbursements) and
US$48.75 (67%) during phase 2.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

68.     The project relevance for both phases 1 and 2 is High in all three aspects -
objectives, design and implementation. The objectives and design of the malaria project
were highly relevant throughout the project, changing appropriately with circumstances.
Implementation responded extremely well to changing country needs, as described below.
The ratings for phase 2 consider both the RBF activities and the malaria-specific activities;
the relevance of the RBF objectives and implementation were High and although relevance
of the RBF design was Substantial, overall phase 2 retains a High relevance rating.

Alignment with Government policy priorities and global goals:

69.     Zambia is committed to the MDGs, which include a specific focus on child
mortality, maternal health, and Malaria (MDGs 4, 5 and 6); the project aligns well with the
MDG targets. 19 The National Health Strategic Plan 2006-2011 theme was “Working
towards achieving the MDGs,” the National Health Strategic Plan2011–2016 retains the
MDG theme, and is consistent with the broadened project focus after 2010 by noting that
“key programs like roll back malaria, maternal and child health remain important,” but
notes the “need to strengthen the entire health system.” The continued relevance of malaria
is evident in being the only disease-specific target in the 8 Main Objectives/Targets in the
plan. Maternal and child health (which are strongly affected by malaria in Zambia) are
priorities in Zambia’s Vision 2030, Sixth National Development Plan 2011-2015, and
Roadmap for Accelerating Reduction of Maternal, Newborn and Child Mortality 2013-
2016. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paperfor2002-2004 highlighted the malaria as a
priority area. The project objectives and design derived from the National Malaria Strategic
Plans 2006-2011, and the design and implementation remains consistent with the National
Malaria Strategic Plan 2011-2016.

Alignment with Bank country and sector strategies and corporate goals:

70.     The project directly supported the Bank’s results-based Zambia Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for 2004-2007 and CAS for FY08-2011 (extended to 2012) by contributing
to pillar 2, improving lives and protection of the vulnerable. This is also one of the three


19
  There is obvious consistency between the MBP and RBF and the following relevant MDG goals and
associated indicators: Goal 4 Reduce Child Mortality: 4.1 Under-five mortality rate; 4.2 Infant mortality
rate; 4.3 Proportion of 1 year-old children immunized against measles; Goal 5: Improve maternal
health:5.1 Maternal mortality ratio; 5.2 Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel; 5.3
Contraceptive prevalence rate; 5.4 Adolescent birth rate; 5.5 Antenatal care coverage (at least one visit and
at least four visits); 5.6 Unmet need for family planning. Goal 6 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other
diseases: 6.6 Incidence and death rates associated with malaria; 6.7 Proportion of children under 5 sleeping
under insecticide-treated bed nets; 6.8 Proportion of children under 5 with fever who are treated with
appropriate anti-malarial drugs, and also 8.13 Proportion of population with access to affordable essential
drugs on a sustainable basis


                                                     23
goals in the Country Partnership Strategy FY13-FY16, with the project specifically noted
as being an important part of the Bank’s support to Zambia.

71.     Objectives: The project tackled the main preventable cause of premature death and
morbidity in Zambia, an important goal for health outcomes. The original PDO was defined
as “access to and use of” malaria interventions; the 2009 revised PDO changed this to
“coverage”, which is usually understood as use of services when needed, which is what
matters for health outcomes. The clearly stated PDO was complemented by a selective set
of well-specified “SMART” key project indicators (KPIs) for the major prevention
activities. No KPI was specified for treatment of malaria, which received relatively little
attention during the first two years of project implementation. This was corrected after the
MTR of May 2008. The revised broader project objective to include other key maternal
and child health interventions as well as malaria was justified by the sharp fall in the
incidence of malaria deaths and cases to the extent that the 2007 DHS found that malaria
was no longer the main cause of death of children under 5 and pregnant women.

72.     The RBF pilot aimed to improve the motivation, morale and productivity of front-
line health workers providing services at the primary care level, clearly relevant in a
situation of poor quality of services and widespread stock-outs of essential drugs in primary
level facilities, and high absenteeism of health workers – random checks had found that
30% of doctors and 20% of clinical officers were not in post.

73.     Design: The selective and well-focused activities in the MBP link tightly to the
desired impact of reduced malaria mortality and morbidity, and to the PDO and KPIs. The
project funded procurement of needed inputs (bed nets, insecticide, drugs, diagnostic kits
and supplies) for prevention activities (spraying, distribution and retreating of bed nets,
IPTp) and better malaria case management treatment. The project also funded training,
surveys, and additional supervision to enhance the efficiency and quality of the other
activities.

74.     The least successful component, the COMBOR grants, aimed to mobilize, inform
and motivate communities to use nets and seek treatment, and was well-justified by the
DHS 2002 results that found that demand for malaria interventions needed attention as well
as supply, and by the MIS 2008 finding of poor utilization rates of LLIN’s in households,
indicating the need for a strong communication strategy and behavioral change activities.
Although modelled closely on Zambia’s HIV community grant program which was
considered successful and effective, there was no evidence that grants to NGOs and CBOs
were likely to be the most effective or cost-effective way to increase demand and use of
malaria interventions. Small grant programs require considerable oversight and
administrative input, and are challenging to sustain after project financing ends. A
Community Health Worker program might have been a better option.

75.    Component 1(b) - Environmental Health Management - directly addressed
weaknesses identified in the WHO assessment of Zambia’s mosquito spraying program,
providing needed equipment, training and studies of insecticide resistance that enabled
decisions on selection of insecticides in subsequent future years.

76.     The RBF activities added during the restructuring and AF targeted immunization
and the substantial unmet need for contraception, ante- and post-natal care, and skilled care
at birth and for improving the quality of primary health care – all highly relevant to the
goals of improving maternal, infant and child health. The RBF approach was innovative,
and the project sensibly introduced it as a well-structured pilot with an additional US$2
million budget (outside the project) for an impact evaluation. Some of the details of the
RBF design could have been better, as discussed in the sections on achievement of
objectives and efficiency.

77.      Implementation: The project responded appropriately and with reasonable speed
to changes in the health sector and changing needs and opportunities. The 2010 AF helped
fill a financing gap that opened when expected GFATM funds were delayed and when
some donors suspended disbursement in response to the corruption scandal. The 2010
US$30 million AF took advantage of additional IDA funds allocated to fight malaria in
Africa. The decision to retain and persist with the COMBOR grants despite lagging
implementation was vindicated by the finding that usage of bed nets was higher in
COMBOR communities where nets were distributed through NGO or community group
grantees than in communities that received nets through a mass distribution campaign
without the involvement of a CBO.

78.    The project responded to Zambia’s success in reducing malaria incidence and
mortality by a restructuring that broadened its scope, to include other priority interventions
for maternal and child health, and was an early adopter of RBF, taking advantage of the
availability of the substantial additional grant resources of the HRITF.

79.     In response to corruption in MOH reported in 2009, an in-depth financial review of
the project and its procedures and processes was undertaken, resulting in a financial
management action plan and more stringent fiduciary management, including requiring the
GRZ to appoint an independent Fiduciary Agent to review all financial transactions and
procurement and provide to training, and greater reliance on direct payments to suppliers
by the WB rather than reimbursement of payment made by the GRZ. A Governance Action
Plan to strengthen weak internal financial controls in the MOH was agreed and the Bank
stopped contributing to the pooled funding mechanism after it was found to be the main
vehicle for the corrupt practices. Judicious extensions in project closing were approved
during implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The rating is Substantial for both phases of the project.

80.    The following table summarizes achievement of the Project Outcome Indicators
(POIs) and Intermediate Outcome Indicators (IOIs) in both project phases (10 indicators in
phase 1 and 19 indicators in phase 2) and provides justification for the ratings of Substantial.

Note: Targets are only considered as surpassed if the outcome is well above the target, outcomes
102-104% above target are considered “Achieved”. Outcomes of 67-99% of targets are
considered partially achieved.

81.     Project performance in achieving the prevention part of the original PDO before
the level 1 restructuring in 2009 was excellent, measured against the POIs at the specified
target date of 2008. All the original POIs were fully met, with two of three targets exceeded.
The three original POIs cover use of the key prevention interventions (but not access).Since
use presupposes access and is what matters for impact on malaria outcomes, these are fully
adequate indicators for prevention. The target to increase use of bednets by children under
five to 40% was exceeded (slightly --102%), and acceptably ambitious for the short time
period. The ambitious target for pregnant women receiving IPT was exceeded (120%),
increasing by 21 percentage points from 45% to 66% coverage in two years. The POI for
increasing malaria prevention through residual spraying of homes was met, with a similarly
ambitious target increase from 40% to 60%. The only intermediate indicator that was not
met measured treatment access: the percent of children under five years with a fever
receiving anti-malaria drugs within 24 hours. The 2008 MIS data found that the actual
value was just under half of the target of 36%. Stock-outs of anti-malaria drugs were found
to be widespread, a treatment barrier to which the MOH and Bank then gave concerted
attention, as described below. Better performance on treatment in phase 1 would have
earned the project a clear rating of High efficacy.

82.    From late 2009 the revised broader PDO applies: “to increase coverage of
interventions for malaria prevention and treatment and other key maternal and child
survival interventions”. The rating is Substantial: coverage certainly increased; all the
POIs and IOIs for coverage were exceeded with the exception of two targets achieved at
97% and one at 67%, and the required core indicator for beneficiary numbers that was not
defined well. Details follow (and are summarized in the data sheet).



                                                26
83.     The revised target for increased use of bed nets by children under five to 50% was
exceeded by 104%, reaching 57% in 2013. The revised target of 75% of pregnant women
receiving at least two doses of IPT was almost (97%) achieved, reaching 73% in 2013, but
the target and gains were far more modest than in the initial project years. The revised POI
for malaria prevention through residual spraying of homes was exceeded at 119%, with
more than 29% of households reporting in 2013 that their home was sprayed within the
past year. Again, the target was modest – to increase from 23% to 26%, but impressive
relative to what most other countries are able to accomplish, and considering that this was
measured nationally (not only in districts that were given priority for IRS).

84.     The intermediate outcome indicator for prevention activities was achieved: 101%
of the formidable target of 3.7 million ITNs were bought and distributed in four years.

85.      No POI and one IOI for malaria treatment access or use was specified in the 2005
PAD. The National Malaria Program included three treatment indicators and goals that are
listed in the 2005 PAD Results Framework (Annex 3) and measured in the MIS. ISRs (and
the 2009 Restructuring) chose to focus on “the percentage of children under 5 years of age
with fever in the previous two weeks who received antimalarial drugs within 24 hours of
onset of fever”.20 The highly aspirational national goal for 2010 was 80%, other countries
in Africa achieved levels around 10% during this period. The original project goal was
60% by 2008, revised down to 36% by 2010 in the 2009 level 1 restructuring in light of
the 2006 and 2008 MIS data. The target was not met. The percentages reported in the four
MIS reports and 2013/2014 DHS were as follows:

                                                               2006       2008      2010      2012   2013
 Percentage of U5 with fever in past 2 weeks                    33         28        34        24     21
 Percentage of U5 with fever in past 2 weeks                    53         43        34        37     40
 receiving antimalarial drugs
 Percentage of U5 with fever in past 2 weeks                     32        29        19        20     21
 receiving antimalarial drugs within 24 hours
 Ratio of treatment within 24 hours to treatment                .60        .67       .56       .54   .53

86.    The percentage with fever can indicate prevention success, and rises with the 2010
malaria resurgence. The percentage receiving antimalarial drugs (at all, and within 24
hours) appears to show a worsening trend for children under five years from 2006 to 2010,
and slight improvement in 2012 and 2013.However, not all children with fever have
malaria, and better prevention of malaria would reduce the percentage of fevers that are
from malaria. Better diagnosis of malaria would also result in a falling percentage of
children with fever receiving antimalarial drugs. Thus the values could also indicate
improvements in the provision of malaria treatment, although there was no improvement
in prompt seeking of treatment (last line of table above). The 2008 MIS discussion notes



20
     At the time, the ISR guidelines were to select one indicator for each component to report on.



                                                       27
inadequacies in the indicator21 and concludes that “A better indicator and measurement of
progress in evaluating prompt effective antimalarial treatment is needed to provide a
measure of the occurrence of prompt effective antimalarial treatment among those with
true malaria”.

87.     The 2010 AF changed this IOI from measuring prompt treatment to a measure of
those give the correct treatment conditional on being treated at all (“children under five
who took the recommended first line drug as a percentage of those had a fever in the past
two weeks and received treatment”). The baseline was noted as 76% (for 2010) and the
target of 85% by 2010was met 100%. The other IOI for quality, the percentage of children
U5 who presented with fever having a blood drop taken (presumably for a malaria test)
increased from 17% to 32.3%, exceeding the 25% target (129%) (Source: MIS surveys).

88.   The indicator for the community response component was met (111% of target)
with NGO/CBO grants in all 34 districts in the 4 provinces with highest malaria incidence.
The number of grants per district ranged from 2-19, with an average of five per district.
The number of grants greatly increased during the latter part of the project from a
cumulative total of 173 before 2010, to 528 completed sub-projects by closing.

89.     MOH reports on the kinds of activities funded included filling ditches and stagnant
pools of water and clearing vegetation to reduce mosquito breeding grounds near homes;
encouraging uptake of IRS where eligible; providing information about malaria prevention,
symptoms, and the urgency of seeking care especially for young children; buying “bicycle
and motorbike ambulances” to reduce barriers to accessing care; and motivating for IPT
during pregnancy. Some districts reported significant decreases in stillbirths with improved
prevention by pregnant women. No data were available to be able to assess the impact of
the COMBOR component, for example by assessing knowledge and use of nets over time
in the communities were grants were implemented, or comparing these communities to
others without grants.

90.     The project helped fund the national malaria program, contributing to the program
impact of helping Zambia be on track to meet the ambitious global target of 50%-75%
decrease in case incidence from 2000-2015.22 Zambia has performed much better than most
other Sub-Saharan countries in decreasing incidence, and in expanding access to prompt
and recommended treatment that has also helped reduce substantially malaria fatality rates
and deaths, as shown in Figure 1 below. The achievements of the project indicators is
clearly reflected in the accelerated fall in malaria admissions and deaths in the early years
of the project which accelerated the more modest falls over the prior five years, and then
the resumption of improving trends after the reversals in 2009 and 2010 (Figure 1).




21
   The survey report notes that small numbers underpowered the survey to measure changes reliably. It also
explains that improved prevention would decrease the proportion of children with fever who are in fact
suffering from malaria. More accurate malaria diagnosis – also supported by the project -- would lead to a
desirable decrease in the percentage being treated with anti-malarial drugs.

91.    Figure 2 shows the ten-year trends in malaria incidence (new cases per year) and
the change over previous years from 2003-12. After the dramatic decrease and then
rebound, malaria incidence was fairly stable from 2010 to 2012, while deaths continued to
decrease (Figure 1), suggesting improved treatment. Going beyond the project PDO to the
intended development impact, the Malaria Booster Project made a contribution to clear
improvements in health outcomes and lives saved.

92.     There are other factors likely to have contributed to some extent to the gains in
malaria outcomes. Socio-economic growth and urbanization tend to improve housing
conditions and reduce the number of people and proportion of the population living in the
most malaria-prone areas. Economic growth in Zambia was a robust 5-7% during the
project, and Zambia has been urbanizing at about 4% per year. As noted earlier, rainfall
and temperature variations can also affect the length and severity of the malaria season,
and are likely to have been a factor in variations in malaria outcomes, but would not affect
the longer-term time trends.

RBF Pilot Achievements23

93.      The RBF supported the increase coverage of interventions for other key maternal
and child survival interventions in the revised PDO. (Annex 12 provides more details on
the design of the RBF pilot including its evaluation.) The “tracer” POI (“to increase the
percentage of women delivering in health facilities by a skilled birth attendant in RBF
eligible districts from 31% to 36% by 2013”) was greatly exceeded, reaching 72% in RBF
districts by the end of the project in 2014 – twice the target level, which was much too low.
The 2011 RBF Baseline survey found that 58% of women were delivering in facilities, so
the increase to 72% over three years was substantial: 124% above the actual 2011 baseline.

94.     In general, there was a steady, convincing and fairly consistent increase in uptake
of services in RBF intervention districts for all indicators except antenatal care and the
provision of drugs to pregnant women to prevent HIV transmission to their infants (see
Figure 3).24Increases varied across indicators, with the biggest overall change seen in the
assisted in-facility deliveries (a 13 percentage point increase relative pure control districts)
and uptake of family planning services, followed by postnatal care (an 8 percentage point
increase relative to control districts) and full immunization of children age < 1 year. The
average uptake of ANC services, already high in Zambia, did not increase, but the indicator
included the stringent condition of payment only if a fourth ANC visit occurred at least 16
weeks before birth or by the 34th week of pregnancy, seldom met especially in rural areas,
and relatively less amenable to action by the health providers.

95.      A rigorous, randomized Impact Evaluation (IE) was an integral part of the RBF
pilot design. To enhance learning, the pilot had three sets of districts: (i) RBF intervention
districts with a comprehensive package of RBF features and RBF funding based on
performance; (ii) control 1 (C1) districts that received the package of essential equipment
and additional funding intended to be about the same level as the average RBF
payments.C1 additional funding was unconditional, and also differed in that no part could
be paid to staff as salary bonus. C1 facilities were explicitly told to use the extra funding
to improve delivery of maternal and child health services. (iii) True control (C2) districts
received nothing different from “business as usual”. Compared to the C2 pure control arm,
the RBF facilities had important gains in key indicators as noted above. The IE also found
that most of the services that increased in the RBF facilities showed broadly similar
improvements in C1 facilities. Institutional deliveries and deliveries by skilled providers
increased more in C1 districts than in RBF districts. There were also greater increases in
women receiving post-natal care in C1 districts than in RBF districts. The indicators in
which the RBF districts outperformed both C1 and C2 was in timing of the first ANC visit
which was earlier by two weeks in RBF compared to both controls; and immunization, in
which full vaccination coverage declined in both C1 and C2 districts (similar to the trend
in the rest of the country) but remained constant or slightly higher in RBF districts,
suggesting a protective effect of the full RBF package. The improved performance in the
C1 districts might reflect spillover effects – there was ample opportunity for staff to learn
from counterparts in other districts at routine MOH meetings. On the other hand, it might
reflect the effect of the equipment and additional funding provided to the C1 facilities,
and/or a “Hawthorne Effect” of being part of a pilot study.

96.    The RBF pilot also rewarded increases in quality. The quality scores show marked
increases for the intervention districts during the pilot (see Figure 4). However, the Impact
Evaluation comparison of intervention and control districts shows a mixed picture. For
example, women residing in RBF districts were significantly more likely to be able to list


                                             31
seven of the 12 danger signs during pregnancy compared to women in C1 districts.
However, C1 districts achieved better improvements in blood tests and any iron taken
during ANC as well as higher immediate initiation of breastfeeding and receipt of Vitamin
A after delivery compared to both RBF and C2 districts. On perceived quality, health
workers in RBF facilities spent significantly more time during consultations with their
patients compared to both C1 and C2 health facilities.

97.     Surveys of health workers conducted as part of the Impact Evaluation found that
staff in RBF and C1 districts had higher levels of satisfaction and lower turnover than in
C2 districts, with larger gains in the RBF arm than in the C1 arm.

98.     The two most important other factors that could account for the improvements
in RBF indicators are the large increase in salaries of doctors and nursing staff in the
MOH that occurred completely independently of the project during implementation of the
RBF pilot, and the rapid economic growth mentioned earlier, that is likely to have boosted
use of health care services among families whose incomes rose. As mentioned above, the
RBF pilot could have had spill-over effects: the IE compared 3 districts, one from each
study arm (RBF, C1, C2) in each of two provinces, all managed by the same Provincial
Medical Office (PMO). In line with Government guidelines, all districts in a province
attend quarterly implementation review meetings and it is possible that during these
meetings there could have been cross-pollination of ideas. One Bank supervision mission
noted that some C1 districts had adopted elements of the RBF approach and some of the
indicators.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: High for the project before restructuring, substantial after restructuring
(modest efficiency of the RBF pilot). Overall project efficiency is rated Substantial.

99.    The original economic analysis conducted during appraisal in 2005 did not include
a formal cost-benefit/return on investment analyses. It outlined the human capital losses
from malaria infection and the potential gains from malaria control, including among the
poor. The 2010 AF appraisal similarly did not provide quantitative economic analysis, but
discussed the economic burden of malaria in Zambia, noted that the package of malaria
interventions had been estimated to have a benefit-cost ration of 20:1 for populations in
sub-Saharan Africa, 25and provided a range of estimates of the cost-effectiveness of the
proposed interventions in terms of cost per DALY saved.

100. Overall donor funding for malaria in Zambia certainly reduced malaria-related
child mortality versus the counterfactual scenario of no funding. The declines in reported
child malaria deaths (and also in deaths from malaria of people older than 5 years) as well
as the MIS results showing reductions in the prevalence of malaria parasites and severe
anemia in children fit with the casual model that the program reduced deaths from malaria.
The resurgence of malaria in three areas of the country seen in the 2010 MIS, after declines
in donor funding for malaria in 2009 and 2010 are further evidence of the strong link
between interventions funded by the project and intended impact.

101. Economic analyses (Table 3 and Annex 3) show strong benefits relative to costs of
the overall malaria control program, with about US$265-295 million in discounted
spending and about US$810 to US$2,210 million in benefits. The overall cost-effectiveness
is in the range of US$500 to 820/DALY, well below the Zambia GDP per capita of
US$1,722 in 2015, and considered a favorable CEA ratio. The internal rate of return was
also quite favorable. The large economic benefits chiefly relate to the value of life lost,
using the plausible assumption that each child death avoided provides US$160,000 in
welfare gains (discounted at either 3% or 5%). Despite the costly chemicals needed for IRS,
the cost of rapid diagnostic kits, bed nets (that need to be replaced every 3-5 years) and
ACT drugs, the malaria program recurrent costs were modest, averaging about US$45
million/year, which is about 13% of the MOH annual budget over the period 2006- 2013.

102. One could attribute a share of the benefits to the Bank contribution in proportion to
the share of the total malaria program financed by the project over the 8 years –roughly on
the order of 20%, although this goes counter to the spirit of contribution to an overall
program.

103. The malaria project implementation paid careful attention to efficiency, seeking to
allocate scarce resources to achieve the greatest possible impact on malaria prevention and
treatment, as is clear in the annual planning discussions and decisions documented in Aides
Memoire. One example is that in 2011, distribution of bed nets especially targeted areas
that had seen the greatest resurgence of malaria cases the previous year; the success of this
targeting was seen in the higher levels of net ownership in those areas documented in the
2012 MIS (Luapula, the area with the worst malaria resurgence in 2010, had the highest
net ownership in 2012).

104. Zambia’s early adoption of newly available malaria technologies contributed to the
efficiency of the project. The use of combination ACT drugs (from 2003) made treatment
much more effective -- considerable drug resistance had built up to chloroquine. The switch
from nets that needed to be re-treated at least once or twice a year to long-lasting nets
impregnated with insecticide that require no retreatment even if washed, was another
efficiency gain, the additional cost of the nets was far outweighed by less frequent
replacement and the saving on retreatment kits, distribution costs, and their greater
effectiveness against mosquitoes.

105. Data are not available for any assessment of the extent to which the community
response activities were efficient or effective, however only 6% of the total IDA funds and
4.6% of the total project funding were allocated to this component. The results summarized
above that found only minor differences between the RBF districts and the C1 districts
(both compared to the “pure control” C2 districts that received no additional funds or
inputs) suggest that RBF may not be as cost-effective as simply providing additional funds
and inputs to facilities. This is especially true considering that the C1 districts in fact
received less money than intended - about 56% of the average RBF intervention group
facility payments. It is important to note that this does not mean that the whole of phase 2
or even the RBF pilot was inefficient – both RBF and C1 facilities achieved significant
improvements, and the RBF pilot costs were less than one quarter of total project
disbursements, with cost-effective malaria interventions continuing throughout phase 2.



                                                   34
106. The Impact Evaluation of the RBF pilot included a cost effectiveness assessment
(contracted to Brandeis University) which found the RBF intervention to be a cost-effective
approach to improving maternal and child health, compared with “business as usual”.
Without the quality adjustment, the estimated mid-point Incremental Cost Effectiveness
Ratio (ICER) was $1,031 per QALY gained. With the quality improvement included, the
ICER was $863 per QALYs gained. Both values are less than the GDP/capita of $1,759 in
2013 (mid-year of RBF program) in Zambia (WDI data).The range of ICERs are bound
within three times the GDP/capita. In comparison with control group 1, the RBF results are
mixed. The mean estimate of ICER is $1,513 per QALY gained if the quality of care is
excluded. However, the ICER can range from $724/QALY gained to infinity to negative
values i.e., dominated by control group 1). If the quality of care is included in the analysis,
the mid-point estimate remains cost-effective, but the range was from $628/QALY gained
(very cost-effective) to $11,820/QALY gained (not cost-effective). Depending on which
group is used for comparison, the ICER varies, but the estimates point to favorable
impact of the RBF program.

107. In addition to increasing coverage of key maternal and child health interventions,
the purpose of the pilot was to learn whether the RBF approach was able to improve health
system performance, and the Impact Evaluation findings contain useful lessons for Zambia
as well as for the many other countries where large amounts of funding are being invested
in RBF initiatives. The learning objective was not captured in the PDO nor stated explicitly
in the indicators, although it was implicit in the inclusion of the indicator that required that
an article on the impact of the RBF pilot be written.

108. The effectiveness and efficiency of many health services depend heavily on
essential drugs being available. The way that the project tackled the persistent problem of
drug stock-outs at primary care facilities is a good example of rigorous efforts to enhance
efficiency. In the first years of the project, assessments of essential drug stock-outs and the
drug supply chain management found that distribution from district stores to primary-level
facilities was a major bottleneck. The Bank, DfID, USAID and MOH worked together to
consider a wide range of potential solutions, and then pilot test and rigorously evaluate the
comparative operational effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the two most promising
new supply chain models from April 2009 to April 2010 in 16 districts. The total cost of
adopting the more successful model nation-wide was estimated, and the expected impact
on stock-outs and deaths. The evaluation also identified several other ways to greatly
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Zambia’s drug supply system.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory for both phases, before and after the 2009 restructuring

109. Applying the rating rules, the high relevance and efficiency and substantial
achievement of objectives (efficacy) of the MBP project before restructuring results in a
highly Satisfactory Overall Project Outcome rating (although some minor shortcomings
have been documented). The Phase 2 ratings of high relevance and substantial efficiency
and efficacy result in a Satisfactory Overall Project Rating for phase 2. Weighting by the
proportions of the project funds (IDA and Trust Funds) that disbursed in each phase results
in a Satisfactory Overall Outcome Rating (see Tables 4(a) and 4(b) below).

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

110. Poverty: The malaria project had no explicit poverty targeting or objective, but
inherently contributed to poverty reduction by focusing on the major cause of morbidity
and mortality in the country, which disproportionately affects people in rural areas who are
more likely to be poor. The national program of mass free distribution of ITNs aims to
ensure that the most vulnerable households – including the poorest – are at least equally
covered. The 2012 MIS found that net ownership was highest in the lowest wealth
quintiles. Monitoring of the core indicators in the MIS disaggregated by income/wealth
quintiles. The absolute and relative gap in malaria-attributable deaths between the two
lowest income quintiles compared to the top two quintiles narrowed sharply between 2006
and 2012(Table 5). This is consistent with the literature that malaria control can reduce
inequalities in child mortality across income groups. Prevention of malaria and effective
treatment have been demonstrated to have large economic and social benefits in Africa,
enhancing the likely impact of the project on poverty.

111. The RBF pilot included explicit pro-poor targeting by selecting all rural and peri-
urban areas of the country (not urban areas), and by setting the performance incentive
payments 25% higher in remote facilities that mostly serve poorer communities. The
interventions that were used for the incentive payments were selected with the aim of
increasing access and utilization of services known to have a significant impact on child
and maternal outcomes, and in which there were large disparities across wealth quintiles
(Table 6, DHS 2007 and 2013, nation-wide data).

112. The gender impact was explicit in that women were a specific target group,
especially for malaria prevention in pregnant women. A “core” IDA indicator was added
in 2010 to track the percentage of project beneficiaries that were female. The revised PDO
explicitly focused on maternal (and child) health interventions, and the services
incentivized by the RBF payments were mainly for pregnant and post-partum women and
expanding contraceptive use among women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

113. The project provided training in procurement, financial management and project
management that will have positive effects beyond the project, as staff who move to other
jobs apply their skills and expertise outside the project or MOH. Several hundred NGOs
and CBOs gained experience and new skills in budgeting, reporting and managing funds
and activities. The supply chain pilot that was added (with DfID funding) to reduce drug
stock-outs built capacity for drug supply planning and forecasting. Discrepancies and
difficulties in estimating the service volumes eligible for RBF payments gave new urgency
to improving and streamlining the HMIS, which is receiving specific attention and support
in the new Health Services Improvement Project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops –
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
The rating is Moderate.

114. Three main factors pose significant risk that the development outcomes will not be
maintained, but on balance the risk is considered moderate given the three countervailing
factors listed in the following paragraph. The risks are: (i) Malaria epidemiology,
especially in Zambia’s Eastern and Northern Provinces continues to be unstable, and
changes in climate and other entomologic conditions could lead to outbreaks on top of the
usual malaria patterns. (ii) There is constant risk of mosquitoes becoming resistant to



                                            38
pesticides and the malaria parasite becoming resistant to anti-malaria drugs. As long as
malaria remains endemic in Zambia and its neighbors, the project achievements remain at
risk. Control efforts, surveillance, good logistics and effective coordination need to persist
and to be quickly reactive. (iii) The Malaria Booster Project coincided with very strong
donor interest globally in and commitment to malaria control, which has been diluted and
displaced by the current attention to health systems and Universal Health Coverage. For
example, as attention has shifted, the Bank no longer contributes to the Roll Back Malaria
partnership.

115. The factors that reduce the risks that the project outcomes will not be maintained
are: (i) The GRZ remains strongly and explicitly committed to the continued reduction and
even elimination of malaria. This is evidenced in national documents and in the substantial
increase in domestic funding from 2012 to fill financing gaps. (ii) Substantial funding for
the malaria program has been secured from the GFATM, USAID/PMI and DFID from
2015 through the end of 2017, and possibly beyond. (iii) Substantial technical and
management capacity and experience has been gained by the NMCC. (iv) The shift in
global health focus from disease-specific to health systems and the HSIP approved in 2014
(effective in early 2015) increase the probability that gains in access, use, and quality of
basic services – especially for women and young children – will be sustained and continued,
notwithstanding the PAD rating of implementation risk as substantial. The HSIP PDO, “to
improve health delivery systems and utilization of maternal, newborn and child health and
nutrition services” in the five of ten provinces in the country with highest poverty and
lowest service coverage and health and nutrition outcomes, explicitly and directly builds
on the MBP and RBF pilot.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

116. The Bank team performed well in designing a simple and well-focused project to
tackle the biggest contributor to Zambia’s burden of disease using evidence-based malaria
control strategies. The time taken for identification, preparation and appraisal was
reasonable. The project was fully aligned with government and Bank priorities and global
development goals, and with the national malaria control program. Project design reflected
lessons learned from previous Bank projects and global experience with malaria control,
and benefited from the suggestions of a QER panel before appraisal.

117. Conditions of effectiveness were pragmatic: a Project Implementation Manual with
detailed implementation guidelines be developed, and bank accounts opened. The results
framework was clear, with strong links from inputs to outputs to outcomes and impact.
Monitoring and evaluation was well-designed (except for the COMBOR component), with
reliable, robust MIS surveys every two years supported by the project. Risk assessment
proved prescient, and mitigation measures worked reasonably well in that the corruption
affected (only) 0.15% of the total initial Bank credit, and was detected by the MOH’s own
procedures. The project design was relevant to poverty and two of the main activities


                                             39
targeted pregnant women. The design included attention to safe disposal of spraying
supplies, based on an assessment by WHO specialists. Project preparation and design gave
effective attention to donor coordination, and took good account of the capacity and
ownership of the GRZ and the NMCC.

118. One shortcoming in the original project design has been noted: more thoughtful
design (including of the indicator/s) and more careful initial guidance and motivation for
the implementers of the COMBOR component was needed. Another minor issue is that an
explanation should have been given for setting the date for the POI targets as 2008 rather
than the planned final year of the project (mitigated by setting targets for 2009 in the PAD
Results Framework Annex).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

119. As the first Malaria Booster project approved by the Bank, there was a high level
of attention from Bank senior management in the initial project years. The Bank team gave
the close monitoring and careful implementation support warranted by the project’s high-
risk rating, with regular supervision missions that often included experts in procurement,
fiduciary and safeguard issues as well as in public health. ISRs consistently complimented
the team on their close supervision attention, strong support to the borrower, and sensible
proposals for resolving delays and bottlenecks, especially to improve procurement and
management in the first year of implementation.

120. A good example of this responsiveness to implementation bottlenecks relates to
drug supplies in primary health facilities. After the 2008 MTR found that drug stock-outs
were widespread in primary level facilities, the Bank secured a Bank-executed TF grant to
review options and test different drug distribution models to improve availability and
access to ACTs and other essential drugs in primary health facilities (the Essential
Medicines and Logistics Improvement Project (EMLIP). A WB Policy Note on the findings
of this operational research prompted MOH’s decision to scale-up the new model; scale-
up costs were largely funded through the project AF. To further improve drug supply
management, the project also funded design and pilot testing of the Electronic Zambia
Inventory Control System (eZICS). (Annex 2 provides more details on EMLPI and eZICS.)

121. In the May 2009 ISR#6, the Sector Manager noted that “the team has gone to
unusual lengths to attract other sources of funding to complement Bank funds” and make
up for the “very limited availability of IDA funds for Zambia”. The team successfully used
the strong project results to attract attention and funding (US$6.85 million) from a Russian
TF in 2007, and a US$17 million grant from the HRITF in 2009 to increase utilization and
quality of MNCH services using a RBF model. The team was also able to make the case
for US$30 million of additional IDA in 2010 despite the 2009 corruption which had made
both GRZ and Bank decision-makers wary. The project team worked closely with the GRZ
to get the required repayments made and limit disruption to the national malaria control
program.




                                            40
122. The Bank’s response to the 2009 corruption scandal was balanced, succeeding in
walking a difficult line between stronger financial controls, and enabling important project
activities to continue. The Bank merits kudos for continuing support during 2009-2010
while the corruption investigations were ongoing, quickly finding ways to improve
fiduciary controls, balancing the fiduciary risk and the risk of malaria resurgence that could
(and did to some extent) result from delays and cut-backs in prevention activities due to
the suspension of funding from other donors. This decision was vindicated by the eventual
finding that US$0.4 million of project funds had been improperly claimed (initially the
Government was asked to refund US$1.3 million, but continued investigation found
documentation showing that US$0.9 million of this were for eligible expenditures and the
WB repaid this amount).

123. The results of the 2009-10 investigation into corruption in the MOH have been
noted: loss of capacity in procurement, project management and implementation; time-
consuming additional controls that slowed procurement and other decisions; and strong
risk aversion that resulted from decisive action by the government in suspending, firing
and prosecuting staff suspected of corruption. Strong efforts and attention to financial
management by the Bank were not able to elicit stronger project performance in the final
years.

124. Three shortcomings in the Bank’s supervision are noted: (i) In late 2009, a detailed
audit of the project accounts found that there had been no documentation of expenditures
for malaria activities at district level since May 2007 – this should have been noticed during
supervision in the previous 30 months. (ii) Supervision and resolution of issues in the
COMBOR component was far less effective than the rest of the project, but as this was less
than 5% of the total financing, it should not weigh too heavily in the rating. (iii) All three
aspects of safeguards compliance – including pest management - were rated Satisfactory
in every single ISR, even when missions expressed “concern about adequate storage [of
insecticides and spraying equipment] and effective implementation of safeguards” (Aide
Memoire 2009) and noted that the Health Waste Management plan was not being fully
implemented.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory 

125. The satisfactory part of the rating is justified by strong malaria design and project
readiness at entry, three initial years of highly successful implementation, a judicious
response to the very difficult corruption situation, and strong and effective supervision
throughout except for the US$3 million small grants component, aspects of financial
management, and the health waste control activities. The “moderately” qualifier reflects
the concerns noted about the RBF design and implementation, and the shortcomings noted
in design and reporting on some indicators and in some aspects of supervision.




                                             41
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

126. Ownership and commitment to the overall project objective was clear, strong and
consistent, as evidenced by national Health policies and programs, and allocation of
funding and attention to the project. MOH ensured meaningful and well-coordinated
involvement of the stakeholder donor group, through the RBM national partnership, as well
as the pooled basked funding for district health plans. MOH was fully and constructively
engaged in project preparation and readiness for implementation, enabling the project to
become effective within four months of approval. GRZ was an early adopter of strategies
for malaria control as new evidence became available, and these actions prior to the project
provided the policy environment and tools that enabled strong project success. MOH
moved quickly in the first year to get needed staff into post enabling procurement to
proceed well after an initial lag, and the project soon disbursed well ahead of schedule.

127. The MOH is to be applauded for decisive action and the strong signal of zero
tolerance in its handling of the corruption in 2009. However, the investigations revealed
“significant weaknesses in the MOH internal control” and poor financial management that
the MOH had failed to remedy. For example, the project had provided a computerized
system for accounting and financial management that the Ministry stopped using in
October 2008 after disagreements with the vendor. The project switched to an excel-based
manual system to record and report project transactions, and by the end of 2009 was still
using this slow, inefficient, and error-prone system. Quarterly project financial reports
were late and seemed not to be used by MOH. Another example is that the external auditors’
report to management on matters arising from the audit for 2008 raised similar
accountability issues as in previous years, further indication of MOH management failing
to take appropriate and timely corrective actions.

128. A financial management plan was agreed and begun to be implemented by the start
of 2010, and ISR#10 in 2011 reports much improved financial management. In 2012 and
2013 missions were still giving detailed attention to financial management and reported
that almost all issues had been resolved. However, procurement capacity was not fully
restored before the project ended, requiring considerable effort by the Bank team and senior
MOH management to follow up delays in large procurement packages that slowed
implementation of related activities.

129. The reorganization of the MOH, transferring responsibility for some primary health
care functions to the MCDMCH was inevitably distracting to those involved, and disrupted
processes and accountability for some district-level activities and decisions. When
responsibility for COMBOR was transferred to the NMCC, the failure to provide vehicles
and office equipment prevented grant management and follow-up for many months.

130. MOH engagement in the RBF pilot was affected by the 2009 suspensions of staff
who had been involved in its design and planning and felt a strong sense of ownership.
MOH reluctantly accepted the Bank Team view that, given the staff losses in MOH,



                                            42
implementation of the RBF pilot needed to be managed through a dedicated RBF
Implementation Support Team hired specifically for the purpose. The “agreement to
disagree” on selection of some of the consultants for the Support Team resulted in sub-
optimal coordination between the RBF Team and MOH (notably with the HMIS team and
some of the senior MOH policymakers)during the last years of the project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

131. The two main implementing agencies were the National Malaria Control Center
(NMCC), and the RBF Implementation Support Team.

132. The NMCC was competent, committed and effective in implementing the malaria
project. They worked smoothly with the Roll Back Malaria partners, coordinating joint
annual reviews and malaria program planning. NMCC was able to ensure that the biannual
MIS surveys and resistance monitoring were completed on time and used the data to inform
decisions.

133. After the small grants program was transferred to NMCC, and once provided with
vehicles, computers, telephones, etc., the team worked hard to try and make up for years
of lagging performance. They were able to increase the number of grants approved to 400
by July 2012, the first ISR to include data on the number of grants approved, justified and
completed. However, no information was reported on the planned assessment of the quality
of the COMBOR grants; the inference is that it was not completed.

134. The NMCC website was well-maintained and highly informative during most of
the project, but has had few new postings since 2010, with the notable exception of the
2014 updated Malaria Treatment Guidelines. The important prevention and malaria case
management activities have continued since the closing of the project.

135. For the first three years of the project, the group responsible for the small grants
provided under the AIDS Project (“CRAIDS” grants) was also tasked with managing the
COMBOR small grants program (Total allocation $3 million). Their performance was
unsatisfactory (in stark contrast to satisfactory management of 1264 CRAIDS grants
totaling US$20 million in the AIDS project as noted in ICRR1308, May 2010), but weighs
lightly in the overall rating of Implementing Agencies because of the limited duration and
component size.

RBF Implementation Support Team

136. As noted, the MOH agreed reluctantly to the RBF pilot being managed through a
dedicated team of consultants, which created a difficult context for their work, and also
disagreed with the selection of the RBF Pilot Manager. It is to the team’s credit that they
were able to roll out the RBF pilot to all ten additional districts relatively smoothly, despite
the disruption within MOH caused by the transfer of some primary care functions to the
MCDMCH, and the corruption investigation and associated staff losses – including most
of the MOH officials who had been working with the Bank on the RBF pilot design and


                                              43
planning. There were some delays in paying the RBM salary bonus, and the change in the
way the quality adjustor was applied after the first year – adding it to the service total score
instead of multiplying it – meant that performance on quality could increase but not
decrease the total score. This removed any “stick” element and the powerful motivating
effect of loss aversion. Details on the pilot performance are provided in the technical and
process evaluations of the RBF pilot. The pilot served its important purpose of testing the
design and learning how to improve it, which carries strong weight in evaluating the
Implementing Agency performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
137. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory, weighing the satisfactory rating for Implementing
Agency performance, moderately satisfactory rating for Government performance, and
satisfactory rating for the project outcome. 

6. Lessons Learned

138. Malaria programs need to be nimble and react to surveillance data, because
malaria can change and resurge in response to climate variability and emerging resistance.
The GRZ made good decisions to adopt new technologies as they became available:
notably the switch to ACTs for treatment and broad use of IRS (by 2004, prior to the
project), and then adjusted the insecticides used for spraying in 2008 in response to
evidence of vector resistance. It is important to continue this timely uptake of new
technologies to ensure continued effective prevention and treatment despite the constant
threat of drug resistance. Diligent monitoring of ACT treatment effectiveness and quality
assurance for drugs to guard against counterfeits is also needed.

139. Effective disease control needs appropriate arrangements to ensure that
information is used strategically for decision making. The Zambia MBP made good use
of “gold-standard” MIS surveys, the costs of which may be well justified by the cost-
savings and/or improved outcomes that result from the appropriate use of the data. Well-
functioning routine health information services may be able to provide much of the data
needed, but the important operative phrase is “well-functioning”. In principle, effective
routine monitoring can quickly identify malaria outbreaks, trigger IRS if appropriate,
ensure that health facilities in the outbreak areas have enough diagnostic kits and drugs for
treatment, and alert households to sleep under insecticide-treated nets.

140. Behavior change interventions and community involvement are needed to
persuade households to actually use ITNs, know when to seek care and actually access care
when needed, but more work is needed to know how best to design and implement
interventions to achieve the needed behaviors. The MIS and DHS assessed the extent to
which ITNs were actually used by household members, and found significant gaps between
net ownership and use. For example, the 2007 DHS found that only about half of the nets
were actually used. Obviously, distribution of nets is not enough, and it made sense to
include a demand-side intervention. The COMBOR small grants program was intended to
elicit the needed behaviors, and was modelled on the existing successful AIDS small grants
program. However, more thought was needed about its design, implementation and



                                              44
monitoring. An effective grant program would need to give clear guidance about the
desired impact to grant applicants, and appropriately monitor grant results, neither of which
seem to have been done. The project indicator chosen was a crude input measure – the
percentage of districts that had at least one NGO/CBO receiving a COMBOR grant, and
cannot be used to assess the impact of the grants, or even whether there was a dose-response
(i.e. whether more grants in a district resulted in more use of nets). It is highly likely –
given global evidence – that the funds could have been better used for a community-health-
worker program focused on increasing knowledge and uptake of malaria prevention and
treatment interventions.

141. Interventions need to be implemented by people who understand their purpose
and have a vested interest in the outcome or have some other incentive to perform
well and appropriately monitor and assess impact. The initial decision to have the
CRAIDS team administer the small grants was logical – they had the relevant experience,
procedures and infrastructure (transport, etc.) and were already administering a large
number of similar grants across the country. It would have been costly and inefficient to
try and set up duplicate capacity in the NMCC. However, it would be unsurprising if the
AIDS team lacked motivation or understanding to ensure that the malaria grants were as
effective as the HIV grants. After the AIDS project closed and responsibility for COMBOR
was transferred to NMCC, the number of grants increased, but the GRZ did not ensure that
transport and other needed inputs were transferred with the responsibility, and the
weakness in the monitoring was not addressed.

142. A constructive response to corruption does not include draconian cuts in
funding to important time-sensitive programs like malaria control. Constructive
engagement with the country authorities to help fix problems achieves far more. The
Bank showed sound judgment in not suspending disbursement when the GRZ notified
donors that corruption had been discovered in the MOH. The total funds finally declared
by the Bank as subject to misprocurement was about US$0.3 million (much less than
initially thought, after extensive efforts to trace poorly-kept records). With Bank funds
accounting for about 11% of all funds for malaria control in 2009 (Table 1), if a similar
level of misprocurement occurred across all malaria funding, the estimated total affected
might be about US$2.7 million. This needs to be contrasted with the economic and welfare
loss from the increase in malaria cases and deaths that resulted from delayed planning and
procurement of needed inputs in reaction to the corruption findings. (Very crudely, each
child malaria death averted has welfare benefits of about US$160,000, so even 17 more
malaria deaths would yield a net welfare loss compared to the estimated total funding
affected by misprocurement). The Bank’s wise strategy was to work quickly and
determinedly with GRZ to fix procurement problems as best possible, while continuing to
fund malaria. The constructive approach by the Bank’s Integrity Office in working with
Zambia’s Corruption Commission and Office of the Auditor General was much appreciated.
This is a valuable lesson to donors whose reaction is to suddenly suspend or cancel planned
funding in response to discovery of corruption or other governance problems.

143. Results-based financing is complex to design and implement well, so it makes
a lot of sense to proceed in careful stages, and learn and adjust along the way. The



                                             45
project is a good example of a staged approach –it began with a pre-pilot in one district,
then a full pilot that included a limited set of outcomes and facilities and careful evaluation,
that could offer experience to use for a decision on whether to adopt the approach widely.

144. Realistic and effective results-based indicators are difficult to define, measure
and verify. The project is a reasonably successful example of: (i) objectives and
performance indicators that were carefully selected at the outset; (ii) an adequately
designed M&E system in place at the start of implementation; and (iii) careful pilot-testing
and adjustment. Even so, in retrospect it was found that several indicators were defined in
a way that made them complex to measure and verify. Not fully aligning the indicators
with routine data collection missed an opportunity for strengthening the HMIS, created
extra work for busy health workers, and made verification more time-consuming and
difficult. Some indicators chosen for the quality adjustment were not under the control of
the facility, and were “structural quality” factors, such as availability of a bed or specific
equipment. Indicators of quality of care that are determined by the health workers’ behavior
(such as diagnostic procedures performed, or appropriate treatment provided, or low drug
stock level reported) are likely to have much greater impact on service quality and health
outcomes.

Component 2: Community Malaria Booster Response (COMBOR)
Financing Source: IDA-41260 (Original Credit), IDA-48510 (Additional Financing Credit), TF-
91376 (Russian Trust Fund).

Carrying out a program of activities aimed at improving the capacity of local communities to
effectively prevent, control and treat malaria and deal with the demand-side constraints to
effective malaria control programming, based on community demand-driven interventions through
the provision of Community sub-grants: According to reports by the COMBOR team, by
December 2012, COMBOR had funded 530 subprojects; increasing from 52 funded community
projects spread across 27 out of 34 malaria prone districts in 2007 to 192 subprojects in 2010
covering all the 34 districts. By June, 2013, out of a target of 768, 69% (530) of the community
projects had been funded with 420 having completed implementation. A total of
US$3,460,158.37had been committed and US$2,608,868.74 had been disbursed, leaving a balance
of US$1,026,225.00. As at June 30th 2013, 96.9 percent of the disbursed resources had been
justified; a total of 128 District Facilitation Team members were trained in 10 districts of Eastern,
Northern, Luapula and Western Provinces to help improve the capacity of the districts to facilitate
project cycle activities for the sub projects; and a total of 238,2000 ITNs were distributed to
vulnerable populations (pregnant women, children under five years old, chronically ill patients)
through the 530 subprojects spread over 34 districts in the four targeted provinces as follows: (i)
Eastern: 71,600 ITNs; (ii) Western: 66,800 ITNs; (iii) Luapula 42,800 ITNs and (iv) Northern
57,000 ITNs.

The following types of interventions were funded:
   a) Environmental management which aimed at reducing malaria breeding sites by: (i) Filling
       soil or gravel into pot holes, pits, tunnels and quarries and any other man made water bodies
       to prevent stagnation of water (ii) Draining or unblocking of blocked drainage systems.
       (iii) Draining - by constructing open drainages and unblocking of canals and drainages,
       and (iv) Clearing and cleaning of surroundings near homes schools, hospitals etc. A total
       of 5,734 mosquito breeding sites were buried;


                                                 49
   b) Training in Key malaria messages: At least 6,238 community members were trained as
      trainers in key malaria messages with 719,432 community members (219,308 males and
      500,124 females) being sensitized on malaria key messages through drama, road shows,
      meetings etc. The number of community members reached was higher than reported as the
      numbers reached through dissemination of key messages through radio and television was
      not reported;
   c) Distribution of ITNs: between 2006 -2009, 38,720 ITNs were distributed to 170
      community projects located in 27 districts of the malaria prone provinces. (a) In August,
      2012, 238,200 ITNs were distributed to all the 34 districts in five malaria prone provinces.
      (b) The numbers distributed in 2013 were not properly recorded but the intention was to
      distribute at least 400 ITNs in each project area.
   d) Improving access to health care: 1,268 bicycles, 71 Ambulance Bicycles and 33
      motorbike Ambulances were procured across the 5 provinces and were being used to
      transport patients to health care facilities. The NMCC appreciated the impact the
      transportation had on reducing the disease burden for the communities as well as improving
      community case management.
   e) Income generating activities (IGAs) - supported by the COMBOR to empower
      communities with resources to sustain implementation of community preventive malaria
      interventions. Since 2006, 69 hammer mills, 35 retail trading posts, 34 farming units,
      15Ox-carts, and 12 other IGAs had been set up. Some of the IGA resources were ploughed
      back into the training of CHWs especially in terms of malaria diagnosis using RDTs,
      treatment or referral.

More Details on the Essential Medicines and Logistics Improvement Project (EMLIP)

After the 2008 MTR found that drug stock-outs were widespread in primary level facilities, the
MOH, in collaboration with the Bank, USAID and DfID, launched the Essential Medicines and
Logistics Improvement Project (EMLIP) in 2009as part of operational research on case
management. The goals were to learn how to resolve significant challenges in secondary
distribution and unavailability of drugs in facilities – in particular ACTs for malaria treatment. The
EMLIP reviewed different distribution models using a pull system to distribute drugs instead of
the push system traditionally used to distribute health kits. In addition to reducing the stock outs
at health facility level, pull systems generate drug use data which is vital for quantification and
decision making. The pilot program evaluation showed remarkable improvement in availability
and access to ACTs and other essential drugs in primary health facilities. A Policy Note informed
by the EMLPI prompted the GRZ to scale-up the model to 27 districts nationwide. However, the
expansion was hampered by central level stock outs of essential drugs. The EMLIP program
continued with funding from other partners, now supplemented with Bank funding under the new
HSIP.

To further enhance EMLIP, which was predominantly paper based, the Electronic Zambia
Inventory Control System (eZICS) was launched. The pilot was intended to: i) respond to
seasonal changes in demand and disease patterns; ii) determine optimal facility orders if MSL
stocks were low; iii) avoid the errors that occur in paper based or manual information systems. The
eZICS was to digitalize the supply chain system by using hand held devices (smart phones)
equipped with bar code scanners which record and transmit health facility data to a central
inventory control system. A specially developed software package (by IBM and London School
of Business) uses the information to calculate the ideal composition of the next shipment based on
available and pipeline stock, and historical consumption data that reflects seasonal trends. The
system design was completed in 2012 and ready to pilot in the three districts for a year. When the
Malaria Project ended in 2013, DfID continued to fund the pilot. If successful, eZICS could be
scaled up to other districts with expected benefits of efficiency, transparency (visibility) and
accountability in the storage, distribution and overall management of essential medicines in the
public sector.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Epidemiological Scenario:

1.      Although malaria control reduced deaths at all ages, the main outcome assessed is
reduction in child deaths below age 5, because this is a particularly vulnerable age group and makes
a very large contribution to DALYs. In 2006, the national HMIS recorded about 3,500 malaria
child deaths, which fell to approximately 2,100 child deaths from malaria by 2013. With the
reasonable assumption that the malaria program was responsible for the reduction, about 5,700
child deaths were averted in the baseline scenario. Taking into account the increase in child
population (about 17% during this time period) about 7,000 child deaths were averted. In the
scenario that a 20% decline would have occurred due to factors outside malaria control, then about
4,200 child deaths would have been averted.

Economic analyses
2.       The economic analyses suggest that the overall cost-benefit of the program and its cost-
effectiveness were favorable (see Table 1 below). The following assumptions are made: The child
malaria deaths averted were attributed to the overall malaria program (with scenarios of worsening
or improving child mortality as shown below). No specific attribution to IDA-financed inputs is
made as the national program was also supported by various other donors in a fully integrated way.
Second, every malaria death averted accounted for 95 disability-adjusted life years (DALY), based
on WHO’s data for these ratios for low-income countries. (Note that the estimated number of years
of life lost as a result of each death is approximately 31, hence the DALY estimate is plausible).
Third, benefits are calculated as either one or three times per capita income of US$1705 USD in
2014, as recommended by the Disease Control Priorities and the Copenhagen Consensus. Finally,
discount rates of 3% or 5% are used.

3.     The key results show that the baseline scenario yields a favorable cost-benefit calculation,
with $290 million in discounted spending yielding about US$2210 million in discounted benefits.
The cost-effectiveness ratios were also favorable at about US$500 to US$820 invested per DALY,
which is well below the suggested threshold of one times per capita in defining cost-effective
interventions.

4.     The favorable CBA and CEA arise mostly from the welfare benefits of reduced child
mortality. Although this analysis by necessity must make assumptions, the overall scenario that
each child death averted constitutes about US$160,000 in welfare gains is consistent with findings
from the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, and the Copenhagen Consensus.26

Fiscal scenario:

5.      A full fiscal impact is not undertaken here. The recurrent cost liability was modest,
particularly as IRS constitutes costly inputs, averaging about US$45 million/year, which is about
13% of the MOH annual budget over the period 2006- 2013. This suggests that ongoing donor

Annex 10. 2009 Corruption and Governance Actions in the Ministry of Health in
Zambia

1.     In June 2009, widespread corruption in the MOH was alleged and later
substantiated. A forensic audit led by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) of the
expanded basket funding concluded that funds from several Cooperating Partners (CP)
were affected. The government subsequently reimbursed the affected partners a total
amount of US$3.28 million. 32 MOH staff were suspended, 11 of whom and 2 individuals
working in the private sector, were prosecuted. To strengthen the weak internal control
environment exposed during the audit, the Government and CPs adopted a Governance
Action Plan (GAP). The government made significant progress in implementing the
proposed actions and as a result several donors restarted disbursements to the sector.

2.      Alerted by the outcome of the forensic audit, the Bank undertook a focused in-depth
financial transactions review of the MBP special account and project disbursements to the
pooled account. This review, completed in August 2010, identified ineligible expenditures
due to: a) fund transfers for which documentation could not be traced; b) duplicate
payments; and c) payments made to unauthorized accounts. The Ministry of Finance repaid
a total of US$1.3 million, under the original Credit. It was agreed that the OAG would
complete a reconciliation exercise of missing documentation to address other issues
flagged by the in-depth financial transaction review, and complete a forensic audit on the
balance of the special account. The Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) provided
necessary support to the OAG. After the final reconciliation in which more documents were
traced, the Bank reimbursed US$ 0.9 million of the US$1.3 million to the Government.

3.      In response to the corruption scandal, measures were taken to strengthen financial
management safeguards: (i) a financial management action plan was developed to
strengthen the fiduciary environment in the MOH and implemented in good time; (ii) An
Independent Fiduciary Review Agent (IFRA) was contracted to review all financial
management and procurement transactions and build capacity in the MOH teams; (iii)
World Bank supervision was intensified and the team composition strengthened; (iv) no
further IDA funding was provided through the pooled funding mechanism; and (v) direct
payments were encouraged. Furthermore, the Bank provided technical support for
implementing the joint Governance Action Plan (GAP) and for developing the Governance
and Management Capacity Strengthening Plan (2012-2016) for the sector.

4.       Additionally, the Additional Funding allocated project resources to strengthen
governance in the health sector. These funds were used to build capacity and strengthen
systems in Procurement, Financial and Internal Audit Management in the MOH.
Specifically, the Project provided resources for: (i) on the job and formal training (short
courses) to improve the skills of the Financial Management and Procurement teams; and
(ii) strengthening the Internal Audit Unit to increase operational efficiency. The latter
entailed providing resources to introduce quarterly post audit exercises and strengthening
the governance structures of the MOH Audit Committee; and (iii) the introduction of an
Integrity Committee within the MOH to promote demand side governance in resource
management in the health sector.

Annex 11. Complex Interaction between Malaria and Rainfall and Temperature

1.      Data were not available to be able to assess the impact of weather variations
(rainfall and temperature) on malaria trends during the project period. The relationship is
a complex one that varies across different ecological zones in Zambia. For example, in the
urban area Ndola, higher cumulative rainfall (for 2 months) is associated with an 0.1%
increase in malaria cases, a one degree increase in maximum temperature is associated with
a 6.1% decrease in malaria and a one degree increase in the minimum temperature is
associated with a 2.5% increase in malaria incidence. These relationships, however, depend
also on altitude and other factors, and cannot be simply applied across the country.

2.      Data from a Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessment27underway
in 2015 show the complex variability in the relationship between temperature, rainfall and
malaria. In Lusaka, between January 2010 and January 2014, malaria varied with weather,
but trended strongly down. In the arid zone of Sesheke, there was an extremely bad malaria
season in 2012 apparently unrelated to rain and temperature, a complete outlier compared
to the usual seasonal peaks that follow rainfall patterns.

             (Urban) - Lusaka                                             Arid - Sesheke




27
  This analysis by a team of experts in health, climate change, and meteorology, aims to better understand
vulnerability to climate variability and climate change of different regions and populations in
Zambia, the likely impact on health outcomes and how this will affect demand for health services. The
data presented here are taken from a power point presentation delivered in Zambia in November 2015.

                                                    60
3.      In rural Lundazi, malaria tracks rainfall closely but the number of cases has also
increased over the years covered in these data (note, however, that these are total cases, not
per 100,000 people). By contrast, in the highland Mpika area, malaria cases are present
year round, even in the dry season, but annual malaria surges also track rainfall, with no
clear trend over 2010-2014, but a particularly severe malaria season in 2013. The “take-
away” message is that any assessment to separate the role of rainfall and temperature on
malaria from that of the malaria program would require data and analysis that are well
beyond the scope of an ICR.

Annex 12: RBF Description, and Technical Review SummaryFindings and
Recommendations

Pilot RBF project in Zambia: summary description

1.      The RBF pilot contracted with primary health care facilities, (i.e. rural health
centers and health posts) to pay facilities an agreed amount per unit of service delivered
for a specified package of predominantly essential maternal and child health services,.
Hospitals (and urban health centers) were not included in the reward scheme, as the
intention of the pilot was to particularly strengthen rural health services. Eligible facilities
in ten (+ 1, i.e. Katete) districts in nine provinces across the country were targeted.

2.     The RBF pilot was implemented through a (innovative) “contracting in”
arrangement mainly managed from within the public health sector. The implementing
entity was the Program Implementation Unit (PIU), which had a national office and
technical experts stationed in the provinces in which the pilot districts are located. Steering
Committees at provincial and district levels with specified tasks and responsibilities were
set up, District Health Offices were contracted to undertake supervisory functions
including data verification; referral hospitals were contracted to do quarterly quality of care
assessments at RBF intervention facilities.

3.       The project focused on strengthening performance of lower level, rural health
facilities to effectively deliver a set of highly relevant maternal and child health services of
adequate/high quality. Nine categories of services were incentivized for quantity and
quality of service delivery. Design and operational features of the RBF pilot were
documented in an extensive Project Implementation Manual (PIM) with a large number of
annexes detailing e.g. procedures, reporting formats, etc. Indicators were selected and
described in detail in the PIM; most but not all the indicators were part of the MOH Health
Management Information System (HMIS). Health facilities declared the services they
provided each month, their declaration was verified/audited by the District Community
Medical Office (DCMO) each month.

4.      The RBF pilot was largely a supply-side intervention focusing on promoting
delivery of quality services. Nevertheless demand-side provisions are feasible as
contracted facilities were free to use their RBF benefits to finance incentive packages to
patients or volunteers in order to boost their performance. Payments of RBF benefits were
made to contracted health facilities on the basis of (i) “fee for service” against verified
performance in terms of quantity of services delivered for 9 output indicators and (ii) the
quality of services provided as per quarterly quality of care audits. Remote facilities
received an additional 25% top-up to compensate for the demanding circumstances in
which they operate.

5.      Health facilities were to a certain extent autonomous in deciding how to use the
RBF benefits accrued. They compiled – in close collaboration with the health center
committees – so called business plans. These plans aimed at a continuous improvement of
service delivery, through (i) motivation packages for health workers intended to improve
their productivity and the quality of their work, and (ii) improvements in service facilities
(buildings, equipment, essential drugs) and (iii) improvements in service delivery (e.g.
strengthening outreach services). The presumption was that the supplementary RBF funds
and their targeted use would lead to greater uptake of primary health care services by the
population if services were of higher quality and delivered by more motivated health
workers. This in turn was expected to lead to better health outcomes, particularly in
maternal and child health.

6.     The evaluation design was an important feature of the RBF pilot. Three districts
were selected from each province (except Lusaka), as similar as possible in district health
administrative capacity, district population health service outcomes, and levels of district
population living standards. The three districts from each province were randomly assigned

                                             63
to one of three treatment arms. The intervention arm (RBF districts) facilities received a
comprehensive package of RBF features and RBF funding based on performance; (ii)
control 1 (C1) district facilities received the package of essential equipment and similar
amounts of additional funding on average as in the intervention district, but without RBF
features, and (iii) “business as usual” control 2 (C2) districts received neither additional
RBF funding nor RBF features. This allowed for an impact evaluation to try to disentangle
the effect of the RBF approach from the effect of providing additional funding to facilities.

7.      In order not to hinder the impact evaluation, the design of the RBF project was
basically kept intact for the duration of the pilot. A few changes were considered necessary,
of which the most prominent were (i) annual contracting of facilities (rather than quarterly),
(ii) changing the formula and prices for calculating benefits (initially the quantity score
was multiplied by the quality score so that a quality score below 1 would reduce the
payment, in the second year the quality score was added to the quantity score so could
increase but not decrease the total payment earned; and (iii) the maximum percentage of
the total RBF payment that could be given to staff as incentives (rather than being invested
in service delivery improvements) was increased from 60% to 75%.

8.       The evaluation design included baseline and endline surveys of households and
facilities. The household surveys covered some 3000 households in 310 communities.
Questions covered socio-economic items, general health seeking behavior, MCH-related
service utilization and perceived quality of those services. The health facility surveys
covered approximately 210 primary health facilities serving the same communities covered
in the household surveys. The facility surveys record physical conditions, staffing, services,
and innovations. Health worker interview solicited motivation and health knowledge.
Patient exit interviews asked questions about socio-economic background, actions of the
health worker just seen, and patient satisfaction with the services just received. In addition,
there a Process Evaluation, a Detailed Technical Review and a study of the impact on
Human Resources were completed (the latter two after the end of the project).

Technical Review of the Pilot Results

9.       At the end of the second year, an independent team of 3 consultants (2 were
Zambian nationals living in Zambia) was hired to do a Technical Review of the pilot and
its results. In addition to analyzing all data collected during the pilot, the team undertook a
field visit over 21 days in August and September 2014, visiting three provinces, six districts
(3 intervention and 3 C1) and 18 health centers (9 in RBF districts and 9 in C1 districts),
and interviewed MOH staff and steering committees at provincial and district level, and
people at referral hospitals that had conducted quality assessments.

   10.     The sample size was small:
    9 (4.7%) of 191 health centers in RBF districts, in 3 of 10 districts in 10 provinces
    9 (5.1%) of 175 health centers in C1 district, in 3 of 10 districts in 10 provinces
    0 of the 166 C2 health centers (very brief visit to Mpongwe District only).
   Moreover, the time available per visit to a facility was never more than two to three hours
   due to long travel distances.

   11.    The team collected qualitative and quantitative information, which was triangulated
   where feasible and relevant. Their Terms of Reference covered eight areas. The report
   team’s summary findings and recommendations were organized by eight areas:

           (i) The RBF pilot design

                  The eligibility criteria used mainly referred to staffing levels at the start of
           the pilot.

                  The pricing arrangement was based on nine indicators with prices per unit
           of service. The unit prices were not based on actual cost of delivering the service,
           but on attributes such as relative priority of the indicator and effort required to
           produce one additional unit of service.

                 The pilot addressed needs of rural communities which are disadvantaged in
           terms of access to services and hence had an indirect (positive) impact on the poor.

                 Purchasing arrangements were in place, i.e. contracting facilities for a set of
           services with a fee per unit of service and payment against verified performance.



                                                 65
           Business plans were seen to encourage health facilities to perform in a
    businesslike manner, and target investments of RBF income earned to unmet public
    health needs. Although all facilities had such plans, there was room for further
    strengthening of the situation analyses and translating these into action plans. The
    team found different planning instruments in use that should be harmonized and
    combined.

          Quality of care assessments were done quarterly by contracted hospitals,
    using a standard checklist and scoring card. There were significant and consistent
    improvement in quality performance. The quality instrument could be improved
    and harmonized and combined with another performance assessment tool found in
    many facilities.

   Internal verification: districts verified facility health records monthly to enhance
    the accuracy of these records, part of which was used to determine RBF payments.
    There appeared some room for improvement here.

    (ii) RBF institutional arrangements

          Health Centre Committee seemed to have received a boost due to the RBF,
    helping community engagement and ownership.

          District and Provincial Steering Committees and District Medical Officers
    have taken leadership in the project. At the national level this was less profound.
    Unlike in other countries, the Project Implementation Unit, being MOH associated,
    has been self-managing the pilot.

          The RBF institutional arrangements seemed to be superimposed on other
    health system management arrangements. This needs attention if the project is
    scaled up.

    (iii)RBF supervision an M&E arrangements

           The pilot gave significant attention to data entries and processing, in order
    to improve accuracy which is partly related to RBF benefits offered to health
    centers.

           The main challenge was the fact that the definitions of some indicators used
    in the pilot differed from the standards in HMIS. This impacted on some of the data
    processing arrangements and also affected data accuracy.

    (iv) RBF budgeting and financial accountability arrangements

           By and large, the pilot adhered to fundamental accounting procedures.
    Nevertheless, facilities were found to have limited accounting skills thereby
    creating room for oversights.

                                         66
           The mechanism of RBF dues calculation appeared to function adequately.
    However, outpatient visits and family planning contributed the largest share in
    overall earnings, while some other essential elements in Maternal Newborn Health
    Care (MNCH) had quite a minimal share. It seemed plausible that the definition of
    some indicators impacted on the volume of services qualifying for RBF payments.

            Per capita payments have increased significantly over the lifetime of the
    pilot in all districts. There is significant variation in per capita payments across
    facilities and districts. It is quite plausible that per capita calculations are affected
    by unreliable CSO data.

           RBF funding proved much more significant and reliable than GRZ income.

           RBF funds were generally used in line with PIM instructions and generally
    in line with the business plans with a focus on MNCH promotion.

           Control 1 district practice with regard to RBF utilization varied, i.e. whether
    the facilities were given the funds or whether the funds were spent centrally. Funds
    appeared to be designated to promoting (outreach and facility based) MNCH.
    Accountability arrangements, however, were found to be minimal or absent.

    (v) RBF and effects on health facility performance
          The RBF pilot appeared to have stimulated uptake in quantity of services,
    with variations per indicator, possibly mainly related with indicator definition as
    mentioned above.

            The uptake in non-incentivized services increased positively too, with RBF
    districts outperforming control 1 and control 2 districts, which saw varying levels
    of improvement.

          The quality of care score seemed to have increased significantly across the
    board with average scores in the final quarter standing at 82%.

    (vi) RBF and the performance of district and provincial medical offices
          A checklist is used in assessing DMO performance. The scores are generally
    high due to the design of the assessment tool (which is mainly a check list).

           Hospitals assigned to monitor quality of care seem to have taken the task
    seriously.

    (vii)   RBF and overall health system performance

   RBF appeared to stimulate health system performance, i.e. particularly the
    provision and uptake of quality primary health care services including MNCH.



                                           67
      Some facilities receive NGO support which is complementary but not yet
       embedded in the RBF approach.

       (viii) Other issues emerging from the review

      There seemed to be an opportunity for stimulating health sector performance by
       focusing on demand stimulation/creation.

      Deliver of Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care Equipment to intervention and
       control 1 districts was delayed.

      The way medical waste is handled needs urgent attention. Health centers were seen
       using open pits for burning waste and even used pit latrines for deposing placentas.

      There seems to be an unmet need for guidance to facilities on infrastructure projects,
       including maternity waiting facilities.

Conclusions and recommendations

12.    In summary the RBF pilot demonstrated the relevance of RBF in promoting
delivery of more and better primary health care services and so strengthened overall health
system performance. The basic design has proved its feasibility, institutional arrangements
by and large performed, same as supervision and M&E arrangements, as well as budgeting
and financial accountability arrangements. These conclusions provide a major argument
for continuing the RBF approach and expanding the area covered. The review team
provided arguments that there was even potential for performing even better.

13.    Some critical observations on the details of the approach translate into
recommendations for, e.g., the selection of indicators, their definition, pricing
arrangements, allocation of funds for different purposes, etc. Moreover there are main
issues regarding harmonizing RBF management tools with crucial health system
management tools, such as action plans, performance assessments and HMIS. If these are
dealt with it may be expected that a successor RBF project will deliver even better results.
