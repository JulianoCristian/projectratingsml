                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project was restructured on July 23, 2014 to extend the closing date for three months from July 31, 2014 to October 31, 2014 and reallocate across expenditure categories in
                         order to close out remaining activities well. Specifically, these remaining activities include: (i) the client’s implementation completion report, (ii) a technical evaluation of the RBF Pilot
                         which complements the Impact Evaluation and (iii) the final payment of the health facility incentives. The Project will close on October 31, 2014.
