{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Malaria Booster and\n            Health Results Based Financing Project for Zambia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: malaria\n            programs need to be nimble and react to surveillance data,\n            because malaria can change and resurge in response to\n            climate variability and emerging resistance. Effective\n            disease control needs appropriate arrangements to ensure\n            that information is used strategically for decision making.\n            Behavior change interventions and community involvement are\n            needed to persuade households to actually use insecticide\n            treated bed nets (ITNs), know when to seek care and actually\n            access care when needed, but more work is needed to know how\n            best to design and implement interventions to achieve the\n            needed behaviors. Interventions need to be implemented by\n            people who understand their purpose and have a vested\n            interest in the outcome or have some other incentive to\n            perform well and appropriately monitor and assess impact. A\n            constructive response to corruption does not include\n            draconian cuts in funding to important time-sensitive\n            programs like malaria control. Constructive engagement with\n            the country authorities to help fix problems achieves far\n            more. Results-based financing is complex to design and\n            implement well, so it makes a lot of sense to proceed in\n            careful stages, and learn and adjust along the way.\n            Realistic and effective results-based indicators are\n            difficult to define, measure, and verify."}, "docdt": "2016-02-19T23:50:01Z"}
