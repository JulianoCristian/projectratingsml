satisfactory, project sustainability\n            was likely, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: flexibility is crucial to respond to fragile and\n            evolving situations, to allow fine tuning the program and\n            address issues not fully identified at the outset. However,\n            close Bank supervision is required for program\n            implementation to benefit from such flexibility,-and\n            performance criteria must be tailored to meet\n            country-specific conditions. In SAC II this allowed to\n            ensure that, although later than originally envisaged,\n            program objectives were substantially met. Selectivity and\n            realism are essential aspects of program design when\n            institutional capacity is weak and the reform agenda is\n            vast. In such situations there is a need to define a\n            hierarchy of reforms and identify those that must proceed\n            simultaneously. Poorly targeted and overly ambitious\n            programs may unnecessarily prolong the implementation\n            period. Donor coordination is vital to avoid conflicting\n            messages, inefficient use of development aid, and\n            over-stretching the Government's weak capacity.\n            Consensus among donors about the reform agenda is important\n            right from the beginning, to encourage greater partnership."}, "docdt": "1995-06-21T00:00:00Z"}
