Productive\n            Partnerships Support Project for Colombia is to generate\n            income, create employment, and promote social cohesion of\n            poor rural communities in an economic and environmentally\n            sustainable manner through the development and\n            implementation of a demand-driven, productive partnership\n            scheme with the private sector. There are two main project\n            components. The first component finances technical\n            assistance and training for activities associated with\n            information sharing, mobilization and screening of interest,\n            pre-investments, ex-ante evaluation of detailed productive\n            partnership sub-project proposals, and studies. The second\n            component supports the implementation of productive\n            partnerships by financing 1) cost sharing transfers as a\n            financial incentive for participating small farmers producer\n            organizations; and 2) technical assistance and training to\n            productive partnership participants. The third component,\n            project management, includes the operation of a management\n            information system, and the design and implementation of\n            monitoring, evaluation, and learning arrangements."}, "docdt": "2001-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
