of the\n            Productive Partnerships Support Project for Colombia were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was significant, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: sufficient\n            attention needs to be paid to the needs of both farmers and\n            buyers. Revolving credit mechanisms in rural areas should be\n            designed in line with the capacity of the user. Producer\n            alliances require a differentiation in design that takes\n            into account trust, relationships, and maturity to determine\n            the level of value added that a productive partnership\n            project is likely to generate. Productive partnership\n            projects are more likely to succeed when they are part of an\n            integrated rural development approach."}, "docdt": "2015-10-26T23:27:01Z"}
