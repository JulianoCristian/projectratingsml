satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: such\n            development objectives as increase income and employment\n            should be kept as the 'contribution of the project to\n            higher level development objectives of the country.'\n            Hence, the objectives of the second project are to increase\n            competitiveness, entrepreneurship and sustainability of\n            partnerships, and producer associations. Such outcomes can\n            be credited directly to the project. As a remedy, the\n            follow-up project introduced time saving measures such as a\n            framework insurance policy covering all future partnerships.\n            It delegates more responsibility to the regional level and\n            to the partners for the pre-investment studies and\n            partnership structuring, shortening the preparation cycle.\n            The results, up to the time of this ICR preparation are\n            encouraging. Although identifying skilled people to prepare\n            partnership feasibility studies remains a challenge. Poor\n            feasibility studies usually result in delays and other\n            problems (often requiring restructuring) during\n            implementation. The gradual reduction in the complexity of\n            the studies while focusing on the essentials and\n            particularly on risks diminished implementation delays and\n            eliminated non-viable partnerships from the onset. Perennial\n            crops that require some medium-term investment are not very\n            suitable for poor farmers, as they do not have the financial\n            capacity to maintain those crops over the years before\n            seeing the financial results."}, "docdt": "2009-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
