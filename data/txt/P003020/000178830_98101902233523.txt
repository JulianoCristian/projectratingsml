INTEERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Ab5OCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXBCUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
ZAIRE FOR THE THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Zaire for the equivalent of US$26
million on standard IDA terms for a Third Highway Project.
PART I - THE ECONCOMY
2.        A Basic Economic Mission visited Zaire in April-May of 1974, and
it is expected that its report will be issued in April of this year. The
conclusions of the mission are summarized in this report. The most recent
report on the economy of Zaire is dated March 5, 1973, "Recent Economic
Developments and Prospects of the Republic of Zaire" (EA-31a, ? vol.). A
Country Data Sheet is attached Annex I.
3.        Zaire is a potentially rich country because of its mineral, agri-
cultural and energy resources. It is also one of the poorest in terms of
per capita income. Few countries have suffered as much disruption and chaos
as did Zaire in the first 6-7 years of its independence.  Political order and
stability were established in 1967 and only then did the Government of Zaire
take a number of measures for economic stabilization and reform. These measures
included devaluation of the national currency, increases in import and export
taxes, steps toward the organization and centralization of the government budget,
and a tightening of the Bank of Zaire's control over foreign transactions and
the banking system. The copper company, Union Mini6re du Haut-Katanga, was
nationalized and a new government-owned company, Gecamines, was formed.
Compensation for this and external debts owed to Belgium were settled; and
in 1969, an Investment Code was promulgated giving sizeable tax incentives
to foreign and domestic investment.  In November 1973, the Government initiated
new measures to place the economy more fiinly in national hands by transferring
small and medium size commercial and agricultural enterprises from foreign to
Zairian ownership.
ti.       Subsequent to the 1967-68 measures the country' s economic performance
improved dramatically: GDP grew by 10-11 percent (in real terms) annually in
1967-70; Government savings rose to US$ 110 million in 1970, compared to
a deficit in 1966, while cpital expenditures increased considerably.



-2-
Zaire's resource surplus grew from $15 million in 1966-67, to $60 million
in 1969-70. These favorable developments were due, in part, to rising
copper prices which increased by over 25 percent between 1967 and 1970
and to increases in copper production which rose from 317,000 tons in 1966
to 385,000 tons in 1970  and to h75,000 tons in 1973.    The  recovery
of 1967-70 was helped by the availability of unused capacity, in industry
and transport, which had survived destruction and deterioration in the
early 1960's.
5.        Between 1970 and 1973 GDP growth slowed down to an annual rate
of 5.5 percent due to lower average copper prices and a decline in unused
capacity. Growth continued in manufacturing, government services and
other sectors tha-t depend on copper revenues, but agriculture declined
in terms of exports and more generally in terms of production. The con-
tinuing decline in plantation agriculture has probably been the single
most important factor causing the massive rural exodus which is swelling
city population, whose growing food requirements have had to be met by
imports. The major economic problem of Zaire is that despite considerable
agricultural and forestry resources the growth of agriculture has lagged
far behind that of the other sectors. Consequently Zaire's economic
development is based narrowly on mining - principally copper - and thus
is subject to fluctuations in world market conditions.
6.        The Government stated at the last Consultative Group Meeting
(November 1973) that it expected a 6 percent rate of growth. In the ab-
sence of a development plan or a comprehensive investment program, it is
not certain that this target can be achieved. It is not, however, out of
line with past performance. In fact, an analysis of the major projects
under implementation, particularly in mining, suggests that the average
growth rate for 1974-80 could be somewhat higher than 6 percent with only
slight improvements in present performance and policies. Given the
physical resource endowment of the country, this growth target is not
high, but given the problems the country faces in managing its development,
the question is whether it can utilize this growth to lay a sound foun-
dation for long-term, balanced development.
7.        The Government faces a major problem of insufficient management
capacity which has been made acute by its policy of increasing national
control over the country's resources. The pursuit of this objective started
in the mid-1960's, with the nationalization of Union Miniere and culminated
in November 1973 with the transfer to Zairian ownership, i.e., mostly to
individuals, of foreign-owned plantations, and retail and wholesale trade.
A recent Government statement, December 30, 1974, tndicates that this policy
is being modified in favor of state owniership. Nevertheless, many of those
who contributed to the management of the economy have left the country.
Despite this, the Government remains basically committed to cooperation with
foreign capital. It wants, however, to carry out this cooperation on new
bases, implying a decrease in foreign influence and a greater role for
Zairian nationals in management positions. This is supported by the fact
that investments made under the 1969 Investment Code were not affected by
either the nationaljzation (Zairianization) measures of 1973, or by the most
recent December 30 statement of Government policy.



-3-
8.        uiirthermore, the Government has thus far not succeeded in formulating
a consistent, wfell designed investment program and in mobilizing sufficient
local resources to implement it. This is due in part to limitations on trained
manrpower which are greatest at the middle and lower echelons. This deficiency
mafes econoLmic decision making and execution difficult. As a result, govern-
ment acTLnistration tends to be inefficient, centralized and unduly reliant on a
few individuals.  Tbis situation is, however, improving.   Eirollment in higher
education has grown from virtually nil in 1960 to 16,000 in 1973 and in secondxry
education from 34,000 in 1960 to 308,000 in 1973. A planning team in the Office
of the President reclrited by the Bank and funded by UNDP, should make a substantial
contribution to improved economic management by providing the necessary analysis,
perspectives and coordination.
9.        I'ost domestic investment takes place in State-owned enterprises which
produce most of the country's industrial output. They are usually organized
as comnercial enterprises, but owing to limited availability of management
resources and lack of overall planning, they do not always operate efficiently.
When objectives are clearly defined and adequate priority is accorded to them,
good results are obtained. This is shown by the excellent performance of Gecamines
and KDL, the Railway Company serving it.
10.       Another major constraint for Zaire has been its inability to
maintain domestic savings at their previous high level: gross domestic savings
fell from about 27 percent in 1968-69 to about 21 percent in 1973 due largely
to a deterioratiorn in tlhe Government's current budget. Govelrnment current
expenditures grew at an annual rate of 17 percent during the 1969-73 period,
while revenues went up by only 15 percent. In 1971 and 1972, when copper prices
and government revenues fell, the Government succeeded in checking the growth of
expenditures by freezing government employment and wages. In 1973, however,
as copper prices improved, current expenditures rose by 33 percent, faster than
revenues which rose by about 25 percent. There are indications that the 1974
results will be similar to those of 1973, but this will be due mainly to the
payment of subsidies to the State-owned petroleum importing company (SOZIR) in
order to finance its deficit resulting from higher oil prices. In the second half
of 197L prices of goods and services marketed by state owned entities (including
petroleum) have been raised, some of them very substantially. Budget performance
may therefore improve in 1975.
11.       Government revenues are closely linked to foreign trade, especially
copper exports which provide over 40 percent of total tax revenues, and are,
therefore, very dependent on fluctuations in world copper prices. This is
accentuated by the fact that export taxes on copper are progressive with
respect to prices. .Scope for increased revenues is also limited as current
revenue is already about 24 percent of GDP. Any improvement in public savings
will call for restraint in government current expenditure.

US 235 Bmillion a ye:)r :;,nd for 1973  are estimated to have been about US$325
;illion. About 62 nHercen,t of this wais provided by- loan dissbursements, one
thlir  by, direct foreign investment and the balance was assured by grants.
On the averaege, Z.a;ire hlas received bilateral ass:istance of USA85 m illion per

(usR;32 mJi1lli.on a year), follotvcd by the EEC (US$17t million a year), and
USAILI (US:0-2 million).  Tlwo thirds of aid disbursements were for technical.
assistance and scholarships.
15.       Data on Zairets external debt are incomplete. The last Bank
econormic mission estimated that exiten-al debt, including undisbursed,
rray have increased in 1-973 by $660 maillion, with outstanding conmmitments
at the end of the year reaching $1,bOO milliorn. The disbursed portion of
this debt was, at the end of 1973, about US $800 million.  The average
grmit clement in the outstanding debt is estimated at about 25 percent.
Capital inflows are expected to grow from US$355 million in 1972 to about US1700
million in 1980. The increase of the annual average for 1974-80 over the
1970-72 period would be about 30 percent in real ternms and 150 percent in
current tems. In order to assure this level of loan disbursements, some
US $3, 200 mlillion in Inow commitments would be needed for 1973-80, or about
US $460  i'llion annual.ly.
16.       External debt service payments which were estimated at about US $80.
million in 1973, are expected to rise to US $355 Million in 1977 and to about
US $1490 m.llion in 1980. T1he debtv; service ratio would rise fromr about 6
percentin i1973 to a peak of about 17 percent in 1977, when many loans
contracted in 1972-73 start to mature. The ratio would probably stabilize
around 15-16 percent in the 1930's. Although on the average, the debt
service level should be manageable, the economy will remain vulnerable to
copper price fluctuations sirne c pnper exports will be about 70 percent of
total export earnings in 19&Q, conpared to 65 percent in 1973. The Bank of
Zaire reserves amounted to $150 mi:llion at the end of October 1974i, represen-
ting a little less than one and a half m.onths of imports of goods and services.
These reserves were cowIn by $8'0 million com-pared to the level at the end of
1973.



17.      Apart from copper Zaire has potentially an abundant supply of
many commodities for which shortages are expected elsewhere in the world:
electrical energy, tropical woods, many agricultural products, and several
minerals. Recent discoveries of oil will in the next few years enable
zaire to satisfy its internal needs. It may also become a minor exporter
of petroleum towards the end of the 1970's, although the above projections
do not take this possibility into account.
PART II - BANK GROXJP OPERATIONS IN ZAIRE
18.       Since 1969 Zaire has received eight IDA credits totalling US$72
million for transport, development finance company operations, agriculture
and education projects. Recently, the first Bank loan to Zaire, since
independence, a $100 million loan for the Gecamines Mining Expansion Project
was approved by the Executive Directors. The Bank has also extended grants
totalling US$400,000 as a contribution toward the cost of two planning
assistance missions in Zaire. Until now, Bank Group assistance to Zaire has
been small compared to the needs of the country. The main limiting factor has
been the inadequate project preparation and implementation capability of the
Government, but this constraint is slowly being overcome.   We plan to invite
the Government, in the near future, to negotiate a US$26 million credit for a
Second Rail/River Project.  Thru the cofinancing arrangements for the Gecamines
Project, the Bank Group took a major step toward assuring that other external
capital assistance for Zaire is effectively directed toward high priority
projects. The IFO, which has a US$760,000 participation in SOFIDE, the local
development finance company, is also making a major effort to identify pro-
jects in Zaire suitable for its financing.
19.       Disbursements on past IDA credits have been slow and amount to only
about US$25 million to date. Project implementation has also been slow due
primarily to the country's inadequate supply of trained manpowcL and management
capacity. For example, execution of the First Education Project(1972) was
delayed because of administrative weakness and cost overruns are now probable.
Also, the technical assistance component of the Second Highway Project (1972)
was poorly implemented and the civil works are only now getting started due to
the shortage of experienced local personnel difficulties in recruiting key
expatriate experts, delays in procurement and in the implementation of organi-
zational reforms. On the other hand, certain autonomous entities which have
benefited from IDA credits, the Development Finance Company, the National
Livestock Development Authority and the National Transport Authority are aji
executing IDA-financed projects in an acceptable manner.   Annex IT contains a
summary statement of IDA credits and lEC investments as of December 31, -1974,
and notes on the status of ongoing projects.



- 6 -
20.       It should be recognized, however, that a main objective of Bank Group
operations in Zaire has been institution-building, thus slow project implemen-
tation may be expected. A Zairian DFC, the Societ6 Financiere de Developpement
(SOFIDE), was established with assistance from IFC and IDA. The River Transport
Project helped strengthen the agencies concerned with waterways, i.e., the
Office National des Transports (ONATRA), the Regie des Voies Fluviales (RVF),
and the Regie des Voies Maritimes (RVM). The First and Second Highway Projects
provided technical assistance to establish and operate the Bureau of Roads. The
Education Project included a manpower survey to furnish data for a review of the
educational system, and the Livestock Project helped establish the National
Livestock Developnent Authority which has since acquired responsibilities beyond
the project area.
21.       The Bank Group's main effort is directed towards assisting in the
rehabilitation and improvement of transport, agriculture and education,all
high priority sectors in which the Bank Group should be able to make a
contribution to institution-building. This concentration should assist the
Government to design and implement appropriate policies in these critical
sectors. In most projects, this will mean providing for transitional
technical assistance and training. We are also preparing projects in popu-
lation, industry, water and power.
22.       Lack of transport is the major physical impediment to the country's
developiment. The Government has placed considerable emphasis on the improvement
of' the country's river/rail arterial network and the Association is helping to
finance both studies and new investments designed to extend and improve this
system. At the same time, roads are essential for inter-regional
commerce, and as a feeder network for the development of agriculture. Agricul-
ture has received insufficient attention from the Government. This situation
must be corrected if the Government expects to stabilize the rural populatiDn
and to let it share in some of the economic and social advantages enjoyed    by
the urban population. In agriculture, preference must be given in the short
run to increasing agricultural production, including the development of large
scale plantations, while the capacity to implement rural development projects is
established in the Government. In education, there is a need for reform of the
curricIlum and emphasis on non-formal and vocational education, especially agri-
cultural training. In this area, and in population as well, our purpose will be to
assist the Governmernt in Iramilrg appropriate policies uhrough project foririu-
lation. In industry, we propose to continue our support f'or the local Develop-
ment Finance Company (SOFIDE). In both water and power, our assistance would
toe directed toward assuring oroader access to these facilities and strengthening
the executing agencies.
23.       An expansion of the Bank Group's activities in Zaire will be possible
only if substantial efforts toward improving the country's economic management
are initiated and sustained progress is achieved. Considering the state of
disintegration within the country in the early 1960s, the political and economic
cohesion attained since then has been remarkable.   However, the lack of a compre-
hensive investmrient plan, the rapid rise in public expenditures and external
borrowings, and the insufficient allocation of resources to agriculture are serious
problems which have to be promptly corrected iI the overall economic potential



- 7 -
ot the country is to be realizeci.  The Governmeat is aware of the pressing
need to take corrective action. A Planning Team of eight experts, financed by
the UNDP and recruited by the Bank, has started work in the Office of the Presi-
dent, advising on key problems of tlhe economy and assisting the Government in
preparing an investment plan and establishing more appropriate budget and borrow-
ing procedures. This team has been very favorably received by the Government
and should be able to make a substantial contribution.
2h.       Another step that will help the Bank monitor developments in Zaire
in general and progress toward the short term improvement mentioned in the
preceding paragraph in particular is the expansion of the Bank's Resident
Mission in Zaire. The Mission now has six professional staff, including the
division chief, two loan officers, an agricultural expert and two transportation
experts. A senior economist will join the Mission in the-near future.
PART III - TRANSPORT IN ZAIRE
25.      Compared to most other African countries, Zaire, prior to
independence, had a relatively well developed transport system, based mainly
on the country's natural net-work of rivers and lakes, most of which are
navigable all year around. In addition to about 14,000 km of waterways,
Zaire has approximately 5,000 km of railways (essentially extensions of water-
ways or by-passes of their non-navigable portions); 140,000 km of roads;
one outlet to the sea and 70 river or lake ports. Except in the north-
east where roads constituted the main transport system, the road network
served as a feeder network for the rail/river trunk system. This is reflected in
Zaire's relatively low road density to total area and the fact that only
about 2,000 km of roads are paved.
26.       The Zaire and Kasai Rivers, with their tributaries and several lakes,
provide navigable waterways serving most parts of the country. The most important
river ports are Kinshasa, on the Zaire River, and Ilebo on the Kasai River, which
are key rail-river trans-shipment points on the Voie Nationale. In 1973, river
traffic upstream plus downstream amounted to 1.1 million tons of which 55 percent,
including all copper passing through Zairian territory, uses the Kasai River.
Zaire's rail network comprises five systems. Ownership and control have, until
recently, been divided amongst public and private agencies, but the Government
has recently consolidated all of the lines into a single Government-owned
national railway company.
27.       During the 1960s, much of this transport system deteriorated.
Transport infrastructure was left unmaintained, and practically no new
investment took place. The road system suffered the most. Even more
significantly, the agencies responsible for transport disintegrated as
expatriates departed in large numbers, while few Zairian replacements
were available.



- 8 -
28.       Governmental responsibility for transport in Zaire is shared by
two ministries. Responsibility for roads rests with the Department of Public
Works while responsibility for road transport, railways, waterways, and civil
aviation lies with the Department of Transport and Communications. Within
the Department of Public Works, the Bureau of Roads, established in 1971,
with assistance from IDA and UNDP, has primary responsibility for road planning,
construction and maintenance. Road transport is the domaine mainly of private
operators, and rail/river transport is managed by a number of autonomous public
agencies, the largest of them, the National Transport Office (ONATRA), also
controls over 90 of domestic waterborne traffic. Presently, these agencies
are staffed with a large number of expatriates and the Government wishes to
train national staff. as rapidly as possible, to eliminate the need for
technical assistance.
29.      An inadequate road system is a major constraint to Zaire's develop-
ment, particularly agricultural developmernt. Since 1968, when the Bank's first
economic mission visited Zaire, the need for rehabilitation of the system
has been recognized as a priority both by the Bank and the Government. Due
to the enormous distances separating the country's major mineral and agricul-
tural areas from the sea (e.g. a distance of 2,750 km from Lubumbashi, capital
of the mineral rich region of Shaba, to the Atlantic port of Matadi), an effi-
cient transport system is vital if Zairian copper and agricultural products
are to compete  in world markets.      The economic, social and political
integration of the country is also heavily dependent on transport, the present
condition of which constitutes a serious obstacle to the flow of goods and
persons between urban and rural areas.
30.       The agencies responsible for transport lack adequate planning staf'
and there is no overall coordination of the Government's investments.
Nevertheless, the Government has certain major objectives for the development of
the transport sector.  One of its priorities is the developmnent of the country's
main artery, the "Voie Nationale" which links the copper belt with the sea through
a combination of rail and river connections. Due to the present inadequacy of
this system, Zaire depends heavily on foreign routes (through Lobito in Angola,
Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, and Beira in Mozambique) particularly for copper
exports. At present, copper moving along the "Voie Nationale" route must be
transported first by rail to Ilebo, then by barge on the Kasai river to
Kinshasa and finally by rail again to Matadi for port loading,entailing
three transshipments. The Government has, therefore, plans to construct
rail links between Kinshasa and Ilebo and between Matadi and Banana, where
a new deepwater port is planned. The Goverrment has also given priority to
rehabilitation and improvement of several trunk roads totalling more than
3,000 km, including parts of the circular "Grande Boucle" route
which cuts through the center of the country, and links its principal popu-
lation concentrations'and agricultural areas.



-9-
31.      The Bank is assisting the Government to restore and improve
existing transport infrastructure and institutions, to train staff and to
plan for the future development of the sector. To these ends,-IDA extended
a credit of US$6 million in 1969 for a Technical Assistance and Highway
Administration Project designed to meet priority needs for road rehabili-
tation and to develop an effective highway administration. This project led
to the establishment of the Bureau of Roads which IDA assisted in 1972 with a
US$19 million Second Highway Project consisting of technical assistance and
further road rehabilitation. Similarly, a US$7 million River Transport Project,
begun in 1971, focused on strengthening the agencies concerned with river
transport and the creation of two new ones, the Regie des Voies Fluviales (RVF),
and the Riegie des Voies Maritimes (RVM), while meeting priority rehabilitation
needs in that subsector.  Administrative inefficiency has been a main cause
of poor execution of both of these latter pojects. But difficulties were also
encountered in recruiting and utilizing technical assistants in the assisted
agencies.  This situation has been improving rapidly.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The project is designed to strengthen the Bureau of Roads and to
meet some of the country's most urgent needs for road rehabilitation. It
consists of the following components with a total capital cost estimated
at US$40.3 million including taxes (see Annex III).
(a) Technical assistance to the Bureau of Roads;
(b) Organization of two pilot highway maintenance schemes;
(c) Establishment of a country-wide logistic support system
for highway maintenance;
(d)  Rehabilitation of about WDO kn of gravel road, including
detailed engineering and construction supervision;
(e)  A highway traffic survey; and
(f)  Feasibility studies afiecting about 1,500 km of roads.
33.       The project was prepared by the Bureau of Roads with the assistance
of consultants. It was appraised in November/December 1973, and the appraisal
was completed by a mission that visited Zaire in June 1974. Negotiation of the
project took place in late December 1974. The Zairian delegation was led by
Mr. Kama, Adviser, Office of the President; and included Mr. Shafali, Director,
Department of Public Works; Mr. Baudouin, Director General, Bureau of Roads;
an,, Mr. Nsungani, Legal Adviser, Office of the President.
34.       The Bureau of Roads is responsible   for maintaining, rehabilitating,
improving and construction roads, bridges and ferries. Due to the shortage
of qualified Zairian staff, 47 experts were recruited under the Second High-
way Project (FY72) and assigned to key executive positions in the Bureau.



- ic -
The need for technical assistance persists, but at a reduced leve'.    The
proposed project includes provision for 24 experts to serve for a period of
three years in advisory positions in the Burem of Roads. Eight of these
experts would be financed under the Credit. The Government has agreed as
a condition of effectiveness to make arrangements satisfactory to the Asso-
ciation for the financing of the remaining sixteen experts, through the UNDP
and other sources.
35.       Zaire's highway maintenance capacity islimited and the proposed
project provides for a pilot maintenance scheme to be started in Bas-Zaire,
one of the country's eight regions, to serve as a training ground for mainte-
nance personnel. Under this scheme, routine maintenance would be carried out
on about 3,200 km of roads over a three-year period.   Additional workshops and
equipment would be provided as well as technical assistance to help improve
maintenance administration. A similar scheme utilizing the experience of the
first one would be established in another region by January 1977, and its
implementation would be started that year. As a condition of elffectiveness,
the Borrower will be required to provide an implementation plan and a time
schedule for these two schemes acceptable to the Association. Technical
assistance for carrying out this part of the project will be supplied mainly
by consultants.
30'.      One of the major deficiencies in the country's maintenance system
is the lack of adequate service facilities for equipment. The project would
assist the Government in creating an organization to maintain and repair
highway maintenance equipment through improvement and extension of existing
workshops in six regional capitals, provision of tools, equipment and spare
parts, and technical assistance and training. Provision of a plan of imple-
mentation for this part of the project acceptable to the Association would
also be a condition of effectiveness. A contract for its execution has been
signed with consultants. The scheme would be reviewed in January 1977 to assess
the role of technical assistance (Section 3.07 of the draf't Agreement).
37.       No comprehensive assessment of existing road transport requirements
has been made. Consequently, existing highway development plans may not
reflect the actual and potential demand of transport users. The project
provides for a road traffic survey to be carried out by consultants who will
also organize a traffic counting unit in the Bureau of Roads and train local
personnel for this prupose over a period of three years. The findings of the
survey should facilitate the formulation of a highway maintenance plan which
the Government agreed to undertake in the Credit Agreement for the Second
Highway Project, but which was delayed due to staffing difficulties. This
plan is now to be prepared by March 31, 1978 (Section 4.0i(b) of the draft
Agreem.ent).  In the meantime, the Government will submit to the Association as
a condition of effectiveness of the credit an interim plan for road maintenance
(Section 5.01(d) of the draft Agreement).   This p]an is substantially ready.
It covers 20,000 km of priority roads, including those roads rehabilitated
under the two earlier IDA credits.

38.       The Kabinda-Kindu road (600 la.) will be rehabilitated to all-
weather gravel standard under the project. The road is presently in poor
condition. Rehabilitation will include minor improvements to the existing
alignment and a new surface. This road is a riajor link in the country's
central road system and runs through potentially rich agricultural areas.
39.       The project also includes feasibility studies for the Mbuji Mayi-
Lubutu and Kikwit-Kananga roads. The former road,of which the Kabinda-Kindu
road is a section, is about 1,000 km long and forms a part of the "Grande
Boucle" inter-regional road system menitioned above. The feasibility study
would ascertain the economic potential of the area served by this road and
thebenefitsof further improving highway communications between Mbuji Mayi
and the northeast of the country. The feasibility study will consider a
variety of rural development strategies in the regions served by the road.
Detailed engineering of the Kikwit-Kananga road (about 700 km) is to be
financed by the Canadian International Development Agency and the Government
has requested the Association to finance its construction. However, the
earlier feasibility study for the road failed to assess its role as an inter-
regional connection, so the present project includes financing of an addi-
tional study of this road to be carried out before the detailed engineering
is started.
40.       Financing:  The following table shows the capital cost breakdown
by project item:
In US$ Millions
Local        Foreign      Total
Technical Assistance          1.80          2.0         4.20

Total         12.50         27.80        40.30
Taxes represent abcut US$2 million.  Of the net cost of about US$38 million,
the Association would finance US$26 million representing about 93 percent of'
the entire foreign exchange component and approximately 65 percent of the total
cost. The balance of the foreign exzhange cost of $1.8 million would be financed
largely by French and Belgian bilateral assistance, which would provide four
experts, and by funds in trust administered by the UNDP, which would provide
for twelve experts. The Government would provide $300,000 in foreign exchange,
and would also contribute about US$12.5 million for local costs ; in addition
it would cover the recurrent costs of the pilot maintenance schemes (US$5.0
million per annum).

41.      Procurement and Disbursements:   Experts for the Bureau of Roads will
be recruited on an individual basis by the Bureau. Consultants for the pilot
highway maintenance schemes and the logistic support system have been selected
by the Bureau. Rehabilitation of the Kabinda-Kindu road will be carried out
by contractors chosen on the basis of international competitive bidding. This
road will be divided into three sections for bidding purposes. Because of
their small size and scattered nature, contracts for the construction and
improvement of all workshops and facilities, stores and office buildings will
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised only locally. On
all civil works contracts, Zairian contractors are eligible to receive a
7-1/2 percent margin of preference. Procurement of all equipment will be
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guide-
lines. Zairian suppliers will receive a 15 percent margin of preference.
42.      Disbursement from the credit account for imported equipment, vehicles,
tools and spare parts will be based on c.i.f. costs (port of entry), or, if
locally procured, on ex-factory price; for the other project items, disburse-
ment will be based on percentages reflecting the estimated foreign exchange
component, or 100 percent of the actual foreign cost of the item. To obtain
accurate cost estimates for the rehabilitation of the Kabinda-Kindu road,
the Government, at the Association's suggestion, engaged consultants early
in 1974 to carry out the detailed engineering of it. The proposed project
includes retroactive financing in an amount of US$700,000 to cover the foreign
exchange cost of the engineering work on the Kabinda-Kindu road and the feasi-
bility study of the Kikwit-Kananga road and consultant services for the
logistic support svstem incurred since March l, 1974.
43.      Justification:   The road to be rehabilitated under this project,
Kabinda-Kindu (604 km), is important to agriculture since it passes through
areas in Eastern Kasai and Kivu where cattle, cotton, coffee and rice are
raised. Rehabilitation of this road is expected to stimulate production in
the areas it serves and yield substantial reductions in vehicle operating
costs. The road also forms part of a highway system that would ultimately
connect several of Zaire's major population centers. The rate of return to
the economy on the rehabilitation of the road is greater than 20 percent,
based on reduced vehicle operating costs and on the regenerative effects that
the road is expected to have on the agricultural economy of the areas it serves.
The immediate benefits of the pilot maintenance scheme in Bas-Zaire will also
yield a rate of return of the order of 20 percent.
44.      Other benefits of the project are not quantifiable and consist of
improved highway administration, improved road maintenance through development
of a national maintenance capacity, and improved data for highway planning
purposes.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Zaire and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Sectian l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a resolution approving the proposed credit agreement are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
46.       The draft agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of
recent agreements used for highway projects. Special features are
discussed in paragraphs 34-37, and 42 above.
47.       I am satisfied thatthe proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOZO.ENDATION
48.       I recommend that the ExecutiveDirectors approve the proposed credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 152 - Technical Assistance and Highway Administration; US $6 million
Credit of June 9, 1969; Closing Date:  December 31, 1975.
The project, financed jointly by a $1.6 million UNDP grant, consisted of:
(a) the provision of consultants' services for the improvement of highway administ-
ration; (b) the purchase of an emergency supply of spare parts, vehicles,
materials and maintenance equipment; and (c) emergency maintenance and
rehabilitation work. After initial delays due to lack of familiarity with
Bank Group procurement procedures, the project has progressed satisfactorily:
most of the equipment has been received and rehabilitation work is com-
pleted. There is, however, a minor aspect of the project - the purchase
of laboratory equipment - that will be completed during 1975 and there-
fore, the Closing Date was extended a fifth time to Pecember 31, 1975.
The balance on the credit account is approximately $250,000.
Credit 190 - DFC; US $5 million Credit of May 28, 1570; Closing Date:
April 30, 1575.
Credit 271 - DFC; US $10 million Credit of September 24, 1971: Closing
Date:  December 31, 1979.
Credit 463 - Third DFC; US $10.0 million Credit of February 20, 1974;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1977.
The first line of credit to SOFIDE, made in 1970 and now fully
disbursed, enabled it to start operations on July 1, 1970, witn a bank-
seconded General Manager.
The second line of credit to SOFIDE was made one year after the
first, since SOFIDE's volume of operations was three times that forecast.
The Credit was not fully committed until December, 1973, due tc the
availability to SOFiDE of other resources. A Zairian General Manager
assisted by an expatriate Senior Adviser replaced the Bank-seconded
General Manager in May, 1973.
j   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

The third line of credit to SOFfL)E is expected to cover abou-t
one-third of SOFIDE's resource needs over the period 197h-75. SOFIDE's
operations are being conducted in a manner satisfactory to the Association.
Credit 255 - River Transport; US $7 million Credit of June 21, 1971; Closing
Date: September 3, 1975.
The project, based on UNDP-financed studies, consists of:  (a)
rehabilitation of navigational aids, dredging facilities and equipment in
the Zaire River estuary; (b) improvement of navigation on the Kinshasa-
Ilebo waterway; (c) rehabilitation of the ONATRA river fleet; (d) pro-
vision of experts to fill key positions in ONATRA, RVM and RVF; and (e)
a feasibiJ.ity study for the Voie Nationale, the combination of rail/river
links between the mining areas of Tlaba and Zairian seaports. The river
agencies have been set up as autonomous public entities, and all contracts
for goods and services under the Credit have been awarded* Success has
so far been limited by delays in procurement, and by the difficulties
of recruiting technical assistance of the right caliber. However, progress
in implementing the project has improved recently and we are confident
that the main objectives of the project will be reached soon. The original
Closing Date, Decenber 31, 1973 was extended to naptember 30, 1975.
Credit 272 - Education; ITS $6.5 million Credit of December 17, 1971;
Closing Date: April 31, 1977.
The project, designed to meet priority needs for improvement and
expansion of teacher training and technical education, consists of:  (a)
rehabilitation and equipment for an upper secondary teacher training
college, a college for primary teacher trainers and four technical secondary
schools; (b) oonstruction and equipment of a new demonstration secondary
school and a new technical teacher training college; and (c) technical
assistance for a management study of the Department of National Education.
The execution of the pirject has been slow and there is a delay of about
one year in its implementation caused by the slow recruitment of con-
sultants. Also, it has become apparent that substantial cost-cverruns are
to be expected. These problems relate to some aspects of project design
and to the weak administrative capacity of the Borrower. We are following
these matters closely with the authorities ad we hope that as a result
no further delays will affect the project.
Credit 292 - Second Highways; US $19 million Credit of March 28, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30 115.
The project, based on studies financed jointly by IDA and the
UNDP under the first highway project, was intended to:   (a) implement
the reorganization of highway management, by providing 47 experts for two
and one half years to occupy executive positions at all levels of the newly
created Bureau of Roads, (b) assist the bureau of Roads to rehabilitate
1,600 km of high priority roads and improve highway maintenance; and (c)
finance pre-investment studies for a third highway project. The project
is jointly financed by IDA; IJNDP, CIDA, FAO0 USAID and the Government.

Implementation of this project has been poor due, to repeated changes in the
organization and purposes of the Bureau of Roads. This was due in part to
delays in the delivery of equipment financed by bilateral aid. Consequently,
some of the experts provided under contracts with consultants were not fully
utilized. These problems, however, are well on the way to resolution.
The road rehabilitation program is underway and proceeding satisfactorily.
Credit 398 - Livestock Development; US08.5 Million Credit of June 21, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
This project is intended to develop three large government ranches in
the Shaba Region and help establish a National Livestock Development Authority.
The project also provides substantial assistance (US$1.3 million) for the prepa-
ration of future agricultural projects. The consultants for implementation of
the project are in place, and except for a recent report of high cattle morta-
lity rates on one of the ranches, progress appears normal.
