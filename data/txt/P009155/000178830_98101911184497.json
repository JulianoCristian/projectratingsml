(c)\n            the procurement and installation of approximately 45 control\n            and metering main stations, including buildings, at city\n            limits, with about 270 km of low pressure distribution rings\n            totaling approximately 2600 in km, and control and metering\n            stations for approximately 146 industrial consumers; (d)\n            treatment plants; (e) the procurement and installation of\n            instrumentation, telecommunications and telecontrol and\n            automated central dispatch station which will receive\n            critical operating data from important outlying stations and\n            will regulate operating conditions automatically or by voice\n            and manually as desired; and (f) technical
