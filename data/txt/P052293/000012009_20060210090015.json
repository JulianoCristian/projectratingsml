Lessons are as follows.\n            The project design concept of combining related sub-sectors\n            in a broader sector project worked satisfactorily, in spite\n            of the involvement of five agencies. Keys to success\n            include: an effective multi-agency steering committee,\n            empowered to make project cost and coordination decisions,\n            allowing a balanced coordination between implementing\n            agencies, with the provision that agency representatives\n            were empowered; a Project Management Unit, supplemented by\n            specific project support in each implementing agency, which\n            proved critically important in this multi-agency project,\n            also effective in building capacity due to the line\n            reporting and accountability of each agency for authorizing\n            project expenditures; intensive monitoring and supervision\n            with a good skill mix, from both the Bank and Government;\n            and, well-defined indicators relevant to each agency, and to\n            the project. In addition, the two-phase Adaptable Program\n            Lending (APL) structure worked well from the Project\n            perspective, particularly with respect to the public sector\n            reform activities, the phasing was helpful because of two\n            agencies, whish despite of differing pace and targets from\n            that expected at appraisal, both in the end exceeded\n            targets. The public works experience shows that sector\n            reform can be introduced smoothly when the timing is well\n            chosen - in this case, alignment of a national reform\n            agenda, sector political will, committed executive leader,\n            comprehensive consultations, and a sound, well-designed\n            plan. Notwithstanding, the introduction of hazard risk\n            management into public sector management needs a number of\n            elements to be successful, and, the preparation of fiduciary\n            arrangements such as procurement, and financial management\n            needs to cover the whole transaction cycle in order to\n            streamline the process."}, "docdt": "2006-02-02T00:00:00Z"}
