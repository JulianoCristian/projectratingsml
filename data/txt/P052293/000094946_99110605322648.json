aims to improve air, road, and coastal transport\n            infrastructure and to support public sector reform and\n            increased private sector participation in the provision of\n            infrastructure. The purpose of this environmental analysis\n            is to identify and assess the environmental issues\n            associated with the project and evaluate the need for\n            further reviews. The airport improvement component may cause\n            spillages from resurfacing materials resulting in pollution\n            of groundwater and the lagoon ecosystem, which will be\n            mitigated by adhering to proper procedures. Road subsector\n            work may bring about dust and/or mud problems during\n            construction. To mitigate such impact, codes of\n            environmental practice will be observed. Under the coastal\n            infrastructure component, groundwater flows to the coast may\n            be inhibited, access to the coast may be curtailed, and\n            lagoon ecosystem may be affected. Mitigation measures\n            include designing coastal protection methods in consultation\n            with the village concerned."}, "docdt": "1998-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
