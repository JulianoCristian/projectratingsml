The key lessons\n            convey that the parastatal framework within which most\n            railway systems have been operating, has proven inadequate\n            for the delivery of effective transport services,\n            particularly under economic liberalization scenarios, and\n            the consequent inter-modal competition; thus, a sharp\n            decline in railway traffic - both freight, and passenger -\n            has been experienced. In addition, the efforts to reform the\n            organizational structure of railways within a parastatal\n            framework, bares no significant impact, due to excessive\n            employment, lack of incentives, and inadequate\n            accountability. It becomes clear, that if railway operations\n            are to succeed, an adequate framework for reform needs to be\n            implemented. Furthermore, private participation in\n            railways' operation, and management through\n            concessions, has apparently renewed railway transportation\n            modes; even in Zimbabwe, the concession for a new link, led\n            to substantial increases in the railroad freight traffic.\n            Therefore, since railway privatization appears to be\n            unavoidable, the delay for private participation, will prove\n            costly, aggravated in Sub-Saharan Africa by the financial\n            pressures the governments are facing. Finally, the\n            successful restructuring, and privatization of railways is\n            liable to an urgent staff redundancy program."}, "docdt": "2000-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
