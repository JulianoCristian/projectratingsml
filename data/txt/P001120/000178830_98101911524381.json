The objective is to assist RAN in effectively\n            playing its important role in the economic development of\n            the region it serves, i.e., all of Upper Volta, central and\n            northern Ivory Coast and south-eastern Mali. The project is\n            designed to meet RAN capacity needs until 1980, to\n            rehabilitate and upgrade existing infrastructure and to\n            strengthen RAN operational and managerial effectiveness."}, "docdt": "1977-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
