Lessons cited from this project\n            included: 1. Transition to sustainability of the\n            micro-credit sector takes time, and must be a part of the\n            initial project design. 2. Targeted technical assistance is\n            of great importance; micro-credit organizations learned how\n            to assess their needs for technical services and how to work\n            with consultants. 3. There is no conflict between the\n            financial and social goals of this type of operations;\n            Experience from this project suggests that achieving\n            simultaneously these two objectives is not only possible,\n            but also leads to synergies. 4. Focused objectives are\n            essential: Focusing the operation on developing a very\n            specific type of micro-credit services (micro-credits for\n            income generating activities), and on targeting specific\n            types of clients (low-income entrepreneurs) was important.\n            5. Performance based financing. Loan financing under the\n            project was performance based in the sense that micro-credit\n            organizations were obliged to maintain certain performance\n            standards to remain eligible to retain existing and be\n            eligible for future financing. This has proven to be a\n            strong incentive for micro-credit organizations to perform well."}, "docdt": "2005-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
