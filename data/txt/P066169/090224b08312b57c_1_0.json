Before war erupted in Bosnia and Herzegovina in\n            1992, the country\u2019s economy was based on heavy and military\n            industry, and dominated by several large state-owned\n            conglomerates. A major part of this economy was destroyed\n            during the conflict. As a result, the country was left\n            without the most basic infrastructure and services, and\n            suffered from significant unemployment. People had a hard\n            time launching new businesses since the commercial banking\n            sector was embryonic. The emerging private sector found it\n            extremely arduous to access capital, while micro-enterprises\n            and low-income clientele found it downright impossible. The\n            International Development Association (IDA) financed Local\n            Initiatives Microfinance Projects were launched in 1997 to\n            raise incomes, develop businesses, and create jobs in Bosnia\n            and Herzegovina. IDA provided financing to eight\n            micro-credit organizations, invested in building local\n            capacity in this new field, and developed a legal and\n            regulatory framework so the micro-credit organizations could\n            diversify their financing sources and services. The project\n            provided financial services to low-income clients and\n            micro-entrepreneurs to launch or expand businesses. About\n            380,000 micro-credits were disbursed over 10 years from the\n            revolving micro-credit. More than 200,000 jobs were created.\n            Gender parity achieved. 50 percent of borrowers were women\n            and it strengthened women\u2019s role in the family and helped\n            support female-headed households, since the war left many\n            households without male heads of families.  Overall, the\n            projects helped create a sustainable and well performing\n            microcredit industry that can meet the needs of\n            microenterprises and low income clients in Bosnia and Herzegovina."}, "docdt": "2009-09-03T03:10:02Z"}
