Microcredit\n            offered the promise of helping poor people get back on their\n            feet. Two Local Initiatives Projects launched in 1996 and\n            2002 helped small entrepreneurs all over the country start\n            anew. Special attention was given to those displaced by war,\n            demobilized soldiers, and people disabled during the war. A\n            total of about US$45 million helped establish eight\n            microcredit organizations. \u0093People get loans from us much\n            faster and more flexibly than from banks,\u0094 emphasizes Mirsad\n            Milavic, general manager of Sunrise, one of the eight\n            organizations.
