objective of the Coastal Forest\n            Reconstruction and Protection Project is to restore and\n            protect forest land in the coastal zone of Croatia in order\n            to enhance the landscape and recreation values of the region\n            and thereby contribute to restore tourism to its pre-war\n            level.  Other objectives are to: a) restore the\n            environmental role of coastal forests destroyed by the war,\n            by protecting soil and water, and initiate the restoration\n            of the natural vegetation; b) address the forest fire\n            problem; and c) develop the knowledge base for improved\n            management and protection of coastal forests.  The project,\n            to be implemented over 5 years, will include the following 3\n            components: a) reconstruction of coastal forests, a nursery\n            and an arboretum destroyed by war activities; b) forest fire\n            management in coastal areas including a comprehensive\n            package of prevention, presuppression, and suppression\n            measures; and c) support services including the development\n            of a geographic information system (GIS) for forest fire\n            management, coastal forestry research, institutional support\n            and project management and monitoring."}, "docdt": "1996-11-15T00:00:00Z"}
