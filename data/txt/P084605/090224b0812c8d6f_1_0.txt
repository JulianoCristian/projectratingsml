ecosystem management and the launch of the consulting services on the legal framework harmonization and integrating the role of the Commission into national legislation. The Lake
Predictive Hydrological Model (PHM) has been finalized and adequate training provided to interested specialists and stakeholders from both countries. The joint Lake Monitoring
Program has been completed and its integrated implementation in the national monitoring system of both countries is currently under discussions. Beneficiary assessments are
planned to be conducted in both countries given the approaching project closure and the need to receive more feedback from all stakeholders and the public involved during project
Simplementation.
