                         The mission assessed that considerable progress has been achieved in the implementation of agreed activities despite the December 2010 flood event that hit Shkodra and the
                         project area, the June 2011 Albanian local elections, as well as the temporary absence (between January-March 2011) of full-time project coordination on the Montenegro side. The
                         Predictive Hydrological Model and the Lake Monitoring Program and Database will be finalized by end-September, 2011; the assignment on the legal framework harmonization and
                         integrating role of SLC into national legislation will be contracted by end-October 2011, and several joint activities related to assistance on learning and capacity building on

                         international water basin management cooperation (e.g., wetland management training and International Waterways #6 conference) will take place during October and November in
                         Croatia, Slovenia and Albania. A joint public awareness campaign is on-going to promote joint management and preservation of Lake resources, activities of the Joint Secretariat and
                         the Working Groups (WGs), and communication among all resource users and lakeside communities in both countries.

                         Both countries acknowledged enhanced communication on trans-boundary environmental issues in the project context during the last 6 months, including cooperation on flood
                         management in the Drini/Buna River Basin as a consequence of the various flooding events caused by heavy rain falls and excessive snow melt that affected the basin, Shkodra city
                         and its population, and the Lake water quality and levels.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Water Administration (MoEFWA) in Albania and the Ministry of Sustainable and Tourism Development (MSTD) in Montenegro are
                         supportive of raising the Skadar Lake Commission (SLC) mandate possibly at the level of the entire Shkodra Lake Basin (e.g., following the Ohrid Lake experience) and enhancing its
                         institutional structure permanently beyond the project closure. In line with the agreement reached between the World Bank and the two Ministries, both governments will cover
                         operational costs for the functioning of the SLC during the last year of project implementation and beyond.

                         The next SLC meeting planned before end-September, 2011 will discuss a possible revised Agreement on the future SLC role as a follow-up to the findings of the legal assessment

                         The Shkoder Fisheries Management Organization (FMO) is seen as a pilot for the centralized fish auction approach, which is intended to be scaled up and introduced to other
                         existing FMOs, including the major Lakes and coastal areas. A Memorandum of Understanding has been drafted to support enforcement of fish trade in Shkodra as fishing is an
                         important livelihood in the lake area.

                         The next project sponsored donor meeting will take place no later than end-September 2011.
