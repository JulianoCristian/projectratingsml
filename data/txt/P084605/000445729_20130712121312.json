Integrated\n            Ecosystem Management Project for Albania and Montenegro were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            global environment outcome was substantial; bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned\n            included: preferable to finalize a project's monitoring\n            and evaluation arrangements at appraisal, including\n            provision of the baseline data for benchmarking progress in\n            the course of implementation. Bank's client countries\n            the governments and local communities have deficient\n            information on the advantages and disadvantages of using\n            constructed wetlands for waste water treatment, and lack\n            trust in this technology. Tough decisions have to be made on\n            time if a project activity significantly deviates from\n            planned arrangements in terms of its substance or timeline.\n            Stimulating participation of local communities and\n            Non-Government Organization (NGOs) in the process of project\n            supervision, monitoring, and evaluation is advisable as long\n            as the rendered support is neutral and does not influence\n            stakeholder opinion.
