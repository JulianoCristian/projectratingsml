                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Mid-term review (MTR) concluded that planned activities can be completed and disbursed by Project closing date (end of September 2012). The Global Environmental Objective
                         (GEO) remains relevant and no significant changes in the project design are needed. In terms of specific achievement of Project Development Objective (PDO) at mid-point
                         implementation, the project registered progress on the role and visibility of the Lake Commission and its 4 working groups (established by the project) in strengthening promotion of
                         trans-boundary activities and efforts to improve sustainable management of the Lake. The predictive hydrological model and the Lake monitoring program were recently contracted;

                         Both countries launched the majority of national activities as planned in the procurement plans; initiated discussions on joint events for learning and capacity building on water basin
                         management. The project socioeconomic study was completed and the review of existing legal framework relevant to the Lake ecosystem management will be finalized by end-
                         January. A park management plan, a community based afforestation pilot in Tarabosh mountain, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for a selected stream bank erosion
                         control site in Shiroka, and the design for a community based lakeside vegetation management pilot are all underway on the Albania side. An initial draft for the Vranjina wastewater
                         investment feasibility study and design work (financed by Government of Montenegro) was discussed and recommendations for improvement shared. A second Lake Commission

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Agreement was reached that an annual work plan will be prepared by the Secretariat, discussed with Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Water Administration (MEFWA) and
                         Ministry of Spatial Planning and Environment (MSPE) and approved by the Commission to ensure a better planning of activities and monitoring of the results of the joint work
                         including donor coordination. Given the progress achieved at MTR, the Skadar Lake Commission (SLC) and its Secretariat need to consider revising the joint groups' responsibilities
                         and their composition in accordance with ToRs updated based on the need to involve other institutions or different skills.
                         The Public Awareness Campaign (PAC) activities including organized events such as eco-camps and bike tours around the lake is ongoing; yet it was agreed that the campaign
                         strategy should ensure a truly joint approach with equal involvement from both sides of the lake.
                         The social and economic assessment report should streamline findings and develop socio-economic indicators in line with the project's Results Monitoring Matrix.
                         The proposed stocking of fish into the Lake to mitigate declining fisheries landings is unlikely to improve the status of the protected areas and the fishery. It is recommended to
                         intensify the protection of identified fish spawning and nursery areas as a key activity and first step towards the recovery of the fishery of the Lake.
                         Fisheries Management Organizations (FMOs) from both countries agreed to launch a campaign to remove ghost nets as a possible joint activity. There is need for capacity building

                         among these fishery associations and other stakeholders (park rangers, border police) on both sides of the lake to develop conditions for better fisheries management.
                         The Vranjina Village Waste Water Treatment Feasibility Study will be revised to include a low-cost suitable treatment solution for the Vranjina area.
                         The next project sponsored donor meeting will take place no later than end-February 2011.
