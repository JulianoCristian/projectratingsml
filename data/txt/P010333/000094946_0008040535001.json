World Bank\n            performance is judged as satisfactory: The Bank maintained a\n            very good relationship with the Borrower and donors, which\n            helped to expedite project implementation. Since the Bank\n            carried out supervision every six months and the project\n            provided comprehensive reporting, including progress on\n            benchmarks during each mission, it was possible to identify\n            all bottlenecks on time and resolve any outstanding issues\n            jointly. Finally, the Bank's decision to grant two\n            extensions of one year each came at a most crucial time\n            without which the project would have been declared\n            unsuccessful. Borrower performance also was satisfactory:\n            The project benefited from continuity in the senior\n            management of the Institute of Engineering (IOE); support\n            for project design and objectives was uninterrupted.\n            Similarly all of the five Deans of the IOE had been directly\n            involved in the early planning stages of the project and all\n            maintained strong commitment and support. Despite serious\n            implementation delays during the first half of the project,\n            some of which were beyond the control of the Borrower, the\n            Borrower was not only able to improve implementation\n            significantly but exceeded achievements in some areas."}, "docdt": "2000-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
