The extension is necessary to allow the government to\n            capitalize on the momentum it has gained, and to implement\n            the remaining activities, which include amongst others: a)\n            construction of 311 classrooms and provision of school\n            furniture; b) training of 1,000 primary school teachers and\n            260 junior secondary school teachers; c) provision of\n            850,000 sets of teaching and learning materials for\n            distribution to primary pupils, and d) training on\n            environmental and social impact of project activities of\n            project activities.

It should be noted that the government's\n            decision to forgo the use of a project implementation unit\n            is based on its long-term view to ensure that capacity is\n            built within the MEYS beyond the life of the project.\n            Therefore, the delays incurred should be weighed against the\n            benefits gained by strengthening MEYS both at the central\n            and decentralized levels."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
