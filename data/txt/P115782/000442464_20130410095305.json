follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was high, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Grantee performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: projects\n            designed for post-conflict and fragile states need to\n            anticipate that implementation and disbursements will be\n            slow initially. The Global Partnership for Education (GPE)\n            three year implementation requirements should be\n            reconsidered, particularly in post conflict countries. A\n            strong government project implementation team must be in\n            place prior to project effectiveness and remain in place\n            throughout project implementation. Strong bank supervision\n            with knowledge of bank procedures as well as bank staff\n            based in post-conflict countries with low capacity is\n            essential for ensuring the implementation of bank-supported\n            projects. Future school construction should include more\n            capacity building and support in bank procurement methods,\n            but should also be managed closer to the community level\n            with more appropriate contract management and supervision\n            arrangements, and with funds provided directly to local\n            governments or communities to pay contractors. Projects\n            designed within a context of ongoing decentralization should\n            include an initial period of adjustment, as capacity cannot\n            be built before but it is actually supported and built\n            during implementation. This is especially important for\n            post-conflict countries."}, "docdt": "2013-03-22T00:00:00Z"}
