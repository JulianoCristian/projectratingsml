                                       Restructuring Paper


1.    The closing date for Sierra Leone EFA FTI PROGRAM, Grant P115782-
TF092755, will be extended from June 30, 2010 until December 31, 2011.

2.      To date, the project has 28 percent disbursement rate, which is rather low given
the fact that the project has been active since September 15, 2008. However, there are an
additional US$6 million that have recently been committed, showing that the project is
slowly gaining momentum. A workshop for Deputy Directors and Local Councils has
been organized that will help identify 300 untrained and unqualified teachers that should
benefit from the distance education component. Furthermore, to date 285 classrooms
have been built or are under implementation, and a contract of Le 739,499,9501 (about
US$185,000.00) to procure teaching and learning materials has also been signed.
Although project implementation has been slow, the project development objectives
remain attainable if an extension of 18 months will be granted.

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to allow the government to capitalize on the
momentum it has gained, and to implement the remaining activities, which include
amongst others: a) construction of 311 classrooms and provision of school furniture; b)
training of 1,000 primary school teachers and 260 junior secondary school teachers; c)
provision of 850,000 sets of teaching and learning materials for distribution to primary
pupils, and d) training on environmental and social impact of project activities of project
activities. Furthermore, the extension would allow the Ministry of Education, Youth and
Sports (MEYS - the implementing agency) address issues on the processing of
procurement documents and would strengthen Local Councils to effectively and
sustainably monitor and supervise project activities. It should be noted that the
government's decision to forgo the use of a project implementation unit is based on its
long-term view to ensure that capacity is built within the MEYS beyond the life of the
project. Therefore, the delays incurred should be weighed against the benefits gained by
strengthening MEYS both at the central and decentralized levels.

4.      The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on Closing Date
which provides that (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the
performance of the Recipient and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and
(c) the Recipient has prepared a specific action plan to tackle the issues and bottle necks
which have led to the initial delay in project implementation.
