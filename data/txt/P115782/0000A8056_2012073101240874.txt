                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Despite initial delays during the first two years of implementation, the EFA-FTI Project began to make slow progress since first being found to be in Moderately Unsatisfactory status
                         in February 2011, and witnessed significant movement since the project was restructured and extended in December 2011. In February 2011, disbursements were 22 percent, the
                         majority of which remained in the project's designated account; no Interim Financial Reports or audits had been submitted; the Education Sector Plan Secretariat was understaffed;
                         and procurement issues were highly prevalent. After remedying most of these problems, the Bank agreed to extend the project from December 31, 2011 to September 30, 2012 in
                         order to allow the goods and works underway to be completed, and to scale down procurement activities in order to focus on a few key system-building activities. Disbursements now
                         stand at 82 percent and the project should fully disburse by the project's closing date.

                         An interim supervision mission was held in May 2011 that highlighted areas of improvement that would allow the Bank team to upgrade the "Implementation Progress" from MU to
                         MS . These were: (i) carrying out a validation exercise to ensure that the learning material s and furniture reached schools and are in use; (ii) progress on the remaining civil works –
                         including wells and latrines; (iii) finalizing the TOR and hiring consultants to work with the various MEST directorates on, inter alia, the Student Assessment Framework and JSS

                         Curriculum Review; and (iv) accelerating the work on the Girls’ Incentive Program at the Junior Secondary School (JSS) level. Similarly, "progress towards achievement of project
                         development objectives" would be upgraded in the same time frame if the validation of learning materials demonstrated presence in schools and active use of the inputs to support
                         improved learning in the classroom. It was also expected that the School Census Report for the 2010-11 academic year would be released, which demonstrates positive trends in
                         enrollments, retention, completion and transition to higher levels of education. Progress was also expected in implementing an inservice teacher training program and training of
                         School Management Committees in school oversight.

                         Since the May mission, the following have been accomplished:

                         (i) Validation of the distribution of teaching and learning materials to the school was undertaken by MEST and Civil Society Organizations and the report submitted to the Bank. The
                         report shows that Local Councils (LC) had distributed on average about 70 percent of the TLM and 65 percent furniture. A high percentage of those TLM and furniture distributed to
                         schools are being used by students and teachers. The remaining will be distributed when the unfinished schools have been completed, and before the end of the project

                         (ii) Thirty-seven of the fifty-seven civil works have been completed and twenty are outstanding. However, several of these are nearly complete and there is now closer monitoring of
                         civil works activity by the Local Council (LC) engineers. In addition, the Bank has contracted the services of an engineering firm to conduct a third-party validation of the civil works.

                         (iii) The TORs for consultancies in the area of Student Assessment Framework, JSS Curriculum Review, and Evaluation of 1-year distance education program have been finalized,
                         and the Bank has given its No Objection Letter for activities to proceed. Consultants have been hired for the evaluation of the 1-year distance education program, and the evaluation
                         is underway. The draft report is expected in mid-September. Consultants have been hired for the Student Assessment Framework and contracts are being finalized. The activity will
                         be implemented during July through September. Recruitment for the consultant to conduct the curriculum review is completed, and that activity is also expected to end in September.

                         (iv) Girls JSS enrollment data has been collected from all Local Councils, and civil society organizations are conducting a field verification of random schools. The data is also being
                         validated against the 2011 school census data before the monies can be disbursed to schools. The validation activity should be completed by July 15, after which time monies can be
                         disbursed to the individual school accounts. This activity is expected to be completed by the end of the project.

                         (v) The School Deworming Program undertaken by the Helen Keller Institute successfully scaled up from seven districts to 12, and increased coverage from 680,000 children in 2011
                         to 1.3 million children in 2012.

                         (vi) The contract was signed with the firm contracted to undertake the 2011 financial audit which was submitted by the June 30 deadline.

                         The project team is raising the ratings from MU to MS based on achievements to date, the likelihood of completing the outstanding activities on time, and the fact that steady
                         improvements in implementation have taken place over the last 18 months - all in a complex, post-conflict and fragile environment. These improvements should not only help the

                         project, but will likely be sustained during the preparation and implementation of the next phase of program engagement.
