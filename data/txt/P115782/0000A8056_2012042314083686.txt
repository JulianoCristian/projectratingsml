                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The EFA-FTI Project witnessed significant delays in its first two years. It became effective in September 2008 but the initial disbursement of US $3 million to the Special Account did
                         not occur until late June 2009 due to internal changes of the EFA-FTI Secretariat's procedures. The delays in start-up resulted in the project being extended from its original closing
                         date of June 30, 2010 to December 31, 2011. Subsequently, the Education Sector Plan (ESP) Secretariat, housed within the Ministry instead of establishing a separate PIU, was
                         understaffed and the Ministry itself did not have the requisite skills to undertake the procurement of schools/classrooms, materials, furniture and textbooks envisioned under the
                         project. In January 2011 implementation continued to be very slow and no Withdrawal Applications had been submitted. The only disbursement had been the 22 percent of the
                         project grant into the Special Account. As the project gained momentum, it became clear that the project focused too much focus on inputs which were not reaching schools (in the

                         be granted if the project was restructured to shift the over-emphasis on goods and works towards a few small, but key activities that would begin to move towards a 'programmatic
                         approach" which would eventually have more long term impact on strengthening the system.

                         The project was successfully restructured and extended on December 29, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The restructuring was designed to (i) curtail remaining large-scale
                         procurement in order to focus completion of existing activities (i.e.: ensure all materials are delivered to and used in schools, complete remaining civil works), and (ii) help work on
                         activities to start strengthening government systems such as conducting a review of the Junior Secondary School (JSS) Curriculum, developing a Student Assessment Framework
                         and improving the efficiency of an existing JSS Girls’ Incentives Program. Additional training for teachers and School Management Committees (SMC) will be undertaken, and the
                         successful school-based deworming program from June 2011 will be scaled up from seven to twelve districts. The change in approach is evident by the fact that the Ministry of
                         Education, Science and Technology (MEST) Directors of various units are actively involved in all aspects of project planning and implementation as part of their work program.
                         Previously most project activities were done in isolation by the Education Sector Plan (ESP) coordinator.

                         Since the October 2011 mission, the ESP Secretariat has been strengthened with additional personnel which is improving the pace of implementation. All Financial Management
                         reports have been submitted and found to be satisfactory; six more schools have been completed and commissioned bringing the total to 32 out of 57 schools; and books and
                         learning materials are being distributed to schools. Teacher training under the project is on track for successful completion, as is the SMC training program. Another Withdrawal
                         Application for $1.1 million has been submitted.

                         Improvement in the following four areas by the end of April 2012 would allow the Bank team to upgrade the "Implementation Progress" from MU to MS - with the hope of reaching fully
                         satisfactory by the end of the project. These include: (i) carrying out a validation exercise to ensure that the learning material s and furniture reached schools and are in use; (ii)
                         completing the remaining civil works – including wells and latrines – before the rainy season begins in June; (iii) finalizing the TOR and hiring consultants to work with the various
                         MEST directorates on, inter alia, the Student Assessment Framework and JSS Curriculum Review; and (iv) accelerating the work on the Girls’ Incentive Program. Similarly,
                         "Progress towards achievement of project development objectives" could be upgraded in the same time frame if the validation demonstrates impact and active use of the inputs to
                         support improved access and learning in the classroom.
