Narayani Irrigation Project are to increase dry-season\n            agricultural production and reduce the risks to monsoon crop\n            production by introducing an equitable, predictable and\n            reliable irrigation system in the Narayani irrigation\n            scheme.  The proposed project is the third phase of an\n            IDA-supported program and will complete the development of\n            irrigation and drainage infrastructure over about 37,400 ha\n            served by the Nepal Eastern Canal in the Narayani Zone of\n            the Central Region of Nepal.  The project will also provide\n            for:  flood protection and river training works;\n            improvements to village roads and canal service roads; as\n            well as support to agricultural extension and research; a\n            regional workshop; training of project staff; consulting\n            services; funding for project establishment and O&M; a\n            small component for groundwater development; and monitoring\n            and evaluation."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
