                         The four Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Enterprises continue to develop with the 18 water treatment systems completed operating satisfactorily with trained operators. In next six
                         months, it is estimated a huge number of water systems will be completed and put in operation. The number of people with access to clean water (piped schemes) has continued to
                         increase (about 40,000 beneficiaries). Tariff levels are rising (with from 4,500 to 5,000 VND per cubic meter. The water tariff level increased as planned) to cover operations and
                         maintenance costs and further increases will be enacted to begin recovering part of the capital investment costs. All provinces have established the Rural Water Enterprises with
