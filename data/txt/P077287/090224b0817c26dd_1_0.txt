                         Overall, there is a high level of satisfaction from the users and local authorities with the pace and quality of implementation in all 4 provinces. Key achievements to date are
                         impressive and include: 41 out of a planned 85 schemes are completed and operating; over 95,000 households (about 410,000 beneficiaries) are now connected to a clean water
                         supply; 361 public toilets are in operation; and, over 36,000 household sanitation loans have been made. Many IEC and Hygiene education activities and capacity strengthening

                         activities have been carried out. In addition, the four Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Enterprises continue to develop with water supply systems that are now covering operating
                         costs. In next six months, it is estimated a huge number of water systems will be completed and put in operation. The number of people with access to clean water (piped schemes)
                         has continued to increase (about 100,000 beneficiaries). Tariff levels are rising (with from 5,000 to 5,500 VND per cubic meter. The water tariff level increased as planned) to cover
                         operations and maintenance costs and further increases will be enacted to begin recovering part of the capital investment costs. All provinces have established the Rural Water
