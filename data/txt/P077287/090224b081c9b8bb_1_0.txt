                         The development objective is to improve water and household level sanitation services and their effective use in selected provinces in ways that are financially,
                         technically, and environmentally sustainable, thereby contributing to poverty alleviation in participating rural communities.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The RRD RWSSP has demonstrated itself to be a successful water and sanitation project. The project is closing on June 30, 2013 and it is estimated that 1 million beneficiaries will
                         have gained access to piped water at a household level, with project exceeding targets by 25%. As well as the excellent results achieved on water supply, a significant impact has
                         been made on improving access to sanitation at both a public and household level with more than 500 public sanitation facilities constructed and more than 46,000 household

                         sanitation loans approved. As a result, percentage of households in project areas with access to improved hygienic latrines has increased from 15% (prior to project interventions) to
                         87%. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Enterprises (RWSSEs) established through this project have demonstrated a very successful model for water supply and sanitation
                         management. The four RWSSEs are financially viable and now cover their direct operating cost through tariffs charged and in some cases have begun loan repayment in
                         accordance with MoF agreements. All have developed 20 year business plans that are updated on an annual basis. This bodes well for project sustainability provided these increases

                         are sustained and remain affordable to the households. In addition to these results which have exceeded the planned targets, useful lessons have been learned. Considerable
                         experience has been gained in the provision of sustainable piped water supply in rural areas including higher levels of cost recovery and more accountable enterprise management
                         models. Clear efficiency and quality gains have also been demonstrated through the use of more competitive procurement processes and community participation and demand
                         responsive approaches to system design. Promising techniques have been learned for scaling up access to household sanitation through lending schemes. Significantly, feedback
                         from the beneficiaries of the project shows high levels of satisfaction with the results. The successes of the RRD RWSSP and the useful lessons learned through the project have
                         been incorporated into the new Program for Results 'Results-Based Rural Water Supply and Sanitation under the National Target Program'. Much of the experience gained through
                         the RRD RWSSP project will be used to provide a good foundation for the Program for Results to scale up access to water and sanitation in eight provinces in the RRD.
