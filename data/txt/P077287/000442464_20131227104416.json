          follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: there is the need to have a\n            project design that focuses on end goals and is not too\n            rigid in the implementation modalities to achieve these\n            results. Project costs need to be underpinned by stronger\n            economic analysis, review of macro-economic trends, and\n            comparisons with similar interventions in the region. Joint\n            stock company model provided successful balance between\n            financial sustainability and affordable service delivery of\n            water supply and sanitation services. Active community\n            participation in planning, supervision, and management of\n            rural water supply schemes is critical to success and\n            sustainability of interventions. Integration of hygiene\n            promotion with sanitation financing coupled with management\n            by community organizations effectively built strong demand\n            and promoted genuine behavioral changes. Conservative\n            disbursement schedule for initial year of project\n            implementation and fiduciary management capacity building\n            activities during preparation can have alleviated\n            bottlenecks during implementation. Adaptive and targeted\n            capacity building activities to all project stakeholders\n            enhanced awareness, engagement, and ownership of project\n            financed infrastructure. Balanced emphasis on provision of\n            water supply with sanitation is critical to enhancing\n            outcomes of interventions. Public sanitation infrastructure\n            needs to be better coordinated and addressed."}, "docdt": "2013-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
