The general mechanism\n            for compensation of lost agricultural land will be through\n            provision of 'land for land' arrangements of equal\n            productive capacity, satisfactory to the DP. If land\n            compensation size is smaller or lower quality, DP will be\n            entitled to compensation on cash equivalent the differences.\n            The level of compensation for the removal of graves will be\n            for all costs of excavation, relocation, reburial, and other\n            related costs. Compensation in cash will be paid to each\n            affected family. Households who possess affected\n            facilities/equipment will receive cash compensation at 100\n            percent of replacement cost regardless legal or illegal\n            users. DPs losing income and/or business/productive assets\n            will be given cash compensation for the loss of income\n            during the transition period, equivalent average monthly net\n            income at least for three months; compensation will also be\n            paid for loss of standing crops and trees; temporary impacts\n            during construction; temporary loss of residential land;\n            temporary impact on business; and loss of community assets.\n            Allowances and rehabilitation assistance will be given\n            during the transition period. Where damages occur during\n            construction, the contractor will be required to pay\n            compensation immediately to affected families, groups,\n            communities, or government agencies at the same compensation\n            rates that shall be applied to all other assets affected by\n            the project.
