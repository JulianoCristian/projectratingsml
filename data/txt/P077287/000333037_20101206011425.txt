  ·   Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam dated April 15th, 1992.
  ·   Land law dated November 26th, 2003.
  ·   Decree No. 181120041ND-CP dated November 16th 2004, regulations to implement the

  ·   Decree No. 188120041ND-CP dated November 16th 2004 regulations on methods of
      determining land prices and price framework for land categories.
  ·   Decree No. 69/2009/ND-CP dated August 13th 2009 of the Government's additional
      regulations on land use planning, land prices, land acquisition, compensation, and
      resettlement assistance.

      and Environment shall detail on compensation, support, resettlement and order, land
      acquisition procedures, land al/ocation or lease.
  ·   The report No. 120ITTr-SLDTBXH November 12th 2009 of the Department Labor, War

  ·   Decision No. 2612009/QD-UBND December 16th 2009 on promulgating regulations on
      land prices in Nam Dinh province in 2010.

The land law of 2007 provides for the assignment of land to people by land use right which
bears close similarities to individual property. Some of the important issues relevant to land
usage, acquisition can be summaries as follows:

  ·   The State reserves the right to allocate land and determine its usage.
  ·   Families and individuals who have been assigned with land have the right to exchange
      their land for another piece; transfer their land use right to another party, and rent,
      bequeath and use their land as collateral.
  ·   The People's committees at all levels (Province, District and commune) are responsible
      for the administration of land use in their localities; the People's Committees at all levels
      are responsible for managing land within their domain.
  ·   The State reserves the right to expropriate land if necessary, in case of national defense
      or security, or national and public interest. In these cases, the land users are
      compensated for loss of possessions. The "national and public interest" is defined in Go V
      Decree No. 19712004/ND-CP dated 3rd December 2004 which includes infrastructure
      projects ..

Before land is recovered, the land users must be informed of the reason for expropriation, time
schedule and plan for relocation and options for compensation (if necessary).
            11.2.       World Bank policy on involuntary resettlement
Involuntary resettlement under development projects, if unmitigated, often give rise to severe
economic, social, and environmental risks: production systems are dismantled; damages on
material and immaterial property (housing, land, forest resources, cultural sites. properties of
commercial value, social and 'cultural activities) are inflicted. Such effects can be either
temporary or permanent. Thus the World Bank policy regulated by OP/BP 4.12 includes
safeguards to address and mitigate these risks
The basic guiding principle of the World Bank resettlement policy is that:

  ·   Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feaSible, or minimized, exploring all
      viable alternative project designs.
  ·   Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be conceived
      and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment
      resources to enable the persons displaced by the project to share in project benefits.
      Displaced persons should be meaningfully consulted and should have opportunities to
      participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs.
  ·   Displaced persons need assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and
      standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or
      to levels prevailing pnor to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher.
            11.3.       Policies applied by RRD-RWSS
The resettlement policy applied for RRD - RWSS will be harmonious between World Bank
requirements (safeguards policy 4.12) and Vietnamese laws and regulations. The principles in
the project resettlement policy include:

  ·   All project affected people, regardless of their owner situation, social economic position,
      will be reasonably compensated, and supported for their loss of assets, income and
      business according to the replacement prices and given suitable resettlement measures,
      in order to assist in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards of living or at
      least restore their living standards, income and production capacity to pre-displacement
      levels.
  ·   Land prices for calculating damage compensations (compensation, support) are
      determined closely with the actual transferred land use right price in the market at normal
      conditions. When there are differences from the actual transferred land use right price,
      land prices for calculating damage compensations shall be appropriately adjusted.
  ·   Compensation for affected dwelling houses and construction sites according to the new
      construction value of damaged dwelling houses and construction sites having technical
      standards equal to dwelling houses are made without discalculate for salvage raw
      materials or depreciation.
  ·   People who, lived, worked and had their assets attached to project affected areas or
      suffered from other damages caused by project implementation prior to the cut-of-date
      are entitled to compensation (compensation, support).
  ·   Resettlement assessment monitoring is regularly executed with the participation of
      affected persons.

    III. PROJECT AFFECTED SCOPE AND INHABITANT STATUS
In recent years, urban and rural area of Nam Dinh province have many innovations as well as
the development of other provinces in the country. The living standard of people in rural area is
better and better. Their demand of infrastructure improvement including clean water supply and
sanitation are necessary. Water supply and sanitation sub-project covering rural communes in
Nam Dinh province will make the satisfied condition for socio-economic development.
The size of Water supply and sanitation sub-projects (RRD-WSSP) is commune or inter-
commune. The pumping station, water tower and water treatment plant have to acquire land for
construction. The delivery and service pipe system is planed to install in road and there is no
effect by land acquisition. Locations of the pumping Station, water tank and water treatment
Plant were considered carefully basing on appropriate technology solution and reducing the
effect by land acquisition to household. Most of area of recovered land for construction is public
land and under administration of commune authority. So, scale affected area by sub-project is
small. There are total of 06 households in 03 communes whose agricultural land will be
recovered and 01 household whose crop plant will be affected. 100% of DH also enjoys official
involvement form project.
                  111.1.     Project affected area and affected persons
