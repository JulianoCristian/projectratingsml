    increase the handling capacity in the ports subsector. The\n            project includes specific developments at the Shanghai port\n            which consist of: (i) the construction of general and\n            multipurpose terminals at Baoshan and Guangang comprising\n            eight berths each; (ii) the construction of two coal\n            handling berths at Zhujiamen; (iii) the reconstruction of\n            four berths at the Minsheng terminal; and (iv) the\n            construction of an 80,000 ton capacity grain silo. Further\n            to this, the project will also finance : (v) the acquisition\n            of cargo handling equipment; (vi) a study to develop a port\n            costing and management information system framework to\n            assist in establishing cost based tariffs; and (vii) a\n            review of the Master Plan of Shanghai port by a panel of experts."}, "docdt": "1988-11-16T00:00:00Z"}
