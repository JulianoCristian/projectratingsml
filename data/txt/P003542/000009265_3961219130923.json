Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Shanghai component of the Ningbo and\n            Shanghai Ports Project in China. The project's main\n            short-term objectives were to help the port of Shanghai\n            increase its cargo handling capacity and efficiency. Despite\n            a delay, project implementation was satisfactory because all\n            objectives were achieved. At completion, the project\n            appeared sustainable. Findings and lessons include the\n            following: (a) Under the project, Shanghai Port Authority\n            (SPA) capably constructed facilities, procured equipment,\n            carried out studies and developed its organization; (b)\n            Project design was relatively straightforward, which helped\n            eliminate the problem of coordinating various agencies; (c)\n            The bid evaluation report, which took considerable time to\n            complete, could have been finalized more quickly if it had\n            provided more detailed information about the bidders'\n            technical deviations to expedite the Bank's review; (d)\n            Forming a joint venture with an experienced terminal\n            operator (SCT) improved productivity and brought modem\n            management techniques to container operations; and (e)\n            Because SPA's operating ratio is increasing, it should\n            focus on: (i) reforming tariffs, (ii) reducing operating\n            costs and increasing the degree of liquidity, (iii) shifting\n            from short- to long-term loans to finance long-term\n            investments, (iv) gaining Government agreement to reform the\n            port's tax obligations, and (v) transferring its\n            non-port-related services to other agencies."}, "docdt": "1996-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
