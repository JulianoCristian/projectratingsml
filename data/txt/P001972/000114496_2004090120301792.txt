     Attention Mrs. R.V.M. Jones-Bos
     Re: REPUBLIC OF NIGER  - Credit No. 1833 NIR (Public
         Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit) Dutch Grant
Dear Mrs. Jones,
     Further to our letter to you dated November 29, 1988 on the
above subject, we acknowledge with great pleasure your letter dated
January 25, 1989, in which you announce an increase in the Grant to
be made available by the Netherlands for the above project, from
four million five hundred thousand guilders to ten million guilders.
     The increased grant will be administered by the Association in
accordance with the "Arrangements for the Administration of certain
funds to be made available by the Minister for Development
Cooperation of the Netherlands", dated December 11, 1986 (the
umbrella Agreement").  Accordingly, it is agreed that the Schedule
to the Umbrella Agreement will be amended by adding the Public
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit to the list of jointly
cofinanced projects, showing the grant amount as 10 million
guilders.  A letter of the formal amendment of the said Schedule,
addressed to the Minister for Development Cooperation of the
Netherlands and duly signed by the Association, is attached for
forwarding to the Minister.
     The entire amount of the Grant has already been deposited in
the T account of the International Development Association with De
Nederlandsche Bank N.V., as specified in the Umbrella Agreement.
The Association intends to enter into a grant agreement with the
Republic of Niger shortly.
     Very truly yours,
                                        Michael J. Gillette
