It provides for the\n            construction of diversion dams, irrigation and drainage\n            facilities and related roads and offices, provision of\n            consulting services to assist NIA in design engineering and\n            training; procurement of vehicles and equipment; and\n            strengthening of the malaria control unit in Palawan.\n            Approximately 11,600 farm families and 900 landless\n            laborers' families, or a total of 74,000 people, would\n            benefit directly from increased production and consequent\n            employment. The project would also create a demand for some\n            12,500 full-time farm-laborer jobs. A total of about 12,000\n            people would be reached under the malaria control component.\n            No implementation problems are anticipated, as NIA is a well\n            managed, competent organization, and has had considerable\n            experience in projects of similar scope."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
