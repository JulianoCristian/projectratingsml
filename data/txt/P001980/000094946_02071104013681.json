is rated as satisfactory, sustainability as\n            likely, institutional development impact as modest, Bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned include: The hybrid\n            financial instrument increased effectiveness in the\n            implementation of sectoral reforms. Cost-sharing in school\n            construction raised implementation and equity issues. Good\n            leadership and sustained commitment to the implementation of\n            measures ensuring improved quality of education are key. The\n            implementation of teacher recruitment reforms requires time,\n            patience, and an adequate risk management strategy.\n            Efficient textbook distribution is key to ensuring\n            availability of books in the classroom. Thorough explanation\n            regarding project activities are of paramount practice.\n            Communications between the coordinating unit and component\n            directors must be comfortable and frequent. Financial\n            management reviewers recommend that a) personnel performance\n            and evaluation procedures should be rigorously followed; and\n            b) the financial management coordination unit produce and\n            publish a quarterly activity report to all involved partners."}, "docdt": "2002-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
