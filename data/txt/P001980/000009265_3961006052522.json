have less than one-third of their children\n            enrolled in primary education.  Although primary school\n            enrollment increased by 73% between 1980 and 1993, due to\n            high population growth, the enrollment coverage in 1993 was\n            only marginally higher than in 1980.  The Government has\n            developed an Emergency Education Rehabilitation Plan (EERP),\n            designed to initiate a transformation of Niger's\n            education system from a small, elitist and costly system\n            into one that is more relevant and equitable.  The project\n            will support implementation of EERP between 1994 and 1999\n            with the objective of increasing the primary school\n            enrollment ratio from 29% to 35%.  The project will achieve\n            this objective by implementing a sector reform program\n            designed to: 1) increase public expenditures on primary\n            education; 2) extend the use of double-shift teaching in\n            primary education; 3) restructure and consolidate training\n            of primary school teachers; 4) consolidate training of\n            secondary school teachers; 5) use teachers more efficiently;\n            and 5) contain student subsidies in secondary and higher\n            education.  The project will also improve access to quality\n            of primary education by constructing classrooms; providing\n            school textbooks; developing and implementing a program to\n            accelerate girl's education; and improving teacher\n            training programs. Finally, the project will strengthen\n            sector managerial and planning capacities by: strengthening\n            the capacity of the Ministry of Education to manage\n            education resources and implement and evaluate education\n            improvement programs; improving the efficiency of\n            decentralized sector planning and management; and preparing\n            a development strategy for higher education."}, "docdt": "1994-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
