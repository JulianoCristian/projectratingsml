"The objectives of the education sector\n            project were satisfactorily achieved in most areas and, on\n            the whole, are likely to be sustained. Key lessons learned\n            include the following. Financial analyses must assess the\n            efficient use of physical and human resources as well. Due\n            to difficulties in coordination community volunteer labor\n            with the supply of materials, future education projects that\n            involve classroom construction should consider\n            nongovernmental organization involvement to organize\n            community labor contributions through contract agreements.\n            Future project should consider the use of a Contract\n            Management Agency, which would be better able to manage\n            numerous small contracts instead of using large national\n            contractors. Thorough and sustained sensitization of parents\n            on the double-shift system is required for public acceptance\n            and appreciation of the cost-effectiveness of the new\n            dimensions of the education system. Capacity building needs\n            to be seen as a broad-based participatory endeavor, in which\n            the stakeholders and beneficiaries learn to maintain project\n            activities. The existence of a national education policy is\n            important in maintaining continuity throughout implementation."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
