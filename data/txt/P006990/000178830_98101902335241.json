project, which is part of the\n            Government's hurricane Emergency Reconstruction\n            Program, would permit the reconstruction of two roads,\n            totalling 150 km. The 86 km Cruce de Guayacanes to Santiago\n            de la Cruz road connects the agricultural north western area\n            to Santiago, the country's second largest city. The 64\n            km Azua-Barahona road links the southwestern part of the\n            country to the capital city. Both roads were scheduled for\n            reconstruction over the 1982-84 period under SEOPC's\n            five-year (1980-84) reconstruction program which was\n            reviewed in May-June 1979 at the time of appraisal of the\n            proposed Second Highway Maintenance and Reconstruction\n            Project. After extensive damage caused by floods that\n            accompanied the hurricanes at the end of August-early\n            September 1979, the reconstruction of these two roads was\n            advanced to 1980-82. Above average project risk could arise\n            from strained SEOPC capacity resulting from additional\n            demands from the reconstruction task. The risk of serious\n            delays and inadequate project management and funding has\n            been reduced by the establishment of a Construction\n            Management Unit with high level expertise, and the creation\n            of a Special Revolving Fund."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
