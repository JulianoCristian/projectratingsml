of\n            Mexico seeks to improve its urban transport sector in\n            services, efficiency, costs, infrastructure and\n            institutional capability.  To that end, the project\n            specifically involves (a) corridor improvements, (b) public\n            transport, and (c) road maintenance.  It further entails (d)\n            traffic system management to improve traffic flow and\n            safety.  The proposed project would demonstrate the\n            cost-effectiveness of an integrated transport management\n            approach, emphasizing increased efficiency in the\n            utilization of existing infrastructure as well as minor\n            infrastructure investments, in two major urban areas of\n            Mexico.  At the same time, the project would strengthen the\n            institutional framework at the federal, as well as local,\n            level to prepare and coordinate a similar approach to\n            transport problems in other urban areas in Mexico."}, "docdt": "1987-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
