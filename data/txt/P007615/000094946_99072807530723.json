of credit)\n            meant that public transport objectives were not achieved.\n            Key lessons learned follow: a) political commitment and\n            changing priorities - projects need to secure political\n            commitment to minimize the risk of component cancellation,\n            and be short enough to safeguard against changing political\n            priorities; b) institutional arrangements for implementation\n            - consultation procedures should be improved, the creation\n            of a professional Traffic Management Unit is essential,\n            focus on institutional strengthening, and the planning\n            agency should have a clear mandate; c) project design - the\n            development of a line of credit must be taken to the\n            \"final scheme\" stage at Appraisal; d) approach to\n            detailed design at appraisal - it should include a\n            representative sample of all types of measures proposed for\n            the project and the co-ordination agency must seek consensus\n            with the new authorities; e) supervision by BANOBRAS\n            (National Bank of Public Works and Services) and the Bank -\n            require a comprehensive review of the Project in relation to\n            its objectives with a detailed action plan to recover\n            overlooked components or policies, and Bank - agency\n            dialogue must be continued; and f) La Venta - Chamapa Toll\n            Road (LVC) - when a completed component's benefits are\n            in doubt, the Bank should influence the borrower to seek\n            remedial actions."}, "docdt": "1999-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
