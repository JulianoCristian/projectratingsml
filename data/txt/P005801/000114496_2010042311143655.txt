                Re: Increase in Disbursement Percentages
Dear sir:
     The International Development Association (the Association has
decided, pursuant to a new policy designed to assist borrowers
affected by the recent Middle East crisis, to temporarily increase
the IDA share of the cost of projects financed under Association
Credits.
           Consequently, the Association proposes, subject to your
confirmation, to hereby amend the Development Credit Agreements
between the Republic of Yemen (the Borrower) and the Association
listed in the Attachment hereto in the manner described in that
Attachment. These amendments will take effect upon receipt of your
confirmation by the Association and will apply to all withdrawals of
the proceeds of the applicable Credits allocated to the categories
listed in the Attachment made on or after September 1, 1990. For
withdrawals made at the existing disbursement percentages between
September 1, 1990 and the date of receipt of your confirmation, the
Borrower may submit supplemental withdrawal applications to the
Association for eligible expenditures reflecting the increased
disbursement percentages, subject to the other provisions of the
respective Development Credit Agreement.
     Subject to the Credit Account being open, these amendments
will be applicable in respect of all withdrawals made by December
31, 1991 or such later date as the Association may establish.
Thereafter, withdrawals shall be made on the basis of disbursement
percentages determined by the Association and notified to you.
     Please confirm your acceptance on behalf of the Borrower of
the foregoing amendments to the listed Agreements by signing and
dating the confirmation form on the enclosed copy of this letter and
returning it to us for our records.
                                     Very truly yours,
