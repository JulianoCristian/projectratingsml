The main objectives of the project\n            were: (i) to increase agricultural productivity and incomes\n            of farmers by means of (a) improved agricultural services,\n            (b) better management of land and water resources and\n            manpower and (c) improved irrigation and agricultural\n            practices; and (ii) to improve the health and nutrition\n            standards of rural families through provision of development\n            opportunities for rural women. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) for a\n            realistic, relevant and practical design and implementation\n            of a regional agricultural development project, a full and\n            active national participation in the entire project cycle is\n            essential; (ii) to improve the effectiveness of project\n            management, the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) should be\n            fully utilized in briefing project management at an earlier\n            stage of implementation on the World Bank (WB) procurement\n            procedures and approach; (iii) effective management of\n            projects that include major institution building and\n            specific socio-economic objectives, necessitates the\n            development and application of qualitative indicators to\n            assess achievement of these objectives, rather than relying\n            solely on delivery of project inputs; (iv) an effective\n            monitoring and evaluation system that incorporates\n            environmental protection and natural resource conservation\n            indicators; (v)extension can only be successful if it can\n            offer sound technical support to farmers; (vi) the strong\n            social issues concerning the role of women in rural\n            development in the Northern Region calls for the adoption of\n            a modest and slow approach over a long time frame; and (vii)\n            design of projects to be implemented in areas of particular\n            difficulty should be simplified to the full extent possible,\n            and, where feasible, sites and activities should be grouped\n            in order to facilitate implementation and supervision."}, "docdt": "1996-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
