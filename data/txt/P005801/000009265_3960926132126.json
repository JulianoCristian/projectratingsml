districts\n            of Sana'a Governorate which have not yet benefitted\n            from the Government's efforts at promoting agricultural\n            development in the country.  The Government attaches high\n            priority to accelerated development of the northern region\n            because of sociopolitical considerations and for ensuring\n            more balanced regional development in the country.\n            Accordingly, the project provides:  (a) agricultural\n            services; (b) agricultural credit; (c) studies for and\n            construction of recharge dams/spate breakers to improve\n            groundwater; and (d) facilities for establishment of O &\n            M.  Lastly, the project includes (e) establishment of\n            project headquarters and facilities and (f) technical\n            assistance and training.  The project will benefit about\n            9,200 farm families or 60,000 people in the northern region\n            through the development of agriculture and improvement in\n            their standard of living through better health and nutrition practices."}, "docdt": "1988-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
