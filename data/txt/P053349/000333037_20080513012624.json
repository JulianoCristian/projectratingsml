Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System\n            (MBRS) Project for Latin America and Caribbean were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: flexibility is needed in designing\n            and allocating budgets to project activities to accommodate\n            unanticipated externalities (such as climate change), to\n            respond to new opportunities, and to meet changes in client\n            needs during implementation. Regional data collection and\n            dissemination should be demand-driven to ensure use of\n            information and markets to pay for it. Alternative\n            livelihoods must be introduced in tandem with restrictions\n            on former resource use and closures on new entrants to the\n            sector to reduce pressure on targeted resources. Training in\n            alternative livelihoods must be accompanied by marketing and\n            incubation of new lines of business. The private sector must\n            be involved in setting codes of conduct for sustainable\n            tourism and in generating investments in greener operations,\n            but to engage the industry effectively, regulatory policies\n            must be aligned with economic incentives. Implementing\n            regional projects to protect Tran's boundary public\n            goods is complicated by: (a) processes and institutional\n            arrangements in the Bank that are designed primarily for\n            single-country operations; (b) differences in client country\n            readiness and capacity; and (c) biases that favor national\n            interests over shared regional ones. Overcoming these\n            barriers requires flexibility in administrative processes,\n            innovative financing to access regional financing and\n            educating stakeholders about the benefits of a regional\n            approach through continuous dialogue, consultation, and outreach."}, "docdt": "2007-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
