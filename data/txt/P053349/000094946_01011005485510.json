unique\n            marine and coastal ecosystems and to assist the countries of\n            Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico to strengthen and\n            coordinate their national efforts for marine ecosystem\n            conservation and sustainable use. In order to mitigate\n            potentially negative consequences, this environmental\n            assessment (EA) suggests the following be considered for the\n            construction and operation of the marine protected areas\n            infrastructure: Construction will take place during the dry\n            season to reduce potential for rain and storm-related\n            erosion/sedimentation and contamination. The construction of\n            the siting structures should avoid clearing and/or draining\n            of mangroves or wetland areas. The EA suggests avoiding\n            excavation/dredging or quarrying of coral rocks and sand,\n            especially along coastal headlands, reefs, and seagrass\n            areas. Construction techniques will include silt barriers\n            and berms to control accelerated erosion and sedimentation\n            of nearby wetland, riparian or coastal areas. To avoid\n            contamination of the surrounding environment with liquid and\n            solid wastes caused by the operation of the facilities, a\n            solid waste management plan will be in place at the\n            initiation of construction. Any oil, grease or fuel should\n            be stored in containers and protected from storms."}, "docdt": "2000-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
