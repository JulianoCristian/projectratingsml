use. The components will: 1)\n            support immediate improvements in marine, and coastal\n            protected areas (MPAs), through planning, management, and\n            monitoring efforts, specifically, through the establishment\n            of a MPA data-baseline, and monitoring programs; the\n            development of management plans for MPAs; supply of basic\n            equipment, and infrastructure for MPA planning; and, a\n            trans-boundary cooperation in policy, protection, and\n            management of MPAs. Capacity building for MPA management\n            will include regional training courses/workshops, namely the\n            Marine Park and Tourism Resource Development Program, and\n            Training Library Development; 2) establish a regional\n            environmental monitoring, and information system (EIS), and,\n            develop a web-based EIS, as tools to organize, and\n            disseminate environmental data on reefs, and ecosystems in\n            the MBRS. Targeted research will support field studies, to\n            include water quality flows, and develop a hydrodynamic\n            surface flow model; 3) promote sustainable fisheries\n            management, through institutional strengthening, and\n            monitoring, and, facilitate sustainable coastal/marine\n            tourism, through policy dialogues, and a cooperative action\n            forum; and, 4) develop public awareness campaigns, provide\n            formal/informal education, supported by the coordination of\n            a regional steering committee, a consultative group, and the\n            program coordination unit."}, "docdt": "2001-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
