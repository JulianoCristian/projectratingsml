It identifies the\n            populations who inhabit, and/or enjoy the area's\n            ecosystem, in particular the impact of their fishing/tourism\n            activities in the barrier reef, to specifically ensure that\n            recommendations concerning indigenous/ethnic populations,\n            are included in the project design. The first part of the\n            SOA describes indigenous/ethnic populations, with a special\n            section analyzing the role of women. The second part,\n            reviews potential risks, and perceptions of local\n            populations regarding recent regional developments.\n            Recommendations include supportive indigenous participation\n            - Indigenous Development and Participatory Plan - in the\n            conservation of the barrier reef ecosystem, focusing on\n            specific actions to protect in particular, the livelihoods\n            of the poorest, and women. Specific recommendations suggest:\n            support income generation alternatives through the promotion\n            of ecotourism, and related handicrafts, providing technical\n            assistance, and initial subsidies; develop educational and\n            vocational training within the formal, and non-formal\n            educational system; promote sustainable land uses for\n            improved urban, and housing development; improve fishing\n            practices within international standards; facilitate\n            women's participation through institutional training;\n            and, include appropriate indigenous populations' land\n            tenure rights within the project's framework."}, "docdt": "2000-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
