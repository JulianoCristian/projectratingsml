Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Economic Recovery Loan or Credit (ERL)\n            in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. ERL aimed to\n            support the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's\n            program of stabilization and structural reforms by helping\n            to finance the costs associated with the restructuring of\n            the economy and facilitating the clearance of the\n            country's arrears with the Bank. The structural reform\n            program focussed on initial measures in: (a) fiscal\n            restructuring and retrenchment; (b) banking sector reform;\n            (c) privatization, enterprise restructuring and private\n            sector development; and (d) liberalization of the labor\n            market and adjustment of the social safety net. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was highly satisfactory.  The key lessons learned were as\n            folows: (a) the objectives of facilitating arrears clearance\n            with the Bank and supporting economic reforms should be\n            clearly distinguished and probably separated; (b) When\n            dealing with a new member state, the Bank needs to be very\n            careful about the signals it gives; (c) when a country is\n            committed to reforms, it will implement them with or without\n            conditionality; (d) difficult and painful reforms can be\n            implemented only with strong political support; and (e)\n            where institutions are weak, adjustment operations have to\n            be accompanied by technical assistance to ensure that the\n            country has the required expertise to implement agreed reforms."}, "docdt": "1996-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
