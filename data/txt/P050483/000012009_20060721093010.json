impacts, in addition to\n            unsatisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            Among the many lessons learned it is suggested a\n            multi-sector area-based program requires a functional\n            decentralized policy framework, and a supportive\n            management/administrative structure. In addition, where\n            institutional capacity is limited, project design and\n            implementation arrangements should be kept simple. The\n            project proved to be difficult to implement because the\n            design included several sectors, and the project was\n            implemented through several Government ministries and\n            agencies. Innovative programs need to be assessed and\n            institutionalized before scaling-up. A more rigorous\n            assessment and institutionalization of the innovative\n            area-based program would have provided a sounder basis for\n            scaling up the program in the form of the Child Development\n            Project. Most importantly, investing time and resources on\n            community preparedness contributes to the sustainability and\n            impact of community-based initiatives. The project\n            illustrated that initiatives that respond to\n            community-defined priorities (like the water schemes and\n            community schools in this case) have a better chance of\n            being sustained, whereas initiatives that are largely\n            supply-driven and through vertical programs (in this case\n            the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) and\n            Community Based Nutrition (CBN) require activities to create\n            the demand in order to increase service utilization."}, "docdt": "2006-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
