the efficiency and\n            accountability of the Mongolian government; and 2) to set up\n            a more effective, nondistortive system of government revenue\n            mobilization. There are two components. The first, the\n            government financial management component, finances advisory\n            services and training in government accounting, treasury\n            debt and cash management, auditing, management skills and\n            related disciplines. Based on a defined needs assessment,\n            the project assists in implementing an improved core\n            government financial management system. The project provides\n            technical assistance and later, computer equipment and\n            software, office equipment, and training facilities to\n            assist the authorities in designing, developing, testing,\n            and implementing processes, procedures, systems, and related\n            regulations. The second component introduces the VAT\n            (value-added tax) on goods and services by finalizing\n            implementing regulations, formulating and implementing a\n            publicity campaign, developing a detailed plan to inform\n            taxpayers, formulating, printing, and distributing guideline\n            materials; tax administration operations including forming\n            and implementing detailed plans for policy interpretation,\n            taxpayer registration, tax accounting and reporting, tax\n            auditing, and forming and developing an information exchange\n            between tax administration and customs."}, "docdt": "1998-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
