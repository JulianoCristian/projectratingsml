It would provide for the planting of\n            windbreaks in typhoon-prone areas and intercropping in\n            immature rubber. It would also include modernization of\n            machinery and transport fleets on state farms, construction\n            or upgrading of sawmills and timber utilization facilities,\n            construction of housing, administrative and service\n            buildings and the construction or upgrading of road links\n            within state farms.
