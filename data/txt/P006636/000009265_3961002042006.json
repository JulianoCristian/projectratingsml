(b) enhance the\n            institutional capacity and effectiveness of the Agricultural\n            Development Institute and the Ministry of National Property;\n            and (c) foster small-farmer access to commercial markets for\n            their products and factors of production, and to\n            publicly-sponsored agricultural development programs.  The\n            project will include: (a) technology transfer, involving\n            both farm-oriented extension and home-centered assistance\n            (family kitchen gardens, and water treatment, improved diets\n            and cooking methods, awareness of education and health\n            services); (b) complementary credit for working capital\n            which is consistent with technology transfer initiatives;\n            (c) land titling; (d) a rural communication system to\n            improve the dissemination of information related to small\n            farmer production and social services; and (e) institutional\n            strengthening.  The main benefits will be : (a) increased\n            on-farm productivity and family incomes and improved\n            welfare; (b) improved and more cost-effective agricultural\n            services; (c) improvement in the credit-worthiness of\n            subsistence farmers; and (d) better targeting of public\n            services, including improvement of services to women farmers."}, "docdt": "1992-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
