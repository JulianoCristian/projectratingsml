PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUATEhALA: SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1104-GU)
PREFACE
This report covers the Second Telecommunications Project in
Guatemala supported by Loan 1104-GU. The loan of $26.0 million to the
Empresa Guatemalteca de Telecomunicaciones (GUATEL) was approved in April
1975, became effective in November 1975 and was closed in June 1984, five
years after the original closing date.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared in the Industry
Department of the World Bank on the basis of information and data provided
by GUATEL and gathered by a project completion mission which visited
Guatemala during July 1985.
In accordance with the revisLd procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard Procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower and Executing Agency for comments. The comments received
are reproduced as Attachment 1.

PROJECT COMWLETION REPORT
GUATEMALA: SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1104-GU)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Second Telecommunications Project in Guatemala comprised the
first phase (1975-1978) of the Second Development Plan of the Empresa
Guatemalteca de Telecomunicaciones (GUATEL). The project was to expand and
improve telephone and telex services and GUATEL's training facilities. It
followed the initiative of the first project (Ln 792-GU) in attempting to
meet the considerable unsatisfied demand for telecommunications services.
2.        The project was cbmpleted in June 19841/, 5-1/2 years behind the
original schedule. The targeted capacity expansTon was only reached in 1984,
and connections reached only 91% of the target due to a shortage of cables
(para 3.06). Due to the implementation delay, only about 38% of demand was
satisfied by end December 1984. The quality of service has generally
improved, although peak hour congestion continues in some capital area
exchanges.
3.        The major causes of implementation delays were.
(a) procurenient was substantially completed only by the end of
1978 due to management changes, delayed cable network design
completion and the 1976 earthquake which required GUATEL to
divert all its resources to repair network damage (para 3.04);
(b) slippage in the commission of the new analog (SPC) exchanges
(57,000 lines) due to software problems (para 3.06 and Annex
7);
(c) the initial supply of cables from one manufacturer, comprising
about 50% of requirements did not meet specifications, and
substitutes were only delivered during 1981 and 1982 (para
3.06);
(d) GUATEL had insufficient foreign exchange to finance the total
cable requirements (para 3.06); and
(e) the appointment of consultants to assist in the design of
the Guatemala City multiexchange network was delayed to June
1976 and the design was only completed by December 1976 (para
3.15).
Implementation delays were aggravated by frequent changes in
GUATEL's senior and mid-level management.
1/ Acceptance testing of equipment was completed by this date, but the Bank
honored loan withdrawal applications until September 30, 1984 (para.
3.07).



- vi -
4.        Despite the delays, project costs only increased by about 17% over
the appraisal estimate (pars 3.10). Financial eerformance was satisfactory,
and, after payment of a 45% de facto income taxi, net internal cash
generation averaged about 51% of investments over 1975-84. The internal
financial rate of return for the 1975-1984 investment program of 16% compares
favorably with the appraisal estimate of 18% (para 7.04).
5.        Technical and administrative training programs were developed (para
6.03) and financial staff training began in 1983 and is continuing under the
third project (Ln 2385 GU). Lessons were learned by GUATEL regarding
procurement and planning. The organizational structure and financial
management are being strengthened under the third project. Learning from
past errors, in the third project, the Bank required that all bids for major
components of the Bank fina-nced subproject were received by loan
effectiveness (para 8.02). Furthermore, bid specifications required that
equipment be field proven (para 8.03).
6.        Further expansion of the telecommunications network in Guatemala
depends on the expansion of the implementation capacity of GUATEL. This is
being addressed under the third project.
2/ As a Government-owned entity, GUATEL is required to transfer 45% of
adjusted annual net income to government (para 5.08).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
GUATEMALA: SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 1104-GU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      All telecommunications services in Guatemala (except domestic
telegraphs) are provided by the Empresa Guatemalteca de Telecomunicaciones
(GUATEL), a state owned autonomous entity. The domestic telegraph service
is operated by the Direccion General de Correos y Telegrafos (DGCT), a
government department which also operates the postal service. Overall
telecommunications secto-. policy is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Communications and Public Works, and coordination of sector investment
under the national economic plan rests with the National Planning Council
(CONAPLAN). The Minister of Communications is the chairman of GUATEL's
Board of Directors (para 6.01). Day-to-day administration is conducted by
the General Manager appointed by the President of the Republic of
Guatemala.
1.02      The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector
in Guatemala since 1971 through three loans.  The first loan (Ln792-GU),
effective January 1972, of $16.0 million was closed in December 1978. A
project completion report was issued in May 1979. In April 1975, the Bank
approved a second loan (LnllO4-GU) of $26.0 million to GUATEL, with the
Republic of Guatemala as guarantor. This was closed in June 19843/ and is
the subject of this report.  A third loan (Ln2385-GU) for $30.0 million was
approved in March 1984, and is due to be closed by June 30, 1989.
1I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND COVENANTS
Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiations
2.01      In 1973 the Government of Guatemala approached the Bank for
assistance in financing the foreign cost of the first phase (1975-1978) of
the Second Telecommunications Development Plan (1975-1981) prepared by
GUATEL. The project was appraised in June 1974 and negotiations took place
in February 1975. The Bank's Executive Directors approved the loan on
April 15, 1975. The loan agreement was signed on April 29, 1975 and became
effective on November 25, 1975.
Project Objectives
2.02      The project, which covered the first phase (1975-1978) of
GUATEL's Second Development Plan (1975-1981), was estimated to cost
Quetzales (Q) 45.86 million ($45.86 million) with a foreign exchange
component of Q 32.86 million ($32.86 million). The project objectives were
to: (a) improve the quality of existing services by relieving congestion;
(b) meet part of the considerable unsatisfied demand for telephone service;
(c) extend and improve telex service; (d) extend rural telecommunications
services to an additional 86 communities; and (e) expand GUATEL's training
facilities.
3/ The Bank honored withdrawal applications until September 30, 1984 (para
3.07).



Project Description
2.03      The project comprised expansion of:
(a)  the telephone network capacity by 82,900 exchange lines, and
the associated expansion of the cable network, and
distribution facilities to connect 60,000 additional direct
exchange lines (DELS);
(b) long distance facilities through microwave, UHF/VHF radio,
cable and open wire systems to provide 722 additional trunk
rhannels;
(c) the capacity of the international telephone exchange by 600
circuits, and installation of a new main trunk exchange with
a final capacity of 3,000 circuits, equipped for 1,200
circuits to cater to traffic growth and further
implementation of subscriber dialing;
(d) the rural telephone system to cover 86 additional locations
via UHF/VHF radio systems;
(e) the telex network by 250 lines; and
(f) training facilities, including appointment of instructors
and technical consultants and purchase of training equipment
for the training center.
Project Cost Estimate
2.04      The project cost was estimated at $45.86 million with a foreign
exchange component of $32.86 million. Of the foreign exchange component,
IBRD was to finance $26.0 million, CABEI $4.96 million, and GUATEL $1.9
million. The local cost of $13.0 million equivalent was to be financed by
GUATEL.
Covenants
2.05      In addition to the Bank's standard covenants on procurement,
management and reporting, the main covenants in the Loan Agreement (under
the relevant sections indicated) provided that GUATEL shall:
(a)  engage experts to assist in planning its training facilities and
in designing the multi-exchange network in Guatemala City
[Section 3.02 (a)];
(b) review with the Bank, within 60 days from the effective date of
the Bank loan, the proposals prepared by the experts
[Section 3.02 (b)];
(c) achieve a ratio of not more than 24 employees per 1,000
telephones by June 30,  1977 [Section 4.01 (b)];



- 3 -
(d) have its accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year
audited by independent auditors and furnish copies of the audited
financial statements and the auditors' reports to the Bank within
four months of the end of each fiscal year [Section 5.021;
(e) not undertake capital expenditures for any "major expansion"
(expected to exceed in any on year Ql million or 5% of the
previous year's capital expenditures, whichever is the higher)
before the closing date of the loan unless a financing plan has
been approved by the Bank [Section 5.04];
(f) take all necessary action to maintain its telecommunications
tariffs at levels to:
(i)  provide (after debt service and participations) in 1975,
1976, 1977 and 1978 funds from internal sources equivalent
to not less than 6%, 10%, 10% and 8% repsectively of the
total value of GUATEL's fixed assets related to
telecommunications operations, including work in progress
[Section 5.05(a)]; and
(i4i) produce an annual rate of return on the current value of
average net fixed assets in service of at least 11%,
starting with FY1979 [Section 5.06 (a)]; and
(g) not incur any debt unless net revenues are at least 1.5 times the
maximum debt service requirement for any succeeding year
[Section 5.07].
The status of compliance of the covenants is indicated in Annex 10. The
Borrower (GUATEL) complied with the covenants in paras (a), (e), (f), and
(g).   The appointment of experts was delayed until June 1976, so the
review (b) was delayed (para 3.15). The staff ratio of 24 employees per
1,000 telephones (c) was not achieved until 1980 and there were
considerable delays in submitting the audited financial statements (d)
until FY 1981.
2.06      The Guarantee Agreement provided that the Government of Guatemala
(the Guarantor) shall:
(a) pay GUATEL a tariff for services comparable to that applied
to commercial users (Section 3.02); and
(b) establish procedures to enable GUATEL to offset accounts
receivable from Government against its statutory
participation in GUATEL's profits (45%) (Section 3.03).
The Government complied with these covenants.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up
3.01      The Loan Agreement specified August 28, 1975, as the terminal
date of loan effectiveness. The conditions for loan effectiveness were
corporate and congressional ratification of:
(a) two loans from CABEI for an aggregate amount of $2.76
million equivalent [Section 8.01 (a)];
(b) a Q5 million bond issue [Section 8.01 (b)]; and
(c) GUATEL's authority to charge its profit and loss account
with the debt service (principal and financial charges) on
these new borrowings [Section 8.01 (c)].
Conditions (a) and (b) were satisfied by the specified date, but there were
delays in congressional approval of the Bank loan and enactment of the
necessary legislation to satisfy condition (c). Consequently, the loan was
declared effective on November 25, 1975, about seven months after signing.
Procurement
3.02      Procurement action commenced briskly and GUATEL staff visited
Washington several times to discuss bid documents and have them cleared.
Bid documents for swit ning and cables (part requirements) were submitted
to the Bank for approval in June 1975. Tenders for this equipment,
telephone instruments and teleprinters were invited in October and November
1975. However, modifications proposed by the Bank were not incorporated in
the bid documents before issue and bid opening dates were therefore
postponed to March 1976 to allow bidders adequate time to receive and study
the amendments to the documents.
3.03      Problems arose with regard to the teleprinter tender.  GUATEL
decided to reject all offers based on their assessment of compliance with
bidding documents and call for fresh bids. After some lengthy
correspondence (particularly with relation to the strict application of
certain requirements under the local Decreto 11-71 which the Bank
considered as non-substantive), the Bank agreed to a rebid on condition
that the above requirements be made more explicit. Fresh offers were
received in September 1977, but difficulties then arose with GUATEL's
decision to award the contract to a Japanese firm, based on the choice of
an inappropriate date for determining the exchange rate of the bid
currencies. In 1980, the Bank iiformed GUATEL that it would not finance
this item under the loan. However, in view of extenuating circumstances,
the amount ($0.68 million) was reallocated.
3.04      There were no other major procurement problems, but processing
delays resulted from the 6-10 month diversion of GUATEL's resources to
repair damage to the telecommunications network by the February 1976
earthquake, changes in senior and middle management in August 1976, and
from delays in the design of the Guatemala City multi-exchange network.



- 5 -
The consultants who were to assist GUATEL in the planning of this network
were only hired in June 1976 and completed the design in December 1976.
Contracts for items totalling about $17.7 million (69% of the ioan amount)
were signed by September 1977. By September 1978, 96% of the loan was
committed and the loan was fully committed by March 1980.
Project Revision
3.05       Minor adjustments were made in capacities and locations of
exchanges to meet demand and increased traffic load over the exte.lded
project period. Some of the changes were necessitated by changes in
population and centers of commelvee, following the February 1976 earthquake
(see PCR for First Telecommunications Project, Loan 792-GU). The
additional exchanges (11) and net additional line capacity (10,100) were
financed as additional works outside the project.
Implementation
3.06       At appraisal, the project was scheduled for completion by
December 31, 1978. A seven month slippage to July 1979 was noted as early
as August 1977. Procurement delays resulted in the closing date being
postponed to July 1980 at the end of 1978. The major cause of delay,
subsequent to this, was the serious slippage in the commissioning of the
foreign supply of the new analog Stored Program Control (SPC) exchanges
(57,000 lines) in Guatemala City, Antigua and Amatitlan due to software
problems (see Annex 7).4/ The installation of cables was also delayed
since the cables initially delivered in May 1979, by a major cable supplier
under the project, did not meet the specifications. Negotiations with the
supplier were protracted since the changes in production techniques
required to meet desired specifications would have resulted in price
increases. The supplier and GUATEL agreed in June 1980, with Bank
approval, to some minor changes in shield specifications that did not
affect the basic electrical characteristics of the cable. Supplies, at the
original price, were delivered during 1981 and 1982. This met only 80% of
requirements as the order had been reduced due to shortage of funds under
the Bank loan [para 3.10(b)]. Procurement of the remaining 20% of the
cables, to be financed from GUATEL's ownI resources, was processed and an
order placed in 1983. However, the purchase of this cable was deferred due
to a foreign exchange shortage. This problem of deferred cable purchase
was only made clear to the Bank during the completion mission (July 1985).
The shortfall is being made up during implementation of the third project.
As a result of the shortfall in cables, GUATEL could only reach 91% of the
targeted subscriber connections. The reduced traffic handling capacity of
the new SPC exchanges (Annex 7) has reduced the effective exchange capacity
added under the project by about 9,200 lines to 73,700 lines.
3.07       The project was substantially completed by June 1982, but
outstanding problems with the operation of the new SPC equipment delayed
the closing date to June 29, 1984. Application withdrawals were, however,
honored until September 30, 1984 since acceptance testing was only
completed in May 1984. The remaining loan balance, US$228,457, was
cancelled effective October 3, 1984.
4/ The remaining 25,900 lines of cross-bar equipment were installed
without problems.



-6-
Cofinancing
3.08      To complete financing for the first project, Congressional
approval was obtained, as a condition of loan effectiveness (para 3.01),
for a Q5.0 million bond issue and for a supplemental loan from CABEI for
$0.6 million. Congressional approval was also granted at that time for a
$2.16 million CABEI loan for the second project to mainly support expansion
of the iuter-urban network. Expansion of international facilities was
supported by complementary CABEI loans effective in 1977 and 1979 for about
$6.4 million.   Total borrowings from CABEI amounted to $9.5 million (para
5.07) during the second project period.
Project Costs
3.09      A comparison of the cost of the project, as estimated at
appraisal and the actual cost as of December 31, 1984 is summarized below.

- 7 -
3.10      Actual total costs increased by about 17%.  The main reasons for
the cost variations are:
(a) Local Costs - Actual local costs at $19.76 million
equivalent increased 52% over the estimated $13.0 million,
primarily due to increases in the local network cost.
Subsequent to appraisal, the 25,000 lines increase in the
Monte Verde exchange was divided between two
exchanges--Monte Verde II(15,000 lines) and Lourdes (10,000
lines). The cost of ducting and cable installation
consequently increased by about $2.0 million. Further,
there were modifications in the routing of the junction
network following the consultant's study of the
multi-exchange network of Guatemala City. This increased
the cost of ducting by about $3.0 million.
(b) Foreign Costs - The overall increase in total foreign
exchange cost is negligible (about 3%). However, there was
a cost overrun of 43% in local switching, due to the
purchase of interconnecting equipment at existing exchanges
for interfacing with the new electronic (SPC) exchanges.
The decision to purchase SPC exchanges instead of
conventional crossbar exchanges was taken subsequent to
appraisal, with Bank approval, and resulted in a cost
increase of about $4.1 million. 'The loan amount could not
cover the full foreign cost of cables required for the
second project ($11.96 million) and GUATEL was expected to
finance the difference from its own resources. Procurement
action was completed, but due to the deteriorating foreign
exchange position of the country, GUATEL was unable to raise
sufficient foreign exchange and the delivery of cables for
12,000 lines ($2.1 million) has been deferred (para 3.06).
The total cost of cables ordered, if fully delivered, would
have thus totalled $10.53 million - an effective underrun
from the original estimate of $11.96 million of only 12%.
The 68% increase in the foreign cost of rural telephony
($1.09 million estimated, $1.8 million actual) was mainly
due to the decision to purchase jelly-filled cables instead
of ordinary cables. The 48% decrease in foreign exchange
costs of training and consultants reflects the ITU
assistance for the development of the training center and
inclusion of training equipment in the contracts for the
main equipment (para 3.14).
Other differences in costs may be explained by price
differentials.
Disbursement

withdrawal applications until. September 30, 1984 (para 3.07).
2/ The balance, $228,457, was cancelled effective October 3,
1984.
3.12      The slow disbursement reflects the delays in start-up and
implementation (paras 3.02-3.06). In addition, the appraisal estimate of
disbursement was optimistic since the project was expected to be completed
in three years (by June 1978), although procurement action had not been
initiated and consultants to finalize the network design for Guatemala
City, on which cable procurement depended, had not been hired.

1/ As of September 16, 1982.
2/ $228,457 was cancelled effective October 31, 1984. Although the loan
was officially closed on June 29, 1984, the Bank honored withdrawal
applications up to September 30, 1984.
3.14      As a rasult of the cost overrun on the local telephone
network, the Bank increased the allocation to category 1 in September
1982. The revised allocation to category 1 ($22,865,300) represents the
total contract amount, less the 10% retention payment on the ITT-North
contract ($1,146,970), due after the equipment had been installed and
operated satisfactorily for one year. This was covered in category 5
(unallocated). Although the amount available ($1,024,864) was less than
the 10% retention payment normally due, it was estimated to be sufficient
as GUATEL expected to claim contractual penalties for delays in
commissioning of the equipment. The amount allocated under category 3 was
reallocated as the Bank did not approve GUATEL's contract award for
teleprinters (para 3.03). Expenditures under category 4 were for ITU
consultants to assist GUATEL in design of the cable network for the
multi-exchange system of Guatemala City. Disbursements were limited under
category 4 as GUATEL obtained ITU assistance for development of the
training center and training equipment was included in the contracts for
the main equipment. The final loan allocation differed slightly from the
revised 1982 allocation, as indicated in the last column of Table 3.3. An
amount of $228,456.93 was cancelled, effective October 3, 1984.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower.
3.15      At appraisal, it was agreed that GUATEL would employ qualified
consultants to assist in the design of the Guatemala City multi-exchange
network and, within 60 days from loan effectiveness, review with the Bank,
the proposals prepared by the consultants. There was considerable delay in
selecting the consultants. Finally in April 1976, at GUATEL's request, the



- 10 -
Bank agreed to finance the services of two ITU experts for this assignment
for 6 months from June to December 1976. These experts, who had been
working in Guatemala tinder an ITU assignment which was terminating and were
familiar with the network, carried out their assignment satisfactorily.
3.16      The performance of suppliers under all contracts other than those
for the foreign SPC switching equipment and the major cable supplier was
satisfactory. Cables supplied initially did not meet the specifications
with regard to the width of the aluminium shield and some minor changes in
specifications were finally agreed to (para 3.06). There were serious
problems regarding the electronic exchanges (see Annex 7). Although the
exchanges began functioning in 1981, they could not operate at full
capacity and the quality of service was poor. The exchanges were
provisionally accepted by GUATEL in September 1984 and in June 1985 were
loaded to about 62%. Substantial revenue losses were incurred by GUATEL
and the supplier agreed to pay compensation of $4.0 million.
3.17      GUATEL's overall performance was adequate, but organizational
efficiency would have been higher if frequent, often politically
motivated, changes in senior and mid-level management had not occurred.
There were two changes of top management in 1976 and one change in 1978,
1982 and 1983. These changes affected mid-level management and financial
and engineering staff to varying degrees. GUATEL submitted regular
progress reports to the Bank on project execution.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      At appraisal, GUATEL expected to increase the capacity of main
exchanges from 43,130 lines (end 1973) to 164,140 (end of 1978) and DELs
from 40,339 to 128,783. Part of this increase (38,110 lines capacity and
28,364 DELs) was to be achieved under the ongoing first project which was
completed three-and-a-half years behind schedule in December 1978.
Implementation of the second project was also behind schedule. By December
31, 1978, the original completion date for the second project, installed
capacity had only reached 62% of the targeted figure and only 58% of the
DELs were in operation (see Annex 1). The targeted capacity was reached in
1984; however, only 91% of target DELs were connected due to a shortage of
cables (para 3.06).
4.02      GUATEL planned to meet about 80% of demand by the end of the
second project in 1978, to reduce the average waiting period for service to
about 11 months and to reduce the waiting list to about 32,000.  Due to the
5-1/2 year delay in implementation, only about 38% of demand was satisfied
by the end of the second project in 1984 and the current waiting period is
estimated to be about 10 years.  Unmet demand has increased from about
72,000 subscribers at the beginning of the second project in 1975 to abort
190,000 at the end of the second project.  The estimation of demand is,
however, subject to -ancertainties.  Demand estimates were revised in 197.
and were reviewed by ITU in preparation of the Master Plan in 1980.  GUArEL
does not encourage prospective subscribers to apply for service, as it has



- 11 -
not been able to accommodate the applicants already on the waiting list.
The current waiting list does not accurately represent expressed demand and
the validity of GUATEL's assumptions in demand forecasting have not been
verified. Provision has been made under the third project for technical
assistance in demand forecasting. Despite the deteriorating unmet demand
position, telephone density improved from about 0.69 DELs per 100
inhabitants in 1974 to about 1.4 in 1984.
4.03      Under the project, service was extended to 118 rural communities
(137% of target). This was the first time that rural telecommunication8
were developed in Guatetaala and the extension of telecommunications to
these areas has aided their economic development. For example, several
private enterprises were encouraged to install factories in the area around
Chimaltenango.
4.04      At appraisal, GUATEL estimated that domestic long distance
traffic would increase at an annual rate of 20% and international traffic
at 30%. Actual annual growth was more than 40% for national traffic but
only 15% for international. Revenues exceeded appraisal estimates for all
years. Thus, for 1979 (the last year for appraisal estimates), revenues
were 30% greater and the net operating income was 97% greater than SAR
estimates. In real terms, operating revenues increased at an annual
compound rate of 10.6% and operating expenses at 9.8% over 1975-1983. The
number of telex subscribers increased at 16% per annum from 260 at end 1974
to 1,176 at end 1984. International telex traffic also grew at about the
same rate.
4.C5      The quality of service has generally improved.  However, some
exchanges in the capital area are congested during the peak hours, the
worst being El Carmen and Lourdes which serve largely industrial areas.
Access to service in the rural areas has improved with the extension of the
network and the provision of more public call telephones. The subscribers
in the interior (18% of total) originate more than 55% of the traffic,
corresponding to a traffic level per subscriber which is 5 times that
originated by a subscriber in the capital area.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01      Guatel's financial performance throughout the project period was
satisfactory. However, project implementation delays (paras 3.06, 3.07)
and frequent changes in accounting procedures and inadequate external
audits until 1980 complicate the comparison of actual performance with that
projected at appraisal.
Accounting
5.02      GUATEL's accounting system anc. procedures continue to have
deficiencies, particularly with regard to work in progress, capitalization
of interest, and the definition of cash and banks. However, GUATEL
introduced several changes at the Bank's recommendation during the
preparation of the third project. Further improvements are necessary to



- 12 -
ensure that accounting practices are acceptable and consistently applied.
GUATEL revalued its assets5/ as of December 31, 1980 and they were updated
in subsequent years. In tEe analysis they have been revalued at 6% p.a.
from 1980 onwards. In 1983, the manager of the Finance Department was
replaced with an externally recruited qualified accountant. Manual
processing of accounts, except billing, places a great burden on the
staff. However, GUATEL's 1984-1987 investment program intends to provide
data processing ability. Technical assistance is being provided under the
third project for training financial staff in data processing and
accounting.
Audit
5.03      GUATEL's accounts are subject to an internal audit and to a
control-of-payments audit by a government auditor, the Contraloria de
Cuentas. At the beginning of the project, the accounts were also audited
by external auditors.   For several years, to save staff time, GUATEL
experimented with government auditors performing the external audit.
However, this was unsuccessful since it resulted in the application of
unusual accounting procedures and frequent changes in these procedures.
Until 1981, there was often a delay in the receipt of audit reports.
Effective 1980, with Bank encouragement, GUATEL again engaged a firm of
external auditors. Furthermore, to improve supervision of the Finance
Department, GUATEL completely restaffed its internal auditing unit in early
1983. Three qualified CPAs were recruited as managers. The delay in
receipt of audits consequently decreased considerably from eight months in
1980 to four months in 1984. Technical assistance provided under the third
project to improve GUATEL's financial systems will contribute to reducing
this delay further.
Financial Performance
5.04      GUATEL's income statements and balance sheets for FYs 1975-1983
are presented in Annexes 2 and 3 and summarized in Table 5.1. The
financial performance of GUATEL has generally been satisfactory. Although
the rate of return on revalued assets, calculated after payment of the
equivalent of a 45% income tax (para 5.08), fell slightly below the
covenanted rate of 11% in 1982 and 1983, this was primarily due to a large
increase in non-performing assets; the new analog SPC exchanges until
recently generated low revenues due to technical problems, but high
depreciation charges (para 3.06). GUATEL increased net operating revenues
by about Q3.5 million or 7% during 1983 by tariff related measures (para
5.08), halting the decline in operating revenues per DEL and in the rate of
return. The rate of return for 1984 is provisionally estimated at 12.3%.
Over the project period (1975-1983), operating revenue/DEL in real terms
grew at 10.6% p.a., and operating expenses/DEL in real terms grew at 9.8%
p.a. DELs increased at about 11% p.a. over the project period, not 25%
p.a. as expected at appraisal. Operating revenues in real terms, grew at
12.9% p.a. on domestic calls and at 11.5% p.a. on international calls. The
operating ratio improved slightly from 78% to 74% over the period.
5/ Based on a 1981 revaluation study, approved by the Bank.

5.05      Cash flow remained satisfactory over the project period.  Net
internal cash generation, as a percentage of construction requirements,
averaged about 52% from 1975-1984, which is satisfactory. Debt service
coverage was also satisfactory at an average of 2.6 times over the period.
5.06      The exchange rate between the Quetzal and the US dollar remained
unchanged over the period. The consumer price level increased by about
105% from 1975-1984. Fixed assets were revalued in 1981.6/ The current
ratio declined in 1976-1978, reflecting the impact of the February 1976
earthquake (para 3.04), which caused considerable damage to GUATEL's cable
network. It has since been restored to acceptable levels.
Sources and Applications of Funds
5.07      GUATEL's funds flow statements over the project period are shown
in Annex 4 and summarized in Table 5.2 below. Net internal cash generation
averaged about 52% of investments over the whole period and improved to
about 70% over 1980-83 alone. This was satisfactory and well above the
covenanted levels for internal cash generation as a percentage of total net
fixed assets (para 2.05). External financing requirements were met by the
Bank (23.9%), CABEI (6.3%), and others, including Government. Bonds for
Qj.0 million were also issued, representing 3.4% of financing.
5.08      As a Government owned entity, GUATEL is required to transfer 45%
of adjusted annual net income7/ to government as "participations". To
minimize the impact of this de facto income tax on GUATEL's cash flow,
participations for 1975-1978 were not paid but accrued as a liability of
Q11.4 million to be repaid over 1984-1989. This is recorded in the Balance
Sheet as part of long-term debt. Furthermore, in 1979, Government and
GUATEL agreed that the Government would refund, as an equity contribution,
up to 100% of GUATEL's annual transfers over 1979-82, amounting to Q21.8
million and shown in the funds flow statement as government contributions.
During negotiations for the third project, tne Government abrogated the
1979 agreement retroactively to 1982. Thus, as of 1982, GUATEL has resumed
payment of the 45% participations to government and has made an early down
payment of Q2 million on its 1976-78 debt of Q11.4 million.

Tariffs
5.09      Faced with a difficult liquidity situation, GUATEL's Board of
Directors decided to increase telephone and telegraph tariffs in 1978.
Installation fees were increased by about 35%, monthly rentals by about 33%
for residential and 50% for non-residential and the cost of additional
pulses was doubled. International rates were increased between 20-50%.
These measures increased total revenues by about 15%. To halt a declining
trend in operating revenue/DEL and in the rate of return, at the end of
1982 GUATEL:
(a) increased installation fees by 48% effective January 1,
1983;
(b) reclassified 3,100 subscribers from residental to commercial
category; and
(c) abolished unlimited free pulses for local calls for
subscribers on ITT-North exchanges.
These measures increased revenues by about Q3.5 million or 7% in 1983.
These changes and the current tariff levels are presented in Annex 8.
5.10      The decline in the rate of return led the Bank to recommend an
increase of tariffs in 1984 based on the preliminary results of an ongoing
tariff study. However, this study9/ was delayed and no tariff action was
taken in 1984. Current financial projections indicate that the rate of
return for FY 86-88 would not meet the level of 13%, covenanted under the
third project.10/ A Bank supervision mission (July 1985) requested GUATEL
to propose a p iIn of action to the Bank using the results of the tariff
study, to maintain satisfactory financial performance.
Accounts Receivable
5.11      Accounts receivable as of the end of 1974 were equivalent to 3
months of billing and to 2.7 months of billing in 1983. This level is
satisfactory. As agreed during negotiations, the Government established
procedures to enable GUATEL to offset Government receivables against
Government participations.1"! GUATEL has a computerized monthly billing
cycle, with payment due one month after the billing date. Disconnection
procedures are enforced, keeping receivables to a satisfactory level.
9/  Financed under the third project.
10/ The rate of return covenant under the second project was 11%.
11/ Although GUATEL is exempt from taxes, 45% of annual net profits must be
set aside for distribution to Government (45%). 5% of annual net
profits must be distributed in cash to employees.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.01      GUATEL is administered by a five member Board of Directors,
chaired by the Minister of Communications, and day-to-day business is
conducted by the General Manager, assisted by a Deputy. Early in the
project period, the management made several organizational changes to
increase effectiveness and improve coordination. A coordination commission
was established under the direction of the Deputy Manager and two new
divisions for civil works and training were created. However, in the two
years following August 1976, two rapid senior management changes had
repercussions at middle management level and led to the loss of several
senior operational staff. Poor internal communications and work procedures
also resulted in poor coordination of construction and considerable delays
in the utilization of installed assets. These management problems were
repeatedly highlighted by Bank supervision missions. Improvements were
apparent from late 1978 under the leadership of a newly appointed General
Manager who promoted effective team work and demonstrated that, given
management stability, GUATEL's staff had the potential to respond to the
challenge of an expanded network. However, there were further changes to
top management in 1982 and 1983 (para 3.17). Although the management of
the organization was adequate for the second project, it was considered
inadequate to handle the greatly expanded level of operations projected
over the subsequent project period (1984-1987). The third project
therefore includes provision for consultants to review the organizational
structure and define necessary changes.
Staffing, Recruitment and Training
6.02      The number of staff, 3,023 at the end of 1975, increased at an
average rate of 3.4% p.a. to 4,086 by the end of 1984.  The staffing
limitation covenant of 24 per 1,000 telephones or 41 per 1,000 DELs'2/ was
not met until mid-1980. The attempt to restrain staff growth was al; o an
attempt to decrease operating costs. In addition, existing staff were
replaced with better qualified staff to improve productivity. The staff
ratio as of December 31, 1984, was 35/1,000 DELs.13/
6.03      GUATEL has had no difficulty in obtaining technical staff of the
requisite quality. Adequately qualified financial staff were appointed
from 1983. Under the project, GUATEL created a training division in 1975
to prepare training plans, and established a training center early in
1976 with ITU assistance, for training technical and administrative staff.
In addition to training newly appointed personnel, the center gives
refresher training and conducts symposia and seminars for higher
management. Use is also made of training facilities provided by other
administrations and of the regJonal training center in El Salvador. Some
specialized telecommunications training was provided by equipment
12/ Assuming a ratio of 1.7 telephones per DEL.
13/ This is above the perf  -an e indicator estimated during appraisal of
the third project of 2       /100  DELs.

suppliers. From 1976 to end-1983, GUATEL conducted about 320 courses and
trained about 3,100 staff in 108 courses; 1,000 staff during 1983 alone.
Technical and administrative training arrangements are satisfactory, but
training facilities for financial staff are inadequate. This requirement
is being addressed under the third project (para 5.02).
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievement
7.01      The project generally achieved the physical installation targets
except those for DELs (para 3.06), but with a delay (see Annex 1). Before
the second project, over 1970-75, DELs were growing at 5.4% p.a. and total
demand was growing at about 10%. During the project period (1975-1984),
DELs grew at 10.5% p.a., and total demand grew at an annual growth rate of
11%. Consequently, no progress was made towards eliminating unmet demand,
and the demand satisfied remained almost constant at only 38% over the
period. However, on the positive side, telecommunications services in the
rural areas have improved, revenues are above expectations, and the quality
of service has generally improved. An in-house training center for
technical and administrative staff has been established and is functioning
well (para 6.03). GUATEL has improved its planning capabilities and is now
self sufficient in this area. .Provision has been made under the third
project to provide technical assistance in demand forecasting (para 4.02).
The instability of top management over the period lindered project
implementation (para 3.17). Although the entity's organization was
adequate for the expansion envisaged under the second project, it is
inadequate for the third project expansion. To address this problem, the
organizational structure is being reviewed under the third project (para
6.01). Remaining financial management problems are also being addressed
under the third project.
Project Spin-off
7.02      Manufacturing of telecommunications materials in Guatemala is
limited to posts (concrete, metal) and PVC ducts, of which GUATEL currently
buys about Q1.0 million worth per year. Telephone cables of up to 800-pair
capacity are manufactured in Costa Rica and El Salvador along with posts,
ducts and hardware. During the project, Q 5.0 million worth of cables was
procured from El Salvador. There are no plans to develop manufacturing
capacity of telecommunications equipment further in Guatemala.
Least Cost Solution
7.03      Bearing in mind the limits imposed on alternative solutions by
the existing telecommunications network, the project design at appraisal
represented the least cost solution. There was some reordering of
priorities in the exchange installations necessitated by the February 1976
earthquake which produced changes in the location of population and
commerce (para 3.02). However, the scope of the project was not
substantially changed.

Rate of Return
7.04      The internal financial rate of return for the 1975-1984
investment program was re-estimated at 16% using the methodology outlined
in Annex 9. This rate represents the return for the project and compares
favorably with the appraisal estimate of 18%. The economic rate of return
could not be reliably estimated due to data insufficiency. However, it
should be higher since it would also include:
(i) incremental revenues beyond 1984 due to utilization of
spare capacity under the project;
(ii)  indirect external benefits to other sectors, such as
transport, agriculture, public services etc., from
improved and expanded telecommunications; and
(iii)  consumer surplus, which is estimated to be large given
the high unsatisfied demand (para 4.02).
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall and Specific Performance
8.01      The overall Bank performance in the implementation of this
project has been adequate. However, supervision in the project's early
years was inadequate (para 8.04). Substantial organizational changes in
GUATEL had occurred under the first project, and the second project
concentrated on decreasing congestion and improving service quality through
network expansion. Institutional development was limited to the expansion
of training facilities and consultants' services for design of the
multi-exchange network of Guatemala City. These were completed
satisfactorily (para 6.03). Although management problems were recognized,
and GUATEL was repeatedly advised by Bank supervision missions of the
deleterious effect of rapid changes in management (para 3.17), the Bank
made no attempt to further analyze management weaknesses or insist on
correctional measures during the project period. However, these issues are
being addressed under the third project, and provision has been made to
improve GUATEL's management and implementation capacity. Administration
will be streamlined, work coordination and supervision improved, and
operational norms and staffing standards will be established (para 6.01).
GUATEL's 1984-87 investment program includes Q3.4 million for new computer
equipment. GUATEL's capability for preparing and interpreting financial
data will be increased through the training of financial and data
processing staff (para 5.02).
8.02      A major weakness in the Bank's project appraisal concerned its
optimistic estimates of implementation and disbursement (para 3.11). At
appraisal, the project was expected to be completed in three years.
Although the long lead time in procurement was acknowledged, there were no
covenants or agreements requiring procurement activity in advance of
effectiveness, e.g., as conditions of loan negotiations or effectivenss.
At appraisal, it was agreed that GUATEL would review with the Bank the
proposals of consultants designing the multi-exchange network in Guatemala
City within 60 days of loan effectiveness. However, these consultants were



- ao -
not hired until June 1976, and completion of the design was delayed until
December 1976 in the absence of Bank pressure for their timely
appointment.    Consequently, determination of the total cable requirement
and initiation of procurement action could not be made until that time.
These problems were sought to be avoided in the third project by requiring
bids for major components of the Bank project to be received by loan
effectiveness. Procurement delays that have subsequently occurred are
mainly outside the control of GUATEL and reflect the country's economic
situation and procedural problems of the application of domestic laws.
8.03      A further problem was that in encouraging GUATEL to introduce
state-of-the-art technology into its network, the Bank failed to fully
appreciate the implications of accepting non-field-proven equipment.
Originally, the project had been designed to use conventional cross-bar
exchange equipment. With the Bank's encouragement however, 57,000 lines
of new electronic (SPC) equipment were ordered (para 3.09). This equipment
had not been field tested and most of the problems that arose (para 3.06)
could have been avoided had the bid documents included a field-proveness
clause. To ,void such problems arising again, GUATEL's procurement
documents nowinclude a standard requirement that equipment be field proven.
Supervision
8.04      The Bank's supervisory effort particularly in the project's early
years, was inadequate. In the two years following Board approval, only 1.9
staffweeks were spent in the field and 0.4 of that tackled the issue of
delayed effectiveness (para 3.01). The remaining 1.5 staffweeks were also
for supervising the first project. Insufficient Bank pressure was applied
to GUATEL to appoint the design consultants on time. GUATEL submitted
regular project progress reports although there were problems in the
quality and timeliness of financial reports (para 5.03).
Working Relationship
8.05      The working relationship between the Bank and GUATEL is good.
The entity has been developing through the second project particularly in
areas of procurement and project implementation. A good working
relationship which aids thts development is encouraged by frequent Bank
supervision. Supervision of the thrid project (efective November 1984) so
far appears adequate.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The growth of the network during the second project was slower
than projected at appraisal. Although DELs expanded at an annual rate of
10.5% p.a. from 1975-1984, compared to the 5.4% p.a. growth that occurred
from 1970-75, this was far short of the growth of 38% p.a. projected at
appraisal which was clearly an unrealistic target. The projected expansion
was based on a shorter implementation period, justified by the fact that
about one-third of the expansion works were to be provided from the ongoing
first project and some work (cable ducting) had already been completed by
the beginning of the second project. About 91% of the target for DELs was



-21 -
met, and other physical installation targets were achieved although
procurement and implementation problems resulted in a severe delay of
five-and-a-half years.
9.02      The delay in network expansion, combined with total demand
growing at about 11.4% p.a., higher than the 10% p.a. projected at
appraisal, resulted in longer waiting lines, continued high unmet demand of
about 62% and more congestion at the end of the second project than at the
beginning. At appraisal, demand satisfaction was expected to increase from
38% to 80% (para 4.02). From 1975 to 1984, the waiting list expanded by
165%, equivalent to 11.4% p.a. Although the second project made little
progress towards satisfying demand, significant improvements are expected
under the third project.
9.03      GUATEL has also built on the institutional changes undertaken in
the first project. Procurement administration has improved, technical
training is adequate and the staff ratio has fallen from 63/1000 DELs at
end-1975 to 35/1000 DELs by end-1984. There has also been significant
progress towards providing service to rural areas (para 4.03). The quality
of service has generally improved although some urban congestion remains
(para 4.05).
9.04      There are several events which help explain the poor project
performance. The February 1976 earthquake resulted in a 6-10 month delay
in implementation of the second project since all GUATEL's resources were
diverted to repair network damage (para 3.06). Organizational changes in
the supplier's company exacerbated the software problems of the new analog
SPC exchanges since many qualified staff left with the takeover (Annex 7).
There were several disruptive politically motivated changes in senior
management, some of which resulted in middle management changes (para
3.17). In encouraging GUATEL to modernize its network, the Bank failed to
take into account the implications of the introduction of non-field proven
electronic SPC exchanges (para 3.10). Performance indicators for the
quality of service were not monitored and, in retrospect, Bank
implementation and disbursement estimates were optimistic. Supervision,
particularly in the early project years, was weak (para 8.04).
9.05      Lessons learned during the second project have had an impact on
the design and implementation of the third project. For example, the
experience of the SPC exchange contract (para 3.06 and Annex 7) has
resulted in the requirement in bid specifications that equipment offered
must be field proven. Furthermore, technical assistance provided under the
third project will result in GUATEL monitoring performance against service
quality standards, developing realistic demand forecasts, training
financial staff and providing data processing training. Strengthening
GUATEL's planning and implementation capacity forms the core of the
institutional component of the third project. Estimates of the
implementation schedule and network expansion under the third project are
more realistic than in the second project, although actual disbursements
for the third project are still behind estimates due to procurement
problems.

There is little the Bank or GUATEL can do to counteract the disruptive
impact of frequert politically motivated management changes (para 3.17).
By establishing effective management procedures, however, the impact of
personnel changes may be minimized. Through network expansion under the
third project, attempts are being made to satisfy demand, and it is
expected that unmet demand will fall from 62% in 1984 to 50% by 1987 (para
4.02).

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN 1104-GU
Performance of Analog Stored Program Control (SPC)
1.        Under the project, provision was made to increase the telephone
network capacity by 82,900 lines. Of these, a contract for 57,000 lines was
placed in January 1977 with a foreign supplier. The value of the contract
was US$ 11.47 million for the supply of 7 eychanges - 5 in Guatemala City
(total 55,000 lines) and 2 in the interior (total 2,000 lines) - of sizes
ranging from 800 to 15,000 equipped lines each. Installation was delayed by
about 18 months due, mainly, to serious slippage in the contractor's
equipment delivery schedule but also to delay by GUATEL in the completion of
one exchange building and finalization of the junction network design, siting
of the 3-wire to 2-wire convertors and equipment layout. Installation
commenced in 1979 but problems soon appeared. There were some hardware
problems resulting from defective design of subscriber trunk circuits,
controllers and power equipment and from rusting of contacts. These were
corrected and all exchanges (except El Carmen) began operating with a limited
number of subscribers in 1980. Software problems then began to appear,
particularly in the exchanges in Guatemala City which had capacities of over
5,000 lines each. The major causes of these problems were the poor design of
the 2+1 configuration of the control system, excessive memory requirements
for providing the special subscriber facilities such as abbreviated dialing
etc., faults in the R2 signalling program and in the maintenance and traffic
measurement programs and instability introduced in the system due to the
defective hardware design. The elimination of these software problems
resulted in provisional acceptance of the exchanges between January and June
1984 - nearly 6 years behind the contractual date of June 1978. Features
such as special subscriber facilities were withdrawn and the loading of
exchanges is to be limited to about 90% of capacity. The exchanges have been
working fairly satisfactorily since 1984 and the loading, as of June 1985 was
as follows:-

About 65% of these connections were made after December 1982.
GUATEL approached the Bank in June 1979 seeking the Bank's intervention since
it was not able to obtain a satisfactory response from the contractor in
spite of several meetings.  GUATEL wanted the Bank to determine the
technical capability in the light of information received that the contractor
had failed to meet its obligations to a number of other telecommunications
entities. Although the Bank suggested a tripartite meeting in Washington,
GUATEL continued negotiations alone and the contractor finally agreed to pay
a penalty of US$4.0 million.
1/  Guarda Viejo also serves as a transit exchange for exchanges in San
Cristobal.
2/ El Carmen serves a commercial area with high average traffic per
subscriber.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Loan 1104-GU
Return on Investment
Benefit Period
The benefit period of the program extends from 1975 to 1992 when, on
average, the equipment provided under the project is expected to have
completed its useful life. No residual values are considered. The
overlapping with the first project and unforeseen additions to the
investment program, partly due to the 1976 earthquake (para 3.02), make
attempts to discriminate incremental costs and revenues for the first
project from the rest of the program arbitrary. The rate of return
calculations have therefore been based on the 1975-84 timeslice of the
total investment program.
The resulting financial rate of return is representative for the
second telecommunications project. The first major benefits from
investments under the second project occurred in 1977. Costs and benefits
are expressed in 1976 terms using a deflator to reflect inflation in
1977-1983. Incremental costs and benefits are assumed to remain constant
in real terms from 1983 onwards. In the absence of data it is assumed that
revenues and costs for 1985 onwards are duplicated. A summary of the costs
and benefits stream is presented below. The financial rate of return with
these assumptions is 16%.

EXECUTION OF PROJECTS IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER;
B)  CONTRACTING THE SERVICES OF EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS FOR THE SUPERVISION OF
THE MANUFACTURING AND INSTALLATION OF COMMUTATION AND TRANSMISSION
EQUIPMENT FOR THE THIRD PROJECT;
C)  IMPLEMENTATION OF mHE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CONTRACTED CONSULTANCY WITH
TELECONSULT IN THE AREAS OF PLANNING, HUMAN RESOURCES, OPERATION AND

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES.
SINCERELY,
