The\n            Response disputes the claims of the Request, stating that\n            the pipeline has very little impact in Cameroon, both\n            environmentally and aesthetically.  The Response states that\n            infrastructure around the pipeline will improve due to the\n            creation of roads and that the land around the pipeline will\n            be available for farming and grazing.  It is acknowledged\n            that the health services branch of the project has advanced\n            the least.  There are currently plans to collect data on the\n            needs of the communities and provide appropriate medical\n            services where needed.  There are also plans to continue\n            developing and strengthening the national capacity to deal\n            with oil spills.  The Management's response to other\n            claims, including water pollution and loss of fishing areas,\n            states that these areas will be monitored, although losses\n            and contamination appear to be minimal.  The Annexes address\n            individual claims from various communities and provide\n            detailed responses to each.  The Management states that it\n            believes the Bank has made every effort to follow policy and\n            procedure in this project and that the Requestors'\n            right and interests have not been adversely affected by the Bank."}, "docdt": "2003-07-24T00:00:00Z"}
