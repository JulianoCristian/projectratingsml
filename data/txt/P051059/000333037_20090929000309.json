Some lessons learned\n            included: it is imperative to design projects in light of\n            the institutional and administrative capacity realities. In\n            countries with weak capacity, it is important to focus on\n            addressing the basic problems rather than attempting to\n            introduce sophisticated practices. Paradoxically, major\n            components of the program in effect assumed the existence of\n            the very capacity they aimed to build. The temptation to put\n            in place special mechanisms to protect specific resources\n            and accomplish results is understandable in a weak capacity\n            and governance environment, but institutional enclaves are\n            generally not successful beyond the short term and even when\n            successful in the short term they tend to undermine the\n            already weak local systems and thus long-term development."}, "docdt": "2009-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
