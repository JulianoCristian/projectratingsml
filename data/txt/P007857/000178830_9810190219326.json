eight multilateral co-educational secondary\n            schools, a new upper secondary level technical school and a\n            vocational training center. The schools would be located in\n            various parts of the country and would consolidate existing\n            small and inefficient schools. The curriculum of the\n            multilateral schools would introduce technical and\n            scientific subjects. The project would also include 33\n            man-years of technical assistance and 23 man-years of\n            fellowships for local staff in support of curriculum\n            development, teaching of technical subjects and project\n            implementation. The project also seeks to bring about\n            greater government financial support for the education\n            sector, in particular secondary and secondary technical\n            education, as well as the assignment of full-time adequately\n            compensated and trained teachers to all secondary schools.\n            An important aspect of the project will be cooperation with\n            industry to insure the provision of adequately trained\n            personnel to meet industrial manpower needs."}, "docdt": "1972-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
