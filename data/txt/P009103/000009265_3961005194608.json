Carpathians Biosphere Reserve.  A second objective is to\n            link with the International Biosphere Reserve initiative\n            being developed by Ukraine, Poland and the Slovak Republic.\n            The project includes: (a) a biodiversity protection program\n            that will initiate a range of activities including:\n            inventory (biological and geographical), a systems\n            extinction model, genetic studies, Geographic Information\n            System critical habitat analysis and a Trans Carpathian\n            Planning Group; (b) a management resources program to enable\n            coordinated management of the discontinuous reserved areas\n            of the Carpathians Biosphere Reserve and the implementation\n            of the protection program;  (c) a training program that will\n            include development of communication skills (extension,\n            public education, interpretation and media relations),\n            language training, data base and computer training, park\n            planning and management training; and (d) a management\n            program that will include assistance to support a joint\n            Ukraine Global Environmental Facility (GEF) unit (both for\n            the Danube Delta GEF and this project) within the Department\n            of Protected and Recreation Areas and the establishment of a\n            small Project Unit at the administrative center in Uzghorod."}, "docdt": "1994-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
