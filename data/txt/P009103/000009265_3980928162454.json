Although local\n            communities approved the expansion of the Carpathians\n            Biosphere Reserve, these approvals occurred at the local\n            political level, and not necessarily based on good\n            understanding of the issues by the local community. Public\n            relations activities under the project would have improved\n            the flow of information between local communities and the\n            reserve management; 2) the applied research component should\n            have been designed to have greater direct application to the\n            management problems of the reserve, including the social and\n            economic conditions of the support zones; 3) biodiversity\n            and natural resources management projects in countries in\n            transition should seek to improve the project's\n            replicability by integrating the results into policy\n            frameworks at local, regional, and national levels of\n            government; and 4) as in other global environmental facility\n            (GEF) biodiversity projects in the region, a needs\n            assessment of the project monitoring unit (PMU) early in\n            implementation would have identified the need for training\n            in office management and business skills. Such training\n            could have reduced early delays in implementation and given\n            greater time to the substantive work to be done."}, "docdt": "1998-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
