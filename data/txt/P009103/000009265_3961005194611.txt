TECHNICAL REPORT
I. THE FOREST AND WILDUFE SECTOR AND THE ENVIRONMENT
A.    COUtMrrY OVERVIEW
1.1    The newly independent republics of the former Soviet UnioL have a remarkably diverse natural
patrimony which is at ri-k. The current economic situatihn threatens one of the most extensive and well-
tended systems of nature reserves in the world - their Zaovedik   - that house a vast ranga of
biological diversity. Yet, their status as strict reserves is fostering resentment by local communities. In
Ukraine the government is making a strong effort to protect their "Zapoveddki but the lack of financial
resources is hampering their efforts.
1.2    The direct and indirect effects of pollution, forestry and agricultural activities within a radically
changing macroeconomic framework cannot be quantified at this time. Nonetheless, these activities, if
undertaken without regard to the effects on biodiversity, can reduce the number of species, alter the
balance of ecosystems and intreduce instability. Short term economic advantage must be balanced against
the longer twrm detrimental impats cf these activities if any of the advantages are to be sustainable.
1.3   In Ukraine, several transitions between adjacent ecological communities are present: between the
European broadleafed forests, the northern taiga, the interior steppe, semi-arid sands and marshes near
the Black and Azov Seas, the seaside littoral, estuaries of large rivers such as the Danube and Dnieper,
and the sub-tropical pine and chaparral of Crimea. Commercially important forest species such as
Norway spruce and European beech are at the limits of their ranges. Questions of adaptability important
to the management of such species need to be clarified. There is a broad appreciation of the values of
such rare resources held in the system of reserves as:
* They house endemic (i.e. found nowhere else) threatened and endangered species;
* They are the only sites of some genetic material of importance (e.g. the best adapted trees, the
healthiest soil, fauna and flora) to renewable resource management, and to the restoration of
polluted watural systems. These are baseline ecosystems against which change due to
development or catastrophe (e.g. Chernobyl) can be measured;
e They are still of a viable size for the maintenance and development of ecosystems and therefore
offer the best opportunities to explore the preservation and management of natural forests and
grasslands in Europe; and
O They still provide ideal opportnities to evaluate current concepts and methods of maintaining
viable populations in relict fragmented forests.

B.    NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION
Biological Diversity
1.4    About 32% of Ukraine's vegetation can be identified as a remnant of the original natural
vegetation. The flora contains nearly 4,500 higher plant species. A second revised Ukraine Red Book2
has been published (1992) and, in all, 631 species of tiweatened and endangered flora and fungi, including
429 species of vascular plants are listed, (about 12 % of the entire flora). These are mainly endemic
relics and they include valuable drug and ornamental species.
1.5   The wildlife patrimony of Ukraine is rich and varied, reflecting the diversity of the major
ecological communities found in the country. Two major flyways traverse Ukraine: a north-south and
an east-west (coastal). Some of the breeding concentrations are significant. For example, 90% of the
world's black-headed Mediterranean gulls breed on the spits and islands of Chornogirs'ky Reserve on the
Black Sea near Kherson. There me some 44,800 known species of animals which inhabit Ukraine: 344
birds, 200 fish, 101 mammas, 20 reptiles, 17 amphibians, and the remainder invertebrates. Nonetheless,
as in much of the world, most wildlife management is focused on game species and iittte attention is
given to the ecology and requirements of non-game species, particularly if' they are not threatened.
1.6    A major threat to the wildlife of Ukraine is not human encroachment as such, but contamination
of the natural ecosystems ca which they depend.3 This threat is represented by air and water pollution
from industries and, to a lesser extent, by agriculture. Water-dependent species in the river systems or
the Black Sea and the Sea of Asov are under severe threat from agricultural discharges containing
fertilizers and residues oc pesticides and other agro-chemicals that move into streams and rivers. Land
animals, while also threatened by contaminated drinking water, are often just as endangered by habitat
degradation caused by air pollution. Some 381 species of fruna, including 101 mammals, are listed in
the revised Red Data Book, which lists four times the number of species of both flora and fauna than was
listed in the original 1974 edition.
1.7 Recognizing the need to address the status of the flora and fauna at the community le.vel, the
Academy of Science has published a Green Book. This listing is innovative because it provides a more
systematic appreciation of the significant communities, habitas and systems at risk. This can be a far
more practical approach in addressing biodiversity protection because enumeration at the species level
does not necessarily give an adequate appreciation of the systems which are at risk. Furthermore, the
community approach makes recovery planning a more tractable and plausible endeavor.
1.8   Some of the principal regions are:
0 The Carpathians and the Crimea which are identified as centers of the highest endemism and are
internationally significant. The Carpathians contain one quarter of the flora of Europe and many
useful endemic and medicinal plants. The largest remaining European stand (10,900 ha) of virgin
beech forest is present in the Carpathians and is a remarkable natural resource for the rest of
Europe, which has lost such undisturbed areas. The Crimea is a center of contrast to the rest of
a/ Comple liatiap of the Red Book are availae in the World Bank

the region. The highest species endeism of the country is maintained by the unusual climate
of the area.
0 Over three hundred thousand hectares of wetlands are of international importance as nesting sites
of waterfowl. In the Danube Delta, 25% or 150,000 ha of which is in Ukraine, the number of
wetland birds is large, and In the case of several species they form a substantial proportion of the
European, Paleoarctic or World populations. It is also important for several globally threatened
species including the pygmy cormorant and the red-brewzted goose. Sivash bay (45,700 ha),
Karkinitski Bay (37,300 ha) and the intertidal areas of Yagorlitski and Tendrovski (113,000 ha)
are also wetlands of international importance'.
O Most of the last virgin steppes of Europe are located in Ukraine in the Ukraine Steppe Reserve
(in four separate areas) and in the Askanya Nova Nature Reserve.
1.9    The forest area of Ukraine is about 10 million hectares, most of which has been modified by
centuries of genetic modification and exploitation. The total grassland area is of the order of 6.6 million
ha of which 380,000 ha is protected, although little of this can be described as natural. The remnants
th4 do survive contain a significant proportion of important threatened species.
1.10   Due to its geographical location, Ukraine has considerable recreational reso--rces concentrated
mainly in the western forest region, the southern sea regions and along rivers, particularly the Dnieper,
southern Bug and Diester. Resort resources (mineral waters and therapeutic muds) exist throughout the
country: 105 mineral wells and 39 deposits of therapeutic mud are used or offer the potential, and 76
resorts of significance are already operating. The south of Ukraine, specifically the Crimea, Mikolaiv,
Odessa and Kherson oblasts, are major recreation centers. These resorts cater mainly to national tourism,
although they once hosted guests from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
1.11   Future recreational development is at an early planning stage in five regions: the Crimea and the
Black Sea area (C lessa, Mikolaiv, Kherson oblasts), the Azov sea coast (Zaporizhskaya and Donetsk
oblasts), the Carpathians (Trans-carpathians, Lviv, Ivano Frankovsk and Chernivtsky oblasts), and the
middle Dnieper area (Kiev, Chernigiv, Cherkassy oblasts).
1.12   The network of protected areas is limited in extent and cannot by itself main  the range and
ext  of habitats required for the continuation of free-living populations of flora and fauna. Activities,
particularly in the forestry and agricultura sectors, can be an important adjuact to the protected area
network in the protection of biodiversity. Minor alterations to current practice and management,
incorporating multiple use and sustainable management approaches offer opportunities for significant
biodiversity protection.
1.13   The tourism sector, both local and international, can also have significant benefits for
biodiversity. It needs to be developed within acceptable limits and needs to be carefully designed and
managed to remain within the ecological and social carrying capacity of a particular area if the potential
it Thse welands were nominatd by the govenmt of the fomer USSR and accepted as part of the RAMSAR convention.
Alhough the wetlands ax inteonaly umporttan, the govenmet of Ukmine has not become a mmnber of the covention
and fte sits ae no longer regied as formal Ramar se.

benefits are to be optimized without undue affects on the resource itself. In natural areas, appropriate
tourism can not only inform the public of the need for the protection of biodiversity, but it can also
encourage active support for wider conservation objectives. At the same time, it can also support the
financial viability of protected areas through fees for use and by payment for the provision of services,
particularly for recreation.
1.14 A suite of renewable resource based activities can provide economic stimuli and contribute to
financial support of the Biosphere Reserve System. The relationship is reciprocal because these activities
depend upon the protected areas much like nature-based tourism. For example, an uneven age
silvicultural system featuring widely spaced stems resulting from planting at spacings of 2-3m x 2-3m
and thinning can result in a fast growing forest which can simulate an ancient forest structure (if snags
are left) while allowing iarvesting on the typically long rotations used. These forest can also be very
profitable where minor forest products are harvested (e.g. mushrooms, berries, etc.).
Protected Areas
1.15   The establishment of reserves for the protection of unique natural ecosystems and genetic
resources of plant and animals is an important challenge recognized by the Government of Ukraine'.
The network of protected areas includes 15 strict nature reserves (ZqpvednM), 4 National Parks, 3
Biosphere Reserves and many other protected landscapes, zoological and botanic gardens and other locally
significant reserves (See Table 1). Some 2.1 % of the country is under some form of protecon. In some
regions, however, less than 0.5% is reserved which reflects the influence of agriculture and forestry over
a long period of time and the previous overriding aim of inereasing production regardless of the impacts
on the environment. The government has indicated the aim of increasing the area of reserves to 3 % in
the near future and has an ambitious target to include every plant species, which now grows beyond the
protected reserves, in two to three reserved areas.
1.16 The highest forms of reservation, or the most protected areas, are the nature reserves, biosphere
reserves and, with a greater emphasis on recreation, the national parks. Annex 1 details these areas.

1.18   Day to day management of the reserves is vested in a multitude of different agencies and
institutions, other than the MEP (See Annex 1). Line management functions are complex and unclear.
Activities and major work groups reflect the orientation of the managing agency. Management of
protected forested areas has rarely been without considerable intervention, including timber production
from the less strictly protected buffer zones. There does not seem to be active management of these areas
in terms of modem approaches to conservation biology or restoration ecology. Conservation biology is
a collective term which would involve the use of existing biological and ecological knowledge to preserve
biological diversity in fragments of original ranges. It would include the determination for key species
of the minimum critical area for them to be retained in the longer term. Restoraition ecology in this
context would involve the development of management methods which in the longer term would minimize
man's need for intervention to particular ecosystems. It would require a sound appreciation of
conservation biology.
1.19   There is a reference manual on protected area management, published in 1988. It has references
to relevant legislation, requirements for planning (operationai), procedures for the establishment of
protected areas, annual reporting requirements, and guidelines on enforcement, protection of fauna and
research for different categories of reservation. Although overtaken by recent legislation and never fully
adopted by each reserve, the approach is significant and provides a mechanism for the communication
of consistent policy and management througnout the system.
LegIslative Framework
1.20 The Law on The Natural Heritage "Fund' (or estate) of Ukraine was passed on June 16, 1992.
This legislation indicates that the natural heritage fund is national property, although areas outside nature
reserves, the protected zones of biosphere reserves and lands granted to national parks can be of either
national or any other form of property allowed by the Ukrainian legislation. The legislation indicates that
the Ministry for Environmental Protection is the responsible body for organization, protection and
utilization of the natural heritage. Notwithstanding this, as Annex 1 indicates, a number of individual
organizations from different ministries have on-the-ground responsibil.ties for management of specific
reserves.
1.21   The legislation permits public organizations to participate in management of the sites and
territories of the natural heritage fund to protect them or to participate in research.
1.22   Adjacent to areas formally reserved, the legislation provides for regulations to determine the
regime of activities (commercial and industrial) which can occur without compromising the protection
of the reserves. These regulations are adopted by state authorities responsible for the designation of such
areas (i.e. the actual management authority of each protected area). Assessment of ecological impacts
are required in such demarcated area of restricted uses; those activities which have a negative impact are
prohibited. The actual size of a restricted area is determined by a special landscape analysis.
1.23 The legislation provides for financing the Natural Heritage sites. All income earned by a reserve
is earmarked for retention by the reserve administration. "Ecology funds" are also mentioned as a source
of revenue. These funds come from penalties and fines, sales of confiscated equipment, pollution
penalties imposed on industry and other enterprises, and voluntary donations. MEP is responsible for
regulations for these funds.



-8-
1.24   The legislation also establishes mechanisms for the expansion of the network of protected areas,
including an examination of the natural and cultural features of each area and consultation with local
authorities on proposed expansion. Any expansion proposal describes the area's ecology and analyses
the economic impact of the expansion.8 Importantly, the legislation provides a mecbanism in which the
Minister can resolve land use conflicts related to a proposal and a number of these areas are curreftly
being considered at ministerial level. It also establishes a "security service" or enforcement organization
under the control of each protected area administration.
1.25 A general provision indicates that Ukraine will enter into international agreements for nature
protection and the conditions (rules) of these agreements will have priority. Ukraina is not presently a
signatory of the RAMSAR Agreement' although the sites Freviously nominated by the USSR are
managed in accordance with the Agreement. It is believed that the Environment Strategy Study will
identify the need for Ukraine to formally enter into this agreement in the near future. Ukraine also
participates in the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve Program.
1.26   A new law on wildlife was passed in 1993 and a frther law on the protection of non-forest
vegetation is under consideration. The law on wildlife deals with changes i.i ownership of wildlife,
administration of hunting, and changes in limnits and iicenses. It also proposes that the primary principle
of the reserve system should be proteion of habitat rather than wildlife per se. Both legislative
initiatives call for specific measures to link strictly protected areas with corridors or areas of mndified
land use. This is an exciting concept with a very significant benefli for the protection of blodiversity.
It is a mechanism which could avoid remnant islands of protection which alone are unlikely to sustain
a representative sample of flora or fauna (e.g Annex 2). Associated with this approach is the possibility
of providing an incentive to individual landholders via tax relief for setting aside small areas of their land
for conservation purposes. These are significant, innovative and advanced measures compared to otier
CIS countries, or indeed for biodiversity preservation efforts globally. To be effective, however,
managers and the general public will need to have a sound appreciation of these provisions and the
provisioas of the new legislation.
Sectoral Issues
1.27   An Environmental Strategy Study is presently being finalized by the government of Ukraine and
the World Bank. This study will establish priorities to address the need to consolidate and clarify
institutional arrangements, review and reform environmental legislation and provide mechanisms to
implement a more effective regulatory environment. This project is consistent with the conclusions,

C.    LESSONS LEARNED FROM SIMILAR PROJECTS
1.28   Experience of similar Global Environment Facility Projects is limited, given that similar GEF
projects (Poland and Belarus Forest Biodiversity) hzve been operating for only a short period of time.
The Polnd GEF biodiversity project, as well as those being developed in Belarus (signed September
1992) and two projects wbich will be finalized for the Czech and Slovak Republics, have provided a good
understanding of biodiversity protection issues and interventions within the region. These recurring issues
are:
o     the need to develop a relationship with surrounding communities through participation
in planning and management and the development of sustainable and appropriate land
uses around protected areas;
o     the need for coordination with other countries given that wildlife and pollutants do not
respect political boundaries and management systems need to be applied over complete
ecosystems; and,
the need for professional development to enable managers, administrators and local
communities to effectively develop the skills to manage, plan and administer land and
usage in a sustainable way as well as achieving biodiversity protection objectives.
H. THE PROJECT
A.    ORiGaN AND RATIONALE
2.1  The proposal arises from the previously approved Czechoslovalkian1  GEP project in the
Carpathians as well as from a recent Carpathians agreement between the governments of Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Ukraine. On September 27, 1991, the Environment Ministers of the Slovak
Republic, Poland and Ukraine signed a declaration to conserve the valuable ecosystems and biodiversity
of the Carpathian Mountains in their three countries. The agreement provides for cooperative and
coordinated activities by the three nations to initially manage and protect more than 90,000 ha of ihe
Eastern Carpathians as an International Biosphere Reserve (1BR). The declaration includes:
*     Establishing the boundaries of the protected areas with scientifically determined zoning,
according to the respective legislation in each country, and guided by the UNESCO
biosphere reserve principles;
*     Promoting and ensuring cooperative scientific research and management for the protection
and restoration of Eastern Carpathian ecosystems; and
o     Organizing uniform bio-monitoring and protection of migratory animal species.

2.2   This project will provide the necessary resources to make the declaration a reality. As such, the
project fosters innovation in the complimentary design and management of a biologically significant
transboundary area which will be invaluable as a model in many parts of the region.
2.3   The project also fosters innovation in that mechanisms such as determinations of minimum viable
population units and habitat areas and the use of wildlife corridors will be developed to further
biodiversity protection objectives beyond the formal reserve boundaries, at the same time enabling
neighboring local communities to produce sustainable economic returns form their present and future
holdings.
B.    PROJECr AREA
2.4   The project will concentrate on a series of initiatives in concert with the recent agreement for the
trilateral IBR with Poland and Slovak (See Map 1). Activity will be directed to the Carpathians
Biosphere Reserve (CBR) of which one particular component, the Stuzica reserve, is common to both
biosphere reserve areas (IBR and EBR).
2.5    The Ukrainian Carpathians preserve some unique central European areas of beech and spruce
forests which are of great significance for studying the development history of the East Carpathians
vegetation. The first reserve of beech and fir-beech forests was created in 1932 on the Stuzica mountain
slopes. Since that time the reserve has been enlarged to 2,952 ha and included in the Ukrainian
Carpathians Biosphere Reserve (CBR). The CBR was created in 1991 with a total area of 38,930 ha
which is sub divided into a reserve zone (21,879 ha), a buffer zone (8,949 ha), and a conservative nature
management zone (8,071 ha). The reserve zone includes the Stuzica scenic reserve, and four separately
located forest and alpine areas. These areas are the Khust massif (valley of Narcissus), Ugolsko-
Shyrokoluy Lansky massif, the Chornogirs'ky massif and the Maramoros'ky massif.
2.6   The Stuzica Reserve is located on the border with Slovak and Poland at a range of between 770
to 1269 m (ASL). Flora of the reserve forest includes over 500 species of vascular plants many of which
are rare, such as: Atropa belladonna, Arnica montana, Astranda major, Helleborus pwpurascens,
Streptopus amplexifolius, and Telelda speciosa. In this region the beech is characterized by high vitality
and has a wide latitudinal range ( 500-1260m). The sub-alpine meadows occupy small areas with the most
typical species being Nardetwm srrccae and Vaccinetwn myrtUlae. The most typical representatives of
the fauna are Fells catus (wildcat), Coronella austrialls, Elaphe longissina, Apatura Iris and Rosalia
alpina.
2.7    The Khust Reserve Massif (Valley of Narcissus) is a small area of forest (256 ha) is the largest
european locality for the narrow leaved narcissus. The forest is at 180-200m ASL. In addition to the
narcissus there are many other rare plants in particular: Dactylorhiza majalis, Erythronium dens-canis,
Gladiolus Imbricatus, Iris sibirlca. Orchis lax/flora, Potentlila alba and Leucojun vernwn. The typical
fauna representatives include: Iphiclites podalirius, Eudia pavonia, Papilio machaon, and Proserpinus
proserpina.
2.8   The Ugolsko-Shyrokoluy Lansky Massif of 10,350 ha, is located at elevations ranging from
400 to 1280m on the Polonya ridge. The beech forest extends to 1280 m. Although the majority of the



- 11 -
ridge is flysch, a limestone ridge is contiguous with the flysch on the south side. This linestone ridge
results in specific flora and fauna associated with caves in the karst system. The forest contains about
550 species of vascular plants. The notable species associated with the limestone include Taxus baccata,
Juniperus sabina (unique in Ukraine) and Quercus petrea. Herbaceous plants also represented here
include Erythronium dens-canis, Cortusa mattioli, Iris graminea, Sedum hispanicum, Coronilla varia,
Jovibarba presslana, Corallorhkiza trflda and Orchis mono.
2.9   Significant fauna species include lhymallus thymallus, Salamandra salamandra, Ciconia nigra,
Falco preregrinus (peregrine falcon), Bubo bubo (eagle owl), Strix uralensis (ural owl), Dendrocopos
leucotos (woodpecker), Rhinolophus hipposideros (esser horseshoe bat), Myotisemarginatus, Barbastella
barbastella (Barbastelle), Meles meles (badger), Aglia tau and Endronius versicolor.
2.10   The Chornogirs'ky Reserve Massif This forest on the Chornogirs'ky ridge at elevations from
800m to 2061m (ASL) has seven identifiable plant profiles associated with elevation. These are (from the
bottom) Fagetum sylvaticwn, Acer pseudoplatani-Fagetwn (fragmentary associatior), Picetm-Abieto-
Fagetum, Fageto-Abieto-Picetum, Piceeto-Abietis and elfin woodland with spinus mugo, Duscheka virJdis
and Juniperus sibirica. The forest flora numbers more than 700 species of particular note are Saussurea
alpina, Polygonwn viviparum, Senecio carpaticus, Gentiana punctata, G. acaulis, Aconltwn nanwn,
Pulmonarlafilarszhyana, Leontodon croceus and Rhodendron kotschyl. Spruce is the dominant forest
type (Piceetum oxalidoswn, P. myrtlilosiun, P. polytrichosiwn). The sub alpine level of plants widely
represents climatic communities such as Mugeta, Duschekieta viridae, Junipereta sibirica. As far as rare
communities are concerned it is worth mentioning Rhodoretum kotschyi, Salicetwn  herbacea,
Doronicetum capatici, Juncetum trifidi and Coricetum sempervirentis.
2.11  The fauna consists of many rare and commercially valuable species such as 7W,turus montandoni,
. alpestrs, Circus claneus, Aquila chrysaetos (golden eagle), Tetrao urogallus (capercaillie), Glaucidiwn
passerinum (pygmy owl), Prunella collaris (alpine accentor), Sorex alpliws (alpine shrew), Caionomys
nivalis and Callimorpha dominulla.
2.12   The Maramoros'ky Reserve Mssif has a total area of 3,970 ha with well defined glacier cirques
at the higher elevations. The slopes of the cirques are covered with thickets of Pinus mugo and
Duschekla viridus. The geology includes schists, gneiss and marble-like limestone of the Jurassic period
which determines the vegetation and to some extent the fauna. The flora is noted for such species as
Campanuda carniolica, Caraaminopsis neglecta and Anemone narcisstflora. The herbaceous sub alpine
level can display a number of rare species such as Gentiana lutea, G. punctata, Sempervivwm montanwn,
Anthems carpaffca and Poa deyll.
2.13   The forest fauna shows a number of peculiar features as well. Present are Tetrao urogaUus, Bubo
bubo (Eagle owl), Neomys anomalus (Millers water shrew), Lutreola lutreola (European mink), Lura
lutra (otter), Fells catus (wildcat), Lynx lynx (Lynx) and Lucanus cervus.
2.14   Surrounding each of the reserves are buffer zones which decrease the impact of human .nd1ced
activity on the protected areas by restricting the extent and nature of some uses.

2.15   The table above indicates the area of the proposed IBR with some possible further expansion
particularly in Slovak and Ukraine. The international MaBW2 Secretariat is yet to formally endorse the
whole area. For project purposes, however, the IBR can be taken as a contiguous unit given the
Agreement by all three countries. The CBR has an administrative center at Rakhiv with an
administration, research and visitor complex. The visitor center is new and presently being fitted out,
although lack of funding has delayed completion of this work.
2.16   The very nature of the CBR, with areas managed as the one entity but actually located some
distance from each other, makes management more difficult. The "tyranny of distance" cannot be
overcome without effective communication, staffing and resourcing systems. On the other hand the area
viewed as a whole, and not just as the reserved areas alone, is primarily a contiguous area of forest and
great opportunity exists to establish "corridors" for wildlife management with the assistance of the
Ministry of Forestry, particularly at the Oblast level. Secondly, opportnity exists in the agricultura
areas for marginal lands to be managed more for wildlife than for pure agricultural production. On the
boundary of the reserves both forestry and agricultural activity has had great impact on the integrity of
the reserves and there is an identifiable need to develop sustainable management practices in these areas
to reduce the detrimental impacts of such activities. Opportunities exist to develop appropriate tourism
including identifiable ecotourism activities which could have many benefits; selective forest practices such
as systems to encourage the rapid development of an old growth structure with a commercial rotation;
educating the public of the need and value of the protected areas and environmental education in general,
and to provide revenue to assist with the management of the reserved areas themselves. As importantly
there would be opportunities to gain economic benefits by the provision of goods and services to the
touring public to offset any reduced production activity required to protect the resource itself. One
mechanism which will be developed in the project to introduce new ways of managing land outside the
protected reserves will be by the promotion of selected demonstration projects.
2.17 The management of reserves is now in transition and many of the administrative structures require
adjustment to fully reflect the new legislation, pr.ivatization and a number of major economic and social
changes in the country. Unfortaely knowledge of the necessary technical management skills to make
these adaptations is not available and the project will need to clearly concentrate on development

opportunities of all personnel as well as surrounding communities and farmers. The adaptation will also
require support for management facilities to the four areas and significant coordination between all the
reserve areas, with the IBR and with local communities and other land management institutions. It should
be noted that a Trust is in the process of being established for all three countries covering activities
associated with the IBR and the Cooperative Agreement. It should be established by mid 1993 and will
act to attract large donations and investments so that the annual income can be used for on-going
protection of the reserve.
C.    PROMCT OBECIE  AND DESIGN
2.18   The project objective is to demonstrate the principles of modern conservation biology and
restoration ecology in Ukraine in addition to adopting and implementing successful park planning,
management and protection of the Carpathians Biosphere Reset e (CBR). This GEF Biodiversity project
will link with a similar GEF project in the Slovak Republic along the common border in the Carpathian
mountain system. The design of the project reflects the need to add to this Slovak project as the
maintenance of the ecosystem shared by all three countries will require input from Ukraine. As such,
the project can be described as an add-on to the existing Slovak initiative which will ensure biodiversity
protection objectives are achieved for the ecosystem as a whole. The project will focus on the linkages
of habitat fragments, species loss, and habitat management (Annex 2).
2.19  The opportunity to manage for biological diversity using recently developed science is uniquely
afforded and will be an innovative component of this project. The goal is to control, understand and
manage the forest fragmentation process to ensure the long-term presence of viable populations of flora
and fauna that are sensitive to habitat loss. This is an unusually germane and compelling consideration
in this case, because there are an array of natural fragments to be managed as a single system.
2.20 The project will develop and implement legal, institutional and administrative interventions to link
the isolated reserved components of the CBR in order to maximize the opportunities for biodiversity
conservation. This would be achieved by a range of interventions including planning, implementation
of wildlife corridors and the development of extension services.
2.21   A second objective is to link with the International Biosphere Reserve (IBR) initiative being
developed by Ukraine, Poland and the Slovak Republic. Wildlife, pollution and management issues are
not stopped by borders and a coordinated and cooperative management arrangement is required if the
ecosystem is to be managed successfully.

D.    DErAILs OP PRojEcr COMPONENTS
Biodiversity Protecdon Program                                                  $148,100
2.22 The Biodiversity Program will develop the information, mechanisms, and skills to manage the
forest fragments of the CBR so that biodiversity protection objectives are assured. Details of the program
are provided in Annex 2 and Annex 6. It would include a number of components, which are detailed
below:
Reserve Inventory - Inventory reserves, forest fragments (by stage of succession, and
history of use), and ownership. Data entry into a Geograph;iC Information System
(GIS)
Acquisition Planning - Create an acquisition plan based on size, naturalziess, geometry
and pattern of dispersion (not faunal and floral character). Investigate planned uses,
potential for modifying uses important to the plan (e. g. leaving corridors, selective
thinning and extended rotations)
Ilora and Fauna Inventory - Inventory plant and animal populations in target areas
including invaders and exotics
Initiate Systems Extinction model
Genetic and Species Studies - Begin genetic studies of selected (from model) animal
species, initiate studies of keystone/dispersor/pollinator systems. Study species from
model requirements, and study species movements
GIS and Critical Habitat/Corridor Analysis - Use GIS analysis of movements, home
ranges, and employ carrying capacity calculations (developed from the above) to derive
minimum critical habitat requirements
Trans Carpathians Planning Group - Develop a Trans Carpathian Planning Group
including local and national governments, local NGOs, elected representatives, scientists
and representatives of local users. Establish a Secretariat
National Policy - Develop National Policy on easements and incentives for select land
uses around the protected areas
Curriculum Development - Develop a curriculum and plan for the inclusion of
Conservation Biology in University and Forestry School curricula. Develop syllabi for
constituent elements of the curriculum and initiate instruction.

Management Resources Program                                                       $210,000
2.23 The Management Resources Program will enable coordinated management of the discontinuous
reserved areas of the Carpathians Biosphere Reserve and the implementation of the above protection
program.
These investments will include:
Computer Equipment and Geographic Information System Facilities - (Annex 1).
These systems will be planned after consideration of the real needs for the Biodiversity
Program detailed above and after consideration of the need for contiguous data sets and
approaches with Poland and Slovak
Transport and Communications - provision of transport and communications for
enforcement, protection and management - including provision of electronic mail
capabilities. At the present these resources are either in short supply or non-existent.
They are the essential tools for management and will be necessary to implement both the
Biodiversity Protection Program above and it's implementation (Annex 2).
Assistance with Demonstration Activities - These activities will result from the planning
detailed in the Biodiversity Protection Component and will likely include the planning
and conduct of farming and forestry activities based on the results of the component and
those ecological farming activities underway in Poland and Belarus.
Publk Education & Awareness Pogram                                                  $40,000
2.24   There is an identifiable need to develop and implement a communications program to provide
support for the CBR. Objectives of a communication program, which would include media relations,
community information and extension, interpretation'3, environmental education and publications, would
be:
o     to promote public awareness, understanding and appreciation of the natural and cultural
heritage;
O     to promote concern for its conservation and recognition of its importance to the overall
quality of the national and global environment; and,
*     to promote public awareness, understanding and appreciation of the aims, achievements
of the Department of Protected and Recreational Areas in its implementation of
Government policies for the conservation of the natural heritage of Ukraine.

Data Base and Computing - Annex 1 indicates the training needs for computer and GIS
managers and technicians.
Professional Development and Language Training - To support the Biodiversity
Protection Program and specifically the development of Trans Carpathians planning,
managers and specialist staff need training in effective public participation and many of
the other commonly accepted approaches to planning. Reserve managers indicated that
local popuiations neighboring the forest are a significant cause of many protection
problems. Neighbors can pose a long-term threat if they have been systematically
excluded from reaping any of the benefits of a large area set aside for specific uses while
suffering crop depredation, incursions of alien, *ee-spending tourists, and a host of
resrictions. A central tenet of a Biosphere Reserve is the integration of the wise (i.e.
sustainable) use of natura resources by those who make sacrifices so that some (i.e.
endangered) natural resources can be protected. The incorporation of the surrounding
rural population into management planning and decision making for the reserves is
essential. This includes public participation/groups dynamics as well as small business
planning and management. Such an approach is not among the management skills
currently in systematic use in the CBR. Secondly there is a need for reserve management
training that many of the current practitioners and their staff can gain immeasurable
benefit. Training proposed here will be initiated to compliment the activities of other
countries of the IBR and will include study tours and selected skills training after the
identification of needs.
Project Management Program                                                       $40,000
2.26 The Department of Protected Areas (DPRA) in the Ministry of Environment would be responsible
for the overall coordination of the project. This program would direct assistance to the main GEF Unit
established within the Department as well as a Project Management Unit established at Uzghorod. Given
the need for coordination with the International Biosphere Reserve and the introduction of new scientific
approaches, funding will be provided for an international joint scientific committee. This committee will
assist in project supervision and monitoring. A detailed Supervision and Monitoring Plan is outlined in
Annex 5.
Central GEF Coordinating Unit Kiev. A small two person central GEF Coordinating
Unit would be established in Kiev. This unit, to be housed in the DPRA, would be
established to expedite investments from the Special Account, to facilitate international
communications, to coordinate international professional development training, to monitor
and evaluate project progress and to collate and forward quarterly and annual progress
reports to the World Bank on project progress. The Project Administrative Manager
(part time) selected to oversee this project should have strong commrunication and project

management skills. The GEF Unit Coordinator shall have strong communication and
administrative skills, including a command of English was well as an ability to maintain
the necessary accounting and procurement procedures. Funding for the GEF Unit
Coordinator, the Bookkeeper/Secretary and necessary office equipment, furniture and
operating costs will be eligible investments under the project. This unit shall be
established and evidence provided thereto to the World Bank prior to grant effectiveness.
Uzghorod GEF Management Unit This unit would be established within the Regional
Administration (at Uzghorod). Evidence of the establishment of this unit and the
appointment of the full time Deputy Manager/Administrative officer shall be provided to
the World Bank as a condition of Grant Effectiveness. It would be physically located at
the Administrative Center (Uzghorod) and would be under the overall direction of the
Oblast administrator of the DPRA at Uzghorod, assisted by the Scientific Director of the
Biosphere Reserve. The Unit would employ a full time Administrative Manager (Deputy
Manager) and a fill time bookkeeper/assistant. It would be expected that the team would
be selected with complementary skills and qualifications. The Head would be required
to have professional qualifications in land/natural resource management and a knowledge
of biodiversity protection and issues.
2.27   A number of additional organizations would be sub-contracted to carry out specific activities.
;he proposed Project Management Unit, assisted by its scientific advisors, will design, contract out, and
supervise the agreed program. These additional institutions will carry out activities under the direction
of the Project Management Unit.
E. PARTCIPAnON BY NGOs ANm LOCAL CommEs iN PRoC AcTIvrrms
2.28 IThe project includes meclanisms for fostering participation by NMOs and local communities in
reserve management, planning and related activities. Such participation is important because: (i) it will
provide a mechanism for the development of the NGO movement and some NMOs are well qualified to
assist with execution of certain project elements; (ii) NMOs and local communities can substantially
increase the scope and effectiveness of certain components (by contribution of expertise and labor); and
(ii) local community and NGO partdipation in reserve management and planning serve to increase
support for (and minimize potential resistance to) reserve protection programs. Both international and
domestic NMOs were consulted during the initial preparation of this project and would be encouraged to
participate actively in the implementation phase as members of the Trans Carpathians Planning Group
established under the project and as possible contractors for discrete project components.
F.    ENVRONMEWNAL IMPACT
2.29 The proposed activity will have a positive environmental impact by directly enhancing the
management and protection of the Carpathians Biosphere Reserve of 39,000 ha and the Ukrian
component of the tri-national Biosphere Reserve of up to 14,000 ha. Project supported mechanisms for
local community participation in reserve management and planning will, be significant componeuts of the
project and social impacts are expected to be positive as well. The environment screening category for
the project is C"c.

(estimated in-kind services and staff costs) and the MacArthur Foundation provision of a grant for
professional development ($10,000).
I.    PROCUREMENT
2.33 The Grant would finance the procurement of equipment for undertaking geographic information
system analysis (GIS) work, air monitoring, two vehicles and communications equipment (US$250,000)
and supporting technical assistance (US$100,000) (See Annex 4 for a partial listing). The Grant would
also finance - for about 30% of the total grant - the salaries, operations and maintenance costs of the
Project Management Program and such incremenal costs associated with the Biodiversity Portection,
Management Resources and Training Programs. It would include the costs of contracted field staff to
implement technical activities. Procurement will be carried out in accordance with the Procurement
Guidelines of the World Bank (May 1992).
2.34   The project also includes eight short-term assignments (estimated cost US$65,000) for which
individual consultants (both foreign and local) would be engaged following the procedures outlined in the
Gidelines.for the Use of Consultants (August 1981). The selection of individual consultants will be on
the basis of comparison of CVs from at least three candidates. The Grant would also finance
expenditures incurred retroactively with effect from June 1, 1993 for external professional development
and training at an estimated cost of $35,000.
2.35 Equipment for the Geographic Information Systems (GIS), including vehicles (total aggregate of
$200,000) will be procured through international shopping by obtaining three quotations from three
different countries. Equipment and related goods (not to exceed total aggregate of $50,000) which are
of proprietary nature, will be procured through direct contracting in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank. All contracts will be post-reviewed.

K. PROJECT BENEFrIS AND JUST IFCATION
2.38 The forests and associated resources of Ukraine are important to the overall economy of the country.
By inappropriate management practices and by environmental abuse, their value and contribution to
society has been reduced. This current project offers a unique opportunity to conserve a significant
component of the whole forest resource in co-operation with Slovak and Poland. In essence, the project
will develop sound management principles for protected areas and adjacent land uses which will address
a significant proportion of the Carpathian ecosystems which have great value in terms of the worlds
biodiversity resources in temperate climates. It enables genetic resources to be retained which would
permit genetic sustainability to occur and as such the forests would be in a far better position to withstand
natural as well as unplanned changes, i.e. global climate change possibilities.
2.39 The Project's specific benefits would:
* Gready reduce the loss of species and now unique relict ecosystems by conservation and
management of the forest and alpine associations, a significant proportion of which are not yet
protected. This GEF Project strategy is important in assuring the maintenance of the forest and
alpine fauna as well as flora.
* Enable man to restore ecosystems destroyed by either natural or anthropogenic factors by re-
introducing populations into their natural or equivalent habitats after having reduced the influence
of the most striking limiting factors.
o Stabilize ecosystems by maintaining a high level of genetic variability within species. Thus the
species can adapt themselves to the site, even if the site conditions are changing to a certain extent.
o Increase the forest economy at a long term by being able to use the full amplitude of genetic
variability available, e.g., by replacement of poorly adapted species by better adapted ones and tree
improvement programs.

L. SUSTAINABILrry
2.40 The project will be a catalyst for the establishment of a Trust for recurrent funding which will
enable the results of the project to be maintained over time. Several of the project components wUl
address mechanisms and economic measures for the sustainability of the protected area as well as for the
surrounding communities.
M. PRojECT RISKS
2.41 Although there are no major risks, implementation could be affected by some institutional
weaknesses at the level of the Department of Protected and Recreational Areas, instability in sustainable
forest practices, and delineation of authority and responsibility for the areas (e.g. a diffusion of authority
and responsibilities outside the MEP), as well as the field level given the major reductions In allocations
for staff and essential management functions. A commitment will be sought at negotiations that the
government will maintain the current level of funding for the CBR in real terms during the life of the
project.
III. PROJECT IMLEMENTATION
3.1 The institutional structures supported under this project to implement the program are included in
the Project Management program. Overall coordination will be the responsibility of a unit to be
established in Kiev within the Department of Protected and Reservation Areas. This unit will also assist
with project preparation activities for the GEF Danube Delta international waters project as required.
To implement the project at the field level, a management unit is to be established within the Regional
administration at Uzghorod. Project monitoring and evaluation are an important and ongoing impact of
implementation. Annex 5 indicates a significant emphasis to evaluate the project as it is progressively
implemented. Annex 7 details the identified implementing organizations for specific project components
under the coordination of the Kief GEF Unit.
IV. AGREEMENTS AND RECOM1MENDATIONS
3.1 During negotiations on the Grant Agreement, assurances were obtained as follows:
a.  Joint Scientific Comminttee The Ministry for Environmental Protection shall establish a Joint
Scientific Committee to ensure appropriate coordination, monitoring, evaluation and progress,
no later than October 30, 1993.
b.  Grant Effectiveness The grant would be declared effective upon submission of documentation
satisfactory to the Bank that the Project Coordinator in Kiev and the Project Manager in
Uzghorod has been appointed.
c.  Accounts  A separate 'special' account would be established in a commercial bank for the
project. This account would be audited annually by an auditing firm acceptable to the Bank.
d.  Project Management  A Project Coordination Unit (Ministry of Environment, Kiev) and a
Project Management Unit (PMU) would be established within the Carpathians Biosphere Reserve
at Uzghorod prior to disbursement of the grant.

TRANSCARPATHIAN BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION PROJECT
PROTECTED AREAS OF UKRAI14E
1.    Nature Reserves: Nature reserves were formally part of the zapovedniki system of the USSR
which meant that they were strictly protected for scientific and educational purposes. Eleven of these
reserves attracted a classification by IUCN' as Category I reserves (the highest category of protection)
in 1990.  Recent legislation and the addition of new areas to the reserve network, including
reclassification of some of the zakazniki (smaller, less rigorously protected areas of the older USSR
system), have increased the number of reserves to fifteen. Presently, the main objectives of nature
reserves are to preserve natural complexes and sites for scientific research and monitoring, to develop
recommendations on nature conservation, to spread ecological knowledge, to assist in the training of
ecological specialists and to co-ordinate research in the territories of game reserves and areas of
outstanding natural beauty. There are no formal zoning requirements for nature reserves, however;
projects of "territorial management" (i.e. land use planning) must be approved by the Ministry for
Environmental Protection and management of the reserve may provide for the needs of its employees by
allotting plots of land for pasture, hayfields, vegetable gardens etc. within established norms. Recreation
is not specifically indicated as an appropriate activity, and travel by unauthorized persons is prohibited.
2.     Biosghere Reserves2 These areas are set up to preserve the most typical nature complexes of the
biosphere, to carry out ecological monitoring, and to study habitat and its changes under the influence
of anthropogenic factors. As such, they can include nature reserves, national parks and other territories
of natural heritage. Three zones are established for biosphere reserves: (i) a reserve zone which has the
functions and objectives of a nature reserve, (ii) a buffer zone which has objectives related to protection
from negative economic activities on the reserve zone, and (iii) an anthropogenic landscape zone
(transitiotn) which includes traditional land uses, settlement and recreation sites, and other types of limited
economic activity.
3.     Biosphere Reserves have been created in Ukraine as additions to the existing reserve system.
Unlike many other neighboring countries, the original size of the zone of strict protection was maintained
with the change to an expanded area under the biosphere reserve designation. The most recent biosphere
reserve proposal is for the Carpathians Mountains (not to be confused with the nature reserve or national
park in tha Carpathians as well). It comprises a number of discontinuous areas to make up the biosphere
reserve itself. This reserve has several individual massifs each with appropriate core (strictly protected),
buffer and transition zones. In this way the reserve captures a high percentage of endemic flora and
fauna of the whole Carpathian system.

4.      National Parks The national parks are designated to preserve valuable natural, historic, and
cultural sites, provide tourism opportunities and recreation, conduct research, and carry out ecological
and educational work. Each national park has four zones: a reserve zone similar to nature reserves; a
regulated recreation zone in which all activities with a negative influence are forbidden, such as hunting,
fishing, and tourist camps; a stationary recreation zone intended for accommodation, and, an economic
zone intended for econonic activity to fulfill the objectives of the park.

TRANSCARPATHIAN BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION PROJECT
MANAGEMENT OF FOREST FRAGMENTATION
1.    IntroduIon We will discuss some of the tenets of the emerging field of Conservation Biology
because it systematically and objectively considers the interplay of habitat fragments, species loss, and
habitat management - the precise elements of this GEF project (and others). The formulation of a useful
project requires some background and our approach is to briefly give a description of the basis for what
is being devised in the work plan in non-technical terms.
2.    History The fragmentation of temperate zone forests only seems less of an issue than that of
tropical forests because it has been occurring for many centuries in Europe. The forests which blanketed
over 80% of Europe began to undergo modification at the hands of neolithic man over 5,000 years ago.
By the Norman conquest much of the forest had been lost. Great Britain had lost its bear, wolf,
capercaillie, boar and goshawk by the beginning of this century. This anticipated a similar episode (much
more rapid) in North America which lost its lions, elk, wolf, passenger pigeon and ivory billed
woodpecker from eastern deciduous forests. With the rise of navies and populations, the destruction of
European forests led to the constitution of forestry schools in France and Germany by the mid 18tb
century, assuring the conversion of the original forests of Europe to the genetically altered, relatively
homogeneous tree factories imbedded in the field-village-city matrix of today. Even many of the game
parks are manicured and artificially maintained (e.g. the animals are fed). The only remnant relict
lowland mixed forests of Europe occur on the Polish-Belarus border at Bialowieza and in beech
dominated groves of the Ukrainian Carpathians. The small remnant montane and alpine forest fragments
found in the Carpathians are the subject of the effort described below.'
3.    The Goal We propose to control, understand and manage the forest fragmentation process to
ensure the long term presence of viable populations of flora and fauna which are sensitive to habitat loss
and in danger of disappearing. This is unusually germane and compelling consideration in this case
because we are provided an array of natural fragments to be managed as a single system. The
opportunity to manage for biological diversity using recently developed science is uniquely afforded and
should be taken advantage of.
4.    The Issue Small remnant patches of the original forest systems constituting an even smaller total
area of habitat systems are imbedded in an inhospitable landscape matrix which will not support marv
of the original species and which discourages their dispersal between the remaining habitat fragments.
Among the questions of importance to managers of these natural resources systems are:
e     how much available habitat must be set aside?
*     in what distribution of sizes?
e     should they be spread or clustered?

5.    The Biological Consequences of Fragmentation Theory  The evolutionary and ecological
significance of fragmentation or insularization lies partly in its effects on populations of the species of
flora and fauna of the natural pre-fragmented forest. The illuminating theory came first from
considerations of island biogeography - a field as old as Darwin and Wallace's theory of evolution. In
fact this emerging concern of natural science emphasizes the filial position of ecology to evolution and
evolution to population genetics - the debt of Darwin to Mendel. The theory of island biogeography
states that the number of species on an island (or habitat fragment) is an equilibrium between immigration
and extinctions. The former (immigration) is determined by the size and isolation of the island or
fragment, and some characteristics of the species - i.e. relative dispersal abilities (finches but no rhinos
in the Galapagos). However, we will examine below the process and meaning of the term extinction of
the equation. The theory of island biogeography fails to say how species interact in communities of
plants and animals. The theories associated with community ecology will illuminate how species react
under stresses such as harvest and invaders from adjacent modified systems. In addition to protection,
this is important to crafting appropriate land uses near protected areas, as well as devising restoration
strategies.
6.    The Reaction of Populations and Communities to Fragmentation Process  Ecologists
(particularly plant ecologists) have long measured the increase in the number of species they would find
as they repeatedly inventoried larger areas. Eventually, no additional species could be contributed by
increasing the area sampled and a "species-area" curve could be drawn showing how large an area was
needed to include all species. For example, the formula has shown that the reduction of an eastern U.S.
forest habitat to 5% of its size will result in the loss of 50% of its species (although empirically we
observe less than 2% loss). In Hawaii, however, half of the original forest remains but 66% of the
species have been lost since 1800. Clearly, other forces are at work. The fragmentation of natural
ecosystems into small remnant areas can lead to the extirpation of plant and animal populations in them
because of.
*     edge effects - the effects of edge are due tc the surface area to volume relationship.
Fence builders know that smaller areas have a greater proportion of edge than large
areas. In this case, it is exposed edge and one result is the increased nest predation on
temperate forest songbirds by animals associated with suburban and agricultural systems
such as feral pets, jays, grackles, weasels, squirrels, raccoons and from nest parasites
such as cowbirds. This effect has been measured up to 600m into the original temperate
forest patch and can severely impact song bird recruitment. Another effect is the change
in microclimate and soil conditions at the edge with increased light and temperature from
adjacent open areas. Lovejoy et al., 1986 document a 60% mortality in original tropical

ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 8
forest vegetation at the edges and the affects on bird densities were seen to about 50m
into the forest. The seed rain of secondary plant species overwhelm natural forest
seeding near the edge. Invading secondary butterfly species were found competing for
nectar up to 300m with forest butterflies into the forest. At effects up to 600 m, at least
1.23 km2 would be a minimnum size for temperate forest reserve if songbirds were the
only species of interest.  The process of edge related mortality can lead to the
autocatalytic "edge creep" effect and continual patch constriction.
inadequate carrying capacity for the spectrurn of species representative of the original
forest. The demainds for the behavioral component of carrying capacity can be
determined by the size of territories and home ranges of the subject species - e.g. 40 km2
for the European goshawk, several hundred for a wolf pack. In tenns of forage, red deer
may average 3,000 kg/yr consumption, about 5 ha production. A typical herd of ten
would require 50 ha of foraging areas if they were the only herbivores. The roe deer,
rodents and lagomorphs, birds and others also need forage. However, the genetic
carrying capacity - i.e. the genetic implications of fragmented habitats (discussed below)
dictate more than one mrating pair or even breeding group per patch. In this way, the
minimum carrying capacity required can be calculated from behavioral, metabolic, and
genetic requirements of each species of the original forest community.
a     secondary extinctions (the cascading effects) due to interrupted links in coupled
communities - predator/prey, parasite/host, plant/pollinator. For example, the large
predators which are lost because of their large home range requirements, naturally
regulated smaller predators and omnivorous which consume forest songbird eggs.
Generally, the lower trophic levels are more connected and most losses do cascade with
a variety of consequences.
o     missing habitat elements which are only occasionally or seasonally required can result
from fragmentation - e.g. the ability to graze a catena (a small change in relief which
provides seasonally changing resources, avoiding over use of any one), micro habitats,
water, etc.
e     the genetic changes which result from isolated and ditinished populations is increasingly
recognized as a subtle and deadly consequence of fragmentation. Selection of a healthy
mate in large populations generally hides the expression of maladaptive but infrequent
recessive genes through the contribution of a generally adaptive dominant gene from one
parent. In small isolated populations, mating between close relatives (even healthy ones)
increases the proportion of delecerious pairs (one from each parent) of recessive genes
since related parents have similar genetic structures. The offspring have then lost genetic
variability (increased homozygosity) and have fixed undesirable characters such as poor
milk yield, low egg production, decreased immunity to disease, low vigor and
intelligence. and smaller size. The affect is known as inbreeding depression and it
reduces a central measure of evolutionary and ecological success - "fitness." Fitness is
the measure of successfully passing on one's (or a populations) genetic qualities in the
genetic endowment to breeding age offspring. Reproductive perfornance of parents and
the survivorship of the offspring determine fitness.  The loss of vigor in inbred
i.idividuals can cause their death and reduce fitness. The loss of variability in a breeding



- 32 -
ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 8
population can reduce the fitness of the populations over generations and reduce its ability
to adapt to random, normal (stochastic) variation in the environment such as climate
change. Based upon the mating system (e.g. a single dominant male) and number of
breeding adults, a coefficient of inbreeding can be calculated for a population. In typical
livestock improvement programs, a level of 10- 15%/ generation is common if the
unfortunate and predictable "mistakes" can be culled by the animal scientists who
carefully keep stud books on the best parents. In isolated populations, inbred individuals
may breed before they are naturally culled, thereby diminishing population viability.
particularly if predators such as wolves have been controlled. At the other end of the
mating spectrm, note that extreme outbreeding can also be costly and deleterious - i.e.
via the risks of dispersal through unfamiliar territory (the springtime roadkill effect) to
aggressive competitors for mates (weekend singles bar affect), or even through
hybridization (which usually produces sterile or inviable offspring). The trick - no
surprise - is to select the best mate for reasons of fitness (at least in nature), and m st
animal species have behavioral conventions and sanctions to help achieve t is.
Conservation and population biologists and other ecologists are calculating the 'minimum
viable population" (MVP) necessary to maintain fitness over the long run. The long run
has been arbitrarily defined as a 99% chance of persistence for 1000 years (Schaffer
1981). As a starting point, the MVP can then be translated into carrying capacity
requirements (e.g. What local resources such as forage are required at what rate of
consumption?), which can then be used to calculate the area of a habitat system required
to ensure population maintenance and which is to be preserved (minimum critical habitat
- MCH),. At what point does the population size become so small that the risk of
extinction is unacceptable? Several approaches analyze population viability: rules of
thumb, analytic, and simulation. A rule of thumb (actually based in substantial theory) -
the "50/500" rule (Franklin 1980, Soule 1980) defines a short term population of 50 to
prevent unacceptable inbreeding and a level of 500 to maintain enough genetic variability
to adapt. To the extent that an ideal breeding population does not exist in nature (a few
males do most of the breeding, etc) the rule expands to about 500/5000. Population
extinction can occur because of random variations in its demography e.g. loss of
vulnerable age class which is the main breeding segment), environmental stochasticity
(e.g. habitat loss), catastrophe (flood fire, volcano) and genetic stochasticity of the kind
described above (May 1963 and Schaffer 1981). Genetic stochasticity is the main
concern with small populations of the kind found in forest fragments. These processes
are interrelated. For example, a reduction of t'ie forest into fragments leads to isolated
populations of small size, which leads to inbreeding, leading to a smaller population and
eventually to extinction. This is a form of positive feedback (uncontrolled) and is called
extinction vortex.
7.    Corridor Development and Management  The importance of corridors in protected area
planning and the maintenance of biological diversity is an increasingly current topic of interest and
research (cf. Sanders and Hobbs 1991 and Beier and Loe 1992). Unfortunately, empirical evidence is
largely anecdotal, and the science of corridors is in its infancy. Corridors tend to be linear features
which connect more extensive area of previously contiguous habitat. They, therefore suffer from
vulnerability to edge effects as noted above. Nevertheless, landscape connectivity is a fundamental
element of conservation biology. The conservative response to the current uncertainty attending the
width, representativeness, management and uses of corridors is to retain them wherever possible until we



- 33 -
ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 8
know more about function and geometry. The basic types of corridors are defined by their function -
for dispersal (by "passage" species such as migrating deer or predators) or habitat (for "corridor dwellers"
-often small mammals, reptiles, resident birds, and insects which reside in the corridor for extended
periods). The most critical measure of the utility of a corridor is how well it fulfills its function by
providing space for animals to travel, sites suitable for plant propagation, facilitating genetic interchange
for metapopulation sustainability, a way of responding to catastrophe and environmental change, and
provision of avenues for recolonization. These five functions have been recognized by American courts
in determining the adequacy of enviromnental analyses and mitigations. The functions will reflect such
features as vegetation types present, length and width, topography, and species present, and will serve
to determine the adequacy of the corridor. This is more meaningful than establishing an arbitrary width.
A checklist with 6 steps for plaming and evaluating corridors has been developed:
a     identifying the habitat elements the corridor is supposed to connect;
o     selecting several species of interest which serve as "umbrella indicators' conferring the
greatest benefits to the most species in need;
a     evaluating the requirements of each umbrella species;
a     evaluating the ability of the corridor to accommodate entry and movement of the species
(and identifying impediments such as human disturbance, silvicultural practices, etc.);
a     drawing the corridor(s) on a map and describing it, future management and uses; and,
o     designing and monitoring ani evaluation program.
The checklist has been recommended in the work plan for this project.
8.    Although the theoretical basis for protected area design and management has been developing
along some pretty novel lines for about 20 years, there is a surprising, even appalling lack of empirical
support. Natural opportunities such as the Bialowieza and the Carpathian complex are invaluable. Very
few confirmations in nature of the progress of inbreeding and its effects on the fragmented forest
community exist except for numerous and spectacular extinctions around the world and endangered
species listings in the United States. The data and inferences cited are therefore tentative and should be
tested through research and the emerging process of Adaptive Management (Lee 1977). The following
list summarizes some of what we generally know and what we might do:
(1)    for a minimum breeding population of 5,000 red deer, an area of about 25,000 ha would
be required;
(2)    about 4,000 ha are needed to support a pair of goshawks;
(3)    a minimum of some 125 ha would be necessary to insulate any breeding songbirds. This
would expand depending on the numbers and territorial requirements;
(4)    a commercial forest buffer or other source of shade need to be at least 50 m deep and
surround the forest;



34
ANNEX 2
Page 6 of 8
(5)   if the original forest area of the Carpathian system is calculated, and the percentage
remaining is determined, we can predict how many species may have already been lost
through further simulation models. As an initial estimate, in one European lowland
forest, species with large area requirements and low resistance to fragmentation rapidly
disappear when 60% of the forest is gone, and species with less rigorous requirements
begin to drop out when 80% of the ordinal forest is transformed;
(6)    some herbs (e,g. Dog's mercury) may need nearest neighboring forests at no more than
lOOm;
(7)   it is best to concentrate habitat in a single large tract rather than many small ones;
(8)    corridors have been demonstrated to be essential in some systems where they had to be
at least 200 m wide, although it would depend on the behavior of the species present;
(9)    policies to assist in prioritizing reserve acquisition have been suggested - i.e. first secure
larger fragments (usually the role of government and its national agencies, then encourage
regional groups such as NGOs to acquire all representative habitats in smaller fragments,
then local groups and individuals can get the available areas through title, easements and
other devices;
(10)   Circular properties are more secure than other shapes;
(11)   Management programs and instruments will be necessary to overcome the ecological
incompleteness and imbalance of fragments. Vegetation should be treated to ensure a
complete range of naturally occurring habitats and to shorten the thne to maturity of
certain associations (e.g. through selective thinning adjacent to the reserve to achieve and
old growth structure - Oliver 1991). Exotic plants and animals will need elimination.
Nuisance animals will need control (such as cowbirds from the adjacent grasslands);
(12)   policy stimuli and leadership will need to foster collaborative efforts reflecting the various
fields of Conservation Biology, managers, felled workers, researchers, forest product
users, theoreticians and modelers;
(13)   new educational curricula must be developed for such contemporary protected area
panning and management and should include more than the typical forestry topics. Even
more necessary are communications and group dynamics and public relation skills - i.e.
the disciplines embraced by Conservation Biology including community ecology,
economics, population genetics and epidemiology;
(14)   research must begin on (among other topics) species deletion impacts (the experimental
removal of species), species requirements (forage, behavior and seasonal habitats
requirements, etc). Breeding systems, and the use of corridors, a thorough inventory of
population and forest fragment sizes and trends, competitive interactions with sympatric
native species and invaders, trophic connectiveness, the identification of keystone
plant/pollinator/dispersor systems, population impacts of multispecies harvests,
electrophoretic studies of genetic variability of source, fragment and founder populations,

the biological and physical effects of different types of edge, the utility of predation in
the population genetics of the prey and the response of prey to predator control/removal,
and many others. This list is not offered to substitute for the inductive reasoning,
hypothesis formulation and research interests of the research community, but rather to
point to some of the topics which would be necessary to inform Conservation Biology
approach;
9.    Cost and Level of Effort The review and list correctly imply a lot of activity to support the
creation of a Carpathian Biosphere Reserve distinguished by existing fragments and the possibility of
designing additional elements. A preliminary estimate of the priority tasks and resources required is

TRANSCARPATHAN BIODIVERSfTY PROTECTION PROJECT
THE ACQUISITION AND USE OF A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.         Briefly, a GIS can use spatial data which are displayed as "themes' (forest cover, pollution
damage, threatened habitat, etc.) to objectively analyze and display the solution to a spatial land
management problem. Such useful products can include, for example, the least cost siting of a logging
road, areas of highest return on habitat development activities, dispersion of pollutants, etc. Such data
are usually acquired through remote sensing of the environment from a platform such as a satellite, or
aircraft. The aerial photographs or images of digital information transmitted from a satellite are then
"processed" manually or statistically to make them meaningful for aiding the achievement of the goals
of the project. Perhaps the greatest failures of GIS technology lie not in the technology but in the failure
of the resource scientists familiar with the area of interest, to educate both the image (ground truthing),
as well as the computer scientist who provides the image and does the initial processing. Lack of precise
conmunication at this point can lead to expensive but useless products whose categories are meaningless
in terms of real habitat or forest types.
2.         Forestry applications of GIS are increasingly common. Forest inventory, infrastructure,
wildlife habitat, geotechnically suitable sites for extraction activities, and other themes can be overlaid.
Likewise, the least expensive environmentally acceptable travel sheds can be spread over a compartment,
silvicultural treatments aliocated, and other analyses performed of use to foresters. Graphic output can
include hard copy maps or digital files.
3.         Other environmental applications of GIS of particular use in the conservation of biological
diversity are emerging. One common problem is in inventorying valuable resources such as endangered
species. Often they are fugitive, furtive, and their ranges are not fully known. In one application which
involved assessing impacts (in this case of roads) to one such important but poorly located species (very
similar to the black grouse), field studies were conducted on twenty habitat variables such as vegetation
type, and distance from water, at the few known population sites. Statistical analyses revealed that only
four of the environmental features contributed to the presence of the bird on its mating display grounds -
the critical environmental requirement in its annual cycle. These four map variables were overlaid and
the priority areas for habitat preservation were predicted over the whole forest. Furthermore, forest
succession and encroachmnent due to effective fire control efforts were predicted and the habitat losses due
to the loss of mating grounds were also predicted for twenty years. Another use of the GIS was in
predicting the impacts of poaching due to the siting of a mine in a rich wildlife area. Surveys revealed
that people would travel up to two hours to recreate and a "travelshed" of two hours on three different
grades of roads and trails was created by the GIS. The travelshed was overlain on key habitat and
revealed that only 3% of the area described by drawing a circle of two hours travel at 80 kph (the
traditiondl method) needed to be patrolled. The GIS analysis produced an efficient focus of effort and
savings of project money.

II. SYSTEM SELECTION
4.         The acquisition of a GIS will, to a degree, lock the user into the hardware and software
system selected. It must be able to satisfy the requirements of the Department while being adaptable to
future needs and compatible with the systems of related users (and sources of data) such as national
mapping agencies, and other resource agencies. A seminal step is inventorying the activities and systems
of other parts of Government. The next step ib in conducting a workload analysis. This lays the
groundwork for making appropriate choices which will have a long-lasting effect. It reviews current uses
which are being made of spatial information, projects future uses, and assesses those uses which can be
replaced by such an automated system as a GIS. How many maps are used for how long? How many
users? Are uses centralized or distributed? How many maps are created by the different uses? How
many overlays? The answers will reveal system requirements. Specifically, what will need to be
purchased, the supporting infrastructural requirements, and staff. The product will be a 5-year
implementation plan with annual costs and progress - i.e. a life cycle analysis. At this point the
procurement people can craft a procurement contract and RFP for the system, including the training
necessary before operations can be productive. At that point the potential vendors will provide
considerable ad hoc planning advice. It should be stressed that although the process will take several
months and an initial pulse of money, the savings from the up-front planning are inevitably considerable.
As mentioned at the beginning of this Annex, the entire process must be closely supervised by
knowledgeable resource scientists - i.e. the users (the biologists and foresters), not only the providers
(vendors and programmers), or the system is guaranteed to be maladaptive. However, a well-planned
GIS is a proven and essential tool in the kit of today's resource planners and managers. For example,
the provision of GIS-aided impact assessment analysis by the National Ecology Research Center of the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for Forest Plans of the U.S. Forest Service has resulted in a 75% saving
of time and money over traditional manual methods. Although the initial tasks involve inventorying
existing resources and capabilities and projecting the demands and uses of a GIS, we have provided an
initial estimate of such needs based upon our visits and discussions with the likely users. These estimates
will be useful in budget estimates now, but may require revision after the systematic analyses conducted
during the initial tasks.
III. TRAINING
5.         The system will not work without trained user/operators. However, it should be stressed
that there is no mnagic to acquiring the necessary skills. It is particularly useful if the operator is also the
scientist - i.e. the scientist does not always have to go to a computer operator not informed about the
technical demands and logic of the biologist or enviromnental engineer, meteorologist, etc. There are
several excellent center which have the range of new equipment and the relevant resource scientists,
which have taught the novice how to use GIS. A working knowledge will take about 2 to 3 months. A
complete facility will take about a year of working on actual projects. One of the trainees (there should
always be more than one trained), should be good at dealing with the hardware and software maintenance
and updating for the lab at the institution. Things will break and the whole system should not be down
for long.

IV. A GIS AT THE CARPATHIANS BIOSPHERE RESERVE
6.         Land Use Plannng and Zoning - Some resources are, in part, spatially defined. These
include seasonal ranges of such wild animal species as the herbivores ( e.g. cervids), as well as other
important faunal elements upon which the ecosystem may depend - i.e. pollinators such as insects and
bats. The distribution of forest stands and unique plant and animal associations is also mappable. Land
use activities, physical features, cultural features are also mappable "themes." In support of the land use
planning activities and corridor development planning, these resources will need to be inventoried and
mapped. The GIS will assist in analyzing these resources and in planning their uses by "map modeling" -
overlaying them, spreading them onto each other, subtracting some from others, etc. Locating the
resources is the first requisite to planning for zones of their best uses.
7.         Pollution Monitoring and Analysis - A GIS can be of immense value in projecting the
dispersion and attenuation of pollutants from a source. The GIS applications software "spreads" the
pollutants from their sources and will complement the use of the data which are now being collected by
researchers at Belovezhskaya Puscha. The use of these spatial data will be coordinated with the land use
planning described above. For example, forest thiining where pollutants are projected to increase,
placement of monitoring stations where analyses indicate problems, the placement of research plots, the
replacement of marginal agricultural sites in heavily polluted areas, the location of the most viable
candidate sites for protection in the primeval protected area network, and other uses influenced by the
projections of pollutants can be materially assisted with inventive applications of the GIS.
8.         Siting of Development Features - As the implementation of the land use plan occurs, the
siting of supporting infrastructure such as roads, tourist lodges, waste disposal/treatment facilities and
other such features which attend development can be assisted with a GIS.
9.         Although numerous uses will be made of this analytic tool, those mentioned above are
indicative. The final point is the need to coordinate any GIS system development with the broader needs
of the FRI and the Forestry Department. It is critical that the system be reviewed and found suitable in
outline by the Forest Development Project planners.

$ 182,300 to achieve a GIS capability. This does not include an image processing capability. Image
processing of digital data from satellites is an esoteric activity quite removed from the interests and
capabilities of the national park management. It should be the function of the Survey and Mapping
Agencies of Government, or contracted from, for example, EOSAT at about $8,000/ TM image. The
budget of $120,000 for this element assumes about $60,000 saved through shared training/copsultant costs
and some accrue by using shared imagery with the neighboring countries.

TRANSCARPATHIAN BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION PROJECT
MONITORING, SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION PLAN
1. INTRODUCTION
1.    Since the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Biodiversity Protection Project was derived from an
extension of a related effort to foster biodiversity protection in the Eastern Carpathians with Slovak
(GEF project) and Poland (Parks Component of the forthcoming Forest Development Loan)
supervision and monitoring are essential elements of any complex project. They are much more than
checking disbursements, reporting, and contractual observations. They are important in assisting all
participants to step back and view the whole effort rather than focussing on managing its parts. The
view afforded permits innovation, adaptive changes, mid-course corrections in changing
environments, and the evolution of the project in ways which enrich it and foster the achievement of
the goals of the project. Monitoring and evaluation are particularly important for projects that involve
uncertainty or poor and missing data. Therefore, in these cases, assumptions, innovations, and
techniques, must be closely monitored before waste or damage occurs.
MONrrORING
2.    With the number of innovative components in this project being implemented in a short time
frame, a wider and more extensive program of supervision and monitoring is proposed than is
commonly applied in Bank projects. For example, the life of this GEF project is two years,
rendering the Annual Project Review less meaningful. Also, its thrust differs somewhat from the
normal concerns of the implementing Agency. This will probably not be unusual for such new
technical concerns as conservation biology in many areas of the world which most require such
efforts. The normal checks and balances and quality assessment mechanisms of such Agencies may
be initially confounded by the novel and unfamiliar elements of such Projects and may therefore
benefit disproportionately from Bank supervision activities.
3.    There is a distinct danger of a paper blizzard with lots of raw monitoring data but little
analysis and useful synthesis. The Plan is more frequent (three times per year) as well as more
scientifically oriented compared to the normal schedule of semi-annual staff/consultant efforts in
regular Bank projects. The scheduled supervision visits respond to milestones proposed in the project.
SUERVESON
4.    Since this is an add-on to the Slovak GEF biodiversity project, there will be economies in
supervision, which will be conducted following each Slovak GEF biodiversity project supervision.
Three short supervision missions are planned for each year of the proposed two year project
:inplementation period (estimated at about of one(1) week each, with office time projected of three
weeks per year. Each of these missions should have the flexibility to adapt to the conditions at the
time. The Core Team would include the Task Manager, the forest wildlife ecologist, and the parks
specialist supplemented by additional scientists funded from trust funds.

5.      The first supervision mission is proposed for October, 1993. At this critical juncture, the
regional scientific three-country Scientific Committee workshop (as part of a tri-lateral trust) would be
held, equipment and infrastructure procurement would be underway, the GIS implementation plan
completed, and the Biodiversity Protection Program initiated. The second supervision mission will
take place in Feb/March Feb/March 1994 when the work is largely in progress, and a follow up
meeting, especially to discuss the project supported GEF biodiversity protection trust would be held.

6.     The proposed budget for this intensive supervision work is 27 staff weeks, 12 weeks for
1993, 11 staff weeks for 1994 and 4 staff weeks for the wrap up work in 1995. The estimated total
supervision cost is estimated at $40,000 for 1993, $35,000 for 1994 and $13,000 for 1995, for a total
supervision cost estimate of approximately $88,000 (inclusive of staff costs, consultant fees, travel
and subsistence) according to the detailed program outlined in the matrix above. The supervising
division expects at a minimum of 1.0 staff weeks of the specific scientific supervision work on the
GIS and the Land Use Planner to be eligible for non-GEF Trust Fund support. This would leave a
direct divisional supervision charge of 17 weeks for the full project cycle (6.8 per annum), which is
well below regular GEF supervision coefficients on an annualized basis (12 staff weeks per annum).
EVALUATION
7.     The project would be supervised in conjunction with the Slovak GEF Biodiversity Protection
Project to keep costs to a minimum.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNCATIONS EQUIPMENT
(Partial Listing Only)
1.    A modest fifty thousand dollars is budgeted for transport and communications equipment. The
nature of the dispersed components of the CBR of the management and coordinating units, and of regional
collaborators in Poland and Slovakia underlines the significance of this element. Furthermore, the areas
are remote and on rough, poorly maintained roads. The budget is designed to provide two vehicles and
their maintenance, liberal helicopter rental time, and communications hardware (faxs), VHF sets, relays
capabilities and software. This equipment has been identified as critical to undertake the project and full
specifications will be developed during project implementation.
2.    Vehicles and helicopters are widely available and are much less expensive than in the west. (For
example, helicopter rentals are presently 1/10 of the cost).
Helicopter Hire                                                           $ 5,000
