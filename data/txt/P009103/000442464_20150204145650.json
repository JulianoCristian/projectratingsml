The transcarpathian biodiversity protection\n            project was supported by a global environmental facility\n            (GEF) grant (the total cost of the project is United States\n            (U.S.) 0.58 million dollars, the GEF grant is U.S. 0.50\n            million dollars). The project objective was to demonstrate\n            the modern principles of environmental protection and\n            regenerating ecology in Ukraine, as well as to maintain an\n            initiative of the international biosphere reserve that was\n            developed by Ukraine, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. In\n            1994-1999, the Danube delta biodiversity project (with the\n            total cost of the project of U.S. 1.7 million dollars and a\n            GEF grant of U.S. 1.5 million dollars) was implemented. The\n            project provided support for protecting and improving the\n            conditions of the Ukrainian part of the ecological system of\n            Europe's largest waterway delta, which had a beneficial\n            effect on the general situation regarding preservation of\n            its biodiversity. The project for ozone depleting substances\n            phase-out in Ukraine (GEF grant of U.S. 23.2 million\n            dollars) is currently at the stage of implementation. The\n            project envisages support for the measures to replace\n            dangerous technologies at enterprises in the areas of\n            refrigerating engineering and production of aerosols,\n            solvents, and halons. Still another grant of the global\n            ecological facility is aimed at implementing the project for\n            GEF biodiversity conservation in the Azov-black sea\n            ecological corridor (the total cost of the project is U.S.\n            9.3 million dollars and a GEF grant is U.S. 6.9 million\n            dollars). The project objective consists in conserving\n            biological diversity in the territories along the Ukrainian\n            coast of the black and Azov seas. The GEF biodiversity\n            conservation project is carried out in two stages (the total\n            cost of the project is U.S. 112 million dollars). The\n            project is aimed at supporting an efficient long-term\n            strategy for the protection and well-balanced utilization of\n            Ukraine's biodiversity, and involving representatives\n            of the state and private sectors of the economy, as well as\n            expert researchers in partnership cooperation on these\n            issues. Promoting attraction of investments to the reformed\n            areas is one of the directions of the strategic assistance\n            rendered by international financial donors to Ukraine. The\n            project for managing Crimea's coastal zone and reducing\n            biogenous contamination (Black sea and Danube program of GEF\n            strategic partnership), aims to achieve this goal (a GEF\n            grant is U.S. 70 million dollars). Presently, the World Bank\n            and the Ukrainian Government are discussing possible\n            measures to be taken under the project, and sources of local financing."}, "docdt": "2004-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
