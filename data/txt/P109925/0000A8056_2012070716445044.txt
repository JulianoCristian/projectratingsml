                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Education Sector Support Scale Up Action Program (ESSSUAP) aims to 1) expand preschool and primary education services so as to reach the most vulnerable
                         groups of children through both demand- and supply-side interventions; and 2) enhance professional and administrative institutional capacity for education service
                         delivery at central, provincial, district and school levels.
