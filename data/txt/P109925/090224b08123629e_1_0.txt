                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Education Sector Support Scale Up Action Program (ESSSUAP) aims to 1) expand preschool and primary education services so as to reach the most vulnerable
                         groups of children through both demand- and supply-side interventions; and 2) enhance professional and administrative institutional capacity for education service
                         delivery at central, provincial, district and school levels.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall implementation progress towards full achievement of Project Development Objectives has been satisfactory. All twelve Performance Indicators have made progress. Four
                         indicators meet the planned targets, the other four indicators exceed targets and the remaining four indicators fail to reach the benchmarks primarily due to the effect of a reduction in
                         construction activities. The best performing indicators are indicators of Early Childhood Development (ECD), School Improvement Grants (SIG) and training sessions for teachers,
