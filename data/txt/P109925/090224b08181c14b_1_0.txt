                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Education Sector Support Scale Up Action Program (ESSSUAP) aims to 1) expand preschool and primary education services so as to reach the most vulnerable
                         groups of children through both demand- and supply-side interventions; and 2) enhance professional and administrative institutional capacity for education service
                         delivery at central, provincial, district and school levels.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since this is the last ISR, it takes a holistic view of the project. The impact of the project was positive. Inputs were delivered and they made a significant difference in the lives of
                         students. For institutional purposes, however, given the fact that 5 out of 12 output targets are under-achieved and the length of time taken to implement the project, the overall rating
                         for PDO is MU; 6 indicators have achieved the planned targets and 1 indicator is going to be met by project closure. This includes 4 indicators that exceeded initial targets. The

                         remaining 5 indicators have failed to reach the benchmarks, a result primarily reflecting the reduction in number of schools constructed.

                         The PAD indicates that the project will only make contributions to the PDO indicators, but will not be wholly responsible for achieving them. Hence, that while an MU rating is given for
                         the PDO, it should be noted that when you look at the whole set of indicators, as well as the many activities that made a significant contribution to education in Cambodia (EGRA,

                         primary scholarships, school grants, disability prevalence study, and ECD), implementation progress was relatively strong. Hence an MS rating for IP is warranted.

                         All remaining civil works are scheduled for completion by the project closing date, December 31, 2012. Transparency and accountability continue to feature strongly in all project
                         activities: its fully compliant with Legal Covenants and a Good Governance Framework is in place.
