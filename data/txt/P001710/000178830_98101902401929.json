The project would also provide training\n            and support to implement the project. The IDA credit would\n            finance specialists, equipment, operating costs, studies,\n            scholarships, and construction. The major benefit is to\n            reinforce the Government's commitment to improve\n            economic policies and institutions."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
