MALI
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING PROJECT
(Credit 1307-MLI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Economic
Management and Training Project in Mali, for which Credit 1307-MLI in the
amount of US$10.4 million was approved on December 7, 1982. The credit was
closed on December 30, 1988, one-and-a-half years behind schedule. The
Credit's last disbursement was on June 30, 1989, and an undisbursed amount
of US$43,480 (SDR 35,084) was cancelled by IDA on December 7, 1989.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Public Sector Management
Division of the Africa Region Technical Department (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III), and by the Borrower (Part II). Parts I and III
were sent to the Government with a request for their comments, but no
comments were received.
Preparation of this PCR is based on the President's Report, the
Development Credit Agreement; supervision reports; progress reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda;
and discussions with Bank staff who worked on the project during its
preparation and implementation.

MALI
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING PROJECT
(Credit 1307-MLI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.        Objectives
The project was expected to assist in the strengthening of economic
management in Mali and with the design of macro and sector policy reforms.
It would provide assistance to the Government in the identification of
better public financial and economic policies, the improvement of
government institutions in elaborating reforms, and the training of Malian
civil servants to make the improved institutions function better. (Para. 4,
Part I)
2.        Implementation Experience
With the exception of two components (State Enterprises and Cereals
Marketing), implementation of the project was slow-during the first years
and at times difficult. This was caused by delays in the selection and
recruitment of consultants and in procurement in general, and by the
problems the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) had in coordinating with the
implementing ministries and in submitting an appropriate general training
program. (Paras. 14-16, Part I)
3.        Results
The main results from the Credit were found in two components, State
Enterprises and Cereals Marketing. The State Enterprises component
financed studies which led to a Sector Adjustment program and a Public
Enterprise Institutional Development project. Also under this component
the Bureau des Entreprises Publiques (BEP) was created, audits of
parastatals were completed and some state enterprises were liquidated.
The project helped develop a program of reforms in the agricultural
sector through the Cereals Marketing component, and to a certain extent
helped in the restructuring of the Rural Development Agencies (ODR's).
(Paras. 18-19, Part I)
4.        Sustainability
lechnical assistance financed by the Credit helped introduce new and
more efficient procedures in the Malian economic and public sectors which
have been adopted and consistently used: (a) new arrangements for petroleum
procurement have provided Mali with a large finar 1. return, at an annual
saving for the country of about four billion FCFA; (b) as a result of a
field survey on expenditures of ur>an households, a Consumer Price Index



- iii -
(CPI) was introduced and market prices have been regularly collected and
published by the Ministry of Planning; (c) a simple computerized system of
budget preparation and monitoring was developed, with the help of a
consultant financed by the Credit, and continues to be effectively used by
the Budget Directorate (DNB). (Paras. 23-24, Part I)
5.        Findings and Lessons Learned
More time should have been devoted to project preparation, as project
design was not really completed before credit approval. In fact, there was
concern at the time that the project was "underdesigned".  The project had
many components unrelated to each other and one of the design prcblems was
the need for a great deal of coordination and input from various staff
units in the Bank.  This proved difficult to do during implementation.  In
addition to the problems experienced by the coordinating agency (PCU),
superv:.sion was inadequate at times or did nol have the right staff
composition. In the last two years project implementation accelerated with
supervision being done by a public - ir management specialist. (Paras.
8-9 and 12-13, Part I)

- Country:           Mali
- Sector:            Public Sector Manageme-it
B.        PROJECT BACKGROUND
1.        Sector Development Objectives.  In response to unsustainable
fiscal and external imbalances in the early 1980's, the Malian Government
decided to launch a program of economic and financial restructuring, and
IDA and the IMF were asked to assist in carrying out such a program. This
request represented a significant change in attitude on the part of the
Government, in recognizing that economic restructuring and improved put'1ic
financial management must be part of any lasting solution to the country's
economic problems. Technical assistance was needed to help elaborate
policy options, as well as to enhance the country's institutional capacity
to devise and carry out reforms.
2.        Policy Context.  Beginning in 1981 the Government introduced a
number of measures to reduce budgetary deficits, public enterprise losses,
and public sector arrears. Initial steps were also taken to restructure
the state enterprise sector and to improve the medium-term viability of key
enterprises. The Five-Year (1981-85) Plan for Economic and Social
Development put special emphasis on the need for policy reforms to
establish fundamental financial and economic equilibria, notably by
balancing the government budget, reducing the balance of payments deficit,
reducing the losses of the state enterprises, and controlling recruitment
for the Civil Service.
3.        Linkages Between Project, Sector and Macro Policy Objectives.
The project was successful in leading to structural and sector adjustment
operations for the first time in Mali.  It paved the way for a Public
Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit. In addition the proposed Agricultural
Sector Adjustment/Investment Credit (FY90) and the SAL (FY91) benefitted
from the project's outputs.



C.         PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project was expected to assist in the
strengthening of management of the Malian economy with the introduction of
macro and sector policy reforms. In order to achieve this objective it
expected to assist the Government in the identificatinn of better public
financial and economic policies, the improvement of government institutions
in elaborating reforms, and the training of Malian civil servants to make
the improved institutions function better.
5.        Project Components.  The project consisted of the following
components:
(a) Cereals Marketing: to restructure agencies responsible for
cereals marketing, especially the Cereals Marketing Board (OPAM)
through the carrying out of studies and training.
(b)  Rural Development Agercies (ODRs):  to carry out a diagnostic
study of the ODRs with a view to analyzing policies and
institutions operating in the rural development sector, and to
recommend changes to help increase the efficiency and the
economic and financial viability of the sector.
*c) State Enterprises: to carry out a diagnostic study of the state
enterprises sector with a view to examining the internal and
external constraints to increased effectiveness of state
enterprises.
(d) Economic Policy Analysis and Data Management: to conduct an
analysis of financial and economic policies in the Ministries af
Plan and Finance; to help the National Oftice of Statistics and
Data Processing in expanding and improving its data covering
production, prices, employment, and national accounts.
(e) Civil Service: the establishment by the National Office of
Civil Service and Personnel (DNFPP) of an efficient management
information system to ensure sound personnel management in
government services.
(f)  Public Debt Management:  to strengthen the Public Debt Agency
(CAA - Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement) and put in place a
computerized debt management system.
(g) Management Training Institute (IPGP): construction and
furnishing of classrooms and office space; to improve the
curricula and teaching methods of the IPGP through provision of
fellowships for its staff.
D.         PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
f.        The initial project idea was to assist in the carrying out of
reforms in the cereals marketing and state enterprise sectors. The
decision to assist these two sectors through a technical assistance project



resulted from policy discussions between the Government, the Bank and the
IMF at the time of prep&ration for the first IMK' Standby. These
discussions originated from the Government of Mali's request for technical
assistance from the Bank in December 1980. Funds from a Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) to finance diagnostic studies in the cereals
marketing and state enterprise sectors were first disbursed in February
1981.
7.        The other components were added later, in response to specific
requests either by the Government, as in the case of the assistance to the
Planning Ministry, or by staff from the Bank's various sector divisions. A
decision on the scope of the project, number of components, their sizes and
content, was made in early 1982 (Issues Paper of February 27, 1982), after
a series of short missions to Mali, linked to the appraisal of the project.
8.         .he project was not new in concept as there had been earlier
technical assistance efforts by the Bank.   But the project was unusual in
the variety of government institutiors it was designed to assist and it was
perhaps too ambitious in relation to its goal of overall institutional
strengthening, particularly with regard to the Economic Policy Analysis and
Data Management, Civil Service, and Public Debt Management components.
9.        Although this was largely the result of the stage of the policy
dialogue with Mali, the project components were probably too numerous and
too independent of each other.  Even before it was negotiated there   re
concerns among Bank staff that the project was attempting to do too much,
and that this would make it difficult for both IDA staff and the Government
to manage the project properly. But despite the feeling that the project
was "underdesigned", it was also considered important to get the project
started in order to assist the Governm,ent in its adjustment efforts.
10.       About 80 staffweeks were used for project preparation (as shown
on table 8, Part III, "Use of Bank Resources"), which is a little above the
average for preparation on technical assistance projects.   Two PPFs,
totalling $1.0 million, contributed to the beginning of actual project
activities by financing diagnostic studies and the start-up of activities
in the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU).
11.       Timing of the project was appropriate; the project helped pave
the way for the implementation of macro and sectoral reforms, and this was
consistent with the dialogue that had been recently started between the
Governn'.4nt and the Bank and their subsequent agreement on the need for
reform.
12.       The role and responsibilities of the PCU as the agency
responsible for managing implementation of the project were well defined at
the time of appraisal and negotiations of the Credit. Although the PCU's
functions had been described in detail at that time, the coordination
requirements of the project were underestimated when the PCU component was
designed. One of the institutional weaknesses of the project was that the
PCU was not tied more directly to those in charge of implementing the



adjustment programi at the Ministry of Finance. Instead the PCU was
attached to the Ministry of Plan. The PCU was expected to play a central
role in managing and coordinating assistance to the various government
implementing agencies in the project. In addition to experiencing
administrative problems at the start of the project and lack of contin-uity
in project management, it had difficulties coordinating with the other
ministries as expected. A supervision mission in January 1988 found that
performance of the PCU was not satisfartory concerning communications with
implementing agencies, coordination of training activities, and the
establishment of a training strategy.
13.       1.i retrospect, problems associated with the design of the
project seem to have contributed to the difficulties and slowness in
achieving the expected results in some of its components. In addition to
the PCU problem, described above, the diversity of the project components
:equired extensive coordination and input from different Bank divisions,
which proved difficult to realize during implementation.
E.         PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
14.       Critical Variances in Project Impleme-itation.  The most critical
variance between planned and actual project implementation was the rather
slow progress of many of the components, particularly during the first
years of the projec . The exceptions were the Cereals Marketing and State
Enterprise components which were operational from the start of the project
and which were instrumental in helping to restructure the cereals marketing
and public enterprise sectors.
15.       There were delays in the selection and recruitment of
consultants to do the studies and to provide technical assistance, on
procurement activities in general, and on the purchase of equipment and
materials for construction work, as in the case of the Business Management
Institute headquacters, which was completed and inaugurated at the end of
the life of the project. Also, training activities, a major component
throughout the Droject and an important tool in achieving its overall
objective of improving general ecowomic management practices in Mali,
suffered fr-.n a lack of proper planning and strategy.
16.       These variances in project implementation could have been
avoided or been less sericus if the project had had a stronger PCU.   The
first supervision mission, at the beginning of 1984, noted that
structurally the PCU was more adapted to project preparation and less to
project implementation.   Although the counterpart staff at the PCU
be-efitted from extensive training, both external (study tours and courses)
and internal (on the job training on public and financial management), the
PCU failed to perform according to appraisal expectations on the
supervision of the tec:hnical and financial execution of the project, on the
coordination with implementing ministries, and on the submission of an
appropriate general training program. More frequent supervision of project
activfties on the part of IDA would also have helped to better implement
the project.



17.       Project Risks.  The two major potential risks for this project.
ds mentioned in the President's Report, operational difficulties, including
trouble in recruiting specialists, shortages of qualified Malian
cournterFarts and trainees, and the complexity and slowness of
alministrative reform in general, proved to have been rightly identified at
the e me of appraisal.
F.        PROJECT RESULTS
1.8.      Project Objectives.  The State Enterprises coirponent was the
most successful component of the project. It provided for studies that led
to a sector adjustment program and a PE institutional development project.
Restructuring of some state enterprises was successfully undertaken (as in
the Development Bank of Mali - BDM), some others, including Air Mali and
Sor.uiex, were liquidated, albeit after many delays. The objective of
developing a program of reforms in the agricultural sector was achieved
through the Cereals Marketing component. To a certain extent the objective
of restructuring the ODRs under the rural development agencies component
was attained; as a result of a diagnostic study, the Government adopted a
reform program, resulting in the dismantling of several ODRs. But the
training which had been included under this component never materialized.
'.9.      The other two objectives. the building of stronger government
institutions and the training of civil servants, under other components
_Ecr.ornic Policy Analysis/Data Management; Civil Service; Public Debt
Management) were not attained as expected.   Nonetheless under these three
em=onents there were a number of achievements.  Details are in Table 4,
'Pro,ect Implementation", Part III of this r3port.
20.        Impact of Project.  The impact of the project was evident in the
state enterprises and financial sectors in Mali, and the activities
implemented under the state enterprises component constitute a major
acomplishment in that sector. The restructuring and privatization of the
Mali Development Bank (BDM) was a big step in the overall public
enterprises reform program, which inclucied audits of state enterprises,
liquidation of a number of them, and the creation of the Bureau des
Entreprises Publiques (BEP). Also, studies financed under the state
enterprises component led to two new projects and IDA credits: a PE Sector
Ad,ustment Credit (Cr. 1937-MLI), the first of its kind in Mali, and a PE
-nstitutional Development Credit (Cr. 1938-MLI).
21.       The project also had an impact in other sectors, although not as
strong as in the PE sector described above. With the help of two technical
advisors, cereals marketing policy reforms were introduced and OPAM's
restructur:ng was begun. The Government also adopted a reform program for
the rural development agencies, following the recommendations of a study on
the subject.
22.       The variances between planned and actual impact of the project
as regards the other components which aimed mainly at building itrr,n'-.
gover.nment lnstitutions and the training of civil servants, can be
exca1ained by a varying commitment to reform on tne part of different



ministries, as well as the unavailability of personnel for training
activities.
G.         PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
23.       A major benefit of this Credit was the new arrangements for
petroleum procurerrent, recormended by a study undertaken with the Ministry
of Finance, and which has provided Mali with a large financial return, at
an annual saving for the country of about four billion FCFA .
24.        Two other benefits which were achieved by the project should
also be mentioned. First, as a result of a field survey on expenditures of
urban households, a Consumer Price Index (CPI) was introduced and price
data has been collected and published regularly. Second, the Budget
Directorate (DNB) benefitted from the acquisition of computer equipment and
software.   With the help of a consultant, a simple computerized system of
budget preparation and monitoring was developed, and is still used by DNB.
H.         BANK PERFORMANCE
25.       After identification of the project, following the Malian
Government request for technical assistance, a good deal of work was
devoted to project preparation on the part of Bank staff. There were also
inputs from the relevant sector divisions during the appraisal stage. But,
during implementation, although the number of actual staffweeks sper.t under
supervision are in line with Bank guidelines, documentation of supervision
missions is very limited, giving the impression that the supervision effort
was rather sporadic. Before approval and actual implementation of this
credit .t was proposed to distribute supervision tasks to the various
relevant sector divisions in the old Projects Department.   This proved
unworkable during implementation and the sectoral supervision never
materialized. After the initial supervision missions, no record of
supervision ceports can be found for 1985 and 1987. In fact, there were
staffing problems. the project officer in charge of this credit left in
1985 and there was a gap cf six months until a new project officer came on
board. Supervision was subsequently transferred to the Resident Mission in
Bamako, but this did not work, as local staff there lacked the necessary
skills and Bank experience. In early 1988 supervision responsibilities
were transferred back to Headquarters and supervision intensified.
I.         BORROWER PERFORMIANCE
26.        The performance of the Borrower, through the main agencies
involved, varied considerably from agency to agency. The Ministry of
Finance provided important support to the computerization of the budget;
the Ministry of Labor and Civil Service was less forceful in fostering
institutional development. As already mentioned the PCU had numerous
problems in coordinating among these agencies.



J.        PROJECT RELATIONSHIP
27.       The relationship between the Bank and the Borrower in this
project varied from agency to agency and over time reflecting changes in
government personnel. and particularly in the PCU.
K.        CONSULTING SERVICES
28.       The effectiveness of consulting services provided under the
project varied considerably depending on the commitment of the concerned
government agency and on the quality of the consulting services provided.
The project did encounter difficulty in recruiting highly experienced
consultants for long-term assignments in Bamako. The long-term consultants
originally provided to the PCU were not particularly effective and, as a
result, greater emphasis was placed on periodic short consultant missions
in the later stages of the project. Consultant services had the greatest
impact in cereals reform, the petroleum procurement study, the
restructuring of BDM, and strengthening the Budget Department of the
Ministry of Finance.
L.        PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
29.       The original documentation for the project was adequate.  The
President's report should have provided a useful framework for the Bank and
Borrower during project implementation.
30.       The data to prepare this PCR, including progress and audit
reports, was mostly available, except the Progress Report for 1988, the
last year of project implementation.

MALI
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING PROJECT
(Credit 1307-MLI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE 1/
Introduction. The present report gives a detailed description of the
state of execution of each component of the Credit. Two PPFs became
effective in February 1981 and April 1982 respectively, at the Government
of Mali's request to finance as soon as possible the first five components
(Cereals Marketing, Rural Development Agencies, State Enterprises, Civil
Service, and the Project Coordination Unit) of the project. Technical
assistance to the Government, as provided under the proposed credit,
constituted a first step to the first structural adjustment lending
operation in Mali.
The Credit Agreement would support and assist the Government of Mali
to implement the 1983 "stand-by" program with the IMF. The IMF program and
the Credit helped develop and complement the technical assistance program
provided by other donors.
The project's main objective was to strengthen the management of the
Malian economy and to help identify a better government policy regarding
financial and economic matters, and as a result to improve government
institutions. Also included in the project were a training program and
diagnostic studies.
The Credit Agrement was signed on December 21 1982 for an amount of
9,700,000 SDR, and disbursed by June 30, 1989, under the different
categories.
I. Cereals Marketing
Objective. The Office of Agricultural Products (OPAM) in Mali,
created in 1965, had the monopoly of the commerce and sale of cereals. At
the end of 1980 the Government decided that a reform of OPAM was needed.
Implementation. The implementation of this component started before
the Credit was signed. Two specialists financed by the PPF were hired in
1/   This is a summary translation of Part II.  For more a more detailed
account the original version in French (Projet d'Assistance pour le
Renforcement de la Gestion Publique de l'Economie et pour la
Formation, Rapport d'Ach&vement) is available in the Africa Regional
Files.



June 1981.  Some progress was evident a year later:  price barriers were
lifted, the State monopoly of cereals marketing was abolished. OPAM's role
was reduced and measures were taken to limit its operating expenses.
Conclusion. The program for the restructuring of cereals marketing
was considered to have had a positive impact on this sector.
II. Rural Development ARencies (ODRs)
Obiective. Financing of diagnostic study to identify ways of
reducing deficits, to provide an analysis of the financial and economic
policies of the ODRs, and to propose institutional reforms with a view to
rehabilitate the sector.
Implementation. The first disbursement (PPF) in September 1983
financed the start of the diagnostic study. The study's proposals for the
restructuring of the ODRs were submitted to the Council of Ministers.
Conclusion. A total of 351 million FCFA was disbursed, which helped
finance the two phases of a study (diagnostic and restructuring proposals),
a seminar, the elaboration of a Plan of Action for each ODR, and a study on
the statutes of the ODRs. Total rehabilitation of the ODRs was not
attained, due to slowness in approving proposals.
III. State Enterprises
Obiective.  Financing of diagnostic study of the sector, which would
determine which state enterprises should remain and propose specific
reforms to make the sector more profitable.
Implementation. As a result of a diagnostic study and of discussion
with IDA staff, the Government classified the state enterprises in three
types: those which would be eliminated from the public sector, either
through privatization or liquidation; those which would be kept in the
public sector; and those which would be the subject of studies to prove
their viability within the Malian economy. Audits were undertaken of Air
Mali, SOMIEX, and BDM. The Office of Public Enterprises (BEP) was created
in March of 1985, to propose the sector strategies to the Government.
Conclusion. The main result from this component was that it gave
government institutions the instruments to (a) elaborate and implement
reforms in the sector; and (b) contribute to their execution.
IV. Planning
Obiective. At the time the Credit was signed UNDP had approved a
project for strengthening the capacity of central and regional planning in
Mali, and to provide training. The IDA credit aimed mainly at
strengthening the Government institutions, by improving economic and
financial policy analysis, economic statistics and data processing
operations.
Implementation. (a) National Planning Directorate (DNP): technical
assistance consultant submits report proposing creation of the National



- 10 -
Budget Commission imnd indicating methodology for the preparation of
investment budget. Implementation was quite slow and at the end most of
this subcomponent was financed by UNDP. (b) Statistics and Data
Processing: Computerization National Plan Study submitted by a consultant
was approved by the Government in September 1985. Consultant's proposals
for computerization were not executed. A survey of urban households is
undertaken which served as a model for consumer price index calculations.
Conclusion: Financing of the DNP subcomponent by IDA was much less
than expected and it was picked up later by UNDP. The Computerization Plan
was not implemented. The survey of urban households was successful.
V. Civil Service
Obiective.   To introduce a management information system in the
Civil Service and Personnel Directorate (DNFPP).
Implementation. Report by consultant on the situation at DNFPP
serves as basis for the assistance to be provided, which was divided into
four phases. Coding and updating of files was done.
Conclusion. Activities under this component contributed to create a
basis for rational management which should be be consolidated through
computerization.
VI. Public Debt Management
Objective. To help the office in charge of managing public debt
(CAA) function more effectively, through the training of staff and the
acquisition of office equipment.
Implementation. Debt census finished at end of 1984. Consultant
submitted report to Government, identifying operations and management
problems within the CAA, and recommending actions to solve the problems.
Conclusion. Although execution of this subcomponent was achieved,
problems still remain regarding the restructuring of CAA and its computer
system.
VII. Business Management Institute (IPGP)
Objective. To help in the restructuring of IPGP, and to
strengthen staff and training capabilities at IPGP.
Implementation. During 1985-87 IPGP provided training through
seminars and its staff did consulting work in particular for the state
enterprises. Transfer of technology also occurred throug)' the assistance
of expatriate consultants and overseas training of IPGP st.ff.
Construction of building.
Conclusion. Technical assistance component was completed :n December
1986. The IPGP building was ready to be inaugurated.



- 11 -
VIII. Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
Obiective. General supervision and implementation of the project,
coordination among the components, etc.
Implementation. Two technical assistance consultants provided
support during the first three years of project implementation; projet
audits were done by consultants financed by the Credit; training provided
to managers and secretarial staff. The PCU submitted quarterly progress
reports on a regular basis.
IX. Training Sub-component
Training was a constant in all components as an instrument for
improving economic management. There were implementation problems in this
subcomponent, mainly as a result of the lack of diagnostic studies under
some of the components; the slow implementation of some cc iponents; the
absence of consensus in general; difficulties in the choice of
apprentices, training centers, etc.; the unwillingness of some managers to
release staff for training.
X. Conclusion
Final disbursements for this Credit took place at the end of June
1989. A large percentage of disbursement was for technical assistance
while a much smaller one was for training.
Supervision by the PCU and by Bank staff (including the Resident
Mission) was provided on a regular basis, which helped manage the project
as expected.
The project contributed to the strengthening of the Government's
economic policy; it paved the way for economic and financial reforms.
