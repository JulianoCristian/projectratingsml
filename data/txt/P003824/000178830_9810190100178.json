to\n            assist the Government of Indonesia (GOI) in its efforts to\n            improve the health status of the population by increasing\n            the effectiveness of health care services, and by reducing\n            the incidence of malaria in three provinces of Sulawesi. The\n            project will improve the quality and increase the\n            utilization of health services through improvements in the\n            health center, referral and outreach system, and health\n            manpower development. The project will also extend and\n            intensify malaria control and aims to strengthen the\n            institutional capacity of the provincial and district health\n            administration in order to implement GOI's policy of\n            decentralizing health care planning and administration. The\n            project was identified, prepared and will be implemented by\n            the respective provincial health administrations with\n            technical guidance and administrative support from the\n            Ministry of Health (MOH). The project beneficiaries will\n            mainly be mothers and children."}, "docdt": "1983-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
