Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 This ISR covers the period of November 2014 to March 2015. This is the final ISR of the project. The last implementation support mission took place
 from March 2 through 6, 2015. To date, the Project has benefited a total of 37,194 people with sustainable access to water (both new and rehabilitated),
 and 42,010 people with sustainable access to sanitation services. To date, from the portfolio of 212 sub-projects 10 are still in execution and expected
 to be finalized by March 31st. Therefore, the final number of Project beneficiaries and the corresponding indicators will only be available in the first week
 of April. The ex-post surveys, which are particularly relevant in calculating the PDO numbers due to the qualitative evaluation of sustainability, are being
 carried out right now and the report will be available in early April as well. Under Component 3, the pilots are being evaluated and their lessons learned
 thoroughly documented. Good practices from the PRASNICA implementation process and achievements in the sector are also being documented as
 part of ICR preparation. As indicated in the previous ISR and as per the Ministry of Finance’s request, the Bank has processed a cancellation of SDR
 918,260.75 (equivalent to US$ 1,292,351.00 on February 27, 2015) from the PRASNICA Additional Financing grant.
