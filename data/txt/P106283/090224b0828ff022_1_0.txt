Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 To date, the Project has benefited a total of 77,817 people with improved access to water (both new and rehabilitated), and 35,218 people with
 improved access to sanitation. The execution of the PRASNICA and its Additional Financing continue to advance, though FISE’s execution of works has
 not taken place as fast as anticipated. These delays have jeopardized the timely finalization of some sub-projects under Components 1 and 2 by March
 2015 and around 10 to 12 will not be carried out before closure and will therefore be eliminated from the Project.. An action plan has been agreed with
 the Bank team, the Ministry of Finance and FISE in order to ensure the timely completion of remaining works under Components 1 and 2. Under
 Component 3, the sanitation markets pilot is finalized, while the Corn Island water and sanitation sub-components are advancing steadily, despite some
 delays. Validation of SIASAR data under component 4 shows strong progress, and an evaluation workshop for the AVAR took place to garner lessons-
 learned for the PROSASR. To date, the Project has disbursed US$ +18M of the PRASNICA grant (98.44%), US$ 300,000 of the credit (100%).
 However, only US$ 2,593,975.03 of the Additional Financing grant (43.4%) has been disbursed and a portion of the remaining balance will be cancelled
 (the final amount to be cancelled will be defined in January 2015).
