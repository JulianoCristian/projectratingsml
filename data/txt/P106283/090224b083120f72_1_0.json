      moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: WSS service sustainability depends on the quality\n            of infrastructure as well as institutional capacity to\n            operate and maintain the infrastructure. When a sector\n            relies disproportionately on donor financing, it is critical\n            that sector agencies have tools to align and guide\n            investments to ensure the investments support the agencies\u2019\n            vision for the sector. Sufficient time should be allocated\n            to the phase prior to design to ensure that users understand\n            the pros, cons, and maintenance requirements of each system.\n            A successful five or six year project can lay the groundwork\n            for positive institutional change but additional support is\n            usually required to ensure that the client fully\n            institutionalizes the good practices.
