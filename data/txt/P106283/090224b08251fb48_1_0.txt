                         To date, the Project has benefited a total of 65,389 people with improved access to water (both new and rehabilitated), and 30,312 people with improved access to sanitation. The
                         new rural WSS operation for the sector, the Nicaragua Sustainable Rural WSS Sector Project, (P147006) was approved on March 18, 2014, and will enable the Bank to sustain its
                         support to the sector’s development through close continued collaboration with FISE. A type II restructuring has been processed in order to allow for the timely completion of activities
                         with a new closing date of March 31st, 2015.

                         Component 1 continues to advance smoothly, with 149 sub-projects completed out of the planned 153, while the implementation of Component 2 continues to progress more slowly,
                         (20 sub-projects completed out of 50). Under Component 3, works of the Corn Island pilot project have finally been contracted, giving good hope that the pilot will be finished in time.
                         The SIASAR information system, under Component 4, now counts with more than 5,000 registered communities, and FISE has initiated a data validation process. The second phase
                         of municipal capacity building activities (AVAR II) is advancing well. To date, the Project has disbursed US$ 16.73M of the PRASNICA grant (89.89%), US$ 307,449 of the credit
                         (99.06%), and US$ 840,363 of the Additional Financing grant (13.54%). The results presented in this ISR refer to both the parent project PRASNICA and its Additional Financing.
