Section 1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of the Project’s appraisal, Nicaragua was the second poorest country in Latin
America.2 Of the country’s 5.5 million inhabitants, 48 percent lived below the poverty line and 17
percent lived in extreme poverty. Poverty was concentrated in rural areas, where 64 percent of the
population lived below the poverty line and 25 percent lived in extreme poverty. The highest rates
of poverty were in the largely rural North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCN) and
South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCS), where the majority of Nicaragua’s
indigenous populations live.

2.      Rural poverty was accompanied by limited access to water supply and sanitation (WSS)
services. Overall water coverage (piped and non-piped) was 63 percent in rural areas and sanitation
coverage (improved latrine with a complete structure that are in service) was 34 percent.3 Reliable
information on coverage levels in the RACCS and RACCN did not exist, but the Water and
Sanitation Program (WSP) and the World Bank estimated that water coverage levels were below
20 percent and sanitation coverage levels were below 30 percent.4

3.      The Rural WSS (RWSS) institutional framework was in a state of transition at Appraisal
as the Government of Nicaragua (GoN) was just beginning to implement the 2007 Water Law. The
Law covered three main public sector institutions: (i) the National Water and Sanitation
Commission (CONAPAS), the governing entity responsible for strategic planning; (ii) the
Nicaraguan Water and Sewerage Institute (INAA), the regulatory agency; and (iii) the Nicaraguan
Water and Sewerage Enterprise (ENACAL), the national service provider responsible for the urban
WSS systems and the supervision and control of service provision in rural areas. At the time of
Appraisal, however, there was no clear sector strategy or approach to monitor RWSS.

4.       The Emergency Social Investment Fund (FISE), a multi-sector project implementation
organization and the only investment vehicle for RWSS projects, was not identified as a main
institution in the 2007 Law but was effectively the most active institution in the RWSS sector. In
addition to supervising and providing financing to municipalities to implement projects, FISE
provided technical assistance (TA) to strengthen municipal capacity to provide post-construction
support to the rural communities’ WSS Committees (CAPS), who were responsible for managing
and maintaining the systems. Marking the importance of FISE to the RWSS sector, a Presidential
Decree issued in 2004 recognized FISE as a lead RWSS agency.5 The ease with which the decree
could be reversed and RWSS responsibilities could be transferred to another institution, however,
was troublesome for international donors working to build FISE’s capacity to manage RWSS.

5.      In addition, FISE’s multi-sector focus limited its capacity to assume a role beyond works
implementation. One of the most significant challenges for FISE was providing post-construction
support to ensure sustainability. Many municipalities did not have units or staff devoted to WSS

4 The Study, Coberatura de Agua Potable y Saneamiento en Nicaragua en 2005 , used the Census and a limited

household survey to establish corrective factors translating census data into JMP-equivalent coverage numbers.
5 Decree 118-2004 gives FISE the responsibility to manage, carry out and monitor projects and activities that help rural

or marginal populations access potable water.

                                                                                                                       1
supervision and support usually ended once the works were completed. In addition, the majority of
CAPS did not have the capacity to maintain and operate the works, making them highly dependent
on the municipalities for continued support. FISE was struggling to find a method by which to
systematically strengthen municipal WSS units (UMAS) and CAPS to achieve sustainability.

6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP) asked
the World Bank to lead donor involvement in the WSS sector given the Bank’s extensive worldwide
experience in WSS, as well as its fresh sector perspective (the Bank was a relatively newcomer to
the RWSS sector in Nicaragua). The MHCP requested that the Bank leads the sector through three
new WSS Projects, including the RWSS Project (PRASNICA), and takes a more active role in
supporting policy development. The Bank’s firsthand experience in RWSS sector policy and
institutional strengthening through projects such as the Paraguay Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Project (P007920) added significant value. The Bank had also at the time just finished
preparing a RWSS Project in Panama that had the same objectives as PRASNICA. In addition, the
Nicaragua RWSS sector needed financing. Nicaragua’s 2005 to 2015 sector strategy projected a
need for US$40 million per year to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), yet
Nicaragua only had US$10 to US$15 million to invest in the sector annually.

7.      Higher Level Objectives. PRASNICA directly supported Nicaragua’s achievement of the
drinking water and sanitation targets established in MDG No.7, “Ensure Environmental
Sustainability.” The Project’s high-level objective to improve the living standards of the poor and
indigenous populations was in line with the GoN’s goals and the Country Partnership Strategy6
(CPS, FY08-12). For example, PRASNICA supported the GoN’s National Development Plan
(PND) Sector Strategy on Infrastructure and Sustainable Development, which aimed to increase
coverage and quality of infrastructure to support economic growth and attain the MDGs. The
Project also supported the following CPS’s strategic objectives: (i) infrastructure and sustainable
development; and (ii) human capital development: improving social equity and opportunity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO)7 and Key Indicators

8.      The objective of the Project is to increase access by Project Beneficiaries to sustainable
water and sanitation services in rural areas of the Recipient. The PDO in the Financing Agreement
and PAD do not differ in substance, but slightly in wording and sentence construction. The ICR
uses the PDO wording of the Financing Agreement.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

9.      The PDO was not revised during the life of the Project. The targets of the key indicators
were increased to reflect additional funding that was allocated to RWSS works, in particular due to
the additional financing (AF) of US$6 million as well as relocations of funds between components
(See par. 12 and data sheet for more detail).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The Project and its AF expected to benefit 50,0008 beneficiaries with new or improved
access to RWSS services. In addition, the Project aimed to strengthen institutional capacity to
support sustainable RWSS service provision throughout Nicaragua. Specifically, the Project
aspired to build the capacity of FISE, the UMAS and the CAPS to carry out RWSS investments
and support the long-term sustainability of the systems.

Financing Agreement.

1.6 Revised Components. No changes in the components structure have taken place.

1.7 Other Significant Changes.

12.      PRASNICA had an AF and five restructurings. The AF aimed to scale up the activities of
the Project and cover cost overruns under Component 2. The restructurings only minimally altered
the design of PRASNICA; they were primarily focused on adjusting the Project to meet the
beneficiaries’ needs, which were continuously evolving given the demand-driven, framework
approach PRASNICA took (See Design Section for more detail). The most significant adjustments
responded to the difficulties encountered in implementation along the Caribbean Coast (component
2), including adjustments to the implementation arrangements with regional and indigenous
territorial governments, Project extensions and reallocation of funds among components and
disbursements categories. Despite the remarkable pioneering progress made through the
challenging activities located in the Caribbean Coast, towards the end of the Project it was


8In the May 2014 restructuring the total number of beneficiaries was adjusted from 50,000 to 97,000 to reflect
beneficiaries who received improved infrastructure from components one, two and three. The increase in beneficiary
numbers also reflected the movement of funds from component 2 to component 1 (see par. 12).

                                                                                                                     3
identified that several works planned for Component 2 (Caribbean Coast) could not be finalized
within the Project closing date. Since, at that point, the Nicaraguan portfolio had a new RWSS
operation under preparation, an additional Project extension (beyond one year from the original
closing date) to accommodate these unfinished works was not considered. Therefore, the GoN
jointly with the Bank decided to transfer the remaining sub-projects from the Caribbean Coast to
the new operation and to shift the funds originally allocated to these works from Component 2
(Caribbean Coast) to Component 1 (Pacific Coast), where the pace of implementation was much
faster. By transferring the funds to Component 1, the numbers of Project beneficiaries also
increased, since the construction costs in the Pacific Coast are lower (see par. 26). Overall, funding
for the Caribbean Coast went from US$8.15 million to US$5.5 million and coverage targets were
reduced from 15,000 for water access to 11,000 (rehabilitated and new) and from 15,000 to 5,000
for access to improved sanitation, while in parallel, targets in the Pacific Coast increased
substantially. Finally, in the final month of implementation, a final restructuring cancelled US$1.29
million from the Project (see par. 28). The restructurings provided the agility necessary to maintain
PRASNICA’s relevance and optimize its impact. For more detail on each of the individual
restructurings see Section H of the Data Sheet.

Section 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

13.      Background Analysis. The team conducted a solid analysis of lessons learned from past
projects and incorporated applicable lessons into the design. For instance, key lessons from RWSS
projects in Ecuador and Peru, such as the importance of demand-based approaches and of building
sustainability through investing in “softer” capacity building aspects, were incorporated into
PRASNICA. PRASNICA also incorporated lessons from the World Bank’s Nicaragua Poverty
Reduction and Local Development Project (P064906), which closed in 2007 and included RWSS
works. The Local Development Project emphasized the importance of a demand-based approach,
the coordination of social and national level strategies as well as the tailoring of RWSS solutions
to community needs. Reflecting these lessons, PRASNICA included upfront community
commitment, social capacity building before, during and after the works, donor coordination
mechanisms as well as a menu of system options that communities could choose from. The team
also conducted a thorough analysis of the structure of the RWSS sector and identified a significant
need to strengthen sector institutions and clarify institutional responsibilities to enable effective
implementation and long-term sustainability. The Bank had a strong rationale to finance
PRASNICA given the significant need for improving sustainable RWSS coverage in Nicaragua,
the direct request of the MHCP to develop the Project as well as the Bank’s experience developing
and supervising similar RWSS projects.

14.      Project Design. PRASNICA had a straightforward PDO that reflected the expected
outcome of the components. With the support of international experts, the task team identified and
included activities in the components that responded to sector weaknesses that would limit the
sustainability of PRASNICA’s investments as well as RWSS systems throughout the country. For
instance, FISE did not have an effective management chain to facilitate RWSS implementation and
supervision, especially post-construction. As a result, PRASNICA included an activity focused on
the development of a “sustainability chain” to promote sector-wide, long-term sustainability that
clearly established the roles and responsibilities of the communities, municipalities and FISE in the
provision of sustainable RWSS services (See Implementation Section for more details).




                                                                                                    4
15.      Another weakness identified by the task team was that FISE did not have a systematic way
of approaching the project cycle. As a result, RWSS works across the country were implemented
utilizing different approaches, some of which promoted sustainability more than others. To
consolidate best practices and provide a systematic approach to RWSS investments that promoted
sustainability regardless of the donor, the task team supported the development of the sector-wide
implementation manual for RWSS (MEPAS).9

16.      In addition to including state-of-the-art, innovative methods to strengthen the RWSS
sector, the design included traditional RWSS extension activities. Rather than focus solely on the
Pacific Coast region, where FISE had substantial implementation experience, however,
PRASNICA included investments in the Caribbean Coast region. Donors oftentimes hesitated to
finance RWSS works along the Caribbean Coast given the degree of difficulty of working in these
areas, and at the time of design, there were no substantial examples from which the team could
estimate implementation time and costs. Nevertheless, the need for RWSS works in the RACCN
and RACCS was very high given the low levels of coverage and financing dedicated to these areas.
The inclusion of these works was ambitious and risky, but the lead implementing agency’s
demonstrated track record of successfully overseeing RWSS investments and the pressing need to
improve RWSS services in these areas justified this design decision. The inclusion of the Caribbean
Coast Communities also amplified the Project’s poverty-focus.

17.      The Project was designed as a demand-driven framework project. The general types of
activities were defined at design but specific works under each component were estimations. The
framework approach gave the Project significant flexibility to respond to evolving Client and
beneficiary demands and to the reality on the ground. The scope of the components – building
infrastructure in remote rural communities while also strengthening the RWSS sector structure to
build sustainability – was ambitious but necessary. Extending access without significant
institutional strengthening would have limited the sustainability of the RWSS investments and
minimized the profound impact PRASNICA had on the RWSS sector. PRASNICA’s bold and
flexible design laid the groundwork for positively transforming the Sector as never before (see table
3, section 3.2).

18.     Implementation Arrangements. The GoN selected FISE to lead project implementation.
Although FISE had been involved in the RWSS sector for a number of years and was the most
active entity in the sector, FISE was a multi-sector, infrastructure-focused agency. FISE had only
recently established a formal RWSS unit, which it designated to lead implementation of
PRASNICA. With the support of PRASNICA, the GoN hoped to increase the capacity of FISE to
lead the sector. The implementation arrangements provided an excellent opportunity to build the
capacity of FISE to fulfill this responsibility. FISE had experience implementing World Bank
Projects (the Poverty Reduction and Local Development Project (P064906) closed in 2007 with a
Satisfactory rating) and working with international donors’ procurement, financial management
and safeguards procedures. For example, FISE had implemented projects financed by the German



9 The MEPAS established: (i) technical criteria for the eligibility of beneficiary municipalities (based on coverage gaps)
and standardized cut-offs for the unit costs of different kinds of works; (ii) a demand-responsive approach in which
social workers present the advantages, disadvantages and financial implications associated with each available level of
service, and the communities select the type of system they want; (iii) methods to ensure community ownership,
including: capital cost contribution from beneficiaries (ten percent through a combination of manual labor and in cash
contributions per household), user fees set at a level that cover full operation and maintenance costs, and the purchase
of meters (for piped systems) by beneficiaries; and (iv) social accompaniment before, during and after works (for
example, the community/social post-construction work lasts six months for piped water systems) as well as training on
managerial and organizational issues (geared towards the CAPS), hygiene and water management.

                                                                                                                        5
Development Bank (KfW), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Swiss Development
Agency (COSUDE), and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) among others.
Nevertheless, the newly created RWSS unit had limited functional experience and required capacity
building and supervision support at the outset of implementation. The sustainability dimension of
PRASNICA was new to FISE and required intensive support.

19.     While FISE acted as the main implementing agency, the municipalities in coordination
with the CAPS were responsible for overseeing the execution of the works. Working with various
municipalities and CAPS added a degree of complexity to the implementation arrangements, yet
was critical to the overall sustainability of the RWSS investments given that the arrangements
permitted direct capacity building of key sector actors.

20.     Adequacy of Government Commitment. The GoN was committed to strengthening the
RWSS sector and requested the Bank’s assistance to lead donor involvement in the sector. The
GoN’s sector objectives and development goals were closely aligned with PRASNICA’s goals,
creating a high-level of dedication to the successful preparation and implementation of the Project.
In demonstration of its commitment to PRASNICA, the GoN accepted the Bank’s recommendation
to develop a transparent basis for allocating funds among municipalities.

21.      Assessment of Risks. At Preparation, the Project team rated the overall risk as Moderate
due to the mitigation measures established in the PAD. The risks identified were the threat to
sustainability posed by unclear institutional responsibilities, the influence of politics in the selection
of beneficiary communities, the absence of a comprehensive sector strategy, as well as Nicaragua’s
exposure to natural disasters. The mitigation measures were adequate so the risks identified in the
PAD did not materialize. In the 2012 AF, the Project team re-assessed Project risks and highlighted
the difficulties inherent in coordinating work between municipalities, regional governments and
the central government, and FISE’s fiduciary and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity. One
risk that the design team did not capture at Appraisal that was assessed by the AF was the difficulty
of working in the RACCN and RACCS. At the time of design, there was a lack of prior experience
from which to draw lessons and cost estimates for carrying out RWSS works in the Caribbean
Region. The AF’s mitigation measures, which included working closely with the regional
autonomous and territorial governments, enabled the works to move forward. The inclusion of the
Caribbean region in the Project was a ‘high risk, high reward,’ decision that led PRASNICA to
pioneer a structured and continued RWSS engagement in the Caribbean Region.

2.2 Implementation

22.    PRASNICA finished with a Moderately Satisfactory implementation rating. PRASNICA’s
engagement of communities throughout the project cycle, promotion of a uniform investment
approach, and focus on strengthening institutions at the national, municipal and community levels
were key drivers of successful implementation.

23.     Community Ownership. PRASNICA engaged beneficiary communities from the outset,
building ownership and a high level of commitment to the successful implementation of the works.
In line with the MEPAS, FISE presented communities with a menu of options so that they could
choose the design and level of service they desired. Residents had to pay counterpart funds to
support the works (mostly in-kind), purchase micrometers (for piped systems) and provide up-front
contributions for at least six months of fees before implementation could begin (the money went to
the CAPS’ savings accounts) to ensure they had the capacity to sustain the WSS services they


                                                                                                        6
selected.10 The up-front contributions built communities’ commitment to the success of the project
and demonstrated the real demand for the systems. The majority (78 percent) of the communities
were also responsible for contracting and overseeing the execution of the works through a
Community Driven Development (CDD) approach, further building ownership and commitment to
the long-term sustainability of the systems. This arrangement increased the CAPS’ capacity to
operate and manage their systems sustainably after the works were complete.

24.      Sustainability chain. PRASNICA’s focus on establishing a sustainability chain for the
RWSS sector (See Figure 1) was critical to the successful implementation of the rural works and
to their overall sustainability. Prior to the establishment of the sustainability chain, the roles and
responsibilities of the sector actors were unclear. The clarity with which the sustainability chain
established the responsibilities from the ground level to the central level transformed the method
of doing business in the Nicaraguan RWSS sector and promoted efficient and effective
implementation. The sustainability chain permitted FISE to oversee the implementation of 212
works spread across the country in only six years and also provided a means for FISE (through its
ARAS – see Figure 1 below), in coordination with the municipalities, to monitor the systems post-
construction, promoting the long-term sustainability of the works. See the Efficacy Section for more
detail on capacity building at each level of the chain.

25.     Uniform Investment Approach. PRASNICA’s development and FISEs and donors’
adoption of the MEPAS ensured that investments in the sector followed a unified approach
throughout the Project cycle. As detailed in the Design Section, the MEPAS systematized existing
practices and incorporated new, international best practices, such as a demand-responsive approach
to RWSS investments. During implementation, the MEPAS ensured that all investments supported
the same sector vision, maximizing the results of each individual project and furthering FISE’s
adoption of an approach and structure to RWSS investments that went beyond individual project
cycles. The Bank team also worked closely with the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP),

                                                                                                                   7
COSUDE, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other donors in the RWSS sector in
order to coordinate actions and funds allocation. The donors involved in the sector oftentimes
participated in Bank missions, and the Bank regularly held roundtable discussions with donors to
ensure that investments were complementary.

26.     Caribbean Coast Communities. The inclusion of Caribbean Coast communities in
PRASNICA was key given the low RWSS coverage levels and the tendency of donors to eschew
projects in this area because of the remoteness of the region. The complexities inherent to the
Caribbean Coast, such as difficulty of access, high presence of indigenous and afro-descendants
peoples (with particular cultural needs), an autonomous Government structure, limited willingness
of firms to work in the area, and higher than expected implementation costs (the costs were on
average 100% higher in the Caribbean Coast when compared to the Pacific. See annex 3 for details)
were underestimated at design and slowed implementation. In addition, FISE had limited
experience working in the region and did not have established mechanisms to engage with the
regional autonomous governments (during implementation, a set of tools was developed at the
Project’s outset –see the Social Safeguards Section). The cumulative impact of these challenges
delayed implementation and reduced the scale of works (see par. 12). Despite these challenges,
PRASNICA achieved important results under component 2, both terms of beneficiaries and in
paving the way for continued engagement in the RACCN and RACCS through the new operation
and potentially with other donors. The Project’s five restructurings and AF mostly responded to the
complications involved in implementing works along the Coast and reflected the difficulty of
planning and carrying out the works. The responsiveness of the restructurings to the on-the-ground
progress of the RWSS investments was key to ensuring that the complications would not jeopardize
the overall impact of the Project.

27.     Mid-Term Review (MTR). The Project team conducted a comprehensive MTR in January
2012 that highlighted the importance of strengthening the institutional framework to promote
sustainability during the second-half of implementation for satisfactory achievement of the PDO.
The Project team analyzed the effectiveness of the sustainability chain and identified areas that
could be strengthened. For instance, the ARAS who had a key role in the sustainability chain
through providing support to the UMAS were more focused on evaluating RWSS works. This
aspect and many others were addressed at MTR.

28.     Canceled Funds. Twelve of the works in the last package of sub-projects encountered last-
minute land tenure issues and could not be completed by the Project closure (representing less than
6% of the Project cost). The land tenure documentation could not be finalized before the community
had agreed on the location of the infrastructure and accepted the designs. The issues encountered
upon solicitation of legal documentation were more complicated and took longer than usual,
making it impossible to complete the works prior to the Project’s closing date. US$1.29 million of
the AF was canceled and part of the 12 works were moved to PROSASR. The cancellation was not
processed until the very end of implementation (in the March 2015 restructuring) to give FISE as
much time as possible to finalize as many activities as possible by the Project’s closure.

29.      In the final ISR, the task team cautiously rated implementation progress as Moderately
Satisfactory (MS) given that FISE was still finalizing works until the end of the Project, along with
outstanding financial management and procurement issues (Paragraphs 40 and 41). The PDO was
also rated MS, since the ex-post evaluation was not ready yet.11 FISE’s resolution of the financial


11As foreseen in the PAD, the final results of the PDO Indicators would come from an ex-post survey to be carried out
by the end of the Project. By the time of the last ISR, the results of the ex-post survey were not ready yet. The final ISR

                                                                                                                         8
management and procurement issues, its completion of the large majority of the RWSS works (212
sub-projects in total, see paragraph 28 for detail on the 12 sub-projects that were canceled), and in
particular the positive results from the ex-post survey resulted in the ICR’s upgrading of both
PRASNICA’s ratings from Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.     M&E Design. PRASNICA had a solid results framework that provided a means to
systematically assess implementation progress and measure outcomes. FISE in coordination with
the municipalities was responsible for the collection of indicator data. PRASNICA’s results
framework provided a comprehensive method to evaluate the full impact of the Project. The
indicator targets, however, were difficult to establish given that PRASNICA’s design was demand-
driven and the activities were expected to evolve to optimize project results. The outcome level
indicators relied on an ex-post survey that included a CAPS sustainability scorecard. FISE carried
out a survey at design to develop a baseline. The majority of the intermediate indicators utilized
FISE’s existing M&E system and reflected information the GoN was tracking at a national level.
At the time of design, the GoN was endeavoring to align indicator definitions and collection
methods across institutions, and the Bank team was committed to helping this effort.

31.      M&E Implementation. In regard to PDO-level indicators, FISE oversaw the
implementation of the indicator survey at the MTR and at the Project’s closure. The FISE and Bank
teams used the results from the survey conducted during the MTR to inform the implementation
strategy for the second-half of the Project. FISE tracked progress on the intermediate indicators
regularly but faced minor difficulties given inconsistent communication on Project data between
FISE’s units as well as a lack of clarity on how to calculate some of the indicators. Close
supervision support from the Bank team, which made frequent supervision missions, however,
helped facilitate indicator-related communication at FISE and clarify calculation methods. At the
Project’s closure, FISE contracted an independent consultant who conducted an ex-post survey in
105 communities that received infrastructure investments as part of PRASNICA and in 275
communities whose municipal water and sanitation units had received training but not
infrastructure investments as part of PRASNICA. The survey was used as the basis for the final
calculation of the indicators.

32.      As mentioned above, PRASNICA’s demand driven approach made it very difficult to
establish targets. To ensure that the results framework did not lose relevance, the team made several
adjustments to the indicator targets through restructurings to reflect the changing situation on the
ground. Although the team demonstrated a high-level of agility adjusting the targets, the constantly
evolving nature of the interventions made targets difficult to predict. For example, the final number
of rehabilitated water connections (intermediate indicator 2 and 6) were lower than expected given
that at the time of intervention, many of the existing systems (which were expected to have
rehabilitation work done) were found in such poor conditions that a full replacement was deemed
more appropriate. As a result of this shift, the final number of new connections (indicator 5, for the
case of Component 2) exceeded its expected target and appeared inflated. When analyzed together,
however, the estimated number of beneficiaries from water works in Component 2 is on target. A
similar situation happened with sanitation in Component 1, where the demand for sanitation works



highlighted that “The ex-post surveys, which are particularly relevant in calculating the PDO numbers (…) will be
available in early April… As a result, the ICR fact-finding mission will be crucial in providing a final evaluation of the
Project.” ISR March 2015.

                                                                                                                         9
increased towards the end of the project and the final number of beneficiaries was higher than
expected.

33.     PRASNICA also supported the development the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Information System (SIASAR, www.siasar.org), a regional, online platform to track RWSS
coverage, quality and sustainability in rural areas. Nicaragua played a leadership role in the
development of the SIASAR tool, successfully uploading the large majority of its rural
communities to the system before other member countries and consistently providing key feedback
for improvement of the functionality of the tool. Prior to SIASAR, the GoN had no method for
systematically tracking coverage, the sustainability of the systems, and service quality in rural
areas. For more information on SIASAR, see Box 1 in Annex Two.

34.      M&E Utilization. FISE regularly uploaded Project indicators on household water
connections, capacity building for CAPS and participation of women on the National Government
Monitoring System. In addition, FISE and several municipalities are currently using SIASAR to
prioritize communities for investments and TA. FISE is also using SIASAR to inform the National
Water Plan, which FISE is developing in coordination with ENACAL and INAA. The results
framework of PROSASR includes several countrywide indicators, such as the number of CAPS
operating sustainably and the number of institutions working in RWSS, but not financed by FISE,
that adopt the MEPAS, which will permit continued monitoring and evaluation of PRASNICA’s
impact. In particular, PROSASR’s use of SIASAR as a primary data collection tool for its results
framework will promote the sustainability of the tool.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35.     Safeguard Compliance. PRASNICA triggered the Environmental Assessment Policy
(OP/BP4.01, Category B), the Physical Cultural Resources Policy (OP/BP 4.11), the Indigenous
Peoples Policy (OP/BP 4.10) and the International Waterways Safeguard (OP/BP 7.50) and
finished with a Moderately Satisfactory overall safeguards rating.

36.    FISE completed the Project with a Moderately Satisfactory rating for its compliance with
the Environmental Assessment Safeguard and a Satisfactory rating for its Physical Cultural
Resources Policy Safeguard. Throughout implementation, environmental safeguard
implementation was rated Satisfactory. The MS ratings reported in some ISRs were linked to minor
shortcomings in the staffing of the environmental office, but those did not prevent them from
adequately complying with safeguards. FISE developed and implemented an Environmental Social
Management Framework (ESMF), which included criteria for design standards, screening works
and monitoring progress. On an institutional level, FISE established an Environmental
Management Unit focused on risk management and RWSS.

37.      With regard to social safeguards, FISE achieved a Satisfactory rating for its compliance
with the Indigenous Peoples Policy safeguard. As part of the Project, FISE developed an Indigenous
and Afro-Nicaraguan People’s Plan (PPIA) to support the participation of local populations in the
project cycle and to ensure that local cultural considerations were taken into account during project
implementation. FISE’s capacity to work with indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan communities not
only in the Caribbean Coast region but also in the Pacific, Center and Northern regions increased
substantially over the course of implementation. PRASNICA created the platform for culturally
adequate sustainable WSS infrastructure and service provision. FISE’s closing report states that the
PPIA was “key for the improvement and consolidation of FISE’s relationship with Regional



                                                                                                  10
Autonomous Governments and the institutionalization of intervention procedures in indigenous
and Afro communities.”

38.      As part of the PPIA, project coordination agreements were discussed, developed and signed
with all regional governments and strategic documents, such as the MEPAS, and capacity building
material were adjusted to reflect the physical characteristics and cultural considerations of the
Caribbean Region. For example, the Regional Governments elaborated a special MEPAS called
“MEPASH” which included “Hygiene” as a main goal, costs that reflected the region’s realities,
the intervention of traditional authorities in some decision-making schemes, and a more flexible
community, counterpart contribution scheme for RWSS sub-projects. The MEPASH and all
relevant community training material were provided in local languages (Miskito, Mayagna, Creole
English).

39.      The International Waterways Safeguard Policy was triggered during the preparation of the
AF as a precautionary measure given the works along the Alto Coco and San Juan River
watersheds, which border Honduras and Costa Rica respectively. In compliance with this policy,
the GoN sent a notification to the Governments of Honduras and Costa Rica. No response was
received in the established time period, permitting the continuation of the works in compliance with
this policy.

40.      Fiduciary Compliance. The project was rated Satisfactory for most of the implementation;
though some Moderately Unsatisfactory ratings were reported, the related shortcomings did not
affect implementation in a substantial way. The Project finished with a Moderately Unsatisfactory
ISR rating in both financial management (FM) and procurement due to the then pending resolution
of an audit that revealed questionable cost of US$71,444 and a 2014 Procurement Post Review that
qualified procurement processes and contract administration as presenting substantial risk. During
the ICR process, FISE submitted supporting documentation to the Bank to clarify the questionable
costs. The Bank FM team also had discussions with the auditors carrying out the final audit review
of the Project, which took place in parallel with the ICR process. The auditors officially informed
the Bank that all expenses were adequately justified, except for US$ 1,012 which were considered
ineligible expenses. This amount (US$ 1,012) is in the process of being reimbursed to the Bank.
Since 98% of the audit concerns are on track to be cleared in the upcoming final audit report and
the other FM arrangements have been adequately addressed,12 the FM team recently upgraded the
FM rating to Moderately Satisfactory. In terms of general management of financial aspects, FISE
sent Interim Unaudited Financial Reports and updated FISE’s fixed assets information on a regular
basis.

41.      With regard to procurement, a recent 2015 Procurement Post Review, carried out in parallel
to the latest procurement audit review, upgraded PRASNICA’s procurement rating from
Moderately Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory given that FISE provided evidence that it
had improved the implementation of procurement processes in compliance with Bank policy. The
MU rating in the final ISR was linked to the delay of the 2015 procurement review until after
Project closing, and was subsequently upgraded once the review was carried out. One procurement
challenge that FISE faced was collecting the minimum number of statements of interest and
satisfactory offers to hire consulting firms and contractors. Many local firms did not have the
qualifications to apply for the contracts and international firms did not express the level of interest
expected at design. In addition, several consulting firms that ended up being contracted delivered
low quality and delayed work due to their limited capacity and commitment. To overcome these

                                                                                                    11
difficulties, FISE and the Bank agreed on several alternative measures (such as the use of individual
consultants to improve the social work and the increase of the CDD ceiling) to improve the quality
of consulting and construction activities. In parallel, the Bank worked with FISE to apply some
mitigation measures such as procurement audits for sub-projects, a schedule of procurement
trainings, increased monitoring of contract management, a review of price estimates under the
processes and an independent market assessment for the specific project among others.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

42.       PRASNICA’s focus was on building sustainable RWSS systems. As described in detail in
the Efficacy Section, the Project provided capacity building for the CAPS, municipalities and FISE
with the goal of supporting the long-term sustainability of RWSS systems throughout the country.
By the end of the Project, the majority of the CAPS that received infrastructure works were
managing the systems sustainably; they had reliable service (at least 12 hours a day in the dry
season) and collected tariffs that covered operation and maintenance among other indicators of
sustainability. Sixty-five percent of the CAPS that received infrastructure investments during the
first three years of implementation were still functioning sustainably at the end of the Project
illustrating the effectiveness of PRASNICA’s approach and exceeding the target by 10 percentage
points.

43.      The RWSS sector structure as it now stands is fostering sustainable CAPS, and the recently
approved PROSASR Project will further strengthen the sector structure. PROSASR’s objective “to
increase access to sustainable WSS services in selected poor rural areas of Nicaragua through the
consolidation of RWSS sector institutions and the provision of adequate infrastructure.” As with
PRASNICA, FISE is leading the implementation of PROSASR in coordination with the
municipalities, regional governments and the CAPS. PROSASR will further strengthen the RWSS
service sustainability chain through supporting institutional strengthening at the central, municipal
and community levels. For example, PROSASR will support additional training for the UMAS,
will utilize the CDD model and will help FISE harmonize existing norms, policies and planning
instruments among other activities. These capacity-building exercises will improve the
sustainability of existing RWSS investments – including those of PRASNICA – in the country. In
addition, several of the RWSS works along the Caribbean Coast that were not carried out under
PRASNICA will be financed by PROSASR. PROSASR reflected several lessons learned from
PRASNICA, including: (i) access constraints make investments along the Caribbean Coast far more
costly; (ii) the complexity of the RWSS sector requires leadership and coordination from dedicated
institutions structure for this purpose; and (iii) better organized CAPS contribute strongly to the
sustainability of the WSS systems. The PACCAS13 Project is also built on the work begun under
PRASNICA’s pilot project for Corn Island.

Section 3. Assessment of Outcomes

The PDO for this Project was to increase access by project beneficiaries to sustainable WSS
services in rural areas.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives
Rating: High

44.      PROSASR’s objective to increase access to sustainable WSS services highlights the
continued high relevance of PRASNICA’s objectives. The GoN’s Program for Human Water and
Sanitation (PISASH), which runs through 2030, and its complementing National Plan for Water
(currently under development), focus on extending WSS services to rural areas in a sustainable
manner, further emphasizing the relevance of PRASNICA’s objectives. The GoN’s National Pl an
for Human Development for 2012 to 2016 sets a goal to extend quality WSS coverage and achieve
MDG No. 7. The CPS FY 2013 to 2017 emphasizes “improving social welfare by improving access
to quality basic services, in particular for poor, rural households.” PRASNICA’s objectives also
directly support the World Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and promoting
shared prosperity given PRASNICA’s focus on improving the quality of life of Nicaragua’s poorest
residents by providing them with access to sustainable WSS services.

Relevance of Design
Rating: Substantial

45.      PRASNICA’s approach of combining institutional strengthening with infrastructure
investments played a key role in not only extending access to RWSS services but to sustainable
access to RWSS services. The design of PRASNICA was sophisticated, bringing the new approach
of “sustainable RWSS” to FISE, an old-style, works-focused institution. In particular, the
introduction of the MEPAS and the sustainability chain provided a framework for effective RWSS
sector management and transformed the way of doing business in the sector. The inclusion of work
along the Caribbean Coast was particularly relevant given the vulnerability of the rural population
and the uncertainty prior to PRASNICA on how to effectively engage and carry out RWSS works
in this region. Nevertheless, the design at Appraisal underestimated the difficulties of working in
the RACCN and RACCS, and PRASNICA experienced increased costs and implementation delays,
which resulted in project adjustments during implementation (see pars. 12 and 26). Nevertheless,
the design that evolved during implementation, which included tools such as the MEPASH that
were tailored to the needs of the region, enabled important achievements in that region and laid the
groundwork for future, more efficient implementation. By the Project’s closure, PRASNICA had
established a method and tools to facilitate efficient implementation, and FISE is already using
PRASNICA’s design to carryout works in this region.

46.     Given the success of PRASNICA’s design in the Nicaraguan context, the PROSASR
adopted a similar implementation model. PROSASR aims to further strengthen the RWSS
sustainability chain and to promote the continued use of MEPAS, CDD, and SIASAR.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Efficacy
Rating: Substantial

47.     The Project achieved its PDO to increase access to sustainable WSS services in rural areas,
surpassing its three PDO-level indicator targets (See Table 1 below). First, the Project increased
sustainable access to water systems to 68,051 beneficiaries, exceeding the Project’s target of

                                                                                                 13
34,000. The Project defined access as sustainable when the governing CAPS achieved a score of A
or B on the scorecard presented in Annex 1 of the AF.14 The scorecard evaluated the physical
components of the WSS systems, the establishment and functionality of the CAPS, the application
and collection of tariffs, the use of meters, protection of the watershed, the quality of water, and
the continuity of the service. Table 2 (below) details how the A and B CAPS performed in each of
these categories.

48.      Second, the Project achieved its outcome indicator on extending sustainable access to
sanitation systems to 34,000 or more beneficiaries through extending sustainable access to
sanitation solutions to 44,120 beneficiaries. The Project defined sanitation service as sustainable
when beneficiaries had access to at least a latrine and were using the solution. PRASNICA
promoted the proper use of latrines through engaging communities on hygiene education,
consulting households on the positioning of the latrine and recommending that each latrine have a
hand washing facilities positioned close by. The beneficiaries’ access to and effective use of the
sanitation solutions were verified in the ex-post survey. Third, 65 percent of the CAPS created
during the first three years of implementation were operating at an A or B level three or more years
after their constitution, surpassing Project’s target and demonstrating the capacity of the sustainable
CAPS to maintain their WSS systems after the Project’s close. PRASNICA’s full achievement of
its PDO-level indicators illustrates the Project’s achievement of its development outcome.

49.     The Project task team realized that achieving sustainability was a long-term process that
for many communities would take longer than five years to achieve; hence, the goal of extending
sustainable access to only a percentage of total beneficiaries. The CAPS that did not achieve an A
or B rating should not be considered unsustainable. Rather, they are on the path to sustainability
(the sustainability chain PRASNICA developed is key to facilitating this transition). Table 2
highlights the areas that “C” CAPS struggled with.

14 The CAPS’ sustainability assessment scorecard was first introduced i n the PRASNICA parent project results

system uses a relatively similar score.

 functions of each of its members; (iii) monthly
 meetings / annual assembly; and (iv) financial records.

50.     The above achievements in extending sustainable RWSS access were reached through: (i)
the development of an effective structural framework for RWSS management based on the
streamlined project-cycle established in the MEPAS and the sustainability chain; (ii) institutional
strengthening activities at the central, municipal and local levels to enable all sector actors to fulfill
the roles and responsibilities established in the frame; and (iii) quality infrastructure investments
that were appropriate for Nicaragua’s rural environment.

51.     Central Level. PRASNICA helped transform FISE from a donor-responsive works
implementation agency to a pro-active RWSS sector leader with an established strategic approach.
PRASNICA inspired this change through the development of a structural framework for the RWSS
sector and a series of tools and best practices that enabled FISE to assume a leadership role. For
example, the MEPAS provided FISE a means to unify donors’ approaches to the sector and ensure
that best practices and sustainability measures, such as the inclusion of social accompaniment
throughout the project cycle, were mainstreamed in FISE’s approach. The establishment of the
sustainability chain, and the capacity building at all levels of the chain, positioned FISE as the lead
organization and provided a structure by which FISE could efficiently implement and supervise
RWSS systems. SIASAR enabled FISE to systematically monitor RWSS quality and pinpoint
communities in need of investment or support.

52.       In addition to these three tools that transformed the sector and enabled FISE to play a
leadership role, FISE also increased the selection of basic sanitation options to offer communities
as part of the Project.16 For example, the Corn Island and Sanitation Market pilots that PRASNICA
supported led to the incorporation of a wider variety of latrines including special biodigestor toilets
for environmental sensitive areas, such as Corn Island. In addition to inspiring a wider array of
sanitation options, the pilots helped FISE explore market niches and test approaches where it had
little or no experience. The Corn Island pilot was FISE’s first experience overseeing works on an
island in the ocean and working in an integrated manner with a small-scale utility. The pilot resulted
in the construction of 112 latrines, 6 wells and a diagnostic of the local utility. The Sanitation
Market pilot connected 139 families to micro-credit to purchase and install their household
sanitation solution, an alternative method to inspire household connections to the sewerage systems
that FISE had previously not tested. Although FISE did not incorporate all aspects of these pilots
in its growth plans, the pilots helped FISE develop a willingness to explore new approaches to
improve performance and build its research and development capacity.




16 FISE initially promoted a Nicaraguan sanitation solution, ecological latrines (inodoros-ecologicos), which
beneficiaries responded positively to given that the latrines could be placed closer to the households than the traditional
latrines. A WSP-led study, however, found that this type of sanitation solution did not have a long useful life. As a
result, FISE added traditional and improved sanitation solutions to its menu.

                                                                                                                        15
53.       Municipal Level. In addition to promoting FISE’s accompaniment of the UMAS, one of
the key methods PRASNICA employed to build the capacity of the municipalities to support the
CAPS was through a results-based learning methodology (AVAR) that FISE had employed
successfully with other donors. The first training, AVAR I, focused on strengthening the
municipalities’ basic understanding of the sector and included material on the legal framework for
RWSS, the MEPAS, the creation, organization and function of the UMAS, water quality, hygiene,
and environmental issues among other issues. One hundred and thirty six municipalities
successfully completed the training and 51 UMAS were constituted as a result of the training. The
second AVAR focused on strengthening the sustainability chain and resulted in an increase in the
sustainability ratings of 70 percent of the municipalities’ CAPS. The strategic role the UMAS play
in promoting CAPS’ sustainability is evident from these results, yet there is still significant work
left to fully institutionalize the UMAS, which oftentimes do not operate their own budgets and have
tasks apart from RWSS management. The PROSASR Project will continue to build the capacity of
the UMAS through hosting additional AVARs. Also, FISE’s strengthened role will enable it to
provide assistance to the UMAS outside the scope of the Project.

54.     Local Level. The strengthened capacity of FISE and the UMAS to provide support to the
communities resulted in strong capacity building and support at the local level throughout the
project cycle. UMAS, FISE and social consultants provided communities with capacity building
on the organization and function of the CAPS, how to calculate tariffs, water use, hygiene and basic
accounting among other themes. The installation of meters in all of the communities alongside the
capacity building sessions on how to charge volume-based tariffs was key to the overall
sustainability of the systems. Rather than having a one-shot training session, UMAS, FISE and
social consultants provided consistent support throughout the Project. The impact of this support
improved the sustainability of the RWSS systems. At the beginning of the Project, only 25 of the
communities reported having CAPS – by the end of the Project 165 communities had established
CAPS.17 Of the 25 initial CAPS, only eight were ranked as A or B; by the end of the Project 109
of the beneficiary CAPS had reached A or B ratings. Table 3 captures the transformation of the
RWSS sector over the course of implementation.

55.      Infrastructure Level. The development of the sustainability chain enabled the efficient and
effective implementation of the RWSS works. As a result of PRASNICA, 79,988 Nicaraguans in
rural communities have access to water (new or rehabilitated) and 47,739 to improved sanitation
solutions. To evaluate the quality of the works, the Bank hired a RWSS specialist to survey the
systems in 17 communities. The specialist found the works to be of high quality – 16 of the 17
systems were providing communities with daily access to water and all of the systems’ physical
components were in acceptable or good condition. A shortcoming was that designs did not
systematically analyze the water sources during the dry and rainy seasons and also assumed low
water consumption per capita. As a result, some communities did not have access to water 24 hours
a day. Nevertheless, community members on the whole expressed a high level of satisfaction with
the systems and the transformational effect household connection to water had on their day-to-day
lives (See Annex 2, Sub-Annex 2). Prior to the Project, many beneficiaries had to fetch water from
nearby rivers or wells. The specialist also reported that the sanitation solutions financed by
PRASNICA were all in good physical condition and that the beneficiaries were using the solutions
regularly, practicing improved hygiene and keeping their latrines clean. The specialist’s survey
results can be found in Annex 2, Sub-Annex 1.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: High

56.      As at Appraisal, the economic and financial evaluation was conducted using a cost benefit
analysis. At Appraisal and during preparation of the AF, only the water interventions were assessed.
Three water interventions systems were evaluated at Appraisal: (a) small piped systems with
electric pumps (MABE); (b) small gravity fed piped systems (MAG); and (c) boreholes and wells.
These interventions were also evaluated for the ICR. Benefits were measured through the avoided
costs approach. The beneficiaries’ savings from the new water systems included saved time,
reduced costs for alternative purification methods, and the avoidance of more costly water sources
such as bottled water and water distributed by tankers. The cash flows were discounted using a 12
percent discount rate, which was estimated to be a proxy of Nicaragua’s opportunity cost of capital.


                                                                                                       17
The costs and benefits were projected for 15 years. The same approach was used for this evaluation,
but water and sanitation works were evaluated.

57.      Project’s impact on socioeconomic development. The Project positively impacted the
socio-economic conditions of beneficiaries’ households. Actual benefits of WSS works were
approximately twice as much as their costs. The distributive analysis shows that after discounting
the bills from services, beneficiaries will receive a net benefit of US$20M from water interventions
and US$13M from sanitation interventions over the lifetime of the works. Other winners are
suppliers and labor who will receive returns of US$2M.The fiscal impact for the GoN shows
benefits from the taxes paid from the Project, yet the full subsidy given by the GoN to finance the
investment made the net result negative and equal to US$19M.

58.     The economic evaluation of the water component show similar results to those foreseen
both at Appraisal and when preparing the AF. The results show a 35 percent return and a net benefit
of US$10M. At Appraisal, 39 percent returns were expected, and during the AF 30 percent returns
were expected. The MABE scheme show higher returns (32 percent) than expected (15 percent
(Appraisal) and 7 percent (AF)) as the cost per household was lower than expected. Net benefits
cannot be compared given that at Appraisal and the AF the evaluation was conducted on a sample
of projects, while at the ICR the evaluation was carried out for all the actual works implemented.

59.     The sanitation interventions show 35 percent returns and net benefits of US$5M. The
Project as a whole generated 35 percent returns and net benefits of US$16M. Some of the
communities benefited from either water or sanitation interventions while other communities
benefited from both interventions. Results show similar returns when interventions were
implemented separately and when interventions were done together.

60.     A financial evaluation that included costs and benefits as they were paid and received by
the communities was included as well. Results show that communities were able to cover operation
and maintenance costs from the tariffs collected. This evaluation was complemented with a cost
comparison of similar projects in the region. Results show that actual costs per household were half
the average cost of the region for both water and sanitation investments. The lower cost per
connection helps explain the high returns obtained. More information on the economic analysis can
be found in Annex 3.

                                                                                                 18
61.      With regard to administrative efficiency, the main challenges were generated in the
Caribbean Coast where, as discussed earlier, there was little experience implementing large-scale
RWSS projects. The unit costs and implementation timeline on the Caribbean Coast exceeded the
original estimates by over 100%, but more favorable implementation conditions along the Pacific
Coast permitted the Project to achieve its PDO and reach the expected number of beneficiaries.
However, the intervention in the Caribbean Coast was important from a development (and poverty
alleviation) standpoint. The Annex 3 presents the economic assessment separated by Region.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

62.      Given that the Project’s December 11, 2012 AF and May 8, 2014 Restructuring involved
changes in the PDO-level indicator targets, the ICR team conducted a split-level evaluation (See
Table 6). During the restructurings, the PDO-level indicator targets for both water and sanitation
were increased (made more challenging); when the outcomes are compared against the original
targets, the achievement of the PDO is still fully met. The split evaluation’s Satisfactory rating is
in line with PRASNICA’s High rating for relevance of objectives, Substantial rating for relevance
of design, Substantial efficacy and High efficiency ratings.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63.       In addition to extending access to WSS services to poor, rural communities and directly
increasing their standard of living, PRASNICA laid the groundwork for an effective method for
FISE to monitor the coverage and quality of services throughout rural Nicaragua and efficiently
carry out future investments. From a poverty-impact perspective, this is especially important given
that the highest concentrations of poverty in Nicaragua are in rural areas. The Project also realized
important and pioneering achievements in the Caribbean Coast and paved the way for increased
involvement in that Region, the area with the highest concentrations of rural poverty. Prior to
PRASNICA, donors were hesitant to invest in the region given the unknown level of difficulty it
would entail. Post-project, RWSS investments in the Caribbean Coast are being continued given
FISE’s improved capacity to effectively coordinate implementation of the works. The Project also
had a significant impact on social development through the capacity building activities and social
accompaniment supported by PRASNICA (See the Efficacy Section for more detail).

64.     With regard to gender aspects, PRASNICA promoted the participation of women in the
CAPS. The Project included two indicators on women’s participation in the CAPS, the percentage
of CAPS in which women represented at least 30 percent of the board and the percentage of CAPS
with women acting as either president or treasurer. Although both these indicators were narrowly
missed, the outcomes were significant. In 76 percent of the CAPS, women represented at least 30
percent of the board, and in 70 percent of the CAPS women either acted as presidents or treasurers.


                                                                                                  19
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

65.     PRASNICA had a transformative effect on the structure of the RWSS sector through its
development of the sustainability chain as well as the MEPAS among other activities (See Efficacy
Section for more detail).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

66.     The original Project design foresaw supporting a nation-wide information system focused
on collecting basic information on RWSS. SIASAR’s focus on not only coverage but also
sustainability and quality of service exceeded the expected reach of the system. Moreover the multi-
country scope of SIASAR, which will help support the long-term sustainability of the information
system, was a positive and unintended outcome.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

67.      Although no formal beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop was carried out to evaluate
PRASNICA’s achievement of its indicators, FISE conducted an ex-post survey in 105 communities
that received infrastructure investments. The results of the ex-post survey are reflected in the
indicators that are based on the CAPS scorecard. In addition to this survey, a World Bank
Consultant assessed the quality of service and the sustainability of the WSS systems in 17
communities (See Annex 2, Sub-Annex 1 for the results) and the ICR team visited ten communities
to evaluate beneficiary satisfaction with the works. During the ICR preparation process, the Bank
team also held a workshop with FISE’s staff and municipal staff to evaluate the impact of the
Project. The results of these qualitative assessments are reflected in the Efficacy section of this
ICR.

Section 4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome.
Rating: Moderate

68.     The Risk to the Development Outcome is Moderate. PRASNICA’s achievements in
strengthening the sustainability chain and PROSASR’s continuation of the strengthening activities
will greatly mitigate the risk of CAPS being left unattended. This is especially important for the
sustainability of RWSS works in communities where the CAPS are operating at a C or D level.
Another risk to the sustainability of the RWSS systems is the low capacity of the CAPS to pay for
major repairs. In the majority of CAPS, tariff collection is only enough to cover operation and
maintenance costs. Building CAPS’ entrepreneurial skills and business sense will be key to
overcoming this risk and building their long-term sustainability.

69.      Another risk to the sustainability of PRASNICA’s achievements is that the role of FISE in
the RWSS sector remains unstable. Although FISE has been established as the lead RWSS
organization through several executive decrees, the legal framework still does not recognize FISE
as having this role. During the ICR preparation, the Bank team held meetings with the Minister of
Finance who confirmed the GoN’s intentions to revise the legal framework in the near future in
order to legally confirm FISE as the lead RWSS agency. In the unlikely event that the GoN shifts
RWSS responsibility to another institution, key sector tools developed by the Project could be
transferred. In addition, FISE largely depends on funding from international donors for its
operations. In the last five years, donors have financed more than 50 percent of FISE’s budget. In




                                                                                                 20
2014, donors financed 76 percent of FISE’s budget.18 It is also relevant to note that PRASNICA’s
sustainability-focused activities strengthened an institutional “chain” essential for the sustainable
provision of RWSS, which goes beyond FISE by including the municipalities and the CAPS in the
RWSS sector composition.

Section 5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

    (a) Bank Performance in ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.      The Bank added significant value to the design given the preparation team’s extensive
experience in the RWSS sector and work on similar projects in the region. In addition to
incorporating lessons learned into the design, the team proposed innovative solutions, such as
MEPAS and the sustainability chain, which inspired transformative change in Nicaragua’s RWSS
sector. These innovative institutional strengthening activities were accompanied by infrastructure
works, which allowed for real time application of the tools and newly developed capacities. The
design’s implementation arrangements also permitted direct strengthening of key RWSS sector
actors. In addition, through supporting engagement on the Caribbean Coast, an area that many
donors hesitated to invest in given its remoteness and the lack of available information, the Bank
targeted Nicaragua’s poorest population. The design highlighted social development through
capacity building activities at all stages of the sustainability chain as well as gender inclusion in all
of PRASNICA’s RWSS interventions. At design, the Project had a high level of strategic relevance
for Nicaragua given the lack of a systematic RWSS intervention method and significant coverage
gaps. At the Project’s close, the Project’s approach was still highly relevant for Nicaragua given
FISE’s adoption of PRASNICA’s intervention method for all of its RWSS works and continued
need to close coverage gaps. The Project’s objectives were also fully aligned with GoN priorities.
Shortcomings included an underestimation of the difficulty of working on the Caribbean Coast,
nevertheless, adjustments and mitigation measures applied during implementation enabled the
Project to have an unique impact in that Region.

    (b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

71.      The Bank provided active supervision support, closely monitoring progress and adjusting
the Project as necessary to facilitate effective implementation. The Bank team wrote detailed Aide
Memoires and ISRs, which provided a candid report of the Project’s progress. During
implementation, the Bank team incorporated activities that FISE had been implementing
successfully with other partners and proposed innovative activities, such as SIASAR, to respond to
needs that became apparent for sector strengthening as the Project evolved. FISE highlighted the
value add of the Bank in developing a tool kit for RWSS investments, especially for projects on the
Caribbean Coast. The restructurings the Bank carried out demonstrated a high level of agility, a
focus on maximizing the development impact, and attentiveness to the needs of the Project, which
evolved throughout implementation. The restructurings were critical to maintaining the Project on
track to meet its PDO and optimize its results especially in light of the difficulties encountered in
implementing works along the Caribbean Coast. The Bank also successfully helped unify donors’


18   FISE’s ICR

                                                                                                      21
approaches in the sector through assisting FISE in the development of the MEPAS and holding
regular meetings with donors throughout implementation. The Bank team’s work on the
development of the PROSASR Project, which uses the same implementation arrangements as
PRASNICA, ensures a smooth transition between the Projects. FISE’s main criticism of Bank
supervision was the length of time it took to receive No Objections for procurement processes. The
Project would have benefited from closer work between Bank procurement specialists and FISE.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

72.     Based on the Moderately Satisfactory Quality at Entry and the Satisfactory Quality of
Supervision, as per ICR’s methodology, the overall Bank Performance rating is Moderately
Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

    (a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

73.      During preparation and implementation, the GoN demonstrated an active interest in the
success of PRASNICA and fully achieving PRASNICA’s development goals. The Bank team
consistently met with MHCP staff and the Minister himself to discuss implementation as well as
larger, sector policy issues. When Project implementation began to stall towards the end of
implementation because of leadership issues, the GoN made an executive decision to incorporate
new leaders at FISE, demonstrating awareness and active interest in the Project’s successful
implementation. The GoN’s policy agenda highlighted the importance of improving RWSS
coverage and service throughout implementation, and the decision to move forward with the AF,
the PROSASR Project, financing from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration as
well as the Rural Section of the PISASH to build upon the sustainability model developed in
PRASNICA illustrated the GoN’s commitment. The GoN’s utilization of information generated
from SIASAR to assess the RWSS sector also demonstrates commitment to PRASNICA and
directly promotes the long-term survival of the system. Although the GoN declared FISE the lead
RWSS agency in an executive decree, one pending action key for the overall sustainability of the
Project and the RWSS sector is the adjustment of the Water Law to reflect FISE’s leadership role.

    (b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

74.       FISE’s hands-on supervision of the implementation of RWSS works in 212 geographically
dispersed communities as well as FISE’s institutionalization of the sustainability chain was key to
the Project’s satisfactory outcome. FISE’s roll out of SIASAR was also impressive; Nicaragua was
the first country to extend SIASAR to all of its communities. FISE provided consistent feedback to
SIASAR’s programmers and actively pushed for updates and improvements to the system. Overall,
FISE displayed a high level of commitment to achieving PRASNICA’s development objectives.
Beyond successful implementation, FISE’s institutionalization of PRASNICA’s best practice
inspired transformational change in the sector. Prior to PRASNICA, FISE was a multi-sector
agency without a cohesive approach to RWSS investments; post-PRASNICA, FISE had an
established system to organize, guide and supervise RWSS throughout the country. By
PRASNICA’s close, FISE was actively ensuring that all donors in the sector followed the MEPAS.
During implementation, FISE faced minor shortcomings related to procurement, financial
management and monitoring and evaluation processes as well as general administrative

                                                                                                22
coordination. Although these shortcomings did not hinder the Project from fully achieving its PDO,
they slowed implementation and played a role in the late start to the final sub-projects, 12 of which
had to be canceled given the upcoming closing date.

    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

75.     Based on the Satisfactory Government and Implementing Agency Performance, the ICR
rates Overall Borrower Performance as Satisfactory.

Section 6. Lessons Learned

76.      Sustainable access depends on infrastructure and institutions. WSS service sustainability
depends on the quality of infrastructure as well as institutional capacity to operate and maintain the
infrastructure. In the rural context, a tiered sustainability chain that connects small communities
with TA is key to the sustainability of local water committees during their transformation from
dependent organizations to fully operative, self-sustaining micro-enterprises. Given that achieving
sustainability is a process that often requires more time than the lifespan of a project, strengthening
the institutional support structure to provide assistance during this transformational period should
be a priority in RWSS projects. The PROSASR Project, highlighting this lesson, prioritizes the
strengthening of Nicaragua’s sustainability chain while extending access to quality infrastructure.

77.     Harmonized approach to donor investments. When a sector relies disproportionately on
donor financing, it is critical that sector agencies have tools to align and guide investments to ensure
the investments support the agencies’ vision for the sector. At the same time, it is also important
that donors regularly dialogue and coordinate to ensure investments are complementary and
synergies are explored. For FISE, the MEPAS has been key to streamlining donor investments and
ensuring a certain degree of quality for all RWSS works. Regular donor meetings during
PRASNICA also helped synchronize investments, facilitating implementation for FISE and
maximizing overall results.

78.      Engage communities from the outset to promote sustainability. Sufficient time should be
allocated to the phase prior to design to ensure that users understand the pros, cons and maintenance
requirements of each system. Building communities’ capacity to select systems that are adequate
for their needs and reflect their capacity to operate and maintain the systems increases the likelihood
of sustainability. In addition, including a social commitment fee prior to implementation ensures
communities have the capacity to pay for the systems and builds their commitment to the successful
implementation of the works. PROSASR’s RWSS works incorporated this lesson and include early
engagement as well as social commitment fees.

79.      Long-term engagement to achieve change. Bank projects, especially in the case of
countries where the sector relies on donor financing, can inspire transformational change when they
maintain sector best practices as top priorities over a longer period of time. A successful five or six
year project can lay the groundwork for positive institutional change but additional support is
usually required to ensure that the Client fully institutionalizes the good practices. In the case of
PRASNICA, several of the many transformational sector changes were still being integrated at the
time of closure. The PROSASR Project, however, will support their further development and
integration in the operating structure of the RWSS sector.

80.     RWSS projects require flexibility in the application of Bank procedures. RWSS projects
involved small-scale and decentralized interventions, often implemented in low-developed areas

                                                                                                     23
where access to markets are limited. During the implementation of PRASNICA, the local
consulting firms contracted for the preparation of designs and social assistance did not have the
qualifications to apply and carry out for these type of activity in such remote areas, and international
firms did not express the level of interest expected at design. A similar problem was found in the
contracting of works. Evolving approaches (such as the use of social facilitators hired as individual
consultants and increased CDD ceiling for works) and flexibility from the Bank side were key to
adapt traditional Bank procedures to the rural Nicaraguan context.

Section 7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

81.      Comments from the Implementing Agency and Borrower. The Government of Nicaragua
(GoN), through FISE, has been taking decisive actions to restore the right of the Nicaraguan people
to safe water and decent sanitation. International organizations, particularly the World Bank, played
a key role in this process. The report generally reflects the information submitted by FISE. The
GoN wishes, however, to make the following comments:
x     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry. The GoN proposes that the following be
      added at the end of the paragraph: “that the success of the project was its inclusion of Caribbean
      coast communities that had no access to quality water or decent sanitation.”
x     Risk to Development Outcome. With regard to the point raised in the report that “FISE’s role
      in the water and sanitation sector is unclear,” The GoN is of the view that the term “unclear”
      is not appropriate, as actions have been taken to enable FISE to spearhead the WSS program
      in the country. To this end, a draft law has been prepared and will be submitted to the national

x     Achievement of Project Development Objectives. Flow measurements were taken for all water
      supply investments. However, as the report accurately states, some of these measurements were
      taken during the rainy season and others during the dry season. For future investments, a
      systematic process to measure water sources patterns in each municipality must be put in place
      to improve analysis. Despite the statement that “the assumed criterion was per capita water
      consumption,” when communities had no records or information on water consumption,
      INAA’s technical standard for the design of drinking water supply systems in rural
      communities was used for calculations.
x     Under PRASNICA, innovative elements were incorporated in the implementation processes of
      WSS projects, such as social support during the entire project cycle, previously provided
      through the CDD approach for the multi-sectorial works FISE executed. PRASNICA also
      helped reestablish the importance of improving subproject environmental assessment, and
      water sources management and protection.

Box 1. SIASAR

SIASAR began in 2011 in response to demand from Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama for up-to-date and
reliable information on the state of RWSS service. Since then, a World Bank team has worked in close
collaboration with the governments of these countries to develop SIASAR. SIASAR’s conceptual model
goes beyond water points mapping and covers a broader range of information to serve as a guide for
intervention planning, both in terms of investments and local institutional strengthening measures. It not only
tracks the physical condition of water systems, but also monitors coverage in rural communities and
measures the quality of the RWSS services and the effectiveness of available TA. The data collection system
is adapted for Android cell phones and tablets, which facilitate data capture and storage. SIASAR displays
the collected data on a public, web-based platform. Nicaragua, with the support of the PRASNICA Project,
played a key role in developing the tool, was the first country to include information on the majority of its
rural communities in the system and has served as an example for other countries interested in utilizing the
tool. Nicaragua currently has 6,710 rural communities registered in SIASAR. SIASAR is currently being
rolled out in the Dominican Republic and Oaxaca, Mexico.

                        Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      This Annex presents an evaluation of the Project from both an economic and financial
perspective. The economic evaluation included the costs expressed in economic terms, eliminating
market distortions caused by subsidies and taxes. The benefits were expressed as the actual savings
the population received as a result of the service improvements. The financial evaluation included
the costs and benefits as they were actually paid and received by the communities in charge of
operating the service. This evaluation was complemented with a distributive analysis to show the
winners and losers

Economic Evaluation

2.       At Appraisal benefits were measured through the avoided costs approach. The
beneficiaries’ savings from the new water systems included saved time, reduced costs for
alternative purification methods, and the avoidance of more costly water sources such as bottled
water and water distributed by tankers. The cash flows were discounted using a 12 percent discount
rate, which was estimated to be a proxy of Nicaragua’s opportunity cost of capital. The costs and
benefits were projected for 15 years. The same approach was used for this evaluation.

3.       At Appraisal, the evaluation was conducted using a sample of sub-projects that had already
been implemented by FISE and that were identified as feasible in the Project areas. The water
supply interventions analyzed were: (a) small piped systems using electric pumps (Miniacueducto
por Bombeo Eléctrico, MABE); (b) small gravity fed piped systems (Miniacueducto por Gravedad,
MAG); (c) boreholes with hand pumps, (Pozo Perforado con Bomba de Mano, PPBM); (d)
excavated wells with hand pumps (Pozo Excavado con Bomba de Mano, PEBM); and (e)
rehabilitation and extension of existing systems (Sistema de Mejoramiento y Ampliación de
Acueducto, SIMA).

4.      For the AF, an ex-post economic cost-benefit analysis was conducted using a sample of 20
sub-projects that had already been implemented in the Pacific region by FISE. Three types of water
supply schemes were analyzed in the sample: (a) MABE; (b) MAG; and (c) PPBM or PEBM. The
shadow price ratio used was 0.75.

5.    The evaluation for this ICR used a cost benefit analysis as well as an avoided cost approach
to measure benefits. As in the previous evaluations, the ICR analysis utilized a discount rate of 12
percent, a lifetime of 15 years, and a shadow price rate of 0.75.

6.    This evaluation included a cost benefit analysis for the works implemented in the 212
communities. Of the 212 communities, 33% had only water interventions; 22% had only sanitation
interventions, and the 45% had both water and sanitation interventions. The evaluation was
conducted for each type of intervention and compared the results when works were done separately
and were done together. For water interventions, the analysis was carried out for the same type of
water schemes evaluated during the preparation of the AF.

7.      The cost benefit analysis shows the net benefits generated by each component on an
incremental basis. The benefits of the Project were equal to the difference between the incremental
benefits and the incremental costs of two scenarios: “with project” and “without project.” The
“with” project scenario considers actual achievements obtained with the interventions. The
“without” project scenario considers that service would have continued unchanged, i.e. coverage,



                                                                                                 36
hours of service, unaccounted for water, and commercial performance would have remained the
same during the Project’s lifetime.
8.       Actual benefits and actual costs were included in this evaluation and transformed to 2008
prices in order to compare them against the ones projected at Appraisal.

Costs

9.       Costs consisted of investment and operating costs. Investment costs corresponded to actual
costs of implemented works, and operating costs were based on actual costs incurred by
communities that are already operating the facilities. Costs were transformed to 2008 prices to
compare them with the ones expected at Appraisal. To do so, costs were adjusted annually by
inflation or exchange rate according to currency and time of implementation. During
implementation, local currency depreciated against the USD by about 29%, going from C$20 per
USD at the end of 2008 to C$26 per USD at the beginning of 2015. Inflation on the other hand
showed a 45% price increase from 2008 to 2015. The depreciation of the local currency helped the
Project as IDA funds were converted to higher amounts of local currency. Inflation, however, hurt
the Project as fewer goods could be bought with the same amount of money. Results show that total
cost at 2008 prices was 17% lower than expected. Component 1 and 4 presented similar costs as
expected at appraisal and AF with just 2% and 4% difference respectively. Component 2 had costs
28% lower.

Benefits

10.     Water provision in rural communities. In rural areas, consumers use water for drinking,
cooking, bathing, washing and productive uses, such as cooking for sales and construction. Before
the intervention, beneficiaries relied on a variety of traditional sources, such as rivers, ponds,
springs and rainwater. Both the quality and cost (time) of water from these sources were different,
and each water source served different needs. When alternative sources, such as wells, boreholes,
and piped water systems became available, they became potential substitutes for water from other
sources. The benefits of the intervention were estimated as the savings of economic costs for
consumers who no longer needed to use the former water sources. The benefits included: time
savings, reduced costs for alternative purification methods such as boiling the water, and avoided
costs from substitution of more costly sources such as bottled water and water distributed by
tankers. At appraisal, no health benefit was included in the evaluation of water projects. The ICR
followed the same methodology.

11.     Surveys were conducted in beneficiary communities to understand how the population
dealt with poor water service received before the Project. The situation varied widely across
communities. Some families bought water every day from private vendors at a price as high as


                                                                                                  37
C$55 (US$2) to fill a 20-liter container; others bought raw water at C$30 (US$1.2). Other families
fetched water from sources nearby such as rivers, ponds, and springs, and the time needed per trip
ranged from 30 minutes to four hours per day. The results of the surveys were used to estimate the
economic cost before the intervention. On average, 20% of population bought water from private
vendors, and 80 percent had to fetch water from a source nearby and spent about one hour per day.
Resulting cost per household was US$14 per month at 2008 prices.22

12.      Sanitation coverage in rural communities. At Appraisal, no evaluation was conducted for
the sanitation component. In this evaluation, sanitation benefits were estimated as the avoided cost
of health related diseases once sanitation services were in place. Health benefits associated with
sanitation were measured only for communities that had water service in good condition. The
project prioritized sanitation interventions in communities that also had water improvement
interventions or in communities where water service was already in place and working well.

13.       The benefits were based on the results of a study carried out in 2012 by WSP23 in Nicaragua
under the Economics of Sanitation Initiative (ESI). The study estimated benefits on health, water
resources, welfare, and tourism. For this evaluation, only health and welfare related benefits were
used. These benefits were quantified as the averted costs when sanitation improves. Health costs
consisted of: (a) healthcare costs from formal health care services and traditional healers; (b)
productivity costs equivalent to welfare or income lost due to sickness time; and (c) costs of
premature death, which correspond to discounted lifetime income losses. Welfare benefits
consisted of reduction or elimination of time spent going to the latrines instead of having sanitary
facilities inside the houses.

14.     Health. The incidence of diseases attributable to poor sanitation presented in the ESI study
in Nicaragua is as follows:

                                             Children <5      Children 5-4     Population 15+                  Total

     Source: WSP-ESI (2012)

15.     The WSP study found that on average, the estimated annual diarrheal incidence rate is 0.9
cases per person. The total number of deaths attributed to poor sanitation is nearly 500, of which
308 are accounted by diarrhea and 180 by diseases related to malnutrition caused by diarrhea
infections in early childhood. Ninety five percent of these deaths correspond to children under five.

16.      Health Care Costs. The ESI study estimated the health care cost based on disease incidence
rates, treatment-seeking rates, treatment practices, and unit costs. Forty three percent of children
under five receive treatment at a medical facility. Twenty percent of older children and 15% of



22
   The calculation was based on the following assumptions: a) cost of time based on minimum hourly wage of US$
0.42/hour (about C$ 8.5) corresponding to minimum wage applied to manufacture industry. Given that kids and
women are the ones who collected the water on normal basis, a 50% factor was applied. The resulting cost of time was
US$ 7 per household per month; b) storage cost was estimated as US$ 3/month per household based on cost of barrel
and other containers and their lifetime; and c) boiled or bottled water was estimated as US$ 3 per household per month.

adults also receive treatment at a medical facility. Ninety percent of children under five with
diarrhea receive one or more forms of the following treatments: (i) treatment at medical facilities;
(ii) the purchase of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and medicines at pharmacies; and (iii) home
remedies. Treatment cost varies from about US$2 per pill and ORS to US$15 at a medical facility.

17.       Health Related Productivity Cost. Disease takes people away from daily activities and
results in a loss of time for children and adults. Economic cost of time was valued for adults as the
minimum hourly rate of about C$8.5 (US$0.4). For children, time was valued at half of adult time.
Time lost for daily activities varies by disease: one day for diarrhea and fifteen days for hepatitis.

18.      Cost of premature death. Premature death has an economic impact due to the loss of wages
and economic outputs generated in the future. The WSP study used the “human capital approach”
for children under five years of age, and the value of a statistical life (VSL) for the population over
five years of age. The human capital approach approximates the value of human life using the
estimated future discounted income stream from a productive person, based on a working life of
17 to 65 years, a 2% annual growth in real income, and a 3% discount rate. The result was
US$71,200 per premature death. The VSL approach used the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) average of US$2M adjusted by the difference in GDP
per capita between OECD member countries and Nicaragua and an income elasticity of 1.0. The
resulting value was US$71,400 per premature death.

19.      The Wealth Impact was measured as a reduction of time spent using a sanitary solution
when a sanitary facility is available in the house. Without the project, most of the communities had
latrines that were shared among households. Time lost was estimated by the WSP study at about
10 minutes per member of the household per day. To value this time, the same assumptions for the
water component were applied.

Impact of appropriate sanitation on health

20.      The effect of improved sanitation on health was assumed to be 45% when accompanied by
hygiene practices such as hand washing. When hygiene practices were not utilized the impact was
reduced to 37.5%. Benefits were applied according to whether there was a hand washing facility
on site.

21.      The assumptions on the impact of sanitation were taken from studies carried out by Pruss
at al. (2002) 24 and Esrey’s 25 . The studies derived the relative risks of diarrhea illness from
international literature and quantified the shift of risk when transitioning between different water
and sanitation scenarios (Table 3 presents the selected scenarios and their corresponding relative
risks). Scenario I is considered the ideal scenario in which there is no transmission of diseases
through water, sanitation, or hygiene. In Scenario I, disease is transmitted through other
mechanisms, mostly food or air (aerosols, or person to person).26

Based on Prüss et al. 2002

22.     The scenario attained with the intervention evaluated in this ICR corresponded to a shift
from scenario Vb in which water is available but no sanitation, to IV in which both services are in
place. In both cases the impact is 37.5%. When the services are accompanied with improved
personal hygiene the impact increases to 45%.

23.      Results show that the savings in health costs with the sanitation intervention was US$113
per household if no hand washing was available, and US$136 if there were hand washing facilities
on site. The convenience cost of having the sanitary facility was US$4 per month.

Cost Difference between Caribbean and Pacific/Central Regions

24.     Information from interventions implemented in 212 communities under PRASNICA
shows that in average works implemented in the Atlantic region were 95% higher, or in other works,
the were almost twice as much in the Caribbean ($272 per beneficiary) than in the Pacific and
Central regions ($ 140 per beneficiary).

25.      Costs difference varies by type of technology. The highest difference was seen on water
interventions using MABE, for which costs in the Atlantic were four times than the ones in the
Pacific and Central. In average water interventions had costs 77% higher in the Caribbean; while
in sanitation costs were 129% higher in the Caribbean.

Results of the Economic Evaluation

26.      Water Component. Results of the economic evaluation show similar results to those
foreseen at Appraisal and at the preparation of the AF. The whole water component shows 35%
returns, which is a similar to the 39% expected at Appraisal and 30% foreseen during the AF. Net
benefits obtained through the water component are US$10.7 million, which cannot be compared
with those expected at Appraisal or at the preparation of the AF, as at that time the evaluation was
conducted on sample of projects, while for this evaluation the whole intervention was analyzed.

expected both during Appraisal and the AF given lower than expected costs per beneficiary. The
other schemes show results similar to Appraisal.

28.     Sanitation. The economic evaluation of the sanitation intervention shows 35% returns and
net benefits of US$5M. The whole Project presents 35% returns and economic benefits of US$16M.

29.      The high internal rate of return is explained in reasons such as: a) in general rural water
projects generate higher returns than urban ones given difficulties for accessing water sources
suitable for consumption and hygienic uses. Main benefits from water interventions come from
time-savings obtained when population does not have to fetch water from long distances, which in
some cases was significant. Returns obtained in other rural projects financed by the World Bank
show similar results; b) unit cost per connection was lower than in similar projects in other countries
in the region. Cost per water connection was half as much as the average of other countries in
Central America (table 9).

region with similar benefits than in the Pacific and Central regions, results of the evaluation show
higher returns in interventions implemented in the Pacific and Central region.

31.      In the Caribbean region water intervention with technology MAG and wells show
satisfactory results with returns of 17% and 45% respectively. However MAGE technology did
not show positive results, as its costs were significantly higher. In sanitation results show that
interventions were close to breakeven point with net benefits close to zero and return a little bit
lower than the discount rate.

32.     Even though results in the Caribbean region were lower, the results of the economic
evaluation of the integrated intervention show satisfactory results. The Caribbean region is the
poorest are of the Country, thus the intervention is justifiable.


Financial Evaluation

33.     The communities were responsible for the administration, operation and management
costs. As explained in the ICR, residents had to pay counterpart funds to support the works (mostly
in-kind), purchase micrometers (for piped systems) and anticipate the payment of at least six
months of fees before implementation could begin (the money went to the CAPS’ savings accounts)
to ensure they had the capacity to sustain the WSS services. The majority (78 percent) of the
communities was also responsible for contracting and overseeing the execution of the works
through a Community Driven Development (CDD) approach. Most of the investment cost,
however, was given as a subsidy from the GoN.

34.      The financial evaluation was conducted with costs and benefits expressed in market prices.
Costs and revenues were included as they actually occurred; actual tariffs, consumption rates, and
collection rates were applied. Subsidies for the investment were also included.

                                                                                                    43
35.     Results show that communities generated enough revenue from tariffs to maintain and
operate the service, a requirement for the sustainability of the works.

Distributive Analysis

36.     A distributive analysis was carried out to identify winners and losers. The difference
between economic and financial prices and economic and financial flows represent rents or
monetary flows that accrue to someone other than the residents of the communities. The results of
the analysis show how the GoN, the customers, and suppliers were affected by the implementation
of the Project. The total net benefit for all society was US$16M.

37.     The fiscal impact of the Project, which corresponds to the net benefit of the GoN, was
negative as the investment was fully subsidized by the GoN. The taxes of US$4M received from
the works did not compensate the GoN’s subsidy, generating a net loss of US$19M.

38.     Households that benefited from the Project had positive return of US$32M after
discounting the tariffs they pay for the services.

39.     Suppliers and labor received positive returns of US$2 million.

Comparison of unit costs across the Central America region

40.      Unit Costs. The evaluation was complemented with a cost comparison of similar projects
in the region. The average water costs of the projects in Central America presented in Table 9 is
US$1,200 per water connection. Actual water costs of the implemented works in PRASNICA were
half as much as this average. The sanitation costs could not be compared since the level of service
and type of sanitation varies substantially from one country to the other. Just as an example, the
sanitation cost per unit in PRASNICA was US$ 594; while in Panama (PASAP project) was US$
1,375; however, in PRASNICA the sanitation solution was mostly latrine, while in Panama they
had more sophisticated toilets.

Introduction

1.     The Emergency Social Investment Fund (FISE), together with the World Bank, executed
the Nicaraguan Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (PRASNICA), which commenced on
March 25, 2009 and was completed on March 31, 2015. The new FISE is responsible for
negotiating, managing, and monitoring projects and actions that help people access drinking
water services in the rural and marginal sectors.

2.      The new FISE is a decentralized entity supervised by the Office of the President of the
Republic, governed by a Board of Directors with an Executive President named directly by the
President of the Republic. Between 2006 and 2014 there were changes in FISE’s operational
structure to make it more compact and efficient, specializing in the rural water supply and
sanitation sector as mandated in 2004. This enabled a multi-sector entity established in an
emergency context to evolve into an institution specializing in rural water supply and sanitation.

3.     The Nicaraguan Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project, PRASNICA, was conceived
and approved in the context of implementation of the National Development Plan (PND) 2003-
2006 and its Operations Plan 2005-2009, Strengthened Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction
(ERCERP), the Sector Strategy for Drinking Water and Sanitation 2005-2015, and the World
Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy for Nicaragua (2008-2012). The implementation of
PRASNICA coincided with the installation of the Government of Reconciliation and National
Unity (GRUN), which defined a new National Human Development Plan (PNDH), 2008-2012
and 2012-2016, shaping a new form of government with a Christian, Socialist, and Partnership
model.

Problems in Nicaragua’s Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector

4.      When PRASNICA was established, Nicaragua, with a population of 5.5 million, had
serious structural problems caused by entrenched neoliberal policies in the country’s institutions.
According to the National Census INIDE – 2005, about 45 percent of the population was below
the poverty line and 15 percent in extreme poverty, mainly in the rural areas where there it was
difficult to get access to drinking water and sanitation options. According to data from PAHO and
UNICEF, water supply coverage (by aqueducts and other means) was 63 percent in rural areas,
compared with 90 percent in urban areas. The 2005 census showed that sanitation coverage in the
rural zones was 70 percent (including traditional and abandoned latrines). In the Autonomous
Regions of the North Caribbean Coast (RACCN) and South Caribbean Coast (RACCS) water
supply and sanitation coverage was less than 20 percent and 30 percent, respectively.

5.      The institutional responsibilities of each of the entities in the sector were still not well
defined, despite the existence of the General Act on National Waters. There were three institutions
with different roles and objectives that could not execute a common strategy for the sector. At the
sector level, there were no uniform procedures for budgets or monitoring and evaluation systems.
Institutional arrangements, particularly for providing support after the construction of the works,
were still unclear, with FISE using a model directed by the local governments and ENACAL.

6.      In the context of these problems, it was necessary to expand coverage of water supply and
sanitation systems in the country’s rural communities with less than 5,000 inhabitants. These
dispersed communities had high levels of socio-environmental vulnerability owing to their

                                                                                                 48
geographic and economic conditions and lack of accessibility to basic services, health, education,
roads, and safe water, which had a direct impact on the quality of life of the country’s poorest
population, making it less resilient.

7.     Among the strategies for the project, it was proposed that FISE develop a sector view of
water and sanitation, including a group of indicators to monitor the whole sector and not just the
project. The Bank, which lent the resources for the project, was mandated by delegation of the
GRUN through the Ministry of Treasury and Public Credit (MHCP), to promote regular donor
meetings to coordinate their activities in the sector and create opportunities for policy discussions
with the government.

8.     The National Human Development Plan (PNDH), in effect since 2008, was based on the
premise that “its policies begin and end with the development of the human being, families, and
the community.” Its primary objective for the rural area is to “reduce the number of persons
without access to services of drinking water and sanitation.” One year after the new PNDH 2008 -
2012 took effect, PRASNICA was launched and it made its first disbursement in June 2009.

9.     PRASNICA is consistent with the objectives of the PNDH 2012-2016, which seeks to
promote access to water and sanitation services, increase coverage and quality of the infrastructure
to support economic growth, and to reduce poverty and achieve Millennium Development Goal
(MDG) Number 7.

10.     To deal with these issues, the World Bank funded PRASNICA, which included a grant and
loan, in addition to the national counterpart from the municipalities. The project’s total cost was
$29.1 million.

Implementation

11.     The project sought to develop a broad sectoral approach for the rural water and sanitation
sector by providing services to the different segments of the rural sector. Its basic objective was
“to increase access by project beneficiaries to sustainable water and sanitation services in rural
areas.” Priority for investments applied this formula: municipal allocation equals the total amount
to be disbursed multiplied by 60 percent of the rural homes without drinking water per
municipality, plus 40 percent of the rural homes without sanitation per municipality.

12.    PRASNICA addressed poverty reduction, even by gender, with recognition of and
emphasis on indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan communities. The project uses a participatory
municipal planning process, with the assumption that when small villages finish their works they
can be taken over by Water Supply and Sanitation Committees to ensure their proper management
and sustainability.

13.    A central strategy was strengthening of the sustainability chain at all levels, especially in
the essential links in the community, municipality, and region, through an accompaniment process
of the implementing entities by the Project Committee (in the Autonomous Regions), the
Municipal Water and Sanitation Units (UMAS), the Water Supply and Sanitation Committees
(CAPS), through a process of training and organization based on the formulation of support
methodologies (MEPAS, AVAR, OSAG-FECSA to name the main ones).




                                                                                                  49
14.    The carrying out of actions in the Autonomous Regions favored recognition of the
principles of regional autonomy and the whole existing legal framework that supports and protects
the specific rights of these regions and communities.

15.    Pilot projects were executed to stimulate the search for renewable and sustainable
technologies and methodologies in water supply and sanitation.

Organization and Financing of the Project

16.     The project was based on a process of strategically integrated components, and the
strategies included environmental protection, the prevention and reduction of pollution, risk
prevention, and attention to the effects of climate change and its variability.

17.    There were four components in the project: Component 1: Increase Water and Sanitation
Coverage in Rural Areas (US$10 million); Component 2: Increase Water and Sanitation Coverage
in the Autonomous Regions of the South Caribbean and North Caribbean (US$5 million),
including the Special Region of Alto Wanky and Bocay; Component 3: Pilot Projects (US$3
million); and Component 4: Institutional Strengthening and Project Management and Monitoring
(US$2 million). The total initial cost of the project was a loan and grant of US$21.5 million and
US$1.6 million of municipal counterpart, for a total of US$23.1 million.

18.    On March 1, 2013, an additional financing document was signed to expand activities in
specific areas, with more funds for execution of projects in the Caribbean regions. This made it
possible to alter the project with respect to Component 2 in the area of Alto Wanky and Bocay,
update the framework of the outcomes, and reallocate funds among components and expenditure
categories. The total cost of the project rose to $29.1 million including loan, grant, and municipal
counterpart.

Indigenous and Afro-descendent Communities

19.     Nicaragua’s Constitution recognizes the existence of indigenous communities and their
right to preserve and develop their own identity and culture, forms of social organization, and local
resource management, protecting their community property, including its use and enjoyment.

20.    In 2006 the population of the two autonomous regions totaled about 700,000 inhabitants,
dispersed over 60,000 km2 and grouped in 20 municipalities and six ethnic groups: Miskito
(200,000), Mayangna (Twahkas, Panamakas, Kukras) (20,000), Garífuna (3,500), Creoles
(75,000), Ulwa (2,000), and Rama (1,500). The indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan population
represented 42 percent of the total population of the RACCN and the RACCS, while mestizos
made up the remaining 58 percent.

21.     Both regions have the lowest rates of water and sanitation coverage in the country’s rural
areas, the RACCS with 36.5 percent, followed by the RACCN with 45.4 percent for drinking
water; for sanitation the RACCN had 47.9 percent coverage, followed by the RACCS with 48.8
percent.

22.   The project’s Component 2 sought to increase drinking water and sanitation coverage in
the RACCN and the RACCS and in 60 communities of the Alto Wanky and Bocay.



                                                                                                  50
23.     One accomplishment of the project through Component 2 was the elaboration of the Plan
for the Indigenous and Afro-Nicaraguan Peoples (PPIA). The PPIA was drawn up to ensure the
access and participation of ethnic groups in the design, implementation, and ex post phase of
sustainability of the subprojects, as well as participatory planning and the delivery of water and
sanitation services that would be culturally accepted in order to ensure the operation’s
sustainability.

Monitoring and Follow-up

24.    The project established a follow-up system using the matrix of project indicators and
indicators of intermediate results, with specific targets for each indicator. The information was
processed, updated, and monitored in FISE’s Information System for Project Control (SICPRO).

Project Outcomes

25.    The outcomes are that the project contributed to the reduction of general and extreme
poverty in the country, by permitting 308 communities in 108 of the country’s municipalities to
have improved access to water and sanitation, contributing directly to poverty reduction and to the
economic activation and improvement of these population groups.
   - At the level of the sector policy, the Integrated Water and Human Sanitation Sector
       Program of Nicaragua 2013-2030 calls for FISE to expand coverage by 2017 to 666,646
       beneficiaries with new or rehabilitated drinking water systems. For sanitation coverage is
       to increase by 631,073 beneficiaries. Of these goals, FISE has already, through
       PRASNICA, granted 99,590 new beneficiaries their rights to water and sanitation, of which
       50,791 are women.

   -   Laboratory equipment was provided to 117 municipalities to control water quality in each
       system developed.

 a. Achievement of Goals

26.    The project’s final results indicate that it met its development objectives in general terms
and achieved the following specific goals.

   -   Overall, 308 communities benefitted, of which 92 percent are mestizo, 6 percent
       indigenous, and 2 percent Afro-Nicaraguan. There were 18 indigenous communities, of
       which 15 were in the Pacific and central zones of the country and 3 on the Caribbean coast,
       two of which are in the RACCN.
   -   This right was restored to 68,051 new beneficiaries provided with sustainable, quality
       water supply systems.
   -   The right of access to sanitation was granted to 42,010 new beneficiaries.
   -   The percentage of CAPS [Water Supply and Sanitation Committees] established in the first
       three years that continued to operate in a sustainable manner was 65 percent, compared
       with the goal of 55 percent.




                                                                                                51
27.    At the end of the project beneficiaries’ access to and use of sanitation options was
measured. Of the total sample, 98.91 percent had the option, 92.42 percent used it, and 7.58 percent
did not.

   -   The total of beneficiaries was 99,590, 3 percent more than the goal of 97,000.
   -   Women beneficiaries in Components 1, 2, and 3 totaled 50,791, 5 percent more than the
       target.
   -   The project increased to 12,123 the number of new and/or rehabilitated household
       connections.

 b. Of the intermediate indicators, five failed to meet their goals:
   - Number of additional beneficiaries with access to rehabilitated drinking water service in
     the project’s rural areas in Component 1.
   - Number of additional beneficiaries with access to rehabilitated drinking water service in
     the project’s rural areas in the RACCN and the RACCS, Component 2.
   - Percentage of CAPS that offer improved services in the jurisdiction of the institution
     strengthened in the project areas (municipalities).
   - Percentage of CAPS with at least 30 percent women on the water board of the project areas.
   - Percentage of CAPS with women in leadership positions (presidents or treasurers) in the
     water boards of the project areas.

28.     The project promoted women’s participation in decision making, producing cultural
changes that strengthened their participation in community organizations, particularly in
leadership roles. The participation of women is relevant at all stages of the project cycle, but
difficulties persist with their assumption of leadership positions on the executive boards of the
CAPS.

29.     It is necessary to strengthen interventions aimed at increasing the capacity of the CAPS,
which will have an impact on the basic aspects of organization, management, and efficient
operation of the water and sanitation systems, equitable participation, their legalization, and hence
their sustainability.

 c. Institutional Changes

30.    As part of the outcomes achieved, FISE was consolidated as the institution in charge of the
water and sanitation subsector in the country’s rural areas, established as the sector agency
responsible for promoting it, and the institution’s methodological, technical, and regulator y
structure was strengthened.

31.     A balance was established between purely technical and design aspects and moving toward
the incorporation of the social approach in all phases of the project cycle. There was progress in
the installation and use of the SIASAR [Rural Water and Sanitation Information System], which
facilitates updated information on sector conditions in the country. The Environmental
Management System (SIGAM) was strengthened for evaluation of the environmental risks in the
212 projects executed.




                                                                                                  52
32.     The capacity of the technical staff of the UMAS was strengthened through training in
project execution and providing better equipment, working conditions, and technologies for
collecting field data.

33.    At the level of project implementation methodologies, the community participated in
managing the solution of its problems through consolidation of the CDD strategies, thereby
strengthening self-management and execution of procedures by the beneficiaries. This method
was used for the execution of 166 projects, which was 78.3 percent of the total project portfolio
executed with PRASNICA.

34.    The institutional strengthening of the local governments included the provision of
equipment, technological resources, and training for the personnel of the UMAS, as well as, in the
case of Corn Island, support for the municipal water company.

35.     The execution of the Sanitation Partnerships Pilot Project generated access to sanitation
services by paying for the service, stimulating credit for obtaining them at reasonable cost, and
with construction facilities from the local supply. Microfinance entities were authorized to make
loans for sanitation options. The system of public-private partnerships was strengthened for the
local supply of sanitation construction services.

36.    A social component from the outset of the project cycle made it possible to have a positive
impact on the establishment, strengthening, and sustainability of the CAPS.


37.    The UMAS have been consolidated, recognized, and legalized, making it possible to
strengthen the sector, especially the CAPS and the municipal water and sanitation committees and
boards.

38.     Technological capacities in sanitation were strengthened by identifying, trying, and
proposing more suitable and better quality alternative solutions, with three different options: i) the
rural commode, ii) ecosan, and iii) biosan.

39.     The main causes of the difference between the outcomes expected in the project and those
actually achieved are many factors, among them inadequate planning processes, which made it
necessary to redirect actions to meet pre-established goals. Moreover, in some cases the
established goals were over- or under-estimated, which made it necessary to review and update
them continuously.

 d. Impacts of the Project on Growth and Macro and Sectoral Policies

40.    PRASNICA has contributed to the reduction of poverty, particularly to extreme poverty,
by enabling the country to improve access to basic water and sanitation services in the rural areas
in which extreme poverty is highly concentrated. According to data of the FIDEG, the country has
experienced improvements in the extreme poverty indexes: 9.7 in 2009, 7.6 in 2012, and 9.5 in
2013. General poverty was significantly reduced from 44.7 percent in 2009 to 40.5 percent in
2013.

41.    The PISASH [Integrated Water and Human Sanitation Sector Program of Nicaragua]
proposes that by 2017 FISE expand drinking water service coverage to 666,646 new or
rehabilitated beneficiaries, with effective coverage of 64.6 percent of the total rural population. In

                                                                                                   53
sanitation, coverage is to be expanded to 631,073 new or rehabilitated beneficiaries, providing
effective coverage to 66.1 percent of the country’s rural population. Toward these commitments,
FISE has been able through PRASNICA to give 79,988 beneficiaries sustainable drinking water.
With respect to sanitation, there are 42,010 beneficiaries.

 e. Impacts on National and Local Institutions

42.     FISE has made progress in developing synergistic relations with other entities in the sector,
facilitating better interagency coordination for the execution of joint actions with the MARENA
through the PCCAS to strengthen environmental management of projects, and to implement new
environment-friendly technologies that permit adaptation to climate change. There has been an
impact on strengthening the approach and strategies of the sector, particularly at the level of
municipalities, which have created specialized water and sanitation agencies (UMAS) that are also
duly certified by the Municipal Councils, and many of them have municipal water plans and
budgets for their execution, autonomous regions, and communities.

43.     At the level of the Autonomous Regions the project facilitated agreement on joint work
strategies by creating the project committee for each region, and approval of the PPI as the work
methodology for water and sanitation interventions in these regions.

 f.   Impact on the Sustainability Chain

44.    PRASNICA empowered FISE in its role as procurer of funding, consolidating a system of
data on the sector’s needs and options for meeting them, perfecting its work methodologies and
technologies and becoming a revitalized institution for responding to the demand for these
servicers, which today is consolidated institutionally with a set of methodologies and techniques
that ensure the quality of the projects that it plans and executes.

45.     At the structural level, FISE has established the Environmental Management Unit, which
specializes in rural water supply and sanitation and risk management. This unit is directly linked
to the projects’ sustainability by promoting the care, protection, use, and sustainable enjoyment of
environmental resources.

46.  With the design and implementation of the CDD methodology, there was a major step in
community empowerment, strengthening the social capital and self-management for development.

47.   The implementation of processes of training and knowledge acquisition for the
improvement and sustainability of the water and sanitation projects further strengthened the
CAPS.

48.    With PRASNICA, FISE is consolidating the institutionalization of a consistent and updated
record of the sector’s needs based on their identification by the municipalities and their
incorporation in the SIASAR.

 g. Sustainability and Follow-up of the Project Outcomes

49.    The sustainability of the project’s benefits will be possible through consolidation and
consistent application by the primary stakeholders: FISE, institutions in the sector, regional
governments, territorial governments, municipal governments, and communities, improving intra-


                                                                                                  54
agency and interagency coordination, strengthening action as an integrated and comprehensive
system.

50.     The intervention model that was reinforced includes implementation of water and
sanitation services as an integrated set of alternatives that generate behavior changes in the care
and protection of life, health, security, and well-being in harmony with Mother Earth. This is
supported by organization and participation with social responsibility shared by the male and
female beneficiaries.

51.     The project contributed to the sustainability of investments by strengthening the key role
of communities in making decisions on the execution of projects in each community, through their
participation throughout the project cycle, and with support of the organization of the Project
Management Committees and the CAPS.

52.     Sustainability of the outcomes was enhanced by the expanded social component, which
facilitated organization at the community level, training, technical assistance, follow-up, and
strengthened social audits.

53.  Establishment of a financial policy for the project that included a municipal counterpart,
community participation, payment of the tariff by beneficiaries, and the establishment of a
community fund equal to the monthly tariff, ensures the financial backing that will enable the
community to start operating its system sustainably.




                                                                                                55
               Annex 6. Comments from Other CoFinanciers/Partners

           Comments received from the Swiss Development Agency (COSUDE)

1.      With respect to FISE’s performance, COSUDE noted that additional time was required for
finalization. This seems to have become “the norm” with FISE in recent years, with difficulty in
disbursing funds even when extensions are granted, which raises concerns.

2.     Sustainability is an important aspect. COSUDE proposes that an assessment be conducted
within two to three years to evaluate sustainability of Project activities. Although efforts have
undoubtedly been made to increase the capacity of the CAPS, behavior change takes time.
COSUDE also recommends that sustainability be envisioned in the context of the “human right to
water and sanitation.”

3.     Though latrines were proposed as a sanitation solution, COSUDE is seeking more decent
and/or modern sanitation solutions and has held intensive discussions on this issue with the former
FISE team. Clarification on how PROSASR will address this issue would be beneficial.

4.      Regarding the situation of the sector institutions, COSUDE is aware that PRASNICA is a
FISE-implemented project. However, many sections in the report point to the complex nature of
the sector and the Government’s failure to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the
various institutions - FISE, ENACAL, INAA, among others. One of the lessons learned could be
the need for more in-depth discussions with the Government on this issue. These discussions were
started at joint COSUDE-World Bank meetings during World Bank missions and COSUDE hopes
that they will continue under PROSASR.

5.     The report makes it clear that in order to provide coverage and WSS access along the
Caribbean coast, the donors should shift our paradigm and agree on the need to “comply with the
human right to water and sanitation.” Costs cannot remain a limiting factor. In many instances,
donors focus on the number of persons who gain access from an intervention. The COSUDE
believe that this is a point that should be raised with and among donors, and that the Bank should
probably take the lead in this regard. This aspect should also be examined in relation to the new
sustainable development goals.
