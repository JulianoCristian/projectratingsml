consolidation of the macroeconomic stability\n            and develop a sustainable private sector growth over the\n            medium term. The program includes the improvement of\n            financial disciplines, both in the private and public\n            sectors, geared to an increased domestic savings, to foster\n            external adjustment, and creditworthiness. Furthermore, the\n            program aims at accelerating the private sector development\n            and ensuring the social sustainability of the reform\n            process, for the preservation of the country's human\n            capital. Armenia will benefit from the credit's\n            financial support in covering costs associated with its\n            economic reforms. It is also envisaged, that support\n            measures for the improvement of social benefits and the\n            strengthening of social safety nets will be provided by the\n            credit. Even though the risk in policy reversals is small,\n            there is a possible deterioration in the macroeconomic and\n            political environment."}, "docdt": "1998-11-24T00:00:00Z"}
