substantial. Valuable lessons are drawn from the\n            project, mainly that the success of this project, reinforces\n            the important role technical assistance (TA) lending plays\n            in advancing adjustment operations, for such instrument\n            provides the required flexibility to adjust legislative, and\n            procedural changes to achieve reforms, as in this case,\n            restructuring and privatization. Moreover, it also played a\n            crucial role in introducing implementing agencies to the\n            state-owned companies, while the close coordination of the\n            TA - funded by bilateral, and multilateral donors - provided\n            high quality advice. Nonetheless, it is important to note\n            that realistic estimates of privatization obstacles, and\n            timing requirements in adjustment operations can be\n            critical: both the Bank, and the Government initially\n            underestimated the barriers to the strategic privatization\n            of electricity companies - given imposed policy conditions\n            that could not be met as scheduled. Invariably,\n            privatization in sectors with deep vested interests, may\n            turn deceitful, presenting unforeseen obstacles, and delays;\n            thus, conditionality may become useful to build political\n            consensus, provided flexibility is exercised in granting\n            waivers for justifiable reasons. Finally, the counterpart\n            capacity of the Government economic team provided the\n            crucial support to achieve a successful comprehensive\n            adjustment operation."}, "docdt": "2001-09-13T00:00:00Z"}
