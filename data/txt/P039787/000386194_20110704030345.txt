                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) of the GEF financed Argentina
Biodiversity Conservation (ABC) Project, and the parallel Native Forests and Protected
Areas (NFPA) Project. The ABC Project was implemented by the National Park
Administration (APN). Its total cost was US $18.1 million, supported by a US $9.9
million GEF grant (TF-28372). The total cost of the NFPA Project was US $20.84 million
with a US $15.78 million IBRD loan. It was implemented jointly by APN and the
Secretariat of the Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS).

Both projects took nearly 10 years to complete, or nearly two years longer than
anticipated. The NFPA Project was approved by the Bank‟s Board on September 5, 1996,
and became effective on July 8, 1997. It was extended three times for a total of 24
months, and closed on June 30, 2007. The ABC Project was approved by the Board on
October 21, 1997 and became effective on May 29, 1998; it closed 21 months after
originally estimated on March 31, 2008.

This PPAR was prepared by Richard Carlos Worden, IEG Senior Environmental
Specialist. The findings of this assessment are based on a review of project documents,
and discussions with Bank project staff and implementing partners during a mission to
Argentina in February of 2011. Meetings were held with senior managers of the
implementing agencies in Buenos Aires and with park personnel at eight National Parks.

The IEG team would like to acknowledge the cooperation and assistance provided by the
government of Argentina, and to their dedicated staff. In Buenos Aíres, Sr. Sergio La
Rocca and Srta. Lila Cuccolo of SAyDS generously gave their time and provided
invaluable access and assistance while Sr. Raúl Espiño of APN graciously provided
logistical support. APN staff in several parks were very helpful during the mission,
including Carlos Rabagliatti, Juan Tessio and Abel Fleita in the Chaco region, “Tata”
Mujica, Axel Lehr, and Daniela Diaz Kiernan in Nahual Huapi National Park, Martin
Rodriguez and “Pato” in Lanín National Park, Augusto Luis Sanchez in Lago Puelo
National Park, and Roberto Gualco and Ricardo Pereyra in Los Alerces National Park.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the PPAR were sent to relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. Comments from the
Borrower were taken into account and are included in Appendix E.

Summary
This report assesses the development effectiveness of the Native Forests and Protected
Areas Project (1997 – 2007) and the Argentina Biodiversity Conservation Project (1998 –
2008), which were designed to be implemented as complementary projects.

During the past century, Argentina cleared two-thirds of its native forests to use the
wood, much of it for the paper and pulp industry, and to convert it to other productive
uses, such as cattle-ranching and agriculture. The amount of forest cover dropped from
roughly 100 million hectares to just over 31 million hectares. This process was
accompanied by a corresponding loss of biodiversity and unique natural habitats. In the
1930s, Argentina began protecting some of its most spectacular natural areas through the
creation of a National Parks system. However, many forest types continue to be
converted to other productive land-uses without taking into account the public goods and
services these native forests provide. The main challenge facing the Argentine
government in the late 1990s in the forestry sector was to develop and to put in place, at
both the federal and provincial levels, the institutional capacity, knowledge base, and the
policy, legal, and regulatory framework to encourage decision makers in both the public
and private sectors to strike an appropriate balance between the public goods and services
derived from native forests and the private gains to be made from clearing them for other
more productive land uses. While these services benefit society as a whole, they are not
incorporated in the price signals and incentives created by private land markets. As a
result, they require government intervention to minimize the negative externalities
associated with their continued loss.

The original concept of the Native Forests and Protected Areas (NFTA) Project was
designed to respond to this challenge by defining and implementing an appropriate role
for the federal and provincial governments in conserving and managing Argentina‟s
native forests, and to support and strengthen APN‟s management of the national
protected areas system (SINAP). The NFPA Project had four development objectives: (i)
assist SAyDS in prioritizing its proposed actions dealing with native forests; (ii) facilitate
the development of an incentive and regulatory framework to encourage public and
private decision-makers to internalize more fully within their decision-making process
the full range of social costs and benefits associated with their decisions and actions
affecting native forests; (iii) develop a plan to transform APN into a world-class park
management organization; and (iv) increase the environmentally sustainable level of
tourism in four selected National Parks in Patagonia.

By comparison, the Global Environment Objective of the ABC Project was to conserve
biodiversity of global significance in Argentina. To achieve this goal, the project had two
specific objectives: (i) expand and diversify the existing system of protected areas to
include several of the country‟s most significant, under-represented, and threatened
ecoregions; and (ii) create the conditions for their sustainable management through
investments in: (a) institutional strengthening, (b) refined mechanisms of consultation
and participation, and (c) improved biodiversity information management.
                                             xii


Both projects‟ objectives were relevant to the Bank‟s country assistance and partnership
strategies for Argentina at the time of appraisal (CAS, 1995) and assessment (CPS,
2009). The NFPA Project responded to the challenges described in the Bank‟s Forestry
Sector Review of 1993 and was consistent with the Bank‟s 1991 and 2002 Forest
Strategies. The ABC Project was consistent with Argentina‟s 1996 Biodiversity Strategy
and 2003 Biodiversity Policy to expand the SINAP to encompass more ecoregions. The
relevance of both projects‟ designs was substantial in terms of achieving their project
objectives and the causal links between inputs, outputs and outcomes were clear for both
projects.

The NFPA Project resulted in the preparation of the first National Forest Inventory,
which altered public opinion and the debate over forest policy. It was instrumental in the
passage and implementation of a new Native Forest Law and Fund in 2007 aimed at
countering the financial incentives driving the conversion of native forests to agriculture
and cattle-ranching in areas with poor soils and climatic conditions for such land uses.
Plans developed to transform APN into a world-class parks organization had only modest
impact, but APN increased the level of environmentally sustainable tourism at four
selected national parks in Patagonia by making investments to improve tourism
infrastructure, concessionary services, and park management. Revenues generated at the
four parks increased proportionally more than they did for the protected area system as a
whole rising from $1.9 million to $27.7 million Argentine pesos between 2000 and 2010.
The overall efficiency of the NFPA Project was substantial since it achieved three of its
four development objectives to a high or substantial degree within the project timeframe
(given the two year extension) at 69 percent of the total estimated project cost. Its overall
outcome rating is satisfactory. The risk to development for the NFPA Project is moderate
since the financial incentives offered under the new forest conservation program will not
be enough to off-set the powerful market price signals driving the conversion of native
forests to other productive land uses.

The ABC Project substantially achieved both of its specific objectives. First, it succeeded
in expanding and diversifying the protected areas system to include some of the most
threatened and under-represented ecoregions in the country by establishing five new
protected areas and national parks. This was done in a scientifically defensible way, and
using internationally accepted selection methods, criteria and protocols. The project
helped establish conditions for effective management of these parks, through investments
to strengthen APN‟s management capabilities, introduction of sustainable land-use
activities in park buffer zones, using refined mechanisms of consultation and
participation, and improved access to biodiversity information management. The project
completed infrastructure works, scientific baseline studies, monitoring programs, and
management plans for each of the five newly created National Parks. Sixty-five
alternative productive activities were undertaken with over 550 local families living near
or within the parks substantially exceeding targets, although there was anecdotal evidence
that some of these activities at the parks visited had since been abandoned due to lack of
funding to provide follow-up initiatives as well as due to lack of interest among local
families to continue them. The number of consultation meetings held to present technical
studies and management plans was four times greater than expected, indicating a high
degree of stakeholder consultation and participation. Finally, access to biodiversity
information has improved significantly with the creation of the BIS website and the use
                                            xiii


of “roving” specialists from APN‟s four regional technical offices. The efficiency of the
ABC Project was rated as substantial since the five new parks were created and the
enabling conditions were provided for their sustainable management. There were some
minor shortcomings, but overall the results of project investments were directly related to
achieving its objectives with most targets being met or exceeded well within the cost
envelope estimated at appraisal. Thus, the overall outcome rating for the ABC Project is
satisfactory. Risk to development of the ABC Project is negligible to low, as the
Government seems committed to continue to adequately support the effective
management of the five new parks as part of the protected areas system.

The Bank‟s performance in both projects is rated as moderately satisfactory. During the
preparation and appraisal of the NFPA Project, the Bank addressed many of the
institutional deficiencies, informational gaps, and policy constraints based on the findings
of the Bank‟s Forestry Sector Review of 1993. However, several shortcomings occurred
prior to project implementation that could have been avoided. For example, the Bank
underestimated the complexity and sequential nature of inputs time required for the
legislative reform process to unfold. The Bank‟s performance during supervision was
satisfactory since the project team worked closely with the implementing agencies, and
intervened at critical moments to persuade senior government officials to maintain a
minimum level of counterpart funding and progress on project activities during the severe
economic crisis of 2001 - 2003. Regular supervision missions were carried out and the
information gathered from the M&E system was used to measure progress toward project
objectives. In addition, the Bank team amended the loan agreement to modify the
allocation of project-funded expenditures, and extended the project to allow more time to
complete a number of activities.

The Bank‟s performance under the ABC Project was moderately satisfactory at entry
since it should have been more aware of some of the institutional risks and challenges
posed by the implementing agency at the time of appraisal, and taken greater precautions
to mitigate their impact on project implementation. Bank supervision was satisfactory
since the project team worked closely with the implementing agencies, and intervened
with the borrower at critical moments to continue the project when many of other projects
were being cut or eliminated. However, the protracted process of including the last of the
five new parks within the national system left insufficient time to ensure that alternative
productive land-use practices were fully adopted by local communities living in buffer
zones around the park. The Bank‟s overall performance rating for the ABC Project is
moderately satisfactory.

Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory for the NFPA project and
satisfactory for the ABC project. The government has shown strong commitment to the
projects since it continued to fund the NFPA and ABC projects under very difficult
circumstances during the economic crisis and has continued to do so since project
closure. It ensured adoption of important legislation for the projection of protected areas
under the ABC project and the Native Forest Law and Fund under the NFPA Project.
Implementing agency performance was strong for SAyDS under the NFPA project, but
weaker for APN. On the other hand APN‟s performance was satisfactory under the ABC
project.

Lessons Learned

The Bank should encourage natural resource project managers to take advantage of
rapidly changing advances in biodiversity conservation methods and tools to
complement traditional on-the-ground monitoring of indicator species surveys. These
include satellite imagery and aerial photographs of habitat vegetation cover, or real-time
remote monitoring devices and camera traps when conservation of specific species is the
objective. The ABC Project took an approach to biodiversity monitoring that focused on
surveys of “key indicator species” in each of the five parks established by the project.
This approach turned out to be more problematic than anticipated, generating information
of poor quality and reliability. Taking advantage of recent technological advances and
falling costs of these new tools might result in technically complementary and cost-
effective ways to assess key habitat and species. The costs involved in monitoring
changing conditions over time will depend on the project objective, but whatever
approach is taken should aim to provide information that is relevant for decision-making.

Blending different lending instruments, such as IBRD loans with GEF grants, to
achieve different natural resource management objectives can be an effective way to
engage clients in addressing the full range of sector challenges they face. For example,
the decision to use an IBRD loan to help Argentina increase park system revenues under
the NFPA Project while preserving ecoregions of global significance under the ABC
Project justified the use of a GEF grant. It was unlikely that the government would have
agreed to pay the start-up costs of these new parks without GEF support given their low
tourism potential. In terms of financing projects with both global and national benefits,
blended packages of financial support can create the right combination of incentives to
engage clients in a full discussion of their forest productive and conservation objectives.

When experimenting with new techniques or approaches to land-use practices or
natural resource management, it is best to approach experimental interventions in a
measured way assuming that unexpected difficulties, costs, and delays will inevitably
arise. The NFPA Project conducted applied research projects on compatible land-use
practices in productive landscapes while the ABC Project introduced alternative, less
destructive productive activities in park buffer zones. Both took more time and effort to
accomplish than expected, and results were mixed. This should be expected given the
uncertainty and risk perceived by those considering adopting innovative approaches.

1. Historical Background and Natural Context of
Argentina Projects
1.1     Argentina is characterized by a broad mix of ecological regions and rich
biological diversity due to its topography, broad latitudinal range stretching across more
than 3,700 kilometers in length from northern Argentina above the Tropic of Capricorn to
Cape Horn in the province of Tierra del Fuego bordering on the Antarctic Peninsula in
the south, with wide variability of climatic conditions. There are 142 terrestrial, 53
freshwater, and 43 marine ecoregions found in the world.1 This broad diversity of
ecoregions supports a large number of species of flora and fauna in Argentina, which is
particularly rich in terms of the number of endemic animal and plant species it harbors.
Of these 238 ecoregions worldwide, 15 terrestrial and 3 marine ecoregions are found in
Argentina. Nine of these 18 ecoregions were considered to be at great risk from a variety
of threats, and were selected as the top priorities for increased biodiversity conservation
efforts by the Government of Argentina, the World Bank, other donors, and
environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs).2

1.2     In terms of forest cover, it was estimated at the time of appraisal that more than
two-thirds of Argentina‟s original 100 million hectares of forested lands had been lost or
degraded within a span of less than 80 years since 1915,3 mostly attributable to the
expansion of row crop and livestock production. This has grave consequences in terms of
conserving biodiversity since it is estimated that nearly 90 percent of terrestrial
biodiversity is found in the world‟s forests.4 The latest figures on the current rate of
deforestation in Argentina (2005) range from 200,000 to upwards of 250,000 hectares per
year of the remaining 31 million hectares of forested landscapes, mostly in the Dry Chaco
ecoregion. The dry and humid Chaco savannah forest ecoregions in northern Argentina
are the largest (representing over three-quarters of Argentina‟s native forest cover) and
most threatened forest ecoregions in the country, where most of the current, on-going
deforestation is occurring. It is estimated that between two to four million hectares of
Humid Chaco are burned every year, mainly to clear land for soybean production or
livestock grazing. The massive clearing of Chaco forest for soybean production is also
displacing livestock production onto already converted and degraded croplands in the
Chaco and Pampas ecoregions, where 63% and 40% respectively of these native dry
tropical forests and tall grassland ecoregions have been converted and degraded in just
the past 15 years.5 The intensive mono-crop agriculture practices and overgrazing is not
well-suited to the poor soils and dry climatic conditions present in these ecoregions. Such
land-use practices lead inexorably toward increasing desertification and declining soil

http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/ecoregions/ecoregion_list/ An eco-region is defined as a "large unit
of land or water containing a geographically distinct assemblage of species, natural communities, and
natural conditions.”1 The boundaries of an eco-region are not sharp or fixed, but rather encompass an area
within which important ecological and evolutionary processes most strongly interact, and are typically
bounded by ecotones or mosaic habitats transitioning from one eco-region to another.

fertility. However, these practices persist due to the lack of understanding and awareness
of their long-term impacts on one hand, and the lack of market price signals, adequate
financial incentives, legal prohibitions, and technical alternatives to encourage land-
owners to adopt more sustainable productive land-use practices.

1.3     Despite its rich biodiversity, Argentina‟s national identity is tied most closely to
its agrarian and cattle-raising heritage. The country is widely known for the broad
expanses of low, flat, and arid grasslands known as the Pampas where most of the
agricultural grains and livestock are produced as well as the Patagonian Steppe where
large sheep ranching operations occur. However, this ever-increasing production has
occurred at the expense of the country‟s natural landscapes, forests, and biodiversity. For
example, the native grasslands of the Pampas have been reduced to one percent of their
original area,6 as can be seen in the following figure (Figure 1) on Argentina‟s
“transformed ecoregions.” Less than half of that one percent (0.5%) is legally protected;
and a third of the Patagonian Steppe soils have been severely eroded due to overgrazing
by sheep ranching. Nearly 85% of the country is not suitable for rain-fed agriculture
since more than half (56%) is desert or xerophytic in terms of vegetative cover.7

1.4     This expansion of the agricultural and livestock frontier in the Chaco ecoregion
was the main impetus for developing, designing and implementing the Argentina
Biodiversity Conservation (ABC) Project with Global Environmental Facility (GEF)
funding and World Bank supervision and technical support. At that time, the existing
reserves and parks in the SINAP did not adequately represent many of the country's
ecoregions that were considered to be of global significance in terms of their biodiversity,
but were at risk of being converted to agricultural or pasture lands. Therefore, the
motivation of the ABC Project was to conserve biodiversity of global importance by
expanding and diversifying the existing national system of protected areas (Sistema
Nacional de Areas Protegidas or SINAP) to include several of the country's most
globally significant but inadequately protected ecoregions, and to create the conditions
for their sustainable management.

1.5     The goal of ensuring the “effective conservation of places that represent at least
10 percent of every major habitat type in the world” is a widely accepted conservation
target established by international conservation organizations.8 Under its conceptual
framework for sustainable forest management, the GEF provides “new and additional
grant and concessional funding to meet the agreed incremental costs of measures to
achieve agreed global environmental benefits”9 to address the issues of climate change,
biodiversity, desertification, and forest degradation. Thus, it was appropriate to provide
GEF grant funding for this project because the global environmental services and
conservation value provided by native forests were not reflected in market prices and the
government would likely not have made the investments to protect them without it.

1.6     During this same period in the late 1990s, the country's system of federal and
provincial protected area had grown to cover some 4.9 percent of Argentina‟s national
territory (about 13 million hectares). Of this total, some 22 percent was under the
auspices of APN, consisting of 31 national protected areas (there are now 35 parks with
two more parks planned to be incorporated into the system in the near future along with
four special natural military reserves10), while the remaining 78 percent was under
provincial or other forms of local or private control. However, it was estimated that less
than 21 percent of the total area under protection was adequately managed, 30 percent

was under some form of management, and almost 50% (mostly under the jurisdiction of
provincial or municipal authorities) had inadequate management or protection.11 In other
words, just over 1 percent of Argentina‟s natural landscapes were being adequately
protected while the national goal is 5 percent,12 and the international conservation target
for conserving terrestrial ecosystems is 10 percent.

1.7     In addition, some of the larger, more widely recognized and frequented parks are
major tourist attractions, representing the fourth largest source of foreign currency
revenue in Argentina, more than twice as large as the value of beef exports for which it is
so well-known.13 However, these parks were not managing the increased levels of
tourism in a sustainable manner, nor were they fully realizing their full potential to
generate revenues. This was the main impetus for the NFPA Project, and the increased
revenues were intended to be used to cross-subsidy other parks of high conservation
value, but with low tourism potential, created with GEF funds under the ABC Project.

1.8     Thus, at the same time that the ABC Project was being prepared to address gaps
in the SINAP by the Government of Argentina for appraisal by the GEF and World Bank,
the Native Forests and Protected Areas (NFPA) Project was being prepared to
complement the ABC by strengthening the financial and strategic management of APN in
general while improving the physical infrastructure and management of four of the most
visited National Parks in SINAP.

Other World Bank and Donor Assistance Projects
1.9     There are six other World Bank projects and at least an equal number of other
projects with other multi-lateral donors that are directly relevant to these two projects in
Argentina. The six World Bank projects are:

         Sustainable Natural Resources Management (SRNM) Project (2009 – 2014)
          US $72 million project supported by a $60 IBRD loan to improve the sustainable
          and efficient management of forest resources, conserve biodiversity in protected
          areas and forest landscapes, and integrate small producers into forestry
          development and conservation.
        Biodiversity Conservation in Productive Forestry Landscapes (2007 - 2013) a
          US $7 million GEF grant to increase integration of biodiversity-compatible
          practices and policies into the plantation-forestry sector at the national and
          provincial levels. It was partially blended with the $60 million SRNM Project.
        Forestry Development Project (1996 – 2006) a $26 million, nearly 10-year
          project supported by a $16 million loan intended to contribute to the efficient and
          sustainable growth of forest plantations and timber processing industries, alleviate
          rural poverty, and develop a strategy to address desertification and soil erosion
          problems in Patagonia.

        Provincial Agricultural Development Project (PROSAP II) (2009 – 2015) a US
         $423 million, six-year project with a $300 million SIL to provide technical
         assistance, capacity-building activities, and direct investments to improve the
         long-term agricultural productivity of small- and medium-sized producers, as well
         as their competitiveness and market access.
        Grassland and Savannas of the Southern Cone of South America: Initiatives
         for their Conservation in Argentina is a brand-new, US $3 million GEF-grant
         project (2010 – 2013) that will be implemented by two national environmental
         NGOs. Its objectives are to develop a production model to combine responsible
         grassland conservation with cattle-ranching activities, develop a “natural
         grasslands beef” certification scheme and the institutional capacity to implement
         it, and create a sectoral policy and regulatory framework that encourages the
         uptake and replication of the model.
        Rural Corridors and Biodiversity Project is a US $24.94 million blended
         project that started in 2011, and is supported by a $6.29 million GEF grant and a
         $13.72 million IBRD loan to Argentina. The purpose of the project is to increase
         protection of vulnerable natural areas and conserve biological diversity through
         the creation, strengthening and operational startup of selected protected areas,
         strengthening the Federal System of Protected Areas (SIFAP) including
         provincial and private sector conservation capacities, as well as through
         interventions to initiate model conservation corridors in the Argentine Chaco and
         Patagonian Steppe and Coastal-Marine ecosystems.

1.10 In addition to the WB projects, there were and are a number of GEF-funded,
UNDP supervised biodiversity conservation projects in the northern Chaco and Wetlands
of Iberá ecoregions that have been particularly relevant to both the NFPA and BCP
projects as well as in the Patagonian Coastal-Marine ecoregion in the south to improve
coordination between coastal zone management and governance of commercial fisheries.

1.11 For example, the four-year Payment for Environmental Services (PES) Project
(2010 – 2014) is a multi-focal area project involving both the Biodiversity and Climate
Change GEF focal areas that is being implemented by SAyDS. This US $10 million
UNDP project to establish financial incentives to conserve ecosystem services provided
by more than 10 million hectares of forest cover landscapes in four provinces in the
Chaco ecoregion of Argentina complements the work of several of the on-going WB
projects mentioned above. The project involves components and activities to expand the
knowledge base about different PES models and tools for grasslands, forests,
biodiversity, water resources, and carbon sequestration to facilitate their replication and
scaling up in reversing the conversion and degradation of landscapes, and decrease
deforestation rates in the Chaco ecoregion at a landscape level.

1.12 Another example of an associated project is the IDB‟s US $56 million project14 to
improve the tourism sector‟s competitiveness in two natural “corridors” of Argentina: the
Iguazú-Misiones corridor and the “corridor of the lakes” in Patagonia. This “corridor of

the lakes” project in Patagonia has complemented the NFPA Project by supporting the
four APN parks plus Lago Puelo National Park. It is focused on improving tourist
attractions and services in those five National Parks in order to attract more tourists,
particularly foreign tourists who spent an estimated US $90 billion dollars there in 2007.
Many of these services were found to be poorly suited to their preferences and needs.

2. Project Objectives and Design
NFPA Project
2.1   Objectives. The project objective15 of the NFPA Project had four specific
elements:

      1. Assist SAyDS in prioritizing its proposed actions dealing with native forests;
      2. Facilitate the development of an incentive and regulatory framework that would
         encourage public and private decision-makers to internalize more fully within
         their decision-making process the full range of social costs and benefits associated
         with their actions affecting native forests;
      3. Develop a plan to transform APN into a world-class park management
         organization; and
      4. Increase the environmentally sustainable level of tourism in selected national
         parks.

2.2       Design. There were three project components.

2.3     Component A: Generation and Dissemination of Research and Information
(appraised baseline cost of US $13.4 million, revised amount of US $10.15 million, with
actual expenditures of US $9.79 million). This component was designed to address
weaknesses and deficiencies in the policy, legal and regulatory framework for native
forests. It was implemented by the Directorate of Native Forests (now known as the
National Directorate of Forests or DNB) within the renamed Secretariat for the
Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS), and had the following three
subcomponents:

         Subcomponent A.1: Policy, Legal and Regulatory Reform. The objective of
          this subcomponent was to update the regulatory and legal framework for
          managing native forests at the federal level to identify the main obstacles to their
          optimal management.
         Subcomponent A.2: National Inventory of Native Forests and Database
          Management. The objective of this subcomponent was to: (a) complete an
          inventory of native forests, and (b) to develop and manage a related database so
          that SAyDS would have the capacity to store, retrieve, analyze and publish
          reliable information related to its mandate governing native forests. The six major
          forest types found in Argentina are presented in Figure 3 in Annex E.

15
  As stated in the Staff Appraisal Document, August 5, 1996; the Loan Agreement (No. 4085-AR) of April
17, 1997; and in the Results Framework of the ICR for the NFPA Project, December 28, 2007.
                                             7


      Subcomponent A.3: Applied Research and Studies to Facilitate the Improved
       Management and Conservation of Native Forests. The objective of this sub-
       component was to develop a strategy to improve the management of native forests
       (particularly those that were privately owned) by conducting applied research and
       studies to identify the most threatened areas for increased protection as well as the
       principal forces causing their loss and degradation. This was to be followed by a
       set of recommendations regarding cost-effective, technically feasible mitigation
       options to improve their management.

2.4     Component B: Protected Areas (appraised baseline cost of US $10.3 million,
revised amount of US $7.6 million, with actual cost of US $9.5 million). The objectives
of the Protected Areas Component were: (a) to prepare a plan for modernizing APN and
transforming it into a world-class park management organization; and (b) to increase the
capacity of four National Parks in Patagonia to accommodate a greater number of tourists
without damaging their environments. It was executed by APN and represented the cross-
subsidy link between the two projects. It contained two subcomponents:

      Subcomponent B.1: Plan for Modernizing APN. The objective of this
       subcomponent was to support studies and activities aimed at developing an agreed
       upon vision of APN and subsequent implementation plan to transform it into a
       world-class National Parks service.
      Subcomponent B.2: Infrastructure Development and Management
       Strengthening in Four Selected Parks. The objective of this subcomponent was
       to increase revenues to APN by financing infrastructure works and strengthening
       the management of four National Parks in the region of Patagonia (Lanín, Nahuel
       Huapi, Los Alerces and Los Glaciares). The additional revenues generated were
       to be used to help support other parks in the protected areas system, which lacked
       tourism potential.

2.5     Component C: Project Implementation (appraised baseline cost of US $2.2
million, revised amount of US $2.66 million, with actual cost of US $1.54 million). The
objective of this component was to strengthen the capacity of the implementing agency
(SRNyAH) to manage and coordinate project by establishing a PIU.

2.6    A map of Argentina‟s ecoregions with an overlay of the locations of the targeted
national parks under the Native Forests and Protected Areas Project is presented as
Figure 2 in Annex E at the end of the report.

ABC Project Objectives and Design

2.7    Objectives. The Biodiversity Conservation Project‟s Global Environmental
Objective was to conserve biodiversity of global importance. The two specific objectives
were to:

   1. Expand and diversify the existing National Protected Areas System to include
      several of the country‟s most globally significant but inadequately protected
      ecoregions; and
   2. Create the conditions for their sustainable management through investments in:
      institutional strengthening, refined mechanisms of consultation and participation,
      and improved biodiversity information management.

2.8     ABC Project Components. The project sought to achieve this objective through
a series of activities embedded within the following three components:

2.9     Component A: New Protected Areas (PA) Component (appraised baseline cost
of US $19.1 million, revised amount of US $19.2 million, with actual cost of US $15.7
million). This was by far the largest of the three components in terms of financial
resources dedicated to its achievement, representing US $15.7 million or 88% of total
actual project baseline expenditures. The purpose of this component was to select,
acquire and manage a number of high-priority protected areas in the nine most important,
under-represented ecoregions of Argentina; to support improved local community land-
use activities through a series of pilot projects replacing more destructive land uses and
practices; and to increase stakeholder participation and consultation in decision-making
processes. It was comprised of three subcomponents:

      Subcomponent A.1: Establishment and Consolidation of Five New Protected
       Areas (appraisal cost of US $15.9 million; revised estimate of US $16.1 million,
       and actual cost of US $13.1 million). 32 candidate sites were evaluated using a set
       of selection criteria and five final selections were made by APN, other Argentine
       biodiversity experts, and NGOs during project preparation. The five protected
       area sites selected were: (1) Los Venados in the pampas of San Luis Province; (2)
       San Guillermo in the dry Puna of San Juan Province; (3) Copo in semi-arid Chaco
       region of Santiago del Estero Province; (4) Quebrada del Condorito of the
       Córdoba Montane Savannas in Córdoba Province; and (5) Monte León (in the
       littoral, wetland habitat of Patagonian Steppe in Santa Cruz Province. Legal
       problems led to the abandonment of Los Venados and its replacement by
       Mburucuyá in the province of Corrientes in 2006 as the fifth new protected area.
      Subcomponent A.2: Sustainable Development Activities in Buffer Zones
       (appraised cost of US $1.4 million; revised estimated cost of US $1.7 million, and
       actual cost of US $2.1 million). This subcomponent supported improved land-use
       practices in the five selected protected area buffer zones through pilot projects,
       studies, awareness-building activities, and extension services. It aimed to offset
       any social or economic impacts caused by restricting access to natural resources
       by local communities living in and around the parks.
      Subcomponent A.3: Public Participation and Training (appraised cost of US
       $1.8 million; revised estimated cost of US $1.4 million, and actual cost of US
                                                     9


        $0.5 million). As part of project preparation, a Participation Plan and Mitigation
        Plan were prepared. GEF funding was used to cover the incremental costs of the
        Participation Plan.

2.10 Component B: Biodiversity Information Management (appraised amount of
US $0.6 million; revised to US $0.8 million, with actual expenditures of US $1.1
million). The objective of the component and training sub-component was to provide
users with readily available information to make decisions regarding the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity in Argentina. An internet-based biodiversity network was
created with the main hub or “node” established in APN‟s National Directorate of
Conservation of Protected Areas. It was linked to “nodes” in each of APN‟s Regional
Technical Delegations in Igauzú, Salta, Córdova, and Bariloche. The system was
designed to fulfill Argentina‟s legal responsibilities as a signatory to the Convention on
Biological Diversity.

2.11 Component C: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (appraised
amount of US $0.6 million; revised to US $0.9 million, with expenditures of US $1.0
million). This component financed technical assistance, equipment and incremental
operational costs needed to strengthen APN‟s capacity of to manage the project and
monitor biodiversity at protected areas.

national parks under the Argentina Biodiversity Conservation Project is presented as

3. Institutional Arrangements, Expenditures and
Implementation Experience of NFPA and ABC Projects
Implementation arrangements
3.1     In the early 1990s, Argentina faced a number of constraints in addressing natural
resource management and conservation issues. In particular, constraints on public
spending had severely restricted the government‟s resources available for new
investments in protected areas. Efficient management of the country's natural resources
was hampered by poor coordination between different levels of government, deficiencies
in the policy and legal framework, and lack of technical expertise and established
mechanisms for public participation and consultation. In view of these constraints, the
Government proposed that the two projects be “blended” as parallel and complementary
projects.16


16
   Blending financial instruments was consistent with the Bank‟s 2002 Forest Strategy which states: “For
the Forest Strategy to be successfully implemented, sufficient financing will need to be made available to
assist countries to realize their national forest objectives for both development and conservation. This
financing will need to be available on blended terms, ranging from investment funds at market rates
through to concessional terms, including grants,” p. 9, Sustaining Forests: A Development Strategy, 2002.
                                             10


3.2     The NFPA Project was jointly implemented by SAyDS for the first two project
objectives and components, and by APN for the last two. At the time, SAyDS and APN
were both located within the Secretariat of Natural Resources and Human Affairs
(SRNyAH). However, as a result of the reorganization of SRNyAH early in the project‟s
implementation, APN was relocated to the Secretariat of Tourism (SECTUR) in 2001. In
contrast, APN was the sole implementing agency for the ABC Project, responsible for
achieving both project objectives.

3.3     Both projects were initially implemented by a common Project Implementation
Unit located within SRNyAH and shared by the two implementing agencies. However,
once APN was relocated to the Secretariat of Tourism in 2001, it experienced significant
delays in the timely flow of funds from SAyDS (which still held authority for the special
account for project operational expenses) to make disbursements for the two components
of the NFPA Project for which it had implementation responsibility. This constraint was
eventually resolved by establishing a separate Project Implementation Unit and special
account for APN with independent procurement authority in mid-2003 when the Grant
Agreement was amended.

3.4     In late 2007, just prior to the closing of the Biodiversity Conservation Project in
March 2008, SAyDS was transferred to the Directorate of the Cabinet Ministers (Jefatura
del Gabinete de Ministros), where it has remained to this day. No negative impacts on the
project were incurred as a result of this reorganization.

Implementation Experience – NFPA Project
3.5      Both projects got off to strong starts in terms of making rapid disbursements
initially, and starting project activities quickly as a result of preparatory work on baseline
assessments, diagnostic studies, and institutional support. A new unit (the National Forest
Monitoring Unit or UMSEF in Spanish) within the National Directorate of Forests of
SAyDS was created, staffed and equipped to undertake the first national forest inventory.
Diagnostic studies were prepared and consultations were held to discuss APN‟s
institutional capabilities, what its priorities should be, and to propose an implementation
plan leading to the development of a “Vision for a Reformed APN.” Work was also
begun to update the park management plans of the four selected national parks in
Patagonia. However, soon after project implementation, SRNyAH was buffeted by a
corruption scandal, resulting in changes to its senior leadership and the eventual
dissolution of the ministry. The National Directorate of Forests remained within the
newly formed Secretariat of the Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS),
but implementation of project components under the direction of APN were set back by
frequent changes in APN presidents and national project coordinators during project
implementation.

3.6     Then, beginning in 2001, Argentina suffered a severe economic crisis that
essentially put both projects on hold for the next two years. Disbursements slowed
significantly as scarce government resources were shifted from counterpart funding for
projects to attend to pressing internal social needs. Like the rest of the Bank‟s portfolio
in Argentina, these projects were at risk of non-performance during this time. However,
persistent Bank support of appeals made by SAyDS and APN to the Ministry of
                                            11


Economy and Production and the Directorate of the Cabinet of Ministries to continue
funding these projects were eventually successful. In addition, the Bank modified the
NFPA Project Loan Agreement and the ABC Project Grant Agreement to ease the burden
on Argentina by increasing the percentages of expenditures that project funds could be
used to pay for, and by extending the implementation period of both projects.

3.7     The NFPA Project had three project extensions for twelve, nine and three months
each for a total of 24 months beyond the original closing date (June 30, 2005). The
second (9-month) extension was dependent upon the first (12-month) extension
stipulating that only infrastructure works either underway or contracted out and projected
to be concluded within the next nine months could be included in the second extension.
The third extension was requested to finalize four remaining infrastructure works which
were over 90% complete and could be finished during the last 3 months of project
implementation (by the end of May 2007).

3.8     The ABC Project had one extension of 21 months granted by the Bank allowing
the project to continue until May 2008. One of the consequences of the economic crisis
was its impact on the procurement of the Estancia San Nicolás area in the province of San
Luis as the site of the proposed Los Venados Provincial Protected Area. The purchase of
the Estancia began in December 2000 with a down payment of 30% of the total purchase
price of US $2.75 million, and in June of 2001 the final payment should have been made.
However, APN did not have sufficient funds on hand to complete the purchase due to
budget cuts imposed during the crisis, and the purchase of the property was never
completed. In 2005, an alternative site (Mburucuyá Provincial Protected Area) was added
through an amendment to the grant agreement to become the fifth new National Park
added to SINAP under the ABC Project.

3.9     Soon after these legal changes in expenditure allocations and the granting of
project extensions, the projects began increasing the rate of activities, disbursements, and
progress toward targets and project objectives in 2004. By this time, the political impact
of the First National Forest Inventory had begun to be felt as public concern grew with
new credible evidence of the degree of deforestation of native forests that had occurred in
Argentina. In addition, the new National Strategy for Sustainable Tourism had made
increasing revenues generated by foreign tourists to National Parks a priority. Project
investments in infrastructure works at the four selected National Parks under the forth
subcomponent of the NFPA Project began in earnest by 2005, and nearly one-third of
NFPA Project funds were spent in the last 18 months of the project. The NFPA Project
closed on June 30, 2007.

3.10 Many of the new park purchases and physical investments in facilities, vehicles,
and equipment were made during the final two years of the ABC Project. The project
extension allowed time for a large number of sustainable production activities and
training programs of over 550 families living in buffer zones, two additional applied
research projects, and public participation processes to be carried out in the five new
parks (including at Mburucuyá where they were initiated with less than two years
remaining in the project).

Planned vs. Actual Disbursements
NFPA PROJECT EXPENDITURES

3.11 An amendment to the Loan Agreement for the NFPA Project was made in July
2003. Besides establishing a separate Project Implementation Unit and special account
for APN following its transfer to the Secretariat of Tourism, this amendment also
changed the percentage of expenditures that could be financed by the project,
summarized in Annex C. The loan amount was only 81 percent (US $15.78 million) of
the $19.5 million estimated at appraisal while the borrower‟s contribution dropped more
than half from US $10.5 million to US $5.06 million. Total financing amounted to just
over two-thirds (US $20.84 million) of the estimated amount of US $30 million.

ABC PROJECT EXPENDITURES

3.12 There were four amendments to the ABC Project Grant Agreement. The first
amendment allowed GEF funds to entirely finance “works” and “goods.” This helped
boost implementation by streamlining the procurement process and allowed the project to
take advantage of a tax exemption for goods and services procured with international
cooperation funds. Changes in project disbursements are summarized in Annex C. The
second amendment in late 2003 changed the grant amount from Special Drawing Rights
(SDR) into United States dollars. This had the effect of stretching project funds as a result
of the devaluation of the Argentine peso vis-a-vis the dollar. The third grant amendment
in 2005 introduced adjustments to key performance indicators. The fourth grant
amendment added Mburucuyá National Park as the fifth protected area to be incorporated
in the national protected areas system. Total ABC Project costs at appraisal were
estimated at US $21.9 million, but actual project costs were only US $18.1 million,
including GEF-financed preparation costs. Of this amount, the GEF disbursed all but
$300,000 of the approved grant of US$10.4 million. The borrower contributed just under
US $7 million or 63% of the slightly more than US $11 million of counterpart funding
estimated at appraisal. Another US $1 million came from “project beneficiaries,” who
increased their contribution by US $600,000 above the estimated appraisal amount of US
$400,000.



4. Achievement of Outcomes
Native Forests and Protected Areas Project
OBJECTIVE 1: ASSIST SAYDS TO PRIORITIZE ACTIONS IN NATIVE FORESTS

4.1      The Bank‟s Forestry Sector Review of 1993 identified an “urgent need” to
address the lack of credible, accurate baseline information required to manage native
forests in Argentina.17 Information available at that time was not accurate or credible
since it had „stitched‟ together forest cover estimates from different provinces or forest
17
     Argentina: Forestry Sector Review, p. v, February 18, 1993.
                                             13


types at different times using different methods and protocols. Also, the lack of
environmental or economic analysis of threats to native forests, or of the economic
opportunities to be gained from sustainably and rationally managing them, made it
difficult to generate policy options, develop realistic management plans, or create
political consensus on critical issues of protected area management. To address this
constraint, the NFPA Project undertook two initiatives under separate project
subcomponents: 1B (National Forest Inventory) and 1C (Applied Research and Studies).

First National Forest Inventory

4.2    Under Subcomponent 1B, the project financed the creation, staffing and
equipping of the new National Forest Monitoring Unit (UMSEF) within the National
Directorate of Forests (DNB) in SAyDS. The UMSEF successfully completed the First
National Inventory of Native Forests (NIF) in 2001, providing accurate and credible
information on the true extent of six different major native forest types found in
Argentina.

4.3      This inventory provided the technical justification for modifying the Native Forest
Law and Fund (Ley 26.331 de Presupestos Mínimos de Protección Ambiental de los
Bosques Nativos) that was passed by Argentina‟s Congress in 2007. The Forest
Inventory helped mobilize civil society groups and environmental NGOs to support the
bill when it stalled in the Senate and the government stated its opposition to the bill.
Grass roots organizations as well as the major productive forestry sector organization
rallied to its support, collecting more than one million signatures on a petition supporting
the bill, which was subsequently passed and signed into law later that year.

4.4      Since the passage of the new Forestry Law in 2007 and its implementing
regulations (Ministerial Decrees 91 and 256 in 2009), UMSEF has lost more than half of
its staff and budget as SAyDS has shifted available staff and resources to implement the
new Native Forest Law and Fund to finance pilot projects aimed at conserving native
forests or restoring transformed areas back into forest. Despite these recent setbacks, as a
result of the project, UMSEF has created a website to disseminate forestry information at
http://www.ambiente.gov.ar/. It has published a Forestry Atlas of Argentina, in both
technical and scholastic versions, as well as a seven-volume bound set of inventory
reports for technical users. These inventory reports are available in their entirety on
UMSEF‟s website, and were reviewed during the assessment mission.

4.5     There is also a proposal to undertake a second national forest inventory at a higher
level of resolution of 10 km2 plots each for approximately 3,300 sample quadrants under
the direction of a national technical committee. This higher resolution data would satisfy
the needs for more detailed information relevant for planning and management
interventions at both the national and provincial levels to support operational decisions
based on accurate and up-to-date inventories of forest coverage and regeneration rates by
species type and location. According to SAyDS managers, it has been proposed and is
pending funding under another donor-sponsored project.
                                            14


Applied Research Studies and Demonstration Sites

4.6     The other project subcomponent intended to help SAyDS to focus on its highest
needs and priorities was the applied research and studies subcomponent conducted as part
of the National Program of Applied Research for Native Forests (PNIARFON). The
purpose of these studies was to generate a suite of case studies about different land-use
practices, involving agricultural and agro-forestry practices compatible with sustainable
forest planning and management.

4.7      A total of five (5) applied research studies were conducted in three different
native forest regions: one forest management study in the semi-arid or dry Chaco with 10
demonstration sites, and one study in the humid Chaco ecoregion with 3 demonstration
sites; an agro-forestry study in the Espinal and Monte ecoregions with 9 demonstration
sites; and one in the Patagonian Andes; and a forest management alternative study in
southern-most tip of Patagonian forest in the Tierra del Fuego region with 9
demonstration sites. In all, thirty-one (31) demonstration sites covering over 650 hectares
of privately-held forested lands in these ecoregions were supposed to have been
monitored over 30 years to demonstrate a variety of biodiversity-friendly, economically-
viable and socially acceptable mixed agro-forestry land-use practice pilot projects. This
did not occur in one-third of the demonstration sites. A proposed sixth study area was
not implemented due to a shortage of time in finding acceptable local implementing
partners.

4.8      An internal review of the five pilot projects and 31 demonstration sites was done
in 2010 by SAyDS as a follow-up activity to the NFPA Project. This review found a
number of technical flaws in the design of demonstration sites and the failure to continue
monitoring programs at a number of them due to a shortfall in financial resources
available. The review noted the importance of resuming the monitoring of those
demonstration sites given the large amount of work that had gone into undertaking them
in the first place and the importance of maintaining time-series data of actual results in
order to persuade others to adopt such approaches or methods.

4.9     Although the flaws observed were distinct and specific to each of the pilot
projects in the different forested regions, there were some common issues raised in the
review. First, the review noted the need to make baseline study methods more consistent
among the different projects. It called for more mixed-use or multiple-use studies to
evaluate more sustainable agro-forestry and silvo-pastoril (mixed pasture – forestry) land-
use practices to be initiated. A minimum set of core indicators and a common analytical
framework for monitoring systems should be created. And evaluations of the economic
and social sustainability of more compatible land-uses should be undertaken. It was also
suggested that the primary focus of future demonstration sites should be in the remaining
three forest regions of the country. Finally, the review recommended that the Information
Management Unit for the Sustainable Yield of Native Forests (UMARF) within DNB be
strengthened in order to systematically collect and analyze the data generated by the pilot
projects and disseminate it to a variety of different end users.

4.10 In sum, the activities undertaken by these two subcomponents resulted in
important technical advances and inputs to achieving the first two objectives of the
                                            15


project (that is, to prioritizing SAyDS‟s actions regarding native forests, and reforming
national policies, regulations, and laws related to updating and improving the forest
planning and management framework). The First National Forest Inventory proved to be
indispensable in eventually persuading policy-makers and political leaders of the urgent
need to pass the new Native Forest Law and Fund incorporating economic incentives
through a national fund to finance sustainable land-use practices in forested areas. This
legislation would likely not have overcome resistance from political and economic
interests had the inventory not so convincingly demonstrated the need to take action to
arrest continued deforestation in the country. Under the Applied Research Studies project
subcomponent, not all of the pilot studies were successful and monitoring efforts were
not continued after project funding ceased. However, these studies have provided real-
world examples of land-use practices that are more sustainable and well-suited to the
soils and climatic conditions of the region. Overall, the results achieved under this
objective have been substantial.

OBJECTIVE 2: DEVELOP AN INCENTIVE-BASED REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

4.11 Based upon the recommendations of the Forest Sector Study of 1993 and the
preparation and appraisal work done prior to the start of project implementation in 1997,
the project financed a set of studies of policies, laws, and regulations at the federal and
provincial levels. The studies assessed existing legislation and regulations affecting the
management, production, transport, processing, and export of commercial products from
forests, and identified the main obstacles to the efficient functioning of the sector,
including environmental consequences. Based on the conclusions of these studies, the
project supported the drafting of proposed federal legislation to create economic
incentives to conserve and restore native forests.

4.12 The information generated and disseminated under the first objective was critical
in achieving the passage of the Native Forest Law and implementing regulations in 2009
established by Ministerial Decree (Resolutions 91 and 256). The Native Forest Law
prohibited the cutting of high conservation value forests for one year while forestry plans
were being prepared by provinces. The law set forth minimum standards for provincial
forestry land-use plans controlling the indiscriminate clearing of native forests beyond
the one-year prohibition, and it promoted the conservation of native forests by
establishing three categories of forested areas and restricting their removal only to those
areas (“Category 3” or “green”) considered to be of low conservation value and already
converted or more suitable to other land-uses (Article 9). There were no minimum “set-
aside” requirements for each category of native forests, but forestry land-use plans had to
be approved by the province‟s legislature and then submitted to the National Forest
Directorate within SAyDS to be “accredited” (Article 33) to ensure their consistency with
the National Forest Inventory. So far, eleven provinces (out of 24 provinces in Argentina)
have had their forested land-use plan petitions accredited by SAyDS/DNB and three more
were in the process of being accredited at the time of the assessment mission in February
2011. The effect of the one-year prohibition on logging of native forests could not be
confirmed by any credible evidence, and it is no longer in effect.

4.13 Although the Native Forest Law does not require provinces to prepare forest plans
for accreditation by SAyDS, it also includes a mechanism for making payments for
                                                     16


environmental services (PES) provided by native forests for those provinces with
approved plans. These services include attenuation of flooding and maintenance of water
quality, provision of habitat for biodiversity, conservation of soil erosion and fertility,
and sequestration of greenhouse-gas emissions of carbon dioxide and methane. Article 5
states that the Federal Environmental Council (COFEMA) would develop
methodological guides to valorize the environmental services to be incorporated into a
new National Program of Native Forests Protection to be created by SAyDS under
Section 4, Article 12. A Fund to finance these PES grants for projects conserving or
restoring native forests in qualifying provinces is funded by a two percent (2%) tax on
exports of agricultural, meat, and forest products and a minimum disbursement of 0.3
percent from general Treasury revenues (Article 31).

4.14 So far, more than 110 proposals have been approved to receive financial support
for roughly $150 million pesos (US $37.5 million), with funding of $300 million
Argentine pesos now available to finance new proposals. It is expected that the new
program will become completely operational and fully staffed within the next year, and
that funding will eventually rise 3 – 5 times above its current annual level of US $75
million.

4.15 The results achieved under this objective of passing the new Native Forest Law,
implementing regulations, and the payment for environmental services (PES) Fund have
exceeded expectations established at the start of the project, which did not envision the
creation of such a PES Fund. Therefore, the achievement of the second objective is rated
as high.

OBJECTIVE 3: DEVELOP A PLAN TO TRANSFORM APN INTO A WORLD-CLASS PARKS
ORGANIZATION

4.16 Most of the project activities and 14 products listed under Annex 2 (Outputs by
Component) of the ICR, such as the “Vision for a Reformed APN,” “APN Strategic
Plan,” or the “Institutional Modernization Plan” which were prepared with project
support, did not appear to have been very influential in terms of providing APN‟s
strategic direction and affecting its decisions at either a national or individual park level.
Most of the individuals interviewed only recognized a few, if any, of the documents listed
in Annex 2 of the ICR, and none could attest to their effectiveness or importance in terms
of “providing the skills and planning needed to confront new challenges in conservation,
a growing park system, and increased tourist visits.”18

4.17 At the national level, the Federal Strategic Plan for Sustainable Tourism (PEFTS),
developed separately by the Secretariat of Tourism in 2005, appears to provide APN‟s
political leadership with its guiding principles and strategic direction for managing the
SINAP. At the park level, all of the superintendents and senior park managers
interviewed indicated that the document guiding strategic management decisions was
APN‟s Institutional Operational Plan (Plan de Gestión Institucional para los Parques
Nacionales) of 2001, which had been updated in 2008. This document created the


18
     ICR for the Native Forests and Protected Areas (NFPA) Project, p. 20; December 28, 2008.
                                            17


framework which they used to develop their Annual Operational Plans (Plan Operativo
Anual or POA) for each park, and was prepared by APN independently of the project.

4.18 What had demonstrably improved the management capabilities of APN were the
infrastructure works and updated park management plans at the four selected parks in
Patagonia. However, at the APN system-wide level, there was little tangible evidence
encountered that the plan developed to “transform” APN had made a substantive impact.
The frequent turnover of APN Presidents and Project Coordinators during the time of the
project, as well as the transfer of APN from SRNyAH to the Secretariat of Tourism, may
have contributed to this apparent lack of impact.

4.19 In summary, while outputs were produced that could have helped transform APN
into a world class park organization had they been fully integrated in APN‟s management
systems, there is little evidence that the activities and products developed for this
objective had more than a modest impact on strengthening the institutional capabilities of
APN and making progress in transforming it into a world-class parks organization.

OBJECTIVE 4: INCREASE ENVIRONMENTALLY            SUSTAINABLE TOURISM IN FOUR
SELECTED NATIONAL PARKS.

4.20 The ICR used three criteria to measure achievement of this objective: 1) improved
park management, 2) enhanced visitor services, and 3) improved opportunities for
increasing revenues generated by concession services that are paid to APN. The last two
of these criteria are flawed as measures of the sustainability of parks since neither
increased use nor income generation necessarily guarantees or promotes a parks‟
sustainability prima facie. In fact, there are many instances in which increased tourist
visits and concessionary activities within national parks have damaged the parks‟ natural,
cultural, or historical characteristics, thereby undermining their unique attributes and
value. Thus, in evaluating this objective in terms of these three criteria, great attention
was paid to ensuring that the increased visits or concessionary revenues generated did not
undermine environmental conditions or lead to their degradation over time.

4.21 Activities and disbursements supporting this fourth objective were carried out
under Subcomponent 2.B (Infrastructure Development and Management Strengthening in
Four Selected National Parks) in the lake region of Patagonia along the southwestern
border with Chile. The four national parks selected were: Nahuel Huapi National Park,
Lanín National Park, Los Alerces National Park, and Los Glaciares National Park. Of
these, only Los Glaciares was not visited due to time limitations and logistical
constraints. However, Lake Puelo National Park was visited to contrast a non-project
supported national park with the other project-supported parks in the area, although there
is an important difference in terms of its size compared to the other four parks.

4.22 In terms of improved park management, this was achieved in a number of ways.
First, for each of the four national parks supported by project funds, management plans
were prepared by consultants working with central APN staff and park managers. Two of
these plans were reviewed (Lanín and Los Glaciares national parks), and found to be
comprehensive and strategic in their focus on each park‟s unique natural attributes and
touristic potential. In comparison, the draft integrated planning document for the
                                             18


Recreational Area of Lake Puelo National Park (not included in the project) was lacking
in strategic focus and organization, reflecting a collection of stakeholder meeting
comments more than a planning document.

4.23 Another aspect of improved park management is related to APN staffing levels,
which also contributes to enhanced visitor services. Of the two parks for which data on
staffing levels were provided between 2000 and 2010 (the period roughly of project
implementation), one park (Los Alerces) experienced a tripling of staff during that period
(rising from 40 personnel in 2000 to 120 in 2010) while the other park (Nahuel Huapi)
only increased its staff by 18 percent (from 170 in 2000, to 180 in 2005, and 200 in
2010), but it started from a very high level. Lanín National Park also had a large staff of
100 APN park rangers, firefighters, and administrative staff; figures from earlier years
were unavailable. Partly, these staffing levels were related to the size of the parks and
historical factors; partly, they were affected by the terrain or type of ecosystem in which
the park is located, its accessibility to population centers, and the recreational pressures
placed on its natural attributes. There was no conclusive evidence to attribute increased
APN staffing levels to the project among the other possible contributing factors.

4.24 The 40 infrastructure works undertaken by the project in these four National Parks
unquestionably enhanced the quality of visitor services. These works included the
construction of a new administration building for Lanín National Park in the picturesque
town of San Martín de los Andes. The construction of this building by the project was a
transformational advance for the APN staff in Lanín by providing them with a modern
facility to carry out their work while freeing up the old historic office a few blocks away
in the town square to house a new visitors‟ information center and museum honoring the
“father” of Argentina‟s park system, Dr. Francisco “Perito” Moreno, accompanied by
many educational and informative displays.

4.25 In several cases, the infrastructure works were synchronized with other works
being carried out by a US $33 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) to improve the competitiveness of the tourism sector (AR-L1004) within two
“tourism corridors:” the Corridor of the Andes Lake region and the Corridor of Iguazú-
Misiones. For example, infrastructure works undertaken by the NFPA Project in Los
Alerces National Park including two entrance control posts with visitor information
centers, bridges and footpaths, and staff offices complemented a number of other
infrastructure works, such as firefighting centers, piers, and four public restrooms paid
for by the IDB project.

4.26 An interesting comparison is found at Lago Puelo National Park, which is located
about halfway between Nahuel Huapi and Los Alerces national parks. Visits by tourists
to the park are very concentrated both physically and temporally. The area most visited
by the vast majority of tourists in confined to an 80 hectare space of the 26,000 hectare
park connecting the entrance of the park to a parking area, two large campsites located
adjacent to the beach area, and a 2-kilometer stretch of day-use only beach along the
northern shore of the lake. Tourism occurs almost exclusively during the summer months
of January – March. The contrast of Lago Puelo‟s infrastructure to that of the other
project-supported projects is striking. The APN administration building and visitor center
burnt down in a fire in March 2009, and has not been rebuilt since then due to a lack of
                                             19


APN funding. A temporary building is being used now by APN staff as its administrative
center; the new visitor center is a small “shed-like” building located next to an
unattractive parking area that is not well regulated or maintained by park staff. However,
there is currently a major infrastructure project underway with financing under the IDB
project to build a new pier/wharf that is expected to dramatically improve service
amenities for park visitors.

4.27 Finally, in terms of enhancing opportunities to increase revenues generated by
increased concessions services to APN, it was not possible to measure (independently of
other contributing factors) the degree to which project activities had enhanced
opportunities to increase revenues from tourism and private concessions operating in the
four APN parks. In many cases, the terms of concession bids could not be shared due to
the sensitive and proprietary nature of those contracts with APN. That said, an indirect
proxy of concessionary fees was the level of services offered to tourists by
concessionaires. For example, figures obtained from Nahuel Huapi National Park
showed that tourist visits to areas accessible only by concessionary tour boats (Victoria
Island and Los Arrayanes National Park) had both roughly doubled between 2002 and
2009. A portion of those fees goes to APN. Most measures of park concessional
activities increased by 12 – 30 percent while the number of individuals “permitted” to
conduct touristic activities doubled between 2005 and 2009.

4.28 Since concessions are based upon the demand for those services by tourists,
trends in the number of tourists also increases revenues to APN indirectly. In this sense,
tourism has quadrupled in the four project-supported parks from roughly 300,000 a year
in 1997 to 1.2 million visitors in 2006, while it only increased by less than double in the
other parks of the system during that same time (from 735,000 to 1,443,000). Tourism at
Los Glaciares National Park in the Southern “Austral” Andes mountain range of
Patagonia on the border with Chile has increased more than any other park from 75,000
visitors in 1999 to nearly 475,000 in 2006.

4.29 While figures are not available on a system-wide basis for APN since 2006, trend
data on tourist visits at two of the project-supported parks (Nahuel Huapi and Los Alerces
national parks) since then have shown a steady increase over the past four years. In Los
Alerces National Park, 130,000 people visited the park in 2006; the initial estimates for
the current tourist season are 200,000 visitors. At Nahuel Huapi National Park, tourist
visits have increased from 315,000 in 2006 to over 407,000 paid park visitors in 2010.
Park staff indicated that they estimated the actual number of park visitors last year was
roughly one million people. However, due to the open access of the park (33 paved entry
points into the park), but limited number of entry points where entry fees can
economically be collected (3 – 4), there is a great deal of “leakage” of revenue. In spite
of this leakage, revenues at Nahuel Huapi have increased from roughly US $150,000 in
2000 to US $325,000 in 2005 to over US $562,000 last year, an increase of nearly 375%
over those 10 years.

4.30 In addition to the quantitative aspects of trends in concessions and outdoor
tourism activities in the park, there are qualitative considerations that should be factored
into the assessment. For example, APN staff at Nahuel Huapi are now working to
establish obligatory security, first aid and emergency care preparedness programs, and
                                             20


insurance standards for adventure tour services. They are creating minimum requirements
and norms for permitted boating, fishing, and horseback-riding tour services that will be
progressively increased to meet quality standards set by the Secretariat of Tourism. They
are also creating the capacity to ensure compliance through credible deterrence and
enforcement of permit conditions when necessary. In addition, infrastructure works in the
four parks have been carefully designed and built to avoid causing any increased
environmental impacts despite increased tourism use. In fact, in most cases, they have
reduced the environmental “footprint” of these projects, such as the new 1.3 kilometer
raised walkway built in Los Arrayanes National Park or the new APN administrative
building at Lanín National Park that improved working conditions for APN staff and
enhanced visitors‟ experiences at the old historic center in the town‟s main plaza.

4.31 In summary, park management improved, visitor services were enhanced, and
revenues generated by improved opportunities for tourism and concession services within
these four national parks increased more than at the rest of the other parks in the national
park system. These outcomes have been achieved without undermining the long-term
sustainability or ecological integrity of the parks‟ natural and cultural resources. In fact,
these activities protected and improved them in all cases.

4.32 What cannot be stated without reservation is to what extent these changes can be
attributed to the project. It would seem reasonable to conclude that a significant amount
of these achievements can be attributed to the efforts of the project for two reasons. First,
due to the qualitative improvements in infrastructure, management capabilities, and
concession services, the project contributed to improvements in the quality of tourism
services offered at the parks, and could not have detracted from them. Second, when
compared to Lago Puelo National Park, which was not included in the project, the
differences in the quality of tourist service amenities in terms of the presence of more
APN staff and installed infrastructure, the level of oversight exercised over concessions
in the park, and reduced wear-and-tear on the natural areas heavily frequently by tourists
(e.g., the beach front and camping areas) are quite noticeable. Based on all these
considerations, the achievement of this fourth project objective is rated as high.

Argentina Biodiversity Conservation Project
OBJECTIVE 1: EXPAND AND DIVERSIFY SINAP

4.33 The Project‟s objective to preserve biodiversity of global importance by enlarging
and diversifying the National System of Protected Areas (SINAP) by adding five new
protected areas encompassing nearly 400,000 hectares (out of a total of 2.8 million
hectares under the existing network of 30 national parks present in SINAP at the time of
appraisal) was substantially achieved by project closure. Five new national parks were
created with project assistance.

4.34 These included San Guillermo National Park in San Juan Province, the
southernmost extension of the Central Andean Dry Puna; Copo National Park in Santiago
del Estero Province, one of the last pristine areas of Semi-Arid Chaco in Argentina;
Quebrada del Condorito in Córdoba Province, an area including a part of the Córdoba
Montane Savannas, an ecoregion endemic to Argentina; and Monte León in Santa Cruz
                                                      21


Province, an area of Patagonian Steppe and littoral and wetland habitat. Los Venados
provincial protected area, located in an area in San Luis Province identified as the largest
remnant of relatively intact Pampas was later replaced by Mburucuyá Protected Area in
the northern humid Chaco ecoregion of Corrientes province.

4.35 These parks represent globally important ecoregions in terms of the habitats and
biodiversity they contain that were under-represented in SINAP at the project‟s inception
and were at risk from various threats. The criteria for selecting the parks were
scientifically sound and conformed to internationally accepted methods. Other leading
conservation non-governmental organizations (e.g., WWF and The Nature Conservancy)
had also identified the Chaco ecoregions (both humid and dry), the central Andean Puna,
and Patagonian Steppe as high-priority ecoregions. The selections were also consistent
with Argentina‟s National Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use Strategy.

4.36 The National Park Law (Regimen Legal de los Parques Nacionales, Monumentos
Naturales y Reservas Nacionales - Mensaje y Ley Orgánica) No. 22.351 of 1981,
provided the legal basis for establishing and managing protected areas in Argentina. This
law defines the management objectives and characteristics to be used to classify protected
areas into one of several conservation classes. The process of changing the designation of
a provincial protected area into a national park requires that legal steps be taken by both
provincial and federal governments. When project activities began in 1998, only the
Quebrada del Condorito National Park had already been legally designated (1996). All
four of the other selected protected areas were legally designated as national parks (the
highest level of protection in Argentina), and were provided with full protection and
management capabilities by the project. These included: San Guillermo (1998), Copo
(2000), Mburucuyá (2002) and Monte León (2004).

4.37 The selection of Mburucuyá Protected Area to replace Los Venados was based on
a “comparative analysis of options”19 conducted by APN, which rated Mburucuyá as its
highest ranking candidate site for inclusion in the project. The Bank‟s Lead Ecologist
conducted a site visit and employed the Rapid Assessment and Prioritization
Methodology developed by WWF and the Bank to confirm its suitability.20 Social and
environmental assessments of the park and surrounding area were carried out by APN --
and found to be acceptable by the Bank. Based on these assessments and the
recommendation provided by APN, Mburucuyá was considered to be an excellent
candidate for inclusion in the project. It was formally added to the project in June 2006
with just 21 months left in implementation. Mburucuyá may have been the most
important site to protect, but this was not clearly or fully explained in project documents
nor was its selection apparent following a field visit to the site during the IEG assessment
mission. Its selection at this late stage in project implementation raised two concerns.

4.38 First, Mburucuyá was not on the list of 32 candidate sites developed to select the
five new protected areas to be added to SINAP during project preparation, but was added
to the project even though two other sites (Puerto Peninsula in Misiones and Los

Cardones in Salta) had been “narrowly excluded only because of an insufficient degree of
[legal and administrative] preparedness”21 during the initial selection process which made
it “unrealistic” to include them given the project‟s short timeframe. Both of these
protected areas are located in high-priority ecoregions of the Atlantic Forest and Central
Andean Dry Puna. Mburucuyá was designated as a national park in 2002, but it is a small
site (less than 18,000 hectares), intersected by a provincial road, and at risk of becoming
ecologically isolated since it is surrounded by privately-owned productive lands. Within
the same province of Corrientes to the east is located the 1.2 million hectare provincial
natural reserve of Iberá comprising an ecologically unique and viable complex of
freshwater estuaries and Chaco habitats containing over 4,000 animal and plant species.
Iberá was on the original list of candidate sites and was excluded for reasons of cost and
lack of local support. However, it is actively managed by the well endowed non-profit
Conservation Land Trust, and is located even further away from population centers and
areas of economic growth than Mburucuyá.

4.39 Secondly, there was little time left in project implementation at the time of
Mburucuyá‟s selection (less than 18 months) for local NGOs working with communities
to achieve the goals of promoting sustainable land-use practices among the 56 families
living in the buffer zones of the park. APN park staff has continued to provide follow-up
support activities since the project closed. Three years later at the time of the IEG
assessment mission, due to the logistical difficulty of reaching these isolated
communities, it was not possible to independently confirm whether they had been
adequately compensated for the restrictions placed on their traditional livelihoods by the
establishment of the park. According to project documents,22 more than SU $233,000 had
been spent on eight community sub-projects to train these families in adopting more
compatible land-use practices and alternative productive livelihoods. However, APN park
staff indicated that more than half (5) of the eight sub-projects had not been successfully
sustained due to the limited time available for their implementation and adoption. It
would appear that the scope of activities that were undertaken following the designation
of Mburucuyá as a national park should have pared down to better reflect the small
amount of time left in the project when the Grant Agreement was modified.

OBJECTIVE 2: CREATE CONDITIONS FOR THEIR SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT

4.40 It is not enough to create a national park by merely giving it legal status. It is also
necessary to “create the enabling conditions for its sustainable management” by enlisting
local public support and providing the required financial, human, and informational
resources for its active management and adequate protection. The project sought to
achieve this objective through three separate activities: promoting sustainable pilot
activities in the buffer zones, increasing public participation in their management, and
improving access to biodiversity data.23 In addition to these three elements, the physical
works and procurement of equipment that were supported by the project were also
assessed by IEG.

4.41 Two of the five national parks (Copo and Mburucuyá) were visited during the
project review mission in February of 2011. IEG also visited one other national park
(Chaco NP) in the area that was not included in the ABC Project due to its geographic
proximity to the other two project-supported parks to examine differences between these
comparable parks.

4.42 Regarding the first aspect of promoting sustainable pilot activities in the buffer
zones, these activities were already discussed for Mburucuyá National Park. In Copo
National Park, APN park staff indicated that only five families had been adversely
affected by the establishment of the park due to “strict limits” placed on maintaining
existing numbers of cattle within the park‟s boundaries (1,500 head), and the prohibition
on hunting and cutting of live wood for cooking. Materials for fencing and suppliers of
cattle for breeding were provided along with four training programs that were offered in
appropriate technologies and animal-raising practices to another 70 families. However, it
was unclear what impacts the training had had on those families from talking to the park
staff as the roads leading to the sub-project sites were impassable.

4.43 In comparison to Mburucuyá and Copo National Parks, there were few notable
differences between them and Chaco National Park in terms of buffer zone activities. For
example, Chaco had re-initiated a series of educational programs and park visits for local
school children over the past several years through a community consultative committee
(Mesa Socio Territorial) organized with local residents that attracted larger numbers of
student visitors to the park each year. Park staff also participated in a rural housing
project to help poor local farmers in nearby buffer zones to improve their living
conditions through the consultative community committee.

4.44 In terms of increasing public participation in the management of the newly
created parks, there was also little difference perceived between Mburucuyá and Copo
National Parks and Chaco National Park. A consultative community committee (Comite
Social Teritorial) had been established in Chaco that met regularly with representatives
of the park, local schools, NGOs, and community leaders that was considered to be very
useful and productive in matching the park‟s operations and activities to the community‟s
needs as much as possible. This appeared to be due as much to the individual leadership
style of the park superintendent as it did to any institutional factors. In Mburucuyá
National Park, community relations were also an important component of APN‟s work
and presence there with three of eleven staff dedicated to it full-time. However, in Copo
National Park, the community consultative committee had fallen into disuse even though
it had previously been “very productive” according to park staff.

4.45 The Biodiversity Information System (BIS) was successfully launched and was
performing its intended function of enhancing access to biodiversity data. In November
2007, the BIS organizational and management structure was approved by the
government, defining the system‟s primary objectives and responsibilities. The BIS now
has its own annual budget line, annual operational and long-term plans that guarantee its
continued growth and development with financial support and human resources provided
by APN. IEG confirmed that all of the studies and analysis done at the five new parks
had been entered into the system‟s electronic database and are available on-line via an
internet address (www.sib.gov.ar) as well as on APN‟s website (www.apn.gov.ar). A
                                             24


wide variety of separate environmental databases related to National Parks and
biodiversity conservation have also been systematically integrated into the BIS‟ various
databases, and internal users can formulate and carryout queries concerning flora, fauna
and other information needed for park management or biodiversity conservation. Several
new activities have been developed, including a new webpage with improved
accessibility; incorporation of additional databases and information by technical staff in
each of the four regional hubs or nodes, and new intra- and inter-operability capabilities
for external and internal users.

4.46 Enhancing access to biodiversity data was useful and relevant to creating the
necessary conditions to sustainably manage the five new parks, but the scale and scope of
creating a national biodiversity information management (BIS) system was greater than
what was required to achieve this objective. This may have reflected an attempt to
“blend” it with the objectives of the Native Forests and Protected Areas Project, which
had as one of its objectives the intention to modernize APN, since they had been initially
conceived as complementary projects.

4.47 Finally, there was a very noticeable difference between the two project-supported
parks and Chaco National Park in terms of infrastructure subprojects that were
undertaken to enhance the physical and logistical capabilities of the parks. These
included access control posts, fencing, rehabilitated or new visitor centers, buildings, and
other facilities, as well as all types of equipment and vehicles (enumerated in Annex 2 of
the project‟s ICR). IEG found that the new infrastructure works encountered at both
parks had enhanced park management capabilities to physically manage and protect their
natural and cultural attributes, and compared favorably with the condition and quantity of
infrastructure and equipment encountered at Chaco National Park. In summary, the
second objective of creating the conditions necessary to sustainably manage the five new
National Parks was substantially achieved. The Biodiversity Information System and the
infrastructure works and equipment provided to the new parks with project funds made
an important impact on park management capabilities. Productive activities in buffer
zones and increased community involvement in park management decision-making
processes appear to have had more mixed results. Viewed three years after the project
closed, incompatible land-uses in buffer zones have decreased; community participation
is increasingly incorporated into park management decisions; biodiversity information is
collected, analyzed, and utilized to manage the parks; and management of the parks has
been facilitated by enhancements to facilities, vehicles, and equipment as a result of the
project.

GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVE

4.48 The NFPA and ABC projects supported the Global Environmental Objective to
“conserve biodiversity of global importance” in a number of ways. They created
Argentina‟s first national forest inventory to credibly identify and prioritize native
forests. This was instrument in passing a landmark piece of native forest conservation
legislation with a fund that is now being implemented through a national program to
identify, evaluate and finance pilot projects that conserve and restore native forests in
provinces which have established forest management plans based on their conservation
values and environmental services. Five new national parks have been created in
                                                      25


ecologically important, but under-represented and threatened ecoregions. They are being
effectively managed and protected by APN staff, and efforts are underway now to
increase their connectivity through conservation easements and corridors. And tourist
visits and revenues were increased substantially at four of the most popular parks in the
protected areas system while reducing the environmental impact or “footprint” of the
projects‟ investments. This experience is being replicated at 11 more national parks now
under a follow-up project.



5. Evaluation Ratings
Relevance of Objectives
5.1     The objectives of the NFPA and ABC projects at appraisal were highly relevant to
the World Bank‟s 1991 Strategy and 1993 Forest Policy, both of which strongly
emphasized the need to preserve intact native forests. They were also a direct outcome of
the Bank‟s Argentina Forestry Sector Review (Report No. 11 833-AR, dated April 26,
1993), which pointed out the need to integrate the policy framework for both native and
productive forests by reducing the use of native forests for paper and pulp production,
and increasing the generation of public goods and services provided by native forests by
improving their protection and management.24 While these two projects addressed issues
involving the conservation and protection of native forests and the protected areas
system, the Bank‟s Forestry Development Project (1996 – 2006) supported the efficient
and sustainable growth of forest plantations and timber processing industries. The
findings of the Bank‟s economic sector work were later reflected in the Country
Assistance Strategy of 1995. This CAS included “rebuilding infrastructure” as one of
three development pillars, under which lending for forestry, enhancing the forestry
regulatory framework, and improving the management of native forests and protected
areas were included.

5.2      The Bank‟s latest Forestry Strategy of 2002 has shifted the focus of the 1991
Forestry Strategy and 1993 Forest Policy, both of which it found had not been effective in
slowing down deforestation rates in tropical forests. The Bank‟s new Forestry Strategy
states that the previous approach had not adequately addressed the need to actively
manage natural forests to reduce poverty, nor had they adequately integrated sustainable
forest management practices into economic and rural development policies. However, the
new Forestry Strategy also encompasses a pillar to “protect vital local and global
environmental services and values.” This pillar includes several elements which were
implemented by the NFPA and ABC projects, such as increasing diagnostic and analytic
work as the primary instrument to engage borrowers and other partners in forest
conservation and management efforts, providing financing on blended terms to create the
right mix of loans and grants to help countries realize their national forest objectives,
forming partnerships with other donors and NGOs, and encouraging full participation by
all stakeholders.

5.3     The objectives of the NFPA and ABC projects also remain substantially relevant
to the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, 2009) covering the period of 2010 –
2012. They address one of the thirteen “development challenges” identified in the CPS,
which acknowledges that the expansion of soy production over the past several years has
fueled rapid deforestation at a rate (0.75 percent in 2006) that is twice the average in
Latin American, and caused severe land degradation affecting 60 million hectares (mostly
in the Pampas and Patagonian Steppe ecoregions). In response to this challenge, the
government‟s “Development Vision” includes an “active green environmental agenda”
with initiatives to safeguard biodiversity, protected areas, biological corridors, and
sustainable resource use in buffer zones of the Chaco and arid Patagonian ecoregions.”25
By improving tourism infrastructure at four of the most visited parks in the national
protected areas system, the NFPA Project was also consistent with Argentina‟s Federal
Strategic Plan of Sustainable Tourism (Tourism 2016) required by the new National Law
of Tourism (Law 25.997), which sets the overall direction of APN‟s management of
SINAP.

5.4   Thus, the overall relevance of the objectives of both the NFPA Project and the
ABC Projects to the Bank‟s country partnership strategy and the country‟s priorities is
substantial.

Relevance of Design
5.5     The main challenge facing the Argentine government in managing and conserving
its remaining native forests and protected areas was to correct market-based price signals
that did not reflect the value of the public goods and environmental services provided by
native forests and protected areas. These “negative externalities” occur because decisions
regarding land-uses are based on considerations of private costs and benefits only, and
societal resources are misallocated as a result. To correct this situation, a policy, legal and
regulatory framework was needed to encourage decision makers, such as private land-
owners, to internalize the full range of public and private costs and benefits in their
decision-making processes. Since nearly all forests (apart from National Parks) are under
provincial jurisdiction or are privately owned in Argentina, the federal government had
two policy instruments at its disposal to change these decisions: market-based incentives,
and regulatory prohibitions and sanctions.

NFPA PROJECT

5.6     The design of the NFPA Project responded to these challenges through the first
project component (“Native Forests”) that contained three subcomponents implemented
by SAyDS to achieve the first two project objectives. The first subcomponent consisted
of preparatory policy studies, workshops and training in payment for environmental
services schemes, and the preparation of a draft federal law to sustainably manage native
forests and biodiversity that was presented to the Argentine Congress in April 2007. The
new Forest Law and Fund (Law 26.331) passed in November 2007, and the
accompanying regulations to implement it were later passed by Ministerial Decrees in
2009 (Decrees 256 and 91). The purpose of these forest conservation grant funds is to

create financial incentives to individual land-owners or groups to conserve and restore
native forests in partnership with accredited provinces. The forest fund is implemented
through a national program partially financed by a tax on exports of products that
contribute to deforestation, such as meat, agriculture, and wood products.

5.7      The second project subcomponent supported SAyDS in developing its capabilities
to generate and disseminate technically accurate and credible information on the status
and condition of the country‟s remaining native forests. The principal output of this work
was the production of the first National Forest Inventory. This inventory galvanized
public support to conserve the remaining native forests, and altered the political debate
that led to the passage of the Forest Law and Fund. The third subcomponent promoted a
series of five sub-projects in three different productive landscapes to demonstrate
alternative silvo-pastoril and agro-forestry practices at more than 30 demonstration sites
through its applied research studies (PNIARFON) program. These three activities under
the first project component were relevant to achieving the first two project objectives of
assisting SAyDS in prioritizing its actions with regard to native forests, and facilitating
the development of an incentive-based regulatory framework.

5.8     However, the project design also included a second component (“Protected
Areas”) aimed at achieving the last two project objectives of transforming APN into a
world-class parks management organization, and increasing the environmentally
sustainable level of tourism at four of the most highly visited parks in SINAP. Merging
these two components within the same project design was awkward in that it combined
two very different sets of objectives implemented by two different agencies. This design
caused unnecessary confusion, delays, and problems of institutional coordination
between the two implementing agencies from the project‟s onset, which were aggravated
when APN was relocated to the Secretariat of Tourism in 2001, and were not corrected
until 2003 when a separate project implementation unit for APN was created within the
Secretariat of Tourism.

5.9     When the project was prepared and appraised, the Bank did not use the Results
Framework format, and the chain of causality between inputs and outcomes was not
clear. The “Performance Indicators” contained in Annex H of the Staff Appraisal Report
were later transferred into the Results Framework format in the ICR. The five PDO
Indicators and 42 Intermediate Indicators were all clearly linked to both project
objectives and the M&E system. Values for baselines, targets, and degree of achievement
were provided for all indicators. The relevance of the NFPA Project‟s design to achieving
the project‟s objectives is substantial.

ABC PROJECT

5.10 The ABC Project was also designed and appraised before the Results Framework
was employed by the Bank. Therefore, the 12 “Impact Indicators” associated with the
four “development objectives” listed under the M&E Plan and Indicators in Annex D of
the Project Document were later translated into the 10 GEO Indicators of the Results
Framework of the ICR in a clear and consistent manner. Baseline values, targets, and the
degree of achievement were assigned to each indicator, which had been lacking in Annex
D of the Project Document. The four development objectives enumerated in the Project
                                                     28


Document were collapsed into the two specific objectives of the project under the general
objective to conserve biodiversity of global significance.

5.11 To achieve the first specific objective to “expand and diversify the existing
National Protected Areas System to include several of the country‟s most globally
significant but inadequately protected ecoregions,” the project legally created, purchased,
and equipped five new national parks within SINAP. However, those parks are becoming
increasingly isolated and less connected to one another as native forests continue to be
converted around them. Given that 78 percent of Argentina‟s native forests (apart from
existing National Parks) are under provincial jurisdiction or are privately owned, an
alternative approach that pursued more of a partnership between federal and provincial
authorities, or attempted to change private sector behaviors or land-use decisions in one
focused area of high conservation value (such as the Chaco ecoregion) might have proven
to be a better approach than the one taken. The ICR itself acknowledged this flaw when it
stated that the project had “laid bare the disconnect between the various institutions
responsible for native forests including: the absence of a shared vision at federal and
provincial levels vis-à-vis the future role of native forests, while the limited capacity and
mandate of the federal Native Forests Directorate highlighted the importance of
developing collaborative partnerships to address native forest issues.”26 It should be noted
that increasing collaboration with provincial forest authorities and increasing the
connectivity of protected areas through greater use of conservation easements and
corridors have been incorporated into the design of the Bank‟s follow-up Sustainable
Natural Resources Management Project. Aside from these concerns, the activities and
components supported by the project were well aligned with the project‟s objective.

5.12 The second specific objective of the Project Document and the ICR was “to create
the conditions for their sustainable management by strengthening APN‟s institutional
capabilities, introduce refined mechanisms of consultation and participation, and improve
access to biodiversity information.” The project‟s inputs were consistent with achieving
this objective. On On balance, the overall relevance of the project design to achieving the
project‟s objectives is rated as substantial.

Blending the NFPA and ABC Projects

5.13 A final observation regarding the design of these two projects involves the
“blending” of the IBRD loan for the NFPA Project with the GEF grant for the ABC
Project. The government requested that the two projects be blended to provide
“additional assistance from the GEF to cover the incremental costs associated with the
creation and management of several priority protected areas in threatened and poorly
represented ecoregions of global importance.”27 The GEF agreed since it was unlikely
that the Government would have invested its own resources to create these new parks
without the assistance provided by the GEF grant, given that they were not expected to
become financially self-sufficient due to their limited tourism potential.

5.14 However, an alternative design between the two projects would have combined
the APN-implemented objectives as a single “Protected Areas” project, and the SAyDS
implemented objectives as a separate, but parallel “Native Forests” project. The table
below describes this alternative arrangement of the two blended projects.

5.15 This approach would have been simpler to implement and reduced delays and
institutional coordination problems that were encountered under the joint implementation
approach that was taken. In addition, one of the main rationales for “blending” the two
projects was to offset the additional costs of purchasing and managing five new parks
under the ABC Project of high conservation value by linking it to the APN-implemented
component of the NFPA Project increasing tourism and revenues in four selected
National Parks in Patagonia. This cross-subsidy would have been clearer if that
connection had been made within the same project instead of across two separate
projects. This approach would have also allowed APN to merge all project activities
under a single project implementation unit.

Efficacy
NFPA Project

5.16 The NFPA Project achieved high ratings for two of the four development
objectives: (DO#2: “Facilitate the development of an incentive and regulatory framework
to encourage decision-makers to more fully internalize the social costs and benefits of
native forests,” and DO#4: “Increase the environmentally sustainable level of tourism in
four selected National Parks”). The first project objective (DO#1: “Assist SAyDS in
prioritizing its proposed actions dealing with native forests”) was substantially achieved,
and the achievement of the third objective (DO#3: “Develop a plan to transform APN
into a world-class parks administration was rated as modest.
                                             30


ABC Project

5.17 The ABC Project substantially achieved both of its two specific objectives. First,
it succeeded in expanding and diversifying the protected areas system to include some of
the most threatened and under-represented ecoregions in the country. It prioritized
Argentina‟s ecoregions in a scientifically defensible way, and used internationally
accepted selection methods, criteria and protocols. There were some concerns raised with
the decision to drop the Los Venados Protected Area, a large site of roughly 130,000
hectares located in the highly threatened Pampas ecoregion of Argentina, and replace it
with the 18,000 hectare Mburucuyá National Park in the humid Chaco ecoregion. This
change occurred very late in the project and complicated the implementation of sub-
projects in adjacent buffer zones and the establishment of effective community
coordination committees under the second project objective.

5.18 In terms of creating the necessary conditions for the parks‟ sustainable
management through investments to strengthen APN‟s management capabilities,
supporting sustainable land-use activities in park buffer zones, using refined mechanisms
of consultation and participation, and improving access to biodiversity information
management, the project substantially achieved this objective on all four counts. All
targets for infrastructure works, scientific baseline studies, monitoring programs, and
management plans at each of the five newly created National Parks were met or
exceeded, and the park management plans were well prepared and utilized by APN staff
at the parks visited. Alternative productive activities were undertaken with local
communities and families living near or within the parks that substantially exceeded their
targets, but there was anecdotal evidence that many of these activities at the parks visited
had since been abandoned due to lack of funding to provide follow-up initiatives as well
as lack of interest among local families to continue them. Targets for establishing
consultative committees at the five parks were also met, and the number of consultation
meetings held to present technical studies and management plans was four times greater
than expected, indicating a high degree of stakeholder consultation and participation.
Finally, access to biodiversity information was improved significantly with the creation
of the BIS website and the use of “roving” specialists from APN‟s four regional technical
offices.

EFFICIENCY

NFPA Project

5.19 An economic analysis (economic rate of return) for the project as a whole was not
conducted during project appraisal since the economic benefits derived from these types
of activities (such as creating the first national forest inventory, passing a new forestry
law and regulations, or conducting applied field research studies) are not readily
quantifiable in economic terms. At project closure, an economic analysis was carried out
for the first two project components dealing with native forests, and the third component
to transform and modernize APN. A financial analysis was conducted ex-post of the last
component of the project to improve the management and tourist facilities and
infrastructure within the four parks in Patagonia. Actual cost data was compared to
estimated values generated at appraisal to evaluate their efficiency.
                                                31


5.20 The efficiency of the first component of the project involved three separate
activities. The first of these to develop the policy, legal and regulatory framework for the
new forestry law and implementing regulations was budgeted at US $900,000 during
appraisal, but actually cost US $1.25 million, nearly 40 percent more than estimated, and
took longer to achieve than originally estimated (passed toward the end of 2007).
However, it achieved its objective.

5.21 The second subcomponent to prepare the first National Forest Inventory and
database management and GIS mapping systems also took longer than expected as the
Forest Inventory was not completed until two-and-a-half years after it was projected (end
of 2005 instead of mid-2002). The cost of developing the inventory and all of the
accompanying technical and educational documents, maps and atlases was slightly less
(93%) than estimated at appraisal. It also achieved it objective.

5.22 Finally, the third subcomponent consisted of conducting applied research studies
of various productive land-use practices that are compatible with forest conservation and
restoration. It was one of the few project activities that did not meet its target, completing
5 out of 6 sub-projects and 31 out of 39 demonstration sites. It only disbursed one-third
of its appraised budget of US $5 million. This was partly due to the economic crisis and
the devaluation of the Argentina Peso, which resulted in lower costs (e.g., training, labor
and local materials). However, it was mostly due to the slow start of the project, the
difficulty of finding adequate local technical expertise to conduct the studies, and the
difficulty of reaching agreements on long-term monitoring programs with willing private
property owners. An internal evaluation of the PIARFON program conducted by
SAyDS28 in 2010 was quite critical of the execution of the program and found that
follow-up monitoring efforts at many of the pilot projects had not been continued after
project funding ceased. It found that replication and dissemination of the results of these
alternative land-uses had not occurred as much as expected because credible time-series
data of the sub-project‟s actual economic, environmental and social results had not been
maintained. It stated that this was needed in order to have the desired demonstration
effect and persuade other land-owners to adopt more compatible land-use practices on a
large scale.

5.23 Under the second project component (Protected Areas), actual expenditures to
transform APN into a world-class parks organization were 76 percent higher than
appraised (US $1.41 million disbursed vs. $800,000 estimated), even though the
objective was only modestly achieved. Six of the nine indicator targets for this
component were met or exceeded, two were reprogrammed, and only one was not met.
These targets were achieved with 85% of budgeted project funds having been disbursed.
The financial analysis conducted at the close of the project to increase the level of
environmentally sustainable tourism at four selected National Parks in Patagonia was
consistent with the estimates generated during the appraisal of the project. The financial
internal rates of return (FIRR) calculated for the four parks are listed in the table below.

Source: ICR for NFPA Project, pp. 23 and 38, December 28, 2007.

5.24      Figures obtained directly from several of the parks and APN staff during the
assessment mission showed that the actual increases in paid tourist visits to the parks was
much higher than estimated with the exception of Nahual Huapi National Park, which
still nearly doubled the number of tourist visits over this period from 162,550 visitors in
1997 to nearly 315,000 in 2006. In 2010, park staff indicated that approximately 350,000
visitors had paid to visit the park.

5.25 The other three parks visited during the assessment mission also showed paid
tourist visits rates had increased substantially more than estimated. Lanín National Park
experienced a 14-fold growth rate in terms of paid tourist visits increasing from under
20,000 in 1997 to nearly 280,000 in 2006. Paid tourist visits to Los Alerces National
Park more than tripled between 1997 and 2006 from 37,000 to nearly 130,000 paid
visitors, and number of paid visitors to Los Glaciares National Park increased more than
5-fold over this period with a much higher than expected increase in revenues (actual
FIRR of 57% vs. expected 11% at appraisal) collected on-site by APN staff due to much
better control of the limited number of entrances to the park. Total revenues generated by
the four select parks rose to more than $27 million Argentine pesos in 2010, representing
more than 50 percent of total revenues at all of the parks and reserves of SINAP
compared to 35 percent in 2000.

5.26 However, it is not possible to ascertain what percentage of this increase in park
visitors and increased revenues were attributable to project investments to improve tourist
facilities and concession services apart from the overall increase in outdoor tourism
worldwide or the effects of the devaluation of the Argentine peso. For example, the level
of park visits dropped off noticeably during the Argentine economic crisis of 2001-2003
and the worldwide financial crisis of 2007 before rebounding in subsequent years.

5.27 Overall, the project achieved three of its four development objectives to a
substantial or high degree within the project timeframe (given the two year extension
granted by the Bank) at 69 percent of the total estimated project cost (US $20.8 million
vs. $30 million) and 81 percent of the estimated financing amount (US $15.8 million vs.
$19.5 million). Therefore, the overall efficiency of the project is rated as substantial.

ABC PROJECT

5.28 There was no economic and financial analysis carried out for the ABC Project
during project appraisal due to the project‟s focus on biodiversity conservation. The five
new parks had limited tourism potential, compared to the parks selected in the NFPA
Project. The ICR stated that, “Because of the wide range of situations, there are no global
standards that can be used to measure the efficiency of the project.”29 IEG agrees with
this statement having been unable to encounter any figures on the costs to establish
protected areas that were reliable or comparable.

5.29 Therefore, in the absence of any viable external comparators, the efficiency rating
is based upon an analysis about how efficiently what was promised in the original project
document was consistent with what was delivered by the close of the project. The first
objective of the project was to establish five new national parks, which was achieved
with cost savings of US $744,000 less than was anticipated at appraisal to purchase the
five provincial parcels. The government purchased the five parcels totaling 396,000
hectares for US $5.7 million.

5.30 The second objective of the ABC Project was to “create the conditions for their
sustainable management.” A logical and well-planned sequence of steps leading to the
establishment of an effective protected area management regime was developed and used
to guide these activities in each one of the five newly created national parks.
Management plans for each park were prepared and investments in civil works, road
rehabilitation, park facilities, vehicles and equipment, local consultants, and even US
$3.5 million to cover operating costs for park personnel and operational and maintenance
costs were paid for by the project. Two of the five parks were visited during the IEG
assessment mission (Copo and Mburucuyá). Overall, the civil works and management
plan were well-done and appeared to be fully utilized. In terms of the two productive sub-
projects carried out with 16 families living within the park‟s boundaries and the four
training sub-projects on appropriate technologies and conservation practices with 71
families, the results were mixed with park rangers informing IEG of low participation and
lack of sustained implementation among the families. What was occurring was that
cattle-ranching activities within the park‟s boundaries have slowly and steadily been
decreasing, but that alternative livelihoods have not fully compensated them for lost
income. Finally, questions about the effectiveness and efficiency of having biological
monitoring activities carried out by APN park rangers at Copo with technical assistance
provided by a local university was mentioned in field interviews with staff.

5.31 In terms of Mburucuyá, the protracted process of replacing Los Venados with
Mburucuyá resulted in many project activities being rushed to completion before the
project closed 21 months later on March 31, 2008 in order to complete the civil works at
Mburucuyá. According to field interviews with APN staff at Mburucuyá, five of the eight
productive activity sub-projects in adjoining communities were unsuccessful or not
sustained due to inadequate time to properly involve the communities in their conception
and execution. However, in terms of both the management plan and civil works at
Mburucuyá, these appear to have been well-done and are being fully utilized. New

vehicles and equipment, such as fire-fighting gear and water tanks, as well as park
facilities, were impressive and well maintained. Some of the restoration and refurbishing
of the Pederson homestead and natural sciences laboratory was incomplete due to lack of
additional funding from APN to complete them. However, APN park staff was very
positive about the impact that project investments had had on improving their capabilities
to properly manage the park, and to protect and restore its natural and cultural assets.

5.32 Overall, the efficiency with which the five new parks were created and the
enabling conditions provided for their sustainable management was substantial. There
were some shortcomings with alternative productive activities introduced in park buffer
zones, but these were not critical elements of creating the enabling conditions for the
parks‟ sustained and effective management accounting for only 12 percent of actual
project costs. Overall, the results of project investments were directly related to achieving
its objectives with most targets being met or exceeded well within the cost envelope
estimated at appraisal.

OUTCOME

5.33 The relevance of objectives of the NFPA and ABC projects were both substantial
to the Bank‟s CPS and Argentina‟s “Development Vision.” In terms of the relevance of
design, the NFPA and ABC projects both presented clear causal links between inputs,
outputs and outcomes to achieve their objectives, and were rated substantial.

5.34 In terms of the efficacy of the NFPA Project, it achieved high ratings for two of
the four objectives, one substantial, and one modest rating. Its efficiency was rated as
substantial. Thus, combined with the substantial rating for relevance of objectives and
design, the overall outcome rating for the NFPA Project is satisfactory.

5.35 The efficacy of the ABC Project was rated as substantial for both of its project
objectives. The efficiency of the ABC Project was rated as substantial. Thus, combined
with the substantial rating for relevance of objectives and design, the overall outcome
rating for the ABC Project is satisfactory.

Risk to Development
5.36 The government now recognizes the need to control the continued clearing and
conversion of its remaining native forests, but has not yet been able to incorporate the
value of public goods and environmental services that they provide into the commercial
land values and land-use decisions made by private land-owners. According to APN staff
working in the Chaco ecoregion, land values are higher for parcels that have been cleared
than they are for unconverted native forests, and incomes from cattle-ranching and soy
bean production are several times higher than for any other land use options there. Initial
indications are that conversion of native forests to other productive land-uses has slowed
down since the passage of the new Forestry Law due to the one-year prohibition on
clearing native forests, and the existence of forestry land-use plans prohibiting clearing of
“very high” value native forests (“red areas”). The level of deforestation in the Chaco
ecoregion for 2008 (the last year for which such data are available) was 136,000 hectares
down significantly from a few years earlier of between 200,000 – 250,000 hectares per
year. However, there is not yet sufficient time-series data to determine if this downward
trend in deforestation and conversion will continue, and the fundamental economic price
signals have not changed to include considerations beyond private costs and benefits.
That depends upon whether the new native forest restoration fund and program can create
enough financial incentives to reduce further conversion to other productive land-use,
such as soy bean monoculture and cattle-ranching. Nor have the applied research studies
that were carried out under the project provided the time-series data regarding the
economic, social and environmental consequences of alternative, more compatible land-
use practices required to convince land-owners to adopt them on any appreciable scale.

5.37 Under the “Protected Areas” component of the NFPA Project, the government has
made increasing tourism to the National Parks system a priority, and an important
element of its new “Tourism 2016” strategic plan for sustainable tourism. Budgetary
support for each of the four selected parks included in the NFPA Project has grown
slightly or remained steady since the project closed in 2007. Coupled with increased
revenue from tourism and income generated from fees charged concessions to operate in
the parks, overall revenues have increased at these parks significantly as a percentage of
total SINAP revenues, and improved the overall finances of APN.

5.38 Thus, the risk is higher that the financial incentives offered under the new forest
conservation program and the regulatory prohibitions instituted by the government will
not be enough to off-set the powerful market price signals driving the conversion of
native forests to other productive land uses than it is for not maintaining the gains made
under the Protected Areas objectives. Thus, the overall risk to development rating for the
NFPA Project is moderate.

5.39 In terms of the risk to development of the ABC Project, the five new protected
areas that were incorporated into the national park system with project financial and
technical support were selected on the basis of their high conservation value, not their
tourism potential. Thus, there was no expectation on the government‟s part that they
would become financially self-sufficient. However, they were expected to generate some
income from entry fees by this time, which has not happened. While tourist visits have
continued to increase across the entire protected areas system since the ABC Project
                                             36


closed in 2008, operational budgets and staffing levels provided by APN have also
increased. This was true for both of the two parks visited in the Chaco ecoregion that
were supported by the project as well as the other non-project park visited at the same
time (Chaco National Park). The risk that the government will not continue to adequately
support the effective management of those parks is rated as negligible to low.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Systems
M&E DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND UTILIZATION

NFPA Project

5.40 The projects NFPA Project was prepared and appraised prior to the introduction
of the Results Framework that was later adopted by the Bank. Thus, the only information
available regarding the M&E system design was contained in two tables in Annex H
(Schedule of Monitorable Actions). This annex contained two tables describing
“performance indicators” associated with project components over a 6-year timeline to
indicate progress toward completion, and juxtaposing components and objectives with
“impact indicators” and the dates of their “impact initiation.” There was no clear causal
link articulated between project components and the achievement of objectives.
Performance indicators reflecting project activities and products were well defined with
dates for expected completion clearly specified.

5.41 However, several of the eight outcomes (“impact indicators”) were vaguely stated
and undefined in terms of evaluable targets while others resembled outputs more than
outcomes. For example, under the first component, the impact indicator was
“management of SRNyAH will be aware of, and committed to, draft legal proposals for
reform at the federal level,” and that a broader set of stakeholders including NGOs and
the private sector would have a “greatly enhanced knowledge concerning” a number of
native forest challenges and issues. During project implementation, a Results Framework
was prepared and populated with five Outcome Indicators and an unusually large number
(42) of Intermediate Outcome Indicators. The first four Outcome Indicators were all
identical to the Project‟s four objectives; the fifth objective Indicator to put in place an
efficient project implementation unit to manage the project was more administrative in
nature. The 42 Intermediate Outcome Indicators were divided into five groupings
logically sequenced according to their corresponding objectives.

5.42 Both APN and SAyDS collected monitoring data throughout the project cycle and
submitted semi-annual and annual progress reports for all indicators. Periodicity might
have been improved to produce quarterly reports had more funding been available to the
line agencies for this task, but this would have come at a high cost given the
exceptionally large number of indicators to track. The monitoring data collected by the
project implementation units was used as a key input to the Implementation Status
Reports that were submitted two to three times a year following Bank supervision
missions. Monitoring frequencies, coverage, and data collection arrangements were
considered to be satisfactory.
                                                     37


5.43 The information generated by the first National Forest Inventory proved to be
very useful in guiding the project through difficult periods. It provided critical feedback
needed to persuade Argentina‟s political leadership and high-level managers of the
importance of continuing to fund the project‟s activities when many other projects and
non-crisis expenditures were being drastically cut back or eliminated entirely. The
information helped the implementing agencies focus their attention and efforts toward
time-sequenced tasks, particularly during the post-crisis period, as the project ramped up
activities in the final few years of project implementation to achieve the targets and
milestones that had been revised in 2003.This was particularly true for completing the
infrastructure works under the “Protected Areas” objective of the project, which had a
series of three extensions for a total of 24 months contingent upon completing on-going
activities. Only infrastructure works either underway, or contracted out and projected to
be concluded within the next nine months could be included in the second extension, and
only the last four remaining infrastructure works that were scheduled to be finished
within the final three months of the last project extension were allowed. Overall, the
M&E system was well designed and implemented, and the information generated by it
was helpful to Bank project staff and implementing agencies to persuade senior
government official to continue supporting the projects‟ implementation. The overall
rating for M&E is substantial.

ABC Project

5.44 In contrast to the NFPA Project, the ABC Project contained indicators clearly
linking project activities and products to expected outputs and outcomes in Annex D
containing the “M&E Plan and Indicators.” Project components and objective were each
defined in terms of inputs, quantified targets for outputs, timelines for achieving them,
and expected outcomes or impacts. It lacked quantified values for outputs. There were
also 12 “Key Impact Indicators” describing the expected outcomes to be achieved under
each project objective with the “source of data and means of measuring performance
indicators” and the dates for their completion. These 12 impact indicators were later
reduced by two indicators in an amendment to the grant agreement, and converted into
the 10 Outcome Indicators (along with 23 Intermediate Outcome Indicators) of the
Results Framework.30 However, in most cases, the target values for the Outcome
Indicators were not useful in terms of their evaluability. For example, many of them used
phrases such as “increased…” or “decreased…” to describe a change in state of a given
indicator, but did not quantify the degree of change to be achieved in order to be
considered successfully accomplished. Without measurable and meaningful indicators,
the “Actual Value Achieved at Completion” did not provide enough of a context to
evaluate it. The comprehensive set of nearly two dozen Intermediate Outcome Indicators
did not include any time-series measures of native forest cover, or trends in requests from
30
   The “Key Impact Indicator” for “Social organization of affected families maintained or improved” that
was developed as part of the Mitigation Plan was dropped since it added little value to other indicators that
sufficiently covered measures of social impact. The indicator for “Development of a more extensive BIS
determined through the creation and integration of additional information nodes” was also formally
dropped in 2005 since it was considered “unnecessary” once the four regional nodes had been established
in each one of the Regional Technical Delegation offices. Expansion of the BIS network through increased
functionality, technological improvements, and additional links to other national and international networks
was considered more advantageous than the physical establishment of additional sites or nodes.
                                            38


private land-owners requesting permits to clear native forests from provincial authorities,
which would have provided valuable information regarding whether the project was
having any appreciable effect in slowing down the rate of deforestation or conversion to
other land-uses.

5.45 For the ABC Project, a distinction needs to be made between the Monitoring and
Evaluation Plan (M&E) for the overall project, including specific monitoring and
reporting activities funded under Component C (Project Management, Monitoring and
Evaluation); and monitoring activities carried out for each of the five protected areas of
the project. Institutional responsibilities for implementing and supervising the project-
wide M&E plan were vested with APN‟s Administration Directorate and included
meeting the Bank‟s fiduciary requirements, including a full and transparent accounting of
project funds, preparing procurement contracts and disbursement requests, and producing
the necessary documentation required by the Bank‟s auditing systems. Project
management and M&E activities at the field level (that is, at each one of the five
protected areas) included collecting baseline ecological information and socioeconomic
surveys of affected families living within the parks and nearby communities as well as
other interested parties and stakeholders. These activities were conducted jointly by
central APN staff and consultants along with APN park staff and superintendents. All of
these activities involved a high level of public participation and empowerment in
decision-making processes.

5.46 During field visits, reported measurements were verified by supervision staff.
This evaluation mission confirmed that most indicators were satisfactorily monitored
without difficulty. The indicator species approach taken by the project turned out to be
more problematic than anticipated. A satellite-based earth monitoring remote sensing
approach coupled with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial mapping software
packages may have proven to be a more effective and cost-efficient approach than
counting on under-trained park guards to monitor species-level indicators of biodiversity
during field surveillance patrols. Satellite imagery might have been complemented by
aerial photography and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technologies that are
increasingly prevalent and affordable. Nevertheless, biodiversity monitoring programs of
indicators species were established in all of the new protected areas, and the monitoring
protocols were finalized by project closing at four of the five new parks (Quebrada del
Condorito, San Guillermo, Copo and Monte Leon National Parks). The monitoring
program at the last new protected area (Mburucuyá Protected Area) was being
implemented at the time of the assessment mission.

5.47 The information generated by the M&E system was very useful to the Bank‟s
project team and the implementing agencies to guide the project through difficult periods.
It provided critical feedback needed to persuade Argentina‟s political leadership and
high-level managers of the importance of continuing to fund the project‟s activities when
many other projects and non-crisis expenditures were being drastically cut back or
eliminated entirely. The knowledge gained through the new biodiversity information
system has helped government agencies and NGOs understand the diversity species
living in different natural habitats of the country, and has generated information that has
focused park management plans to the main threats to key species.
                                             39


5.48 Thus, the M&E system for the ABC Project was well designed and implemented.
The information generated by it has built a better knowledge base of the country‟s natural
habitats and biodiversity. The overall M&E rating is substantial.

Bank Performance
NFPA PROJECT

Quality at Entry

5.49 The Bank‟s performance in preparing and appraising the NFPA Project was
moderately satisfactory. The Argentina Forestry Sector Study of 1993 informed much
of the design of the NFPA Project in addressing many of the institutional deficiencies,
informational and knowledge gaps, and policy constraints existing in the sector at that
time. Basing the design of the project on Bank economic sector work was one of the main
recommendations made subsequently by the Bank‟s Forest Strategy in 2002, which found
that this had been one of the main shortcomings experienced in the sector during the
preceding decade. The NFPA Project was one of the few exceptions where this had been
done. The Bank also identified the project‟s risks accurately and proposed a number of
mitigation measures, focusing on the institutional weaknesses present in the
implementing agency at that time (SRNyAH). On the “Native Forests” side of the
project, Bank staff realized that a technically credible information base was lacking with
regard to the location, types, and extent of the country‟s forests, which did not exist prior
to this point. So, they designed a project component to build the technical capacity within
SAyDS by creating a new unit charged with the task of designing and conducting the first
national forest inventory. On the “Protected Areas” side of the project, the Bank also
focused its efforts to strengthen the management capabilities of APN and improve
tourism infrastructure at four selected national parks in Patagonia to boost park-generated
revenues.

5.50 However, several shortcomings were later discovered that occurred prior to
project implementation that could have been avoided. For example, the Bank
underestimated the complexity and sequential nature of implementing several activities
under the project. For example, the initial timeline for a draft legislative reform bill to be
passed was three years (by the end of 2000), but the bill did not pass until nearly seven
years later. The timeline for this indicator was overly ambitious given the political
constraints and the fact that its achievement depended on the sequencing of other input
products (e.g., the Forest Inventory) and processes to occur first. This should have been
anticipated. Also, SRNyAH was widely perceived to be inefficient and lacking
professional leadership at the time of appraisal, and was soon caught up in a corruption
scandal that led to the dissolution of the agency, the forced resignation of its minister, and
the eventual relocation of APN to the Secretariat of Tourism. This resulted in the slow
start-up of the APN-implemented project components addressing protected areas. The
Bank should have taken greater precautions to mitigate these institutional risks at entry.
                                             40


Project Supervision

5.51 During project implementation, the Bank project team developed a strong
collaborative relationship with the Borrower and implementing agencies that was
instrumental in the project‟s continuation during the economic crisis years. For example,
to mitigate the effects of the economic crisis on the borrower‟s ability to provide
counterpart funds, the Bank project staff modified the loan agreement to increase the
percentage of the IBRD loan that could be disbursed for a number of line items. This
greatly eased the financial burden on the borrower, sped up disbursements soon
thereafter, and took advantage of an Argentine tax exemption for goods and services
provided by international donors. These changes were very successful in restarting the
project‟s activities and making up for lost time in the latter half of the project following
the crisis.

5.52 Key Bank project staff changed only once during the entire project. The project
team‟s experience and technical knowledge contributed substantially to the success of the
project. For instance, nearly 240 LANDSAT satellite images covering the entire
landmass of Argentina for the forest inventory were obtained from the Global Land
Cover Facility at the University of Maryland by the project team free of charge.
Supervision missions were carried out two times a year on average with 27 supervision
missions in all for the NFPA Project, four of which were purely fiduciary in nature.
During the three years of the economic crisis and immediately afterwards between 2002
and 2004, there were more frequent supervision missions, indicating a heightened level of
oversight and collaboration with the implementing agencies and borrower. During the
crisis, the largest contract (to prepare the first national forest inventory) was jeopardized
when two parties of a three firm consortium threatened to abandon the contract. The
Bank project team worked with the Country Lawyer and Lead Procurement Specialist in
the Region and their counterparts within SAyDS for several months, finally reaching an
agreement with the government on acceptable terms for re-initiating work and
completing the contract. Bank supervision is rated satisfactory.

5.53 Overall, the Bank‟s performance for the NFPA Project is rated as moderately
satisfactory.

ABC PROJECT

Quality at Entry

5.54 The Bank‟s performance at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. Good
technical work was carried out in preparing the project for Board appraisal, but
insufficient care in mitigating institutional risks within SRNyAH resulted in a number of
unnecessary implementation problems and delays. During the preparation of the ABC
Project, the Bank conducted an analysis of 32 candidate sites located in nine under-
represented but highly threatened ecoregions of Argentina to prioritize five protected
areas for inclusion in the protected areas system in close collaboration with APN and
other Argentine biodiversity experts. The candidate sites were evaluated on the basis of a
number of scientific, legal viability, financial readiness, and community acceptability
criteria. Four of the five candidate sites were designated as National Parks by both
                                             41


provincial and federal law, and are being actively managed and protected adequately by
APN today. An alternative protected area (Mburucuyá) was substituted for the fifth site
originally selected (Los Venados). The Bank insisted on and appraised the environmental
and social assessments conducted by APN with strong representation and participation of
local affected communities and stakeholders to ensure that they met Bank safeguard
standards.

5.55 The Bank also appraised environmental and social assessments incorporating
participatory consultation processes, and the Public Participation Plan that supported
project activities within the five parks to ensure that the sub-projects in the buffer zones
were demand-driven, and that any adverse environmental or social impacts caused by the
project would be mitigated. However, like the NFPA Project, the Bank should have taken
greater precautions to mitigate the institutional risks associated with the implementing
agency (APN). The resulting problems caused the project to get off to a slow start and
subsequently required an amendment to the grant agreement to create a second project
implementation unit to be set up for APN.

Project Supervision

5.56 The Bank project team conducted 25 missions over the 10 years of the project‟s
implementation with multi-disciplinary teams of specialists participating in supervision
missions. Like the NFPA Project, the ABC Project was adversely affected by the
economic crisis and had to be extended by 21 months to complete several of the applied
research studies, pilot alternative livelihood demonstration projects in park buffer zones,
and finish infrastructure works in Mburucuyá National Park. The Bank project team did
an excellent job of working with APN to persuade senior government officials to
continue providing project counterpart funds to support the project, and providing the
staff and resources to effectively manage the five new national parks.

5.57 Time was lost between when the government could not make the final payment of
US $830,000 to the provincial government of San Luis to purchase the fifth provincial
park (Los Venados Area Protegido) in June 2001 and September of 2004 when APN
proposed a set of five candidate sites to replace Los Venados to the Bank. Eventually, on
June 26, 2006, Mburucuyá Provincial Park was included as the fifth protected area to be
added to the ABC Project. The Bank might have been more proactive in encouraging the
government to propose an alternative site since this five-year gap left less than two years
to complete all of the enabling activities to introduce sustainable activities in buffer
zones, strengthen the staff‟s capabilities, equipment, and facilities, conduct baseline
studies and prepare management plans, and establish community consultative
committees. In the end, this was insufficient as the project was pinched more by time
than by resources. However, the infrastructure and management improvements made as a
result of the project and supervised by the Bank‟s project staff provided important inputs
to effectively managing the parks and protecting their natural and cultural resources. And
the Bank‟s persistence and success in persuading the government to continue supporting
the project was essential to its ultimate success. Thus, the overall rating for the Bank‟s
quality of supervision is satisfactory. The Bank‟s overall performance rating for the
ABC Project is moderately satisfactory.
                                             42


BORROWER PERFORMANCE

NFPA PROJECT

Government

5.58 The performance of the government is rated as highly satisfactory because it
continued to support the implementation of the project through a severe two year
economic crisis. The government passed landmark legislation, the new Forestry Law and
Fund (Law 26.551) in 2007, creating a native forest conservation fund and national
program to finance projects in accredited provinces that conserve or restore native forests
for the first time. That law and its ministerial enabling regulations are now being
implemented by SAyDS, and funding levels have been increasing since its inception in
2010. The government also proposed “blending” the financial instruments used for the
two projects so that the revenue-enhancing component of the NFPA Project in four of the
most visited parks in the system would help offset some of the additional administrative
costs of managing the five new parks created under the ABC Project.

Implementing Agencies

      SAyDS

5.59 The National Directorate for Forests within SAyDS was responsible for
implementing the first two components of the NFPA Project. It fully achieved the first
two specific objectives of the project dealing with native forests. First of all, the First
National Forestry Inventory and statistical database were essential in terms of identifying
those native forests under the greatest threats for each of the six main forest types in
Argentina. The unit (UMSEF) within SAyDS that is responsible for updating and
improving the national forestry inventory is still functional. The unit and staff costs have
now been completely absorbed by the National Directorate for Forests, although its
capabilities have been diluted in the past two years as resources have been drawn away
from UMSEF by SAyDS‟s need to process provincial accreditation requests and
individual project proposals for funding under the new Forestry Law and Fund. UMSEF
staff levels are expected to return to normal once the portion of that fund (10 percent) that
is set aside to cover SAyDS‟s costs to manage the program are allocated.

5.60 Secondly, the new Native Forests Law and Fund have begun the process of
altering the incentive structures, subsidies and government policies that have been driving
the conversion of Argentina‟s remaining native forests to cattle-ranching activities and
agricultural production. SAyDS realized that any PES scheme should be based upon
having adequate and appropriate native forest policies and regulations at the provincial
level. They insisted that the new Forestry Law and Fund require provinces to submit
provincial forested area land-use plans for their accreditation by SAyDS to ensure that
they are consistent with the national forest inventory‟s three classifications for different
uses of native forests before grants from the Forestry Fund can be provided for
conservation and restoration activities. Thus far, 11 provinces have been accredited by
SAyDS. There are now more than 110 projects have received financial support of
appropriately US $75 million from the fund. Three more provinces are nearing
                                            43


accreditation presently, and the Forestry Fund is expected to increase by 3 – 5 fold over
the next few years once the new National Program of Native Forests Protection becomes
fully operational. The performance of SAyDS in achieving both of the first two
objectives was highly satisfactory.

      APN

5.61 APN was responsible for implementing the last two objectives and components of
the NFPA Project. The plan to transform APN into a world-class parks organization had
only a modest impact, but the second objective of increasing the level of environmentally
sustainable tourism at four National Parks was achieved. APN‟s performance under the
NFPA Project was marred by managerial problems involving institutional instability,
frequent turnover of APN Presidents and Project Coordinators, noticeable differences in
strategic focus between headquarters and field staff, and procurement and disbursement
delays related to having a shared project implementation unit in SRNyAH until a separate
unit for APN was established in 2003. Its performance was rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

5.62 On balance, implementing agency performance is rated moderately satisfactory
and in line with harmonized evaluation criteria, overall borrower performance is
moderately satisfactory.

ABC PROJECT

Government

5.63 The government demonstrated its commitment to the ABC Project by increasing
the park system‟s representation of several under-represented ecoregions within SINAP
with the full knowledge that these parks do not possess the characteristics necessary to
make them financial self-supporting. It met all of its financial obligations by increasing
staffing and fiscal support for APN in order to create and manage the five new parks, and
has maintained that support and the special unit within APN (UCEFE) to manage donor-
assisted natural resource management projects. The government also approved the new
federal laws required to create each new national park in the system of protected areas, as
did the provincial governments in transferring their management over to APN. Given that
all this occurred during a severe economic crisis, the government‟s performance is thus
rated highly satisfactory.

Implementing Agency

5.64 Under the ABC Project, APN established five new parks that extended the
protection and management of biodiversity in some of Argentina‟s most important,
threatened, and under-represented ecoregions. The second objective to create the
conditions for their sustainable management was also substantially achieved by APN.
Promoting active public participation in the planning and management of protected areas
was recognized by APN as a critical factor in building successful conservation programs
and park management plans. Consultative commissions were formed at each one of the
new parks to represent the interests and concerns of interested and affected local parties,
                                             44


families, and communities in decisions involving park operations and management.
Mitigation plans were prepared in each park to minimize the negative impacts on those
families already living in the areas designated as parks who were allowed to remain in the
parks under certain conditions of gradually shifting to more compatible land-uses and
practices, as well as local communities affected by the creation of the parks. The legal
requirements to pass the provincial protected areas over to the authority of the federal
government and APN‟s management were met, and the park staff and resources required
to manage and protect them was adequately provided. However, like the NFPA Project,
organizational instability, frequent changes in ministry and project leadership, and
different perspectives between field and headquarter APN managers adversely affected
project implementation. Thus, APN‟s performance under the ABC Project is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

5.65 Combining the ratings for the government and the implementing agency, the
overall rating for the borrower‟s performance is satisfactory.



6. Lessons Learned
6.1    There were four lessons learned from these two projects involving the adoption of
technological advances to monitor rapidly changing environmental conditions, the
blending of financial instruments to cross-subsidize different project objectives, the risks
and uncertainties of experimenting with innovative land-use practices, and the
importance of having well-defined and focused objectives.

6.2     The Bank should encourage natural resource project managers to take
advantage of rapidly changing advances in biodiversity conservation methods and
tools to complement traditional on-the-ground monitoring of indicator species
surveys. These include satellite imagery and aerial photographs of habitat vegetation
cover, or real-time remote monitoring devices and camera traps when conservation of
specific species is the objective. The ABC Project took an approach to biodiversity
monitoring that focused on surveys of “key indicator species” in each of the five parks
established by the project. This approach turned out to be more problematic than
anticipated, generating information of poor quality and reliability. Taking advantage of
recent technological advances and falling costs of these new tools might result in
technically complementary and cost-effective ways to assess key habitat and species. The
costs involved in monitoring changing conditions over time will depend on the project
objective, but whatever approach is taken should aim to provide information that is
relevant for decision-making.

6.3      Satellite imagery complemented by aerial photography and light detection and
ranging (LiDAR) technologies or pre-positioned camera traps are becoming increasingly
prevalent and affordable for landscape conservation planning and management. In rapidly
changing environments where a new dirt road or airstrip can open up access to illegal
activities in large, remote natural areas with little government presence, the Bank should
provide more support to project managers to work with implementing agencies and other
partners to take advantage of these new technologies to obtain more accurate and real-
                                            45


time monitoring data. Over the past 20 years, a number of second-tier institutions such as
NGOs and universities have developed very sophisticated conservation management
approaches, tools, and technologies to locate and quantify species diversity and measure
effective habitat management. For instance, the World Bank and WWF have developed a
Monitoring Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) that allows project participants and
managers to quickly and accurately assess the quality of perceived interventions among
project beneficiaries and other stakeholders. This tool is now commonly used by GEF
financed projects as a simple and cost-effective means to gauge the degree of effective
management across a range of issues in protected areas.

6.4     Blending different lending instruments, such as IBRD loans with GEF
grants, to achieve different forestry or natural resource management objectives can
be an effective way to engage clients in addressing the full range of sector challenges
they face. For example, the decision to use an IBRD loan to help Argentina increase park
system revenues under the NFPA Project while preserving ecoregions of global
significance under the ABC Project justified the use of a GEF grant. It was unlikely that
the government would have agreed to pay the start-up costs of these new parks without
GEF support given their low tourism potential. In terms of financing projects with both
global and national benefits, blended packages of financial support can create the right
combination of incentives needed to engage clients in a full discussion of their national
forest objectives for both productive and conservation purposes.

6.5     When experimenting with new techniques or approaches to land-use
practices or natural resource management, it is best to approach experimental
interventions in a measured way assuming that unexpected difficulties, costs, and
delays will inevitably arise. The NFPA Project conducted applied research projects on
compatible land-use practices in productive landscapes while the ABC Project introduced
alternative, less destructive productive activities in park buffer zones. Both took more
time and effort to accomplish than expected, and results were mixed. This should be
expected given the uncertainty and risk perceived by those considering adopting
innovative approaches. Changing practices is not a linear or smooth process, and it
requires addressing all of the incentives and concerns of the intended end-users.

6.6    For example, the Applied Research and Studies program under the NFPA Project
was designed to generate a number of case studies demonstrating the costs and benefits
of mixed cattle-ranching and agro-forestry practices that are more compatible with
maintaining the environmental services associated with native forests in collaboration
with local land-owners. Identifying capable local NGOs, universities, and government
agencies to collaborate with the project in carrying out these demonstration pilots proved
to be more difficult and time-consuming than expected. Secondly, land-owners were risk-
adverse and not as willing to experiment with novel approaches to land-use management
as expected without project funding to reduce their financial risk. The results from the
demonstration sites were mixed and have not been replicated on a large scale for a
number of reasons. One of the reasons for the lack of replication among other land-
owners was that the analysis conducted at the demonstration sites focused mostly on the
environmental costs and benefits of the alternatives, but did not focus enough on the
economic and social aspects (that is, the costs, benefits, and risks) to the land-owners of
                                             46


changing commonly used practices. It is critical to take this into account when promoting
novel approaches or methods that bear directly on peoples‟ livelihoods.

6.7     A similar experience was encountered with the sub-projects to promote
sustainable productive activities in buffer zones around the new parks established by the
ABC Project. These sub-projects experienced many delays and setbacks, and did not
uniformly achieve the lasting changes that were sought. Some of the productive activities
that were introduced to local families by project facilitators were successful and
sustained; many others were not. This should be expected since experimentation involves
failing some of the time. Because results are difficult to predict upfront, achieving
quantified targets can be problematic. These risks should be carefully assessed and
mitigated in project design and appraisal.

6.8      The more focused an objective or target audience is defined, the more likely
it is to be achieved. For example, one objective of the NFPA Project was to “increase
the environmentally sustainable level of tourism in four selected national parks.”
Increasing tourist visits and the revenues generated by them in those four parks was
achieved by improving the capacity of APN to manage and protect those parks, and by
enhancing the experiences of visitors‟ by improving infrastructure and concession
services in the parks. Related to this lesson was the observation that more tangible and
measurable activities, such as “mortar and bricks” types of infrastructure interventions,
were more often achieved than were the “softer” institutional-strengthening or behavior-
changing activities in both projects. It is harder to change organizational cultures or
individuals‟ behaviors than it is to get them to change specific analytic techniques or to
modernize facilities and equipment. The more an intervention can focus on a specific
client or place, the more likely it is to be successful. For instance, it was found that the
management plans developed for the five individual parks under the ABC Project were
better utilized in setting up the management of those parks than the system-wide strategic
plan to modernize APN by creating a “Vision for a Reformed APN” under the NFPA
Project.

Comments from the Borrower (English translation)

                                                               Buenos Aires, June 16, 2011

Dear Monica Huppi:

     I have the pleasure to write to you in relation to the Project Performance Assessment
Report (PPAR), conducted by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), for the Native
Forests and Protected Areas Project (Loan No. 4085) and for the Biodiversity Conservation
Project (Grant TF -28372).

   In this regard, I will list some comments that this Administration has regarding this
PPAR. We understand that the full reality could not be fully reflected in this report, probably
because of the inability to perform a more detailed review due to the short timeframe of the
visit. Our observations are as follows:
       • Cover: the identification number of the Native Forest and Protected Areas Project
           is 4085.
       • Page vii, Key Staff, the teams at appraisal and at ICR are reversed.
       • Page xiii: it is mentioned that for Loan 4085 the performance of the implementing
           agency (Administración de Parques Nacionales or APN) was weaker, but this
           Administration has put its full commitment to achieve the project‟s goals, so I do
           not know the reasons that would lead IEG to reach this conclusion.
       • Paragraph 4.15/17: One of the project‟s four development objectives was to
           develop a plan for transforming APN into a world class organization managing
           Protected Areas (as detailed in the third paragraph on page xi). This was not
           completed (the transformation) as expressed in paragraph 4.15. However, the plan
           was formulated and approved by resolution 074 of the Honorable Board in 2007.
       • 4.16 When APN became incorporated into the Ministry of Tourism, technical
           teams from both organizations worked together for the elaboration of Federal
           Strategic Plan for the Tourism Sector (PFETS). This document serves as the
           Ministry‟s strategic plan at a national level, but APN has developed its own
           regional, local, and individual park level plans.
       • Paragraph 4.19: Law 22.351, which governs this Administration‟s implementation,
           prescribes the requirements, precautions and assessments necessary that all works
           or visitor services are subjected to in order to prevent and / or minimize damage to
           any natural, cultural or historic attribute that the protected areas may possess.
       • Paragraphs 4.22 and 4.26: On these two points, it is true that you cannot measure
           the results, but neither can you infer them, since they contributed to the significant
           growth that are expressed in the figures available.
       • Paragraph 4.27: Los Glaciares National Park is not located on the Atlantic coast
           but in the Cordillera de los Andes (Andes Mountains).
                                       57                                  ANNEX D


•   Paragraph 4.36/4.37: Mburucuyá National Park (found mainly in the humid Chaco
    ecosystem as a globally important and insufficiently protected national park) was
    proposed to replace Los Venados Provincial Protected Area, given the
    impossibility of acquiring the Estancia San Nicolas (i.e., Los Venados).
    Mburucuyá National Park represents three different ecoregions, including
    grasslands, unlike those cited by IEG (Puerto Peninsula and Los Cardones, situated
    in the provinces of Misiones and Salta, respectively, which represent other
    ecosystems), as well as by the opportunity that this presented since it had already
    been legally created [as a national park] in 2002. It should also be mentioned that
    the analysis of five possible areas and the selected proposal was evaluated and
    approved timely by World Bank specialists, including the lead ecologist George
    Ledec.
•   Paragraph 4.38: The sustainable development activities in the buffer zone of
    Mburucuyá National Park were made through a promoter, as in the other protected
    areas of the project, who were initially hired by the project and were then
    incorporated into the APN staff and who carried out their activities in the park's
    facilities, so no work was done directly with the organizations as stated.
    Unfortunately, APN staff members who participated in these tasks are conducting
    their activities in other protected areas so they could not be interviewed by the
    evaluator, who also didn‟t contact the staff from the Community Consultative
    Committee to get their view of sustainable development subprojects executed not
    only in the Mburucuya Park but also in other protected areas involved [in the
    project]. It‟s also worth mentioning that the distances and isolation of the
    populations in these areas is common because of their own characteristics and that
    they shouldn‟t be an impediment to select them when developing a subproject.
    Also the designation of Mburucuyá as a National Park was prior to its
    incorporation to the project.
•   Paragraph 4.43: APN has advisory committees / local advisors as a participation
    mechanism in the protected areas. The Community Consultative Committee (Mesa
    Socio Territorial) linked to Chaco National Park was originally conceived as an
    initiative of the Agricultural Social Program of the Secretary of Agriculture with
    small producers‟ organizations in the area. APN joined [this group] later, with
    participation and support, through Chaco National Park and staff of the
    Consultative Committee, in addition to other government institutions and NGOs.
    The dynamics of this coordination and consultation mechanism is interesting and
    should be noted that the context of each protected area, which usually has its own
    characteristics as well as the situation with other institutions. [Therefore, it is not
    possible] to assume if one model is better than other to be replicated.
    Moreover, the Rural Housing Project that is mentioned in paragraph 4.42 was
    submitted to the [afore] mentioned committee by stakeholders, and then by the
    committee to the provincial authorities, which, once approved, allocated the funds
    to the parties concerned. This means that the participation of the staff of Chaco
    National Park is in the committee and not in the implementation of the project
    itself.
•   Paragraph 5.11: It should be noted that the methodology used for the selection of
    ecosystems to be protected by the GEF Project 28372, aimed at under-represented
ANNEX D

           and highly threatened ecosystems of global importance. This methodology didn‟t
           consider the proximity or connectivity between them, since the different
           ecosystems are in different latitudes of the Republic of Argentina, nor was it a
           requirement the presence of native forest that is representative of only some of
           them.
     •     Although the criteria used was as mentioned, it made [it] possible to identify
           specific needs, giving origin to the request for a new GEF grant, which involves
           the Chaco and the coastal corridor, and takes into account connectivity [between
           protected areas] and involves actions taking into account the protected area and the
           different actors involved (municipalities, provinces, nation and private).
     •     Paragraph 5.32/5.33: The budget estimated by the World Conservation Monitoring
           Centre (WCMC) is for the management of protected areas and not for the creation
           and establishment of the areas.
     •     Paragraph 5.52/5.53: It is important to highlight the support and collaboration that
           this Administration has had from the task manager, Robert Davis, as well as from
           the rest of the World Bank team, in both the period of crisis in our country as [well
           as] during the rest of the implementation.
     •     Paragraph 5.62/5.65: It is worth mentioning that the activities of both projects were
           consulted and approved promptly by the different levels of responsibility of this
           Administration, whether it refers to the staff performing their activities in the
           protected areas, to the different directorates or to the members the Honorable
           Board. This is reflected in the methodology of work that required formal approval
           of the line units involved to advance to the Board of Directors. For the reason
           mentioned above, the different perspectives among field staff and management of
           APN shouldn‟t have been a reason to adversely affect the implementation of
           projects.
     •     Annex D: Florencia Reca assisted the evaluator as a consultant to the World Bank.

        Finally, we regret that the time of year chosen for the visit, [which] has not been the
most convenient climate-wise to go around and visit the residents of Copo National Park
whose opinion would have been valuable to know, as well as the evaluator couldn‟t
interviewed key informants suggested that worked during the implementation of the projects
nor any member of the Board, since they would have shown other interesting points of view
during the evaluation.

         We hope these comments are useful and taken into account in the final report.

         Without further comments, we are at your disposition for any consultation, regards.

Annex E: Maps
Major Forest Types of Argentina
     Parque Chaqueño — comprised of both the dry and humid Chaco ecoregions in the
      north-central portion of the country, extending well into Paraguay and Bolivia (the 2nd
      largest forest in South America behind only the Amazon forest in terms of size at
      roughly 60 million hectares) and representing 21 percent of Argentina‟s total land
      area and 41 percent of its total forest area;
     Espinal – a dry savanna type of forest located in an extensive arc west and north of
      the Pampas radiating out from the province of Buenos Aíres toward the Parque
      Chaqueño and representing 20 percent of the country‟s forested lands;
     Monte – a transitional highland xerophytic short shrub and grassland steppe
      ecoregion situated between the dry, highland Central Andes Puna ecoregions to the
      west and the Parque Chaqueño and Espinal to the east, and representing 29 percent
      of the country‟s native forest lands;
     Bosque Andino Patagónico – forming a panoramic backdrop of alpine glacier-fed
      lakes ringed by the Andean mountains in a region known as the “Lake region or
      corridor” containing several of the largest and most visited protected areas in SINAP,
      it represents just 5 percent of the native forests of Argentina, but it‟s National Parks
      generate half of SINAP‟s revenues;
     Selva Tucumano Boliviana – a lush, moist rainforests located at higher elevations
      along the eastern slopes of the Andes mountain range in the northwestern corner of
      the country bordering Bolivia, and representing 3 percent of the country‟s forest
      cover; and
     Selva Misionera found in the northeastern corner of the country by Paraguay and
      Brazil and representing 4 percent of the country‟s forests, but including Iguazú
      National Park .
