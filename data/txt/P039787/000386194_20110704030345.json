"4085", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Native Forests and\n            Protected Areas (NFPA) Project for Argentina were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was negligible to low, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the Biodiversity\n            Conservation Project (ABC) for Argentina were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: The Bank should encourage natural resource project\n            managers to take advantage of rapidly changing advances in\n            biodiversity conservation methods and tools to complement\n            traditional on-the-ground monitoring of indicator species\n            surveys. These include satellite imagery and aerial\n            photographs of habitat vegetation cover, or real-time remote\n            monitoring devices and camera traps when conservation of\n            specific species is the objective. Blending different\n            lending instruments, such as International Bank of\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans with Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) grants, to achieve different\n            natural resource management objectives can be an effective\n            way to engage clients in addressing the full range of sector\n            challenges they face. For example, the decision to use an\n            IBRD loan to help Argentina increase park system revenues\n            under the NFPA Project while preserving ecoregions of global\n            significance under the ABC Project justified the use of a\n            GEF grant. When experimenting with new techniques or\n            approaches to land-use practices or natural resource\n            management, it is best to approach experimental\n            interventions in a measured way assuming that unexpected\n            difficulties, costs, and delays will inevitably arise. The\n            NFPA Project conducted applied research projects on\n            compatible land-use practices in productive landscapes while\n            the ABC Project introduced alternative, less destructive\n            productive activities in park buffer zones."}, "docdt": "2011-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
