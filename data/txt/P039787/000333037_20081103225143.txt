F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The general goal of the project is to conserve biodiversity of global importance; the
specific objectives are to: (a) expand and diversify the existing national protected areas
system to include several of the country's most globally significant but inadequately
protected ecoregions, and (b) create the conditions for their sustainable management
through investments in institutional strengthening, refined mechanisms of consultation
and participation, and improved biodiversity information management.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)
Argentina is characterized by a broad mix of ecological regions and rich biological diversity due
to its wide range of climatic conditions. Of the 178 terrestrial ecoregions in Latin America and
the Caribbean (identified in a World Bank/World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) study), 18 are
found in Argentina. They range from the tropical rain forests of Misiones Province to the cold
and arid Patagonian steppes of southern Argentina. While most are shared with adjacent countries,
several are exclusive to Argentina, including most notably the Espinal, the Monte, the Pampas,
and the Córdoba Montane Savannas (Chaco Serrano). Predictably, this diversity in ecoregions
supports a large number of species of flora and fauna. With a total land area of 2.7 million km2
(two percent of the world's land surface), Argentina accounts for 12.2 percent of the world's
gymnosperm species, 12.3 percent of the world's mushroom species, 10.9 percent of birds, and
8.7 percent of mammals. The country is particularly rich in endemic species, with more than
2,500 vascular plant species, 32 amphibian species, 53 reptile species, and 46 mammal species
found nowhere else.

Argentina has long recognized the importance of these biological resources. Its national park
system, the first in Latin America, dates back to 1903 with the donation of 7,500 ha of private
land to the State. This initial holding was later enlarged and became the Nahuel Huapi National
Park, the nation's first national park created along with the National Parks Commission in 1934.
Other important accomplichments leading to the present national park system include the
establishment of another 30 national protected areas; the creation of the national school for park
rangers in 1967; and the development of a national protected areas system (NPAS) in 1986.

At appraisal, the country's protected area system (both national and provincial) had grown to
cover some 4.9 percent of the national territory (about 13 million hectares). Of this total, some 22
percent was in the national park system, which consisted of 31 national protected areas, while the
remaining area was under provincial or other forms of local control. In addition to their
importance for biodiversity conservation, Argentina's national park system also represents an
important source for generating revenue. Several of the country's national parks and reserves are
major tourist attractions which provide significant sources of revenue.

Notwithstanding the global significance of the country's biological resources, their unsustainable
use and over-exploitation continues at an alarming rate. Over the last century, it has been
estimated that Argentina lost more than two thirds of its original forest cover. Deforestation
continues unabated; the current loss rate is estimated to be 160,000 hectares per year. The Chaco
is the forest ecoregion most threatened, and the location of most of current deforestation in
Argentina. The loss of non- forested habitat is also significant. This is particularly true in the
Pampas ecoregion, where conversion of grasslands to extensive livestock production has reduced
this natural ecosystem to only one percent of its original size. Similarly, over a third of the
Patagonian Steppe is severely eroded due to overgrazing by sheep and cattle, an issue of
increasing concern in many of the country's other open habitats. At the species level, available
information appears to support a similar pattern of irreversible loss. For example, in a recent
study on the country's biodiversity species, 22 percent of Argentina's 2,355 vertebrate species
were considered threatened or endangered.

At Appraisal, a National Parks Administration (APN) analysis estimated that less than 21 percent
of the total area under protection was adequately managed, 30 percent under some form of
management, and almost 50 percent (mostly under the jurisdiction of provincial or municipal

authorities) receives very little or no management support. Moreover, the existing National
Protected Areas System (NPAS) did not equitably represent many of the country's ecoregions
considered to be of global significance in terms of their biodiversity. According to the degree of
protection and threat levels, nine Argentine Ecoregions were identified as top priorities for
increased biodiversity conservation; the Pampas, Brazilian Interior Atlantic Forests, Semi-Arid
Chaco, Patagonian Steppe, Argentine Espinal, Humid Chaco, Cordoba Montane Savannas,
Littoral/Marine Habitats, and Central Andean Dry Puna.

The National Park Law (Regimen Legal de los Parques Nacionales, Monumentos Naturales y
Reservas Nacionales - Mensaje y Ley Orgánica) No. 22.351 of 1981, provides the legal basis for
establishing and managing protected areas (PAs) in Argentina. This law defines the management
objectives and characteristics to be used to classify PAs into one of several conservation classes.
Land, water and biological resources designated as national protected areas can be declared on
the basis of scientific importance, education, and the enjoyment of present and future generations.
Each protected area must be officially designated with its own individual national law.

The Government of Argentina (GOA) had long demonstrated a commitment to protecting
biodiversity. The country is a signatory to a host of international conventions, including the
Agreement on Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR, 1971); the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES, 1973); the Convention for Conservation of
Migratory Species (1979); and the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) and in November
1996, the Government hosted the Third Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the
Convention on Biological Diversity. In 1994 GOA began initial consultations with technical
specialists within and outside government agencies to determine priorities for a national
biodiversity strategy and a national protected area network. In September 1996 GOA received a
UNDP-administered GEF grant to finalize the national biodiversity strategy, including support for
a process of full consultation and participation of all stakeholders. Key elements of the strategy
have already been identified and have been incorporated into the design of the proposed
Biodiversity Conservation Project (BCP). These elements include: (i) strengthening and
extending the protected area system; (ii) increasing national and local capacity in natural resource
management, both in forested and non-forested areas; and (iii) promoting greater public
participation in natural resource management.

At appraisal, Argentina faced a number of constraints in addressing environmental conservation
issues. In particular, constraints on public spending had severely restricted government resources
available for new investments in protected areas. Efficient management of the country's natural
resources was hampered by poor coordination between different levels of government,
deficiencies in the policy and legal framework, and lack of technical expertise and established
mechanisms for public participation and consultation. Recognizing these opportunities and
weaknesses, the Government proposed an integrated program which was composed of an IBRD-
financed Native Forests and Protected Areas Project and a Global Environmental Facility (GEF)-
financed Biodiversity Conservation Project (BCP). Specifically, the IBRD-financed Native
Forests and Protected Areas Project (Loan 4085-AR) pursued these issues by enhancing the
policy, legal and regulatory framework governing native forests, by addressing information
constraints to the sustainable use of native forests and conservation of biodiversity, and by
supporting the modernization of APN as a national parks management entity. GEF support of the
Biodiversity Conservation Project complemented these objectives by making possible the
formulation of an integrated and balanced approach to improved conservation of natural habitats
containing biodiversity of global significance.

The semi-blended IBRD Native Forest and Protected Areas Project (NFPA) (Ln. 4085 Ar.) had
two components; Native Forests (Comp. A) and Protected Areas (Comp B.). Component B was
executed by APN and was the main link between the IBRD and the GEF Project. Component B
had two subcomponents: (a) Plan for Modernizing APN and (b) Infrastructure Development and
Management Strenghtening of the Selected Parks. Under the Protected Areas Component, APN
prepared a plan to modernize the institution, as well as finance specific infrastructure
developments and strengthening of management in four selected parks in Patagonia, including the
strengthening of APN's regional technical office. These parks (Nahuel Huapi, Lanin, Glaciares,
and Los Alerces) are the major revenue-generating protected areas managed by APN and the
most heavily visited.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project was conceived prior to the use of the Results Framework later employed by the Bank.
The overall objective of the project was to conserve biodiversity of global importance; the
specific objectives were to: (a) expand and diversify the existing National Protected Areas
System (NPAS) to include several of the country's most globally significant but inadequately
protected ecoregions, and (b) create the conditions for their sustainable management through
investments in institutional strengthening, refined mechanisms of consultation and participation,
and improved biodiversity information management.

The project objectives align with the objectives identified with for each of the three components
of the project, described below in Section 1.5. Impact indicators were developed for each of the
objectives. Specific performance indicators were also developed during preparation.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

(i) Key Impact indicator "Increased provincial presence in provincial reserves around project
federal PAs" was formally changed in 2003 to read "Increased federal and provincial presence
in PAs and Provincial Reserves".

(Justification: The indicator was changed, as the main focus and investment of the project was in
federally protected areas, not provincial reserves. Yet, no indicator to measure federal presence in
PAs was included in the original Key Impact Indicators set. The changed indicator includes both
federal PAs and provincial reserves.)

(ii) Key Impact Indicator "Social organization of affected families maintained/improved" was
formally dropped.

(Justification: Field staff, APN and Bank supervision team agreed that the indicator was of
limited utility for measuring key impacts of the project. The effects of social organization on the
protected areas is sufficiently covered in indicators 3,4, 5 and 6. Family well-being is measured in
indicators 8 and 9.)

(iii) Key Impact Indicator "Development of a more extensive BIS determined by the creation and
integration of additional information nodes" was formally dropped.

(Justification: The indicator was unnecessary for measuring key impacts as the BIS is fully
complete with the five nodes established by the project. Expansion of the system is being carried
out by APN through increased functionality, improvements in technology and links with other
national information providers, not through establishment of additional nodes.)

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the GEO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The principal beneficiaries of the project were:

· The government institutions, principally APN, responsible for the management and
     sustainable development of protected areas;
· Rural populations in the zone of influence (and within the protected areas in certain areas);



                                                  4

· Park visitors (through the provision of improved facilities, management and services in the
     new parks);
· The tourism sector (through new infrastructure which attracts increased numbers of park
     visitors to rural areas);
· The education sector (through the development of teaching materials and training programs
     for rural schools relative to conservation)

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had three components: (A) Protected Areas; (B) Biodiversity Information
Management; and (C) Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. Total project costs at appraisal
amounted to US$ 21.6 million; US$ 10.1 GEF (originally expressed as US$ 7.3 million SDR in
the Grant Agreement), US$ 11.1 from GoA and US$ 0.4 form from buffer-zone grant
beneficiaries.

Component A - Protected Areas (base cost US$ 20.3 million, US$ 9.3 million from GEF,
US$ 10.6 million from GoA and US$ 0.4 million from beneficiaries).

The general objective of this component was to support the establishment and consolidation of
five new protected areas in poorly represented ecosystems of recognized global importance. The
selected areas were: (a) Los Venados (an area in San Luis Province identified as the largest
remnant of relatively intact Pampas); (b) San Guillermo (in San Juan Province, the southernmost
extension of the Central Andean Dry Puna); (c) Copo (in Santiago del Estero Province, one of the
last pristine areas of Semi-Arid Chaco in Argentina); (d) Quebrada del Condorito (in Córdoba
Province, an area including a part of the Córdoba Montane Savannas, an ecoregion endemic to
Argentina); and (e) Monte León (in Santa Cruz Province, an area of Patagonian Steppe and
littoral and wetland habitat). Selection was made based on evaluation criteria applied to 32
potential areas. A team of local and international biodiversity experts confirmed the significance
of the selected sites in terms of: (a) their global importance for biodiversity conservation; (b) the
degree of threat to the ecoregion; and (c) a complex of factors related to investment feasibility
(e.g., provincial interest, cost of land purchase, support of local communities, and other
institutional considerations.) There were three sub-components:

Subcomponent A.1. Establishment and consolidation of new protected areas (US$ 15.9 million
base cost, US$ 6.7 million from GEF and US$ 9.2 million from GOA). The project supported the
establishment and management of five protected areas in the selected sites, for which the
management strategy was based on a policy of strict protection, but with provisions for the
possibility of low-impact visits. Following the completion of legal establishment and land
acquisition, livestock should be gradually eliminated from the parks and park rangers should be
hired to manage visitor use and to control access, poaching and other types of illegal activity. It
was planned that these rangers would also conduct basic inventory and monitoring activities,
paying special attention to key indicator species. Moreover, the project developed partnerships
with the local scientific community to monitor the effects of park management on flora and fauna.
As such, the project financed: (a) technical assistance for boundary demarcation, drafting of legal
documents, preparation and implementation of operational plans, implementation of
environmental assessments and other specialized studies and activities associated with the
establishment and management of these areas; (b) limited equipment; and (c) small works
(construction of observation points, interpretative trails, fencing, administrative offices,
interpretative center and park ranger residences, and one road repair).




                                                    5

Subcomponent A.2. Sustainable Development Activities in Buffer Zones (US$ 1.4 million base
cost; US$ 0.9 million form GEF, US$ 0.1 million form GoA and US$ 0,4 million from
beneficiaries). The project supported improved community land-use practices through pilot
projects, studies, and support to extension activities. Pilot activities consisted of financing a
variety of small activities (e.g., the testing of improved land management models, recovery of
degraded natural grasslands, fire management, and the implementation of complementary
biodiversity studies) that contributed directly to the sustainable use and conservation of
biodiversity in PA buffer zones. This subcomponent also supported awareness-building activities
aimed at local communities living in and around the parks, thereby helping to increase local
knowledge of, and support for, the parks themselves. In most cases, funding for this sub-
component was made available on a competitive, cost-sharing basis to NGOs, universities, and
government agencies working in collaboration with local landowners or rural communities. GEF
funding was used to cover the incremental costs of the sub-component.

Subcomponent A.3 Public Participation (US$ 1.8 million base cost; US$ 0.7 million from GEF
and US$ 1.1 million from GOA). As an essential part of project preparation, an extensive
stakeholder participation and consultation process was implemented with representatives of
federal and provincial institutions, NGOs, rural families, local farmers, community organizations,
and universities. This subcomponent played a central role to ensure broad public participation in
the creation, protection and management of each protected area. This has been done through the
formulation of a Participation Plan and a Mitigation Plan and their implementation for people
who might otherwise have been adversely affected by park establishment. Social mitigation costs
included training for alternative employment, employment in park management activities, and
improved housing and living conditions for the people who would continue to live in the parks.
GEF funding was used to cover the incremental costs of this sub-component while GoA financed
the Mitigation Plan.

Component B - Biodiversity Information Management (US$ 0.6 million; US$ 0.5 million
from GEF and US$ 0.1 million from GoA): The objective of the component was to provide
decision makers (national and international) with ready access to information for decision making
relative to conservation and the sustainable use of biodiversity. The project considered the ability
to access and exchange information on Argentina's globally important biodiversity as an essential
tool for effective management and protection. This was achieved by putting into place an
internet- based biodiversity network, enabling worldwide access to to Argentine biodiversity
information.

The component financed the development of prototype nodes within APN and provided the
training and standards needed to extend the network nationally and internationally. The project
financed system development, limited hardware acquisition, and reconfiguration of existing
databases. A major thrust of the component was a training sub-component to ensure the
sustainability of the first -node within this emerging network. The component consisted of (a)
promotion of the Biodiversity Information System (BIS) at the national level, (b) development of
the BIS software, (c) adaptation of existing data bases to the BIS, and (d) capacity building and
training. GEF support of US$ 0.5 million was proposed to finance the incremental costs of the
component.

Component C ­ Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 0.6 million base cost;
US$ 0.5 million from GEF and 0.1 million from GoA). This component financed technical
assistance, equipment and incremental operational costs needed to strengthen the capacity of the
implementing agencies to manage the overall program. It also supported scientifically sound
monitoring of biodiversity at globally significant Protected Areas sites.

1.6 Revised Components

Not applicable (no revisions)

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

During execution of the Project, four amendments to the grant agreement were made (July 2003,
December 2003, February 2005, and June 2006) as follows:

        i) On July 11, 2003, at the request of APN, the percent of expenditures financed by the
             GEF for "goods" and "works" disbursement categories were modified to increase the
             percentage of GEF resources required from 88% to 100% for "works", under
             disbursement category (1)(a); from 82% to 100% for "equipment", under
             disbursement categories (1) b), (4)(a) and (5)(a). This helped to boost implementation,
             as lesser amounts of scarce counterpart funds were required for implementation. It
             also enabled the project to take advantage of the tax exemption in effect in Argentina
             for procurement of goods and services carried out using funds provided by
             international cooperation (Argentine Law no. 23.905). Finally, it helped to streamline
             the procurement process, as payments under categories with 100% GEF financing
             were not required to be processed with counterpart funds (which require a separate
             internal routing and authorization). (The effect of this amendment was demonstrable
             and implementation picked up substantially as a result.)

        ii) The second amendment (December 17, 2003), requested by the Bank, was to change
             the grant amount, which had previously been recorded in Special Drawing Rights
             (SDR), into United States dollars.

        iii) The third amendment (February 17, 2005) approved the tables of adjusted Project
             monitoring indicators. (see Section 1.3)

        iv) The fourth amendment (June 26, 2006), requested by APN, was to add a sixth
             protected area (Mburucuyá National Park), reallocate funds, and modify the
             percentage of expenditures financed by the GEF for the "Grants" disbursement
             category (This helped to expedite the administration and disbursement of funds to
             subprojects, by using only one funding sources).

             In 2005, APN conducted a comparative analysis of options for incorporating an
             additional protected area into the Project. Once complete, they provided a
             justification for inclusion of the highest ranking candidate from their analysis,
             Mburucuyá, to the Bank, along with detailed analyses of other alternatives.
             Following a review of the request and field mission by the supervision team, the
             Bank's Lead Ecologist conducted a site visit and an assessment using the WWF
             tracking tool to determine its suitability for inclusion in the project. Social and
             environmental assessments of the park and surrounding area were carried out by
             APN -- both were found to be acceptable by the Bank (and the social assessment
             recognized as a best practice). Based on the assessments, good registration with the
             project objectives and the justification provided by APN, it was concluded that the
             area was an excellent candidate for inclusion in the project.



                                                   7

             Mburucuyá is located primarily in the Humid Chaco, an ecosystem identified at
             appraisal as having globally significant biodiversity, and insufficient protection. The
             area has a range of ecological conditions and vegetation due to the convergence of
             three different ecoregions: hygrophytic forests associated with the Parana Forest
             ecosystem; Chaco forests, primarily Schinopsis spp. and Prosopis spp.); and yatay
             (palm) savannas and Mesopotamian-type wetlands (including 104 lagoons and 8,000
             ha of marshes and streams, in an excellent state of conservation). The protected area
             is home to 13 threatened species of vertebrates and 27 endemic species of flora. In
             addition, it contains extremely important grasslands, prioritized for conservation as
             Valuable Grassland Areas in the Pampas and Plains of Argentina, Uruguay, and
             Southern Brazil (D. Bilenca and F. Miñarro. J.M. Kaplan Fund-FVSA 2004.


Institutional arrangements

The Biodiversity Conservation Project was designed to be executed by the National Park
Administration (APN), a semi-autonomous agency within the Secretariat of Natural Resources
and Human Environment (SRNyAH). Following a series of institutional reorganizations in the
environment areas, in 2001 APN was transferred to the Ministry of Tourism. No negative impacts
were incurred as a result of this transition.

Project Extensions

The project had one extension for twenty-one months, to March 31, 2008, in order to complete
the established goals and incorporate a New Protected Area, Mburucuyá National Park, (MNP)
into the project. Impacts of the fiscal and political crises of 2001 ­ 2003 on the project had
slowed progress during those years. However, following the crisis the project had recouped its
momentum and showed good signs that it could successfully accomplish its objectives, providing
it was granted the additional 21 months ­ which proved correct.

Amendment of Disbursement Category Allocations ­

Two of the amendments signed had the purpose of modifying the percent of expenditures
financed by the GEF of select disbursement categories (July 2003 and June 2006) and
reallocation of funds between categories (June 2006). The following funds reallocations were
authorized:

         · Works, disbursement category (1)(a) ­ increased from US$ 3,140,685 to
             US$ 4,040,685;
         · Goods, disbursement category (1)(b) ­ increased from US$ 1,106,850 to
             US$ 1,332,850;
         · Consulting Services, disbursement category (1)(c) ­ decreased from US$ 1,328,220
             to US$ 1,156,220;

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Project Preparation

The Bank team was composed of protected areas, biodiversity, information systems, social, and
public participation specialists and other technical experts. The FAO CP played a very important
role in providing technical experts to work side-by-side with national counterparts in project
formulation. The project was well conceived and had a sound technical design that targeted the
issues and constraints derived from the sector review report.

Lessons learned and incorporated

The design of the project was based on GEF-related experience from Argentina and on the larger
information base derived from other relevant projects supported under the GEF Pilot Phase and
other related environmental protection projects in Latin America.

The only completed GEF-financed project in Argentina was the Patagonia Coastal Zone
Management Plan Project (CZMP). The main lessons derived from the CZMP project included:
(a) the need to build on a strong, established organizational base; (b) project preparation and
implementation should be carried out to the maximum degree possible through the use of local
experts; and (c) the education of decision makers and the population generally on the role of and
need to conserve natural habitats is vital to develop support for managing protected areas
sustainably.

The key lessons derived from other GEF-funded biodiversity projects elsewhere in Latin America,
that had been also generally corroborated in the November 1995 World Bank report,


                                                  9

Mainstrearning Biodiversity in Development: a World Bank Assistance Strategy for Implementing
the Convention on Biological Diversity, and by the 1996 Bank report GEF Pilot Phase Portfolio
Project Implementation Review were fully taken into account during the formulation of the BCP.

Rationale for Bank and GEF Involvement:

The project was the Bank's first GEF- funded project aimed at improving the conservation of
biodiversity of global importance in Argentina. The BCP provided a vehicle for pursuing one of
the three pillars of the 1995 CAS for Argentina: rebuilding infrastructure (including addressing
environment issues) by improving environmental management and protection. In particular, the
Project supported the in situ conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, a key objective of
the Convention on Biological Diversity, consistent with the GEF Operational Strategy for
Biodiversity and with all four GEF Biodiversity Operational Programs.

The proposed national parks for GEF assistance were selected to protect arid and semi-arid
ecosystems (the Pampas, the Central Andean Dry Puna, and the Patagonian Steppe); forest
ecosystems (Córdoba montane savannas and the Chaco); mountain ecosystems (the Puna), and
coastal, marine, and freshwater ecosystems (littoral and wetland Patagonian habitats). The project
was consistent with the Conferences of the Parties (COP) guidance on conservation and
sustainable use of vulnerable ecosystems and species; capacity building, including human
resource development and institutional strengthening; and innovative measures to conserve
biodiversity, including government-private partnerships for land management. Furthermore, the
Biodiversity Information Management component was designed to contribute to the Argentine
National Information Management responsibilities as defined in the Convention on Biological
Diversity.

Project design

One important factor contributing to the project's success was the decision to base the project's
design on the comprehensive Argentine Forest Sector study of 1993 (No. 11833-AR). The sector
work concluded that the Bank can be of great assistance to the government in helping it to
develop and to implement an appropriate state role in the conservation and management of
natural habitats. The project's success demonstrates the importance of carrying out a sector
review to identify issues and constraints in the early stages of preparation.

Risk Assesment

The risks identified during the preparation were i) lack of awareness by local decision makers
concerning the need for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protected areas to be created
through the project and ii) limited involvement by and support from provincial governments
regarding biodiversity conservation, due to lack of financing.

To mitigate the first risk, both the project design and activity implementation emphasized local
public consultation processes and participation of stakeholders at each of the proposed protected
area sites. Consultative commissions were created at each area, including participatory workshops
to support public participation in the development of park management plans.

One of the selection factors applied to the proposed protected areas considered for inclusion in
the project was the existence and degree of provincial support, which partially mitigated the
second risk. In addition, sustainable development and training activities were included for
residents of the provincial buffer zones around each national park included in the project.


                                                  10

When the Project was formulated, the San Guillermo Protected Area had a specific risk linked to
the mining exploration permits valid in the buffer zone adjacent to the park. The law (No.
24.585/95) requires environmental impact studies to be done prior to exploitation. These studies
must be approved by provincial authorities and include mitigation measures. During Project
implementation, both APN and the Bank supervision team carried out activities to evaluate the
possible impacts of mining activities in the Park's influence zones (Veladero and Pascua Lama,
both of Barrick Gold Corp. of Canada).

In September 2005, the supervision mission visited San Juan and met both provincial authorities,
the UnderSecretary of Mining and the Undersecretary of the Environment, and the on-site
managers of Barrick, including their Vice President, Legal Counsel and Medical Director, to learn
more about the monitoring, control and mitigation measures being employed at the mines. The
mission also visited CIPCAMI (Centro de Investigación para la Prevención de la Contaminación
Minero Industrial) (a provincial technical center with state-of-the-art water quality monitoring
equipment and personnel trained and financed by the Japanese Government).

CIPCAMI and Barrick reported they had been carrying out independent water-quality monitoring
of the Las Taguas, Cuesta del Viento and San Juan El Palque Rivers. Both of the water
monitoring programs reported they had yet to detect any problematic contamination from the
mines. The project financed a followup study, "Physical and chemical water quality monitoring
of the Blanco River between Junta de la Palca and Cuesta del Viento Dam" to assess the threat of
contamination from the mines and to determine the adequacy of both Barrick's EIA, as well as
their monitoring programs (and CIPCAMIs). The study identified technical areas where the EIA
could be improved. APN followed up with the Secretary of Mining and the Province concerning
the findings and is now working with the Province to determine best locations for new water
monitoring stations that include park's concerns. The Secretary of Mining has also followed up
with Barrick and made recommendations for improvements to its EIA and mitigation efforts.

Borrower Commitment

To achieve the Project's objectives, a strong commitment from APN was fundamental, both from
technical personnel and from authorities, particularly PIU staff. APN showed a high commitment
to the project and worked diligently with provincial authorities in the creation of the parks. Given
that this was only the second project with external financing in APN, initially there were some
minor issues associated with the administrative flow of counterpart funds. However, they were
eventually resolved through the use of a revolving account for each park (established within
APN).

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Project activities were initiated in August 1998 at a good pace. While disbursements were slow
initially, due to the time lag between procurement of lands and the implementation of site
activities in the new parks, progress was considered satisfactory up until the midst of the political
and economic crisis of 2001 - 2003.

The economic crisis eventually took a toll on the project's execution and the project was
considered at risk, as was most of the Argentine portfolio. In 2003, the project was downgraded
to unsatisfactory, due to a slowdown in work and corresponding disbursement lag. With 50% of


                                                 11

the population haven fallen below the poverty line, the government was compelled to shift scarce
funds from line agencies to avert or mitigate social crises. Consequently, across the board budget
cuts were experienced in the project and sector.

However, with assistance from the Bank team, the agencies made successful appeals for
additional funding to the Ministry of Economy and Production and the President's Chief of
Cabinet. In addition, the Bank agreed to an amendment of the grant agreement to increase the
percentage of GEF resources required from 88% to 100% for "works", under disbursement
category (1)(a); from 82% to 100% for "equipment", under disbursement categories (1) b), (4)(a)
and (5)(a). This helped to boost implementation, as lesser amounts of scarce counterpart funds
were required for implementation. The disbursement profile was updated, and the project began
pulling ahead.

Another difficulty stemming from the economic crisis was its impact on the procurement of

Estancia San Nicolás (San Luis Province), site of the proposed Los Venados National Park. The
purchase of the Estancia began in December 2000 with a down payment of 30% of the total (apx.
$US 0.83 million equivalent of counterpart funds), and, in June 2001, the final payment should
have been made. However, APN did not have sufficient funds on hand to complete the purchase
due to budget cuts imposed during the crisis. A legal process is still underway to resolve its
acquisition by APN.

Although the peso was pegged to the dollar at a 1:1 ratio at effectiveness, the peso devalued to
nearly 3.6 to 1 in 2002 and remains today at about 3.1 to 1. The devalued peso, along with low
rates of inflation (avg 8%) between 2003 and 2006, resulted in lower rates of disbursements in the
project in US Dollars, even as the country emerged from the crisis and the project began to
recover lost ground in implementation. This is because most of the project's expenditures were in
Argentine Pesos and US Dollar equivalent costs were much lower after the crisis compared to the
cost estimates at appraisal. The graph below shows the disbursements in US dollars before and
after the crisis relative to the dollar-equivalent in pesos.

Figure 1. Cumulative Disbursements in US $ and AR Pesos

The project was implemented in a semi-blended arrangement with the IBRD Native Forests and
Protected Areas Project (US $15.8 million). The two projects shared facilities, and some of the
administrative costs. For example, financial management and procurement were shared between
the projects. The two projects were supervised by the same National Director in APN, and were
thematically complementary. The IBRD project focused on modernization of APN as a national
parks entity, including major infrastructure investments in Argentina's four most highly visited
national parks, while the GEF project complemented this by improving the conservation of
natural habitats containing biodiversity of global significance.

During project implementation, four amendments to the grant agreement were authorized (July
2003, December 2003, February 2005, and June 2006). (See Section 1.7 for details.)

Personnel Changes - Personnel changes were incurred during implementation. However, this
rarely impacted implementation, since most of the core technical staff were retained. Over the
course of project implementation, the National Director for the Project changed six times.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design ­ The project design included performance and impact indicators to monitor the
Project's activities. During implementation, one impact indicator was adjusted, and targets and
methods modified for some of the progress indicators (See Section 1.3 and "Revised Targets"
noted in the Datasheet).

M&E Implementation ­ The PIU took measurements during the entire project cycle and
updated the table of performance indicators annually. During field visits at supervision missions,
some of the reported measurements were verified. Most indicators were found to be very
straightforward, and could be monitored without difficulty, with the exception of the species-level
indicators of biodiversity. Nevertheless, biodiversity monitoring programs of indicators species
were established for all of the new protected areas by closure. The first monitoring was finalized
by closure in Quebrada del Condorito, San Guillermo, Copo and Monte Leon National Parks. In
retrospect, it may have been more practical to monitor biodiversity at the ecosystem level with
remote sensing analyses (and field checks) to determine how well habitats for the species were
fairing, rather than monitor individual species.

Indicator species selected for Quebrada del Condorito include tabaquillo (Polylepis australis),
puma (Puma concolor), red fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and ratón plomizo (Akodon spegazzinii)
and vegetation at landscape level and for San Guillermo the following species were selected:
vicuña (Vicugna vicugna), guanaco (Lama guanicoe), andean cat (Oreaihurus jacobita),
European hare (Lepus europaeus), ratón de las vegas (Neotomys ebriosus), chinchillón (Lagidium
viscacia), puma (Puna concolor), lagartija de San Guillermo (Liolaemus eleodori), lagarto de
cola piche sanjuanino (Phymaturus punae), burmeister´s anole (Pristidactylus scapulatus),
Andean flamingo (Phoenicopterus andinus) and horned coot (Fulica cornuta). In Copo, the
indicators were: quebracho colorado (Schinopsis lorentzii y balansae), vinal (Prosopis ruscifolia),
zorro gris (Pseudolapex griseus) and insectivorous birds of branches and trunks and of foliage.
Indicator specieis in Monte León include Darwin´s rhea (Pterocnemia pennata), guanaco (Lama
guanicoe), red fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus), puna (Puma concolor), Magellanic penguin
(Spheniscus magellanicus), imperial shag (Phalacrocórax atriceps), sea lion (Otaria flavescens)
and herbaceous and bush steppe. Indicator species monitoring showed that populations were



                                                13

either stable or increasing. These findings are compatible with the high degree of protection
afforded through the creation and management of the new protected areas, and backed by M&E
reporting showing a decrease in disturbances in them.

M&E utilization ­ The PSRs and ISRs were regularly updated with the monitoring and
evaluation information, which proved to be a useful tool for the team in its supervision and to
provide the needed feedback and guidance to the implementing agency on where to focus its
efforts. The M&E was particularly important in the post-crisis period to clearly demonstrate to
high-level administrators of the line agencies areas to target for improvement. The M&E effort
was the first for APN, along with The Protected Areas Component of the Native Forest and
Protected Areas Project, and has demonstrated the knowledge obtained through the project by
building high-quality indicator sets for the new Sustainable Natural Resources Management
Project (SNRM Project).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Fiduciary

During Project implementation, there were five supervision missions by financial administration
specialists from the Regional Office of the Bank: November 2002, March 2006, November 2006,
April 2007 and March 2008. In all cases the conclusions were that the project's overall financial
management performance was Satisfactory.

The conclusions of the FM supervision missions were that the project´s overall financial
management and procurement performance was satisfactory. Some weaknesses, mainly related to
the lack of timely counterpart funding, partly caused by the 2001-2002 economic crisis and
because this was one of the APNs first experiences with international funding, were identified by
the FM supervision mission. Time differences between the counterpart funding according to PIU
project financial statements and APN budget execution system were raised by the auditors
because information was not timely channeled to the PIU. However, the identified weaknesses
were satisfactorily addressed by the Project Unit. However, the identified weaknesses were
satisfactorily addressed by the Project Unit.

There were four procurement reviews conducted by the Regional Office Procurement Specialist,
in 2006, 2007 (two) and 2008. The procurement review of 2006 included the physical inspection
of works in QCNP. The second review in 2007 was a joint review with the financial management
specialist, and the others were ex-post reviews. The PIU showed adequate experience in carrying
out bidding processes related to civil works, but some weaknesses in the selection of consultants
and goods procedures. Though overall, based on the supervision missions and ex-post reviews,
the procurement performance for the project was considered satisfactory.

The project had no cases of misprocurement nor accountability issues (financial disqualification
problems) in any of the financial auditing reports.

Safeguards

Environment Assessment (OD 4.01): The project was classified as category "B" as the
infrastructure developments in protected areas were small and because of the low number of
individuals in or around the parks. It aimed to promote improved environmental management of
the new protected areas, the effects of which were designed to be overwhelmingly positive.


                                                 14

Infrastructure works were the main focus for environmental management and monitoring. To
manage this, prior to the execution of the works, APN carried out specific environmental
assessments according to the potential for environmental impacts per National Law 22.351 and
APN resolution no. 16/94, which were completely consistent with OD 4.01. The requirements
and administrative procedures for the assessments are outlined in APN's Reglamento para la
Evaluación Impacto Ambiental en Areas de la Administración de Parques Nacionales. EIAs and
mitigation plans were reviewed and cleared by the team's environmental specialist for the
relevant works. APN performance for the reviews and environmental management was
consistently complete and of high quality. The Bank supervision team included biologists and
ecologists trained in the applicable Bank safeguards policies. (Prior to the incorporation of the
new park, Mburucuyá, during the course of the project, the client presented an EA based on the
Park's management plan, which was reviewed and cleared by the team's environmental specialist
and SAT on May 26, 2006.)

Involuntary Resettlement (OD 4.30): Significant attention was devoted to ensure that the people
who lived in the Quebrada del Condorito, Monte León and Copo National Parks were dealt with
fairly and that they didn´t lose their capacity to support themselves. In terms of the World Bank's
Operational Directive 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement, no one was resettled due to the
establishment of the parks. Persons living in the parks and supported through the project included
six familes in Quebrada del Condorito, one aged (and blind) farmhand in Monte León and five
families in Copo. In compliance with the Bank's policies, APN developed and implemented a
Social Mitigation Plan during implementation that included, in addition to training and housing
improvements, hiring one member of each family at Quebrada del Condorito as APN staff,
processing an APN retirement for the farmhand from Monte León, and hiring two members of
one family at Copo. APN's considerable experience with land purchasing carried out over the last
60 years in other parks has been non-controversial and successful. Land purchase and mitigation
arrangements were in full compliance with OD 4.30 ­ and there was no involuntary resettlement.
(In addition to the mitigation efforts, the project developed and carried out specific social
participation plans/activities to involve local stakeholders in management plan development and
implementation.)

During trips to supervise the Project, mission members had occasion to contact various residents
of the Quebrada del Condorito and Copo National Parks. As part of the monitoring and evaluation
activities, a survey was taken of the QCNP beneficiaries concerning the mitigation aspects of the
project. Results were evaluated as positive because "the status of APN worker places them in the
situation of having increased income and a greater choice of productive activities to engage in."

(Prior to the incorporation of the new park, Mburucuyá, the client presented an SA which was
reviewed and cleared by the team and SAT on May 26, 2006. The SA confirmed there were no
indigenous people in the area, and there would be no nvoluntary resettlement. It provided
excellent information for the incorporation of the new park and addressing social issues in the
buffer zone. The team was commended by SAT on the quality of the SA and safeguards
compliance.)

Natural Habitats (OP 4.04): The protection of natural habitats was a major focus of the BCP and
it was designed to have positive impacts on the environment. During the project, five new
protected areas were created and strengthened, protecting five ecoregions with biodiversity of
global importance. All activities under this project aimed to enhance biodiverstiy conservation,
through, inter alia, creation of the protected area, sustainable activities in buffer zones, local
community involvement, infrastructure works in national park areas and improved biodiversity
information management. Infrastructure works in national parks incorporated Bank standards for


                                                   15

EA and EIA for relevant activities. APN demonstrated excellent compliance with Bank standards,
and has a set of protocols for works in Parks which are comparable and applicable for all projects
through its Reglamento para la Evaluacion de Impacto Ambiental en Areas de la Administracion
de Parques Nacionales. These standards apply for all works whether or not they are financed by
the Bank. Supervision missions visited each protected area during the course of implementation,
and the project was consistently found to be in compliance. In the case of the access road for
"Condorito" the Lead Engineer for the QAT reviewed and cleared the environmental assessment
and mitigation plan, found it to be satisfactory, and recommended it as a best practice.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

APN has demonstrated a high level of commitment to the sustainability of the project objectives
and the Project supported parks are now fully incorporated into the APN system. This includes
allocation of the required levels of funding and personnel for the maintenance, care and use of the
facilities and equipment provided by the project to support the its objectives to expand and
diversify the existing National Protected Areas System (NPAS) into globally significant but
inadequately protected ecoregions. In addition, APN has recognized the value of the actions
carried out in the buffer zones with communities and individuals, and in consultative processes
with stakeholders for park management, and is incorporating these instruments into their overall
work program for the park system.

Next Phase:

The government of Argentina requested and obtained from the Bank financing for a new IBRD
project, Sustainable Natural Resource Management (SNRM), that takes into account the
experience with protected areas and sustainable activities in buffer zones with the GEF
Biodiversity Conservation Project. In addition, discussions are underway for a new GEF project
that would focus on rural corridors and biodiversity conservation needs in Patagonia and the Arid
Chaco. The SNRM Project was approved by the Bank on March 18, 2008 (Loan No 7520 AR) for
an amount of US $60 million and aims to improve the sustainable and efficient management of
forest resources, conserve biodiversity in protected areas and forest landscapes, and integrate
small producers into forestry development and conservation.

In 2005, the government developed the Federal Strategic Plan for Sustainable Tourism (PEFTS)
that provides the guiding principles for the PA sector over the next few years. Under the PEFTS,
national parks are considered a key element in conserving the natural resource base for
sustainable economic development. The new project is also underpinned by the UN Convention
to Combat Desertification and its national level implementation or national action plan (NAP),
and the components for biodiversity conservation of the new project are consistent with the
National Biodiversity Strategy adopted in 2003 by the Secretary of Environment and Sustainable
Development (Resolution 91/03). The new project will key on these by aiming to strengthen
management capacity of eleven priority protected areas and to upgrade APN's capacity in Buenos
Aires. The parks to be supported through the new project were identified as having high potential,
but lack the management capacity and infrastructure to provide needed levels of protection to
biodiversity while serving increased numbers of tourists.

The 2006 Argentina CAS emphasizes the promotion of agricultural growth, reducing rural
poverty, and improving environmental management. The CAS highlights the importance of the


                                                  16

forestry sector, while emphasizing that "Argentina's growth has long been, and will continue to
be, based in significant part on its tremendous natural comparative advantages" (Argentina
Country Assistance Strategy, May 4, 2006, Report No. 34015-AR). In this respect, the project
maintains a high degree of consistency and relevance with the present CAS and concerns of the
country.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project has a high degree of relevance to current country priorities and to the overall Bank
assistance strategy for Argentina. The project's design, objectives and implementation are
completely consistent with current development priorities, including the current Argentina CAS,
and that relevance is further reflected by the development and approval of a follow-on operation,
the Argentina Sustainable Natural Resource Management (SNRM) Project. (The proposed
follow-on GEF project, Rural Corridors and Biodiversity is presently in the concept identification
and description stage.)

The Government of Argentina places a high priority on improving the management and
conservation of native forests and protected areas. These sectors are the basis of significant
economic activity and are the source of innumerable positive externalities which benefit the
economy. Government commitment to the protected areas sector has increased, and APN's
budget raised from AR$28 million in 2002 to AR$131 million in 2008.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

D.O. 1:
Increase protection of biodiversity in ecological regions of global significance

The Project's objective to preserve biodiversity of global importance by enlarging and
diversifying the National System of Protected Areas and creating conditions for its permanent
management was fully completed by closure. Five protected areas, encompassing 391,464 ha,
were brought under full protection by the project and designated as national parks (the highest
level of protection in Argentina); the Quebrada del Condorito National Park (Cordoba Montane
Savanna), San Guillermo NP (Central Andean High Puna), Copo NP (Semi-Arid Chaco), and
Monte León NP (Patagonian Steppe and Oceanic Patagonian Littoral) and Mburucuyá (Humid
Chaco, Iberá Wetlands Ecosystem). All of these parks provide protection to ecosystems with
globally important biodiversity and were poorly represented in the system of protected areas at
inception. More than 300 different species of fauna have habitats in the parks, sixteen of which
are threatened (Appendix I CITES)1.


1First due to economic difficulties caused by the economic crisis of 2001-2003, and later because of legal
obstacles, the procurement of the Estancia San Nicolás for the Los Venados National Park (Pampas
Grassland) was not completed by closure. Notwithstanding, the project completed the objective of
supporting the creation of five new protected areas through the formal inclusion of Mburucuyá NP to the
project in 2006. The GEF-financed parks encompassed 391,464 ha of ha of high priority ecosystems at
closure, compared to the target area of 358,250 proposed to be protected at appraisal (109% of target).


                                                     17

Conditions for the permanent management of the five protected areas have been successfully
created by the project; including legal designation of the parks, infrastructure, vehicles and
equipment, boundary surveys, consultative commissions, participatory involvement of local
communities in subprojects and management planning, scientific studies and other actions. APN
assigned the required personnel to the parks, including rangers, fire-fighters, and administrative
staff. Each park now has its own operating budget through APN to ensure their sustainability and
the provinces have assigned rangers to the provincial reserves to ensure conservation in the buffer
zones.

The Quebrada del Condorito National Park consists of 37,364 hectares of montane savanna in the
Chaco Serrano ecosystem. Five properties were purchased by APN between 1998 and 1999 for an
amount equivalent to US $ 3.9 million . The Park provides critical protection for many important
species including tabaquillo (Polylepis australis), maitén (Maytenus boaria), andean condor
(Vultur grypheus), puma (Puma concolor), lagarto de Achala (Pristidactylus achalensis), red fox
(Pseudalopex culpaeus), grey fox (Pseudalopex gymnocercus), gato montés (Oncifelis geoffroyi),
Lobito de río (Lontra longicaudis), sapo de Achala (Chanus achalensis), crowned eagle
(Harpyhaliaetus coronatus), ratón plomizo (Akodon spegazzinii) among others, 4 of which are
threatened. Threats surrounding the protected area include overgrazing and fire. The park has 8
guards and 12 administrative personnel, as well as 4 fire fighters. The Biodiversity Conservation
Project supported 21 projects in the buffer zone surrounding the park.

The San Guillermo National Park consists of 160,000 hectares of high mountain desert with
herbaceous and bush steppe cover, located in the high Andean and Puna ecosystems. The
property was purchased by APN in 2000 for an amount equivalent to US $ 110,000, well below
its commercial value. The Park provides critical protection for many important animal species
including vicuña (Vicugna vicugna), guanaco (Lama guanicoe), andean cat (Oreaihurus jacobita),
Darwin´s rhea (Rhea pennata), red fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus), grey fox (Pseudalopex
gymnocercus), andean condor (Vultur grypheus), 4 of which are threatened. Threats surrounding
the park include mining and hunting. The park has 6 guards and 2 administrative staff. The
Project supported 22 projects in the buffer zone surrounding the park.

The Copo National Park consists of 114,250 hectares of forest and grasslands in the Semi-Arid
Chaco ecosystem. A provincial reserve was donated by the S. del Estero Province in 2000,
providing the lands for the park. Although, its estimated value was not estimated for procurement,
the land has a value of several million US $ equivalent. (Lands adjacent to the park are sold at
amounts around US $500/ha. for farming.) With the advent of the soy boom and new high levels
of deforestation in the Chaco associated with land clearing for cultivation, this park plays a key
role in ecosystem conservation. The Park provides critical protection for many important species
including quebracho colorado (Schinopsis lorentzii y balansae), quebracho blanco (Aspidosperma
quebracho-blanco), mistol (Ziziphus mistol), vinal (Prosopis ruscifolia), tatú carreta (Priodontes
maximus), three species of peccary (Catagonus wagneri, Pecari tajacu, Tayassu pecari), giant
anteater (Mirmecophaga tridactyla), boa (Boa constrictor), yaguareté (Panthera onca), Darwin´s
rhea (Rhea pennata), crowned eagle (Harpyhaliaetus coronatus), tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis),
6 of which are threatened. Threats surrounding the park include deforestation for agriculture, fire
and hunting. The park has 4 guards and 2 administrative personnel, as well as 2 fire fighters. The
Project supported 6 projects in the buffer zone surrounding the park.

The Monte León National Park consists of 62,168 hectares of steppe and 40 km of coast in the
Patagonian Steppe ecosystem and littoral and wetland habitat, and is the country's first coastal
protected area. The property was donated by the Patagonia Land Trust through FVSL in 2002 for


                                                 18

an amount equivalent to US $ 1.7 million. The Park provides critical protection for many
important species including guanaco (Lama guanicoe), Darwin´s rhea (Pterocnemia pennata),
pichi (Zaedyus pichiy), zorrino patagónico (Conepatus humboldtii), red fox (Pseudalopex
culpaeus), puma (Puma concolor), the hoarfrosted Hill´s Lizard (Liolaemus escarchadosi),
Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), three species of shags, including imperial shag
(Phalacrocórax atriceps), little grison (Galictis cuja) gaviotín sudamericano (Sterna
hirundinacea), coscoroba swan (Coscoroba coscoroba), balck necked swan (Cygnus
melanocorypha), lobo marino de un pelo (Otaria flavescens), peales dolphin (Lagenorhynchus
australis), Commerson´s Dolphin (Cephabrhynchus commersonii), coirón (Festuca pallescens),
Junellia (Junellia tridens) and green shrub (Lepidophyllum cupressiforme), one of which is
threatened. The penguin colony, with a population of apx. 150,000, is the fourth largest in the
country. Threats surrounding the park include fishing, hunting and fossil extraction. The park has
5 guards and 3 administrative personnel, as well as 1 fire fighter. The Biodiversity Conservation
Project supported 8 projects in the buffer zone surrounding the park.

The Mburucuyá National Park consists of 17,682 hectares of forest, grasslands, palm savanna and
wetlands in the Iberá wetlands ecosystem. Two properties were donated by Troels Pedersen to
APN in 1991 and the park created in 2002. Although, its estimated value was not needed for
procurement, the land has a value of several million US $ equivalent. The Park provides critical
protection for many important species including quebracho colorado chaqueño (Schinopsis
balansae), quebracho blanco (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco), urunday (Astronium balansae),
viraró (Pterogyne nitens), caranday (Copernicia alba), timbó (Enterolobium contorticiliquum),
cañambí guazú (Baccharis dracunculifoliael), palmares de yatay (Butia yatay), jabirú (Jabiru
mycteria), pileated parrot (Pionopsitta pileata), marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus), jaguarundi
(Herpailurus yaguarondi), Geoffroy´s cat (Oncifelis geoffroyi), neotropical river otter (Lontra
longicaudis), yacaré overo (Caiman latirostris), toco toucan (Ramphastos toco), great rhea (Rhea
americana), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), maned wolf ­ aguará guazú (Chrysocyon
brachyurus), Argentine tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis), azara´s fox (Pseudalopex gymnocercus),
capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) and black howler (Alouatta caraya), 7 of which are
threatened. Threats surrounding the park include fishing, hunting and wildfires. The park has 8
guards and 6 administrative personnel, as well as 4 fire fighters. The Biodiversity Conservation
Project supported 8 projects in the buffer zone surrounding the park.

The process of creating new protected areas included procuring lands through purchase or
donation, ceding the jurisdiction by the provinces to the federal government through a provincial
law, and acceptance of the land acquisitions as national parks through an act of Congress. When
activities began, Quebrada del Condorito NP had already been legally designated as a National
Park (1996). It was followed by San Guillermo (1998), Copo (2000), Mburucuyá (2002) and
Monte León (2004).

Guaranteeing institutional presence in the GEF-national parks has been a priority for APN
authorities. Personnel have been consistently assigned throughout implementation, and their
number has been growing. Although, the provincial reserves were slower to assign personnel, by
the end of 2007, several rangers had been permanently assigned to the provincial protected areas:
Quebrada del Condorito, San Guillermo, and Copo. (There are no provincial reserves adjacent to
the other parks.) The following table details park rangers and support personnel as of March
2008:

A total of 39 infrastructure projects were completed with project financing, including the
renovation of several existing buildings2. As a result, each park now has the infrastructure
required for protected-area management and visitor services. Works carried out include: two
dormitories for researchers in Copo NP and San Guillermo NP; two visitors' centers in Quebrada
del Condorito and Monte Leon; administrative offices in Copo, San Guillermo, Monte León, and
Mburucuyá; thirteen housing units for park rangers in the five parks and a number of auxiliary


2The infrastructure works were of very high quality. In 2006, the Argentine Central Society of Architects
(CSA) and the Professional Council of Architecture and Urbanism (PCAU) presented their national award
for the Best Institutional Architecture to the Copo National Park Administrative Center during its 11th Bi-
annual national competition. (The headquarters at Copo received honorable mention in the competition.)
The works were both esthetic and highly innovative, as they were adapted to the harsh conditions and very
high temperatures found in the Chaco ecosystem.

structures including sheds, stables, and parking lots. The access road to Quebrada del Condorito
was also built. Counterpart funds were used to repair trails and overlooks and do other small
repairs. Twenty-four works were planned, and thirty-seven were completed by the end of the
Project (125% completion against target values). For more detail, see the list of works for each
PA in Annex 2. In addition, each park was provided with vehicles and equipment (for
maintenance, camping, GPS, firefighting, AV and IT equipment).

To increase scientific knowledge and improve management of the Project's protected areas,
numerous scientific studies were carried out (see Annex 2 for list). These studies stand out:
baseline biodiversity studies with associated monitoring plans; participatory creation of
management plans; environmental evaluations of proposed works; an audiovisual program to
disseminate information relative to the "new GEF-supported parks"; new components that were
finalized in the process of institutional transformation; and infrastructure development at the
parks.

In conclusion, the development objective of increased protection of biodiversity in ecoregions of
global importance was completed. The parks were strengthened through a new and improved
institutional presence, protected-area management planning, scientific studies and monitoring of
biodiversity, construction and/or renovation of infrastructure, and provision of vehicles and
equipment.

D.O. 2: Promotion of sustainable use of biodiversity in areas adjacent to protected areas

Sustainable use subprojects in the buffer zones were key tools for involving local communities,
families and individuals in activities that support the parks' conservation objectives. During the
course of the project, 568 families living near the parks participated in 65 sub-projects, along with
other stakeholders. Buffer-zone subprojects were received with great enthusiasm by the
beneficiaries, and the individual park's staff acknowledged their importance in helping to
improve conservation, and involve stakeholders in park management objectives. By ensuring that
the buffer zone areas adjacent to parks are more sustainably managed the core protected areas are
better protected. Sub-projects also helped to sensitize local farmers, students and landowners
relative to the importance of conservation and the environment. Thematic categories for
subprojects were (i) sustainable production, (ii) applied studies, and (iii) training. Specific themes
eligible for each park were identified and prioritized through a socio-economic analysis in park
buffer zones. APN promoted the participation of local stakeholders and conducted an open
request for proposals to ensure broad participation.

Productive subprojects (21 total) helped to diversify farming systems and make them more
compatible with the surrounding ecosystems. Themes included beekeeping, agriculture with
native species, fruit and vegetable farming, rearing of small animals, production of photovoltaic
energy, water, and eco-tourism services. The subprojects helped strengthen the process of
community organization among the beneficiaries as many were executed by groups or
communities, which increased the likelihood of their sustainability.

Applied-study subprojects (12 total) covered research themes such as factors affecting livestock
production, surveys of exotic species, local knowledge of flora and fauna, water quality and
others. Several of the applied studies systematized disparate information about natural resources
and are the basis of research theses in Universities, particularly in biological disciplines. Many of
the studies published their results and bibliographies for use as teaching material. Cooperative
efforts carried out in the project have helped to stimulate partnerships between the parks and
other organizations for future efforts as well.


                                                  21

Training subprojects (32 total) covered themes including animal health, environmental education,
local use of native plants, and others. Training projects included support for the organization and
institutional strengthening of local groups, the creation and management of producer associations,
participative resource management, and the identification and formulation of project proposals.
Some productive activities were developed in parallel with training events to ensure that residents
had the knowledge as well as the resources to complete the work. In addition, the project carried
out training in marketing and social organization. Teachers and students received training which
helped to increase their awareness of natural resource conservation and sustainable use.

(Annex 2 describes the subprojects in detail.)

The physical progress of subprojects was approximately 400% of the target objectives, and park
personnel and beneficiaries showed a high degree of appreciation for them. In the opinion of APN
park/project staff working in the program, subproject activities have improved conditions in the
ecosystems around the parks and the relationship with the stakeholders in the area. As a result of
the successes in the GEF project, APN has decided to include buffer-zone subprojects in the new
IBRD operation (Sustainable Management of Natural Resources, loan 7520 AR) in 11 other
parks.

D.O. 3: Increase of public participation in the creation and protection of each protected
area

One key tool for conserving biodiversity is the involvement and active participation of local
stakeholders associated with the protected areas (those that live in the area or engage in activities
related to the protected area). Because ecosystems extend across frequently arbitrary park
boundaries and land holdings, to conserve biodiversity local land owners and other stakeholders
need to participate in their creation and protection. Park-specific approaches were developed for
public participation, and included establishing and operating consultative commissions and
sponsoring training events. Consultative Commissions were created for each of the five areas
involved and a total of 53 commission meetings were held.

                                                  22

The Consultative Commissions addressed issues including: defining internal regulations;
technical assistance, participation and priority setting for subprojects; participatory development
of management plans; assistance and participation of technical studies; workshops for training
and information dissemination; and evaluation of monitoring plans. During the project, 15
specific workshops were held to provide local stakeholder feedback to proposed park
management plans. The workshops helped to address social, economic, conservation and
livelihood issues in and around the park and ensured their consideration in the final plans.
Participants included APN, residents, technicians, and local government officials. Surveys of
Consultative Commission members (2003-2008) in QCNP, SGNP, and CNP indicated a high
level of satisfaction by participants. At closure, the commissions in QCNP and SGNP were
transformed into Local Advisory Commissions or Comisiones Asesoras Locales (CAL), APN's
own version of the GEF consultative commissions.

Within the framework of the project and in compliance with Bank regulations (DO 4.30) and
APN policy, a mitigation plan was implemented for residents living within the created parks. This
plan included training and small improvements in housing, incorporating one family member into
the local APN park staff (QCNP), hiring and later processing retirement benefits for a farmhand
in MLNP, and hiring two members of one family in Copo to work for APN as park staff. Results
from surveys of QC residents (2003-2006) showed mitigation plan participants were satisfied
with the mitigation measures and income levels through their participation in the plan. APN has a
policy of no involuntary re-settlement, and remained in compliance throughout the project.

This development objective has been fully achieved, and exceeds the targets established at
appraisal.

D.O. 4: Increase access to biodiversity data

At the close of the project, the Biodiversity Information System (BIS) was complete and on line
at www.sib.gov.ar. The following information is now available through the site; 3,196 source
documents, 227 maps, 458 species photographs, and information about 24,267 species,
subspecies, and varieties of flora, 13,842 species of fauna, 2,081 of mushrooms, and 244 of
bacteria and cyanophytes. The information is fully accessible to both internal and external users
through the internet. The BIS website has over 75,000 visitors a year.

The BIS is organized into five geographic nodes. Each is responsible for data entry and database
management of regional information, and website management. The main (headquarters) node is
of national scope and is overseen by the National Directorate of Conservation of Protected Areas
in APN. The other four are of regional scope and are overseen by the four Regional Delegations:
Patagonia, Central, Northwest (NOA), Northeast (NEA) and Casa Central (Headquarters). Each
node possesses basic computer equipment for data entry (alphanumeric and spatial), processing,
and dissemination of information through the BIS website. Each node has three technical
specialists, one leader and two for data entry and GIS.

Nodes collect, organize, review, quality control and enter data/information about the protected
areas' biodiversity for its respective geographic area; the information is later transferred to the
Internet. The BIS supports query functions to support information needs/analyses of the Regional
Delegations and other APN users. Various databases include information on public use in park
areas, residents, biological surveys (flora and fauna), land registries, fires, etc. and can be linked
to support complex analyses or queries.




                                                  23

As a result of the project, in November 2007 (APN Resolution No 548/2007) the BIS
organization and management structure was approved, defining the system's primary objectives
and responsibilities. Since that time, the BIS project has been operating with APN resources,
which, together with the incorporation into APN, 12 former project staff, assures its sustainability
and growth. The website currently has an average of 6,521 visitors per month and an average load
of 1.5 to 2 GB. Under APN's direction the BIS is still growing and several new activities are now
underway, including development of a new webpage with improved accessibility; continued
database development and new intra- and inter-operability for external and internal users.

This development objective has been completely achieved, the BIS is fully functioning, supported
by APN, and has compiled an impressive amount of biodiversity information which is being used
extensively by APN and external audiences (100% of target value). The system's sustainability is
assured through the financing and support of APN. The BIS has its own annual budget,
operational and long-term plans that guarantee its continued growth and development. The
Biodiversity Information Management component contributes to the Argentine National
Information Management responsibilities as defined in the Convention on Biological Diversity.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

During the project appraisal, an economic and financial analysis for the GEF project was not
carried out due to the nature of the project ­ strict biodiversity conservation with limited
visitation, as opposed to economic (eg. tourist) development. However, it was agreed at closure
that it would be meaningful to conduct such analyses in order to gain insight into the fiscal
impacts of the parks, and the extent to which they would be sustainable over time.

Cost effectiveness. The project established five national parks and outfitted them with modern
infrastructure, equipment and trained personnel needed to ensure their startup and long-term
sustainability. It also established a state-of-the-art biodiversity information system on the internet,
which has approximately 75,000 visitors annually. The economic benefits of the project were (i)
strengthening and expansion of the national protected area system, (ii) improvement of tourism
services through modern park facilities, (iii) the deployment of a biodiversity information system
useful for planning and system maintenance of the national parks administration, and (iv) the
protection of biodiversity and environmental goods and services; including water, soil and bio-
carbon assets.

Efficiency. The principal beneficiary is the government agency, APN, responsible for managing
the national parks system. The procurement and management of five parks provide for increased
biodiversity conservation in high priority ecosystems of global importance in Argentina. Along
with the biodiversity, valuable environmental goods and services in and around the park are also
being conserved. This includes the protection of watersheds and wetlands (San Guillermo,
Quebrada de Condorito and Mburucuyá), which are important to help regulate water quality,
quantity and regimen; protection of soils (Copo, Condorito and Monte Leon), which are
prevented from degradation and depletion due to unsustainable cropping and overgrazing; and
forests (all areas except Monte Leon) for carbon storage and the regulation of greenhouse gasses.
The total area placed under conservation, 391,464 ha, was accomplished at an est. cost of apx. US
$58 per ha, including land purchases. Excluding land purchases the costs are about US $43 per ha.

Costs of conservation are a function of many variables; stakeholder consultations, boundary
demarcation, land purchase, construction of infrastructure, compensation and planning (Brunner,


                                                   24

Gullison and Balmfold 2004). In addition, the complexity of the ecosystems; frequency, severity
and intensity of threats; and the size of area (needed to achieve economies of scale) influence the
costs. Because of the wide range of situations, there are no global standards that can be used to
measure the efficiency of the project. This said, however, the indication is that the project was
highly efficient when comparing costs of conservation to, for example, establishment costs of
other land uses; with costs of US ~$800 per ha for forestry establishment and US ~$300+ per ha
for establishment of grains in Argentina (excluding land, maintenance and harvesting costs).

The BIS has increased the efficiency of APN in many of its system planning and park
management activities. This was accomplished by compiling, digitizing and making available a
wide range of information on biodiversity and related issues relevant for park managers and
administrators to support APNs goals. The BIS supports internal and external queries and enables
users to quickly and efficiently find and analyze biodiversity information. In the preparation of
the follow-on IBRD project, APN and the Bank preparation teams used the BIS extensively to
identify relevant information on protected areas and their biodiversity, threats, and other issues
needed to support the formulation effort.

Financial Analysis.The five protected areas supported by the GEF project focused on strict
biodiversity conservation with limited visitation in five high-priority ecosystems: Cordoba
Montane Savanna (QCNP), Central Andean Dry Puna (SGNP), Semi-arid Chaco (CNP),
Patagonian Steppe (MLNP) and Humid Chaco-Iberá Wetlands (MNP). At closure, the project had
succeeded in placing 391,464 ha under strict protection. The infrastructure investments realized
through the GEF project improved the conservation and management of the areas, and helped to
"graduate" the parks to comply with APN criteria for charging admissions, and therefore
generating revenue. At the end of the project, over 16 thousand people visited the GEF-financed
parks each year (excluding SGNP). By comparison, visitation rates were effectively zero at
inception, as the parks did not exist. Had APN charged admission to the parks in 2007, the gross
income would have been around US $36 thousand. This is however offset by annual operating
costs of about US $1.3 million. Consequently, it is no surprise that, as stand alone parks, each of
the GEF-financed protected areas was shown to have negative FIRRs. (The best FIRR was for
QCNP at -4 percent.) On the other hand, as part of the blending arrangement with the IBRD-
financed parks, and as part of the overall APN system the GEF-financed activities are considered
to be fully sustainable over time.

Increased revenues generated from the IBRD operation more than offset the operating costs
associated with the new GEF financed parks, indicating the blending arrangement was the correct
approach. IBRD-financed parks generated over US $ 25 million annually by closure, representing
over 50 percent of total park revenues. The protected areas component of the sister-Native Forests
and Protected Areas project focused on four high visibility parks in Patagonia: Lanin, Los Alerces,
Nahuel Huapi and Glaciares that total 2.1 million hectares; around 75% of the parks system
coverage at the time of appraisal. The infrastructure investments realized through the IBRD
project enhanced the quantity and quality of infrastructure and services available at the four parks,
and improved the visitors' experience. Revenues and visitation rates increased significantly at
each.

Revenues from the four (IBRD) parks supported under the Native Forests/Protected Areas project
rose significantly from US $5.6 million in 2000 to US $25.3 million in 2006. As a percentage of
total park revenues for 2000 and 2006, those figures represent a jump from 35 percent to 53
percent, respectively.

The financial analysis results and comparisons are as follows:

In conclusion, as a result of the blending with the IBRD operation and the incorporation of the
GEF project parks into the overall APN system, the goal of ensuring the five new parks are
sustainable over time is considered successful. This finding is further substantiated by the fact
that each of the 5 Project-supported parks is now receiving annual allocations from APN (see
table below), who has assumed all associated costs of the parks from the GEF3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of GEOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory

The project achieved all of its development objectives. The 2006 CAS reaffirms the relevance of
those objectives. The establishment of the five new national parks ensures the protection of
391,464 ha. All these parks belong to ecoregions with globally important biodiversity and were
poorly represented in the system of protected areas at inception. More than 300 different species
of fauna have habitats in the parks, sixteen of which are threatened (Appendix I CITES). High
quality infrastructure works, with designs appropriate to each environment, were completed in all
of the new parks. Sustainable activities in buffer areas contributed directly to the sustainable use
and conservation of biodiversity and involvement and participation by stakeholders was high.
Argentine biodiversity information is now available on the internet. Although the duration of the
project was long (9 years, 9 months), the project was approved with an 8 year timeframe, based
on the standard disbursement profile for Argentina at the time of appraisal. Moreover, the 21
month delay was largely due to the impacts of the economic crisis, which could not be predicted
at appraisal. The project should therefore be considered satisfactory. Achievements were high by
the project and continue to provide positive impacts and externalities.4




3In 2008, APN's budget increased by AR$40 million over the previous year to AR$131 million with
important additions in field personnel and infrastructure investments.

4While the last ISR rated the project moderately satisfactory, a Quality Enhancement Review (QER) for
the ICR (Sept. 18, 2008) concluded that this rating was low based on the project's high achievements. The
QER recommended an overall rating of satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not applicable

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The creation of new protected areas, including new infrastructure, provision of equipment and
technical studies have strengthened APN by increasing the area and quality of protection the
institution provides to high priority ecosystems. APN has fully incorporated the parks into the
protected area system, assigned personnel to manage them, and provides for their long-term
financing. The 2008 APN budget has increased by AR$40 million over the last year to AR$131
million with important additions in field personnel and infrastructure investments. Infrastructure
investments have improved the visitor experience, providing improved opportunities for greater
financial sustainability of the parks through revenues generated by tourism.

The development of sustainable activities with local producers and communities in the buffer
zone areas of the parks was an innovative for APN, who has now embraced it and is replicating it
in the new project with the Bank (Sustainable Natural Resource Management Project, Ln 7520
Ar.) in the 11 protected areas.

The Biodiversity Information System developed by the project is a completely new tool for APN
and has helped to increase institutional efficiency and improve the Administration's planning and
management of protected areas. The BIS was completely absorbed by APN at closure, who has
taken over the responsibility for technical planning/management and the financing of personnel
needed to maintain the system and help it grow. The BIS is widely available to APN personnel
and external users, and is also helping the country to meet its commitments under the Convention
on Biological Diversity.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

The project highlighted the need for increased protection of grasslands, which helped to promote
the incorporation of Campos de Tuyu, a private grasslands reserve, into the APN system.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

The risks to development outcome are low given that the support for the project's activities has
been embraced, fully supported and financed by the government. The country approved new
legislation for the formal transformation of newly procured lands into national parks, and the
provinces approved corresponding legislation to support the transformation. The "national park"
designation provides the highest level of protection to the biological resources of the area. In
addition, the consultative commissions, which involve non-APN stakeholders and communities in
park management decisions, have helped to ensure that development outcomes are supported by
the surrounding populations. The Biodiversity Information System is up and running; has a long-
term plan for development; and is fully financed by APN. Sustainable development activities are
being supported in other APN parks.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the operation was satisfactory
and the resulting project was highly pertinent to both Bank and country priorities. The Bank
conducted an appropriate diagnosis of the current state of important biodiversity issues, threats
and alternatives for confronting them, highlighting the need for a highly participative process,
fundamental for a country with diverse environmental systems and potentially conflictive natural
resource management issues. The Bank correctly focused its efforts on strengthening the physical
and human resources of the protected areas in critical ecosystems. The performance of the Bank
staff and technical teams in ensuring quality at entry was highly satisfactory, as it collaborated
proactively on issues which arose during preparation. The project was reviewed by the Quality
Assurance Group in 2004 and was rated "highly satisfactory" for its focus on development
objectives.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

Two task managers managed the project. The Bank team developed a strong collaboration with
the Borrower. The team's experience and technical quality contributed substantially to the
success of implementation and monitored the progress. On average, supervision missions were
carried out two or three times a year with 21 supervision missions in total. (The 2004 QAG
Review of Supervision rated supervision overall as satisfactory.) The combined knowledge of the
Bank team in addressing similar environmental problems in other countries and situations
strengthened, enriched, and helped to guide the project's evolution. The FAO-World Bank
Cooperative Programme (FAO-CP) made strong contributions to project supervision as well
providing key technical supervision that would not have otherwise been available.

During the financial crisis, the Bank team worked diligently with the PIUs to keep the project
from failing, when counterpart resources were sharply reduced. The project was one of few Bank-
financed projects that made progress and received at least some government counterpart funding
during that time. To help mitigate the effects of shortages of counterpart funds, in 2003 the team
processed an amendment to increase the percentage of GEF resources required for
implementation from 88% and to 100% for "Works", from 82% to 100% for equipment. This had
a very positive impact on the project, and helped to boost implementation during the crisis as
lesser amounts of scarce counterpart funds were needed to fund the project activities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

In consideration of the ratings for preparation and supervision (above), the overall rating is
considered satisfactory. In addition, the 2004 Quality of Supervision Assessment noted, "...[that]
the panel felt that the solid prospects of achieving the DO ... against a backdrop of economic
crisis is in no small measure the result of a well-focused project design, a realistic assessment of
what progress could be made, as well as a capable and diligent supervision team."

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

In general, the Government of Argentina supported project preparation and implementation. They
gave priority to conservation, and collaborated with all work required by the Bank. During the
crisis years the government provided counterpart funds to the extent possible, and helped the line
agencies when called upon to do so. The federal government, including the President, Senate and
the national congress, approved the new laws required to form the national parks, as did the
provincial governments.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The PIUs were composed of qualified technical professionals and administrative staff. Based on
the number and diversity of programs, subprojects, and activities implemented under the project
and supervised by the PIU, it was highly efficient in its work. They also collaborated with the
National General Auditor in project audits, and incorporated comments received into its
operations.

Collectively, the PIU staff demonstrated a high degree of dedication to their work and during the
project's lifetime conducted 58 workshops, and processed over 400 separate contracts (for
consultants services,and works). During the crisis, APN was able to maintain the project staff,
who prevented the project from failing.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is considered satisfactory given the level of government
commitment during the project's tenure to provide the funding for execution, satisfactory
performance of the line agencies, including the high levels of results obtained and the high
sustainability of impacts generated. There were no cases of corruption, misprocurement nor
safeguards violations during the project's tenure.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Wide General Application:

Lesson One: Development is not a linear process, and processes need to be sufficiently flexible
to adapt to changes on the ground. Although the project experienced some setbacks, including
delays and difficulties during implementation, it managed to produce highly relevant impacts for
the protected area sector by closing. The Bank, as an institution, should ensure that its instruments,
philosophy and approaches to development are flexible enough to adapt to the changing country
conditions, while maintaining focus on the project development objectives.

Lesson Two: The creation of a protected area is a complex process that involves diverse actors
and requires substantial coordination. In future projects, sufficient time should be allocated



                                                29

according to the complexity of participatory processed and taking into account the number of
actors and decision makers involved. This is especially important in situations where a diverse
spectrum of stakeholders are concerned (private land holders, intermediary agents, stakeholders,
federal and provincial governments). Participation is critical at all levels, yet it is time consuming
and the outcomes are unpredictable.

Lesson Three: Monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity should be carried out at ecosystem
levels. Biodiversity can be assessed at either the ecosystem, species or genetic levels. Because of
the operational nature of GEF- and IBRD-financed projects, the use of highly detailed scientific
studies is not always feasible. The use of ecosystem evaluations, through, for example, remote
sensing surveys, can help to determine the extent to which habitats for key species are being
protected. This can be a more practical approach than, for example, monitoring indicator species
themselves, which entails costly and difficult field surveys.

Project Specific:

Lesson Four: Local participation in the management of protected areas is a key tool for
enhancing conservation. The project generated local participation through the consultative
commissions, training events, validation workshops and sustainable use subprojects. Persons in
the buffer zone areas showed a high degree of interest in participating and their involvement is
considered key to ameliorating threats along the protected area borders, and contributing
positively to the protection and integrity of the ecosystems targeted for conservation.

Lesson Five: Because local populations rarely are organized under formal charter
organization and "intermediary agents" not found in many remote areas, project
implementation arrangements must be sufficiently flexible to correspond to the reality on the
ground. Frequently qualified organizations needed to assist local populations in buffer-zone
subprojects do not exist in the remote areas, which are frequently the site of conservation
activities. Seed funds should be made available for formulation of sub-project activities and their
use should be sufficiently flexible to attract qualified intermediary agents to participate in remote
rural areas. Sub-project development costs, including travel-related expenses, need to be covered
by the seed funds.

Lesson Six: Administrative processes should be agile and compatible with the capacity of
beneficiaries and intermediary agents involved in sub-project activities. Administrative
processes associated with sustainable use (buffer zone) activities need to be kept simple, as
most rural beneficiaries and some intermediary agents are not likely to have experience in funds
management. Participants may require training to handle funds. Co-mingling government and
project funds can complicate disbursements and should be avoided.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Comments on Draft ICR from The National Parks Administration (APN):

Comment 1:

APN: The project constructed four rangers quarters in Monte Leon, not two as indicated in the
draft report.




                                                  30

Bank comment: APN has verified that four rangers' quarters were built in Monte Leon NP by the
project, and this has been corrected in the final version of the report.

Comment 2:

APN: The total number of consultative commission workshops/meetings held was 53 (not 57 as
indicated in the draft report), as follows: 15 in Quebrada del Condorito, 6 in San Guillermo, 17 in
Copo, 12 in Monte León, and 3 in Mburucuyä.
Bank comment: APN has verified that there were 53 consultative commission meetings and the
final report has been amended to include this.

Comment 3:

APN: There were two Task Managers during the course of the project, not three.
Bank Comment: Agreed. The quantity of "three" appeared in the summary of the APN report in
order to reflect the accuracy of APN reporting. However, this has now been amended in the final
version of the ICR.

Overall Comments/Summary:

APN considers the project and ICR acceptable and the project as satisfactory. A summary of their
report is found in Annex 7.

degree of dedication to their work and during the project's lifetime conducted 58 workshops, and
processed over 400 separate contracts (for consultancy services and works). Each collaborated
with the National General Auditor in project audits, and incorporated comments received into its
operations.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

During the project appraisal, an economic and financial analysis for the GEF project was not
carried out due to the nature of the project ­ strict biodiversity conservation with limited
visitation, as opposed to economic (tourist) development. However, it was agreed at closure that
it would be meaningful to conduct such analyses would be useful in order to gain insight into the
fiscal impacts of the parks, and the extent to which they would be sustainable over time. Two
approaches were taken:

    (i)      the first was to analyze the GEF-financed parks as stand alone, and
    (ii)     the second was to analyze the project parks in conjunction with the four parks
             financed through the IBRD Native Forests and Protected Areas Project, which was
             semi-blended to the GEF project

As stand alone parks, each of the GEF-financed parks was shown to have negative FIRRs.
However, the analyses showed that QCNP and MLNP might begin to show positive net revenue
around years 12 and 19, respectively. CNP and MNP were not expected to show positive net
earnings. The main driver for increased revenue is tourist income, and the model is most sensitive
to this factor. (Insufficient data existed for SGNP to calculate projected cash flows, principally
visitor logs.)

While the GEF-financed parks are not self-sustaining, as part of the blending arrangement with
the IBRD parks, and overall APN system they are. Increased revenues generated from the IBRD
operation more than offset the operating costs associated with the new GEF project parks,
indicating the blending arrangement was the correct approach. IBRD-financed parks generated
over US $ 25 million annually by closure, representing over 50 percent of total park revenues.

Economic analysis

Component A ­ Protected Areas

The main achievements of the component included the establishment and management of
protected areas and associated technical and legal work needed to ensure their procurement and
management.

The principal beneficiary is the government agency, APN, responsible for managing the national
parks system. The procurement and management of five parks provide for increased biodiversity
conservation in high priority ecosystems of global importance in Argentina. Along with the
biodiversity, valuable environmental goods and services in and around the park are also being
conserved. This includes the protection of watersheds and wetlands (San Guillermo, Quebrada de
Condorito and Mburucuyá), which are important to help regulate water quality, quantity and
regimen; protection of soils (Copo and Monte Leon), which are prevented from degradation and
depletion due to unsustainable cropping and overgrazing; and forests (all areas except Monte
Leon) for carbon storage and the regulation of greenhouse gasses. The total area placed under
conservation, 391,464 ha, was accomplished at an est. cost of apx. US $58 per ha, including land
purchases. Excluding land purchases the costs are about US $43 per ha.

Costs of conservation are a function of many variables; stakeholder consultations, boundary
demarcation, land purchase, construction of infrastructure, compensation and planning (Brunner,



                                                  52

Gullison and Balmfold 2004). In addition, the complexity of the ecosystems; frequency and
intensity of threats; and the size of area (needed to achieve economies of scale) influence the
costs. Because of the wide range of possibilities and situations, there are no standardized
comparable costs to measure the efficiency of the project. This said, however, the indication is
that the project was highly efficient when comparing costs of conservation to, for example, other
land uses; with costs of US ~$800 per ha for forestry establishment and US ~$300+ per ha for
establishment of grains in Argentina (excluding land, maintenance and harvesting costs).

While there are presently no revenues generated from the GEF-financed parks, the project has
made it possible for them to do so through the provision of new visitor services and facilities to
ensure the management of the areas (visitor centers, administration offices, ranger housing, toilets,
camping and picnic areas, access roads, etc). Had the GEF-financed parks (excluding SGNP)
charged admissions fees, by the final year of the project they would have generated a modest
amount of revenue that year, around US $ 36 thousand total for four parks.

One of the benefits of twinning the GEF project with the IBRD Native Forests and Protected
Areas Project in a semi-blended arrangement was the possibility to address both conservation and
tourism objectives simultaneously. Increased revenues generated from the associated IBRD
operation through tourism are shown to substantially offset the operating costs associated with the
GEF project-financed parks and validate the original approach. Revenues from the four (IBRD)
parks supported under the Native Forests/Protected Areas project rose significantly from US $5.6
million in 2000 to US $25.3 million in 2006. The GEF-financed parks are also fully incorporated
into the APN system and now receive an annual budget allocation from APN, totaling about US
$1.3 million.

Component B ­ Biodiversity Information System

The biodiversity information system provides a dynamic tool for internal APN users and external
visitors to the website with the best information on biodiversity, available in Argentina. The BIS
logs about 75,000 external visitors to its website each year. The system has proven to be a useful
tool for APN in the planning and management of its parks. As its single best repository for
biodiversity information, internal users can formulate and carryout queries concerning flora,
fauna and other information needed for park management. During the preparation of the new
IBRD Sustainable Natural Resources Management Project, both the Bank and APN teams used
the database to support project development and planning. In this way, the BIS greatly improved
the efficiency of APN in bringing new areas under conservation, as well as system-wide costs
needed to support the existing protected areas with information needed for their management.

Financial analysis

Stand-alone analysis. The five protected areas supported by the GEF project focused on strict
biodiversity conservation with limited visitation in five high-priority ecosystems: Cordoba
Montane Savanna (QCNP), Central Andean Dry Puna (SGNP), Semi-arid Chaco (CNP),
Patagonian Steppe (MLNP) and Humid Chaco-Iberá Wetlands (MNP). At closure, the project had
succeeded in placing 391,464 ha under strict protection.

The infrastructure investments realized through the GEF project improved the conservation and
management of the areas, and helped to "graduate" the parks to comply with APN criteria for
charging admissions, and therefore generating revenue. At the end of the project, over 16
thousand people visited the GEF-financed parks each year (excluding SGNP). By comparison,
visitation rates were effectively zero at inception, as the parks did not exist. Had APN charged


                                                  53

admission to the parks in 2007, the gross income would have been around US $36 thousand. This
is however offset by annual operating costs of about US $1.3 million.

The streams of incremental revenue were calculated over a 20 year period for four of the five
parks. (Insufficient data existed for SGNP.) Actual data were used up to 2007 for theoretical
revenues, based on a 7 peso per person entrance fee, and up to 2008 for individual park's
operating costs. The annual rate of visitation, which is assumed to be the main form of revenue,
was calculated independently for each park. For CNP and MNP, annual increases in rates of
visitation were projected at 10 percent, based on their remote locations.

For QCNP, park officials believe that once the access to the highway is complete next year by
the province, visitors could easily triple. This is plausible given the proximity of the park to the
major city of Cordoba. After that, it was assumed that rates would fall to the average annual rate
of increase for Argentina's parks of about 30 percent, then level off at 10 percent after 5 years.
For MLNP, even though the park is remote, the transportation infrastructure to the park is
excellent, and the penguin colony is proving to be an important tourist attraction. Visitors
frequently travel in groups from Rio Gallegos to the park, spend the day and return. Therefore the
average annual rate of increase for visitation to Argentine parks (30 percent) was used for the
first 10 years, and the standard worldwide rate of 10 percent thereafter.

Cash flow analysis based on the projected possible revenue show that QCNP is likely to have a
positive cash flow in about 10 years, and MLNP in around 20 years. The other parks are not
likely to have positive cash flows. FIRRs showed that all of the parks have negative rates of
return. QCNP had the best return, but this still was only -4 percent. The conclusion of the stand-
alone analysis is that the GEF-financed parks are not financially viable. On the other hand, they
were not intended to be.

Semi-blended analysis. The protected areas component of the sister-Native Forests and Protected
Areas project focused on four high visibility parks in Patagonia: Lanin, Los Alerces, Nahuel
Huapi and Glaciares that total 2.1 million hectares; around 75% of the parks system coverage at
the time of appraisal. The infrastructure investments realized through the IBRD project greatly
enhanced the quantity and quality of infrastructure and services available at the four parks, and
improved the visitors' experience. Revenues and visitation rates increased significantly at each.

Revenues from the four (IBRD) parks supported under the Native Forests/Protected Areas project
rose significantly from US $5.6 million in 2000 to US $25.3 million in 2006. As a percentage of
total park revenues for 2000 and 2006, those figures represent a jump from 35 percent to 53
percent, respectively.

The financial analysis results and comparisons are as follows:

      IBRD Project Parks              FIRR At Appraisal (%)                  FIRR at ICR (%)
Lanin                                              16                                13
Nauel Huapi                                        13                                32
Los Alerces                                        36                                 8
Los Glacares                                       11                                57

In conclusion, because of the blending with the IBRD operation and the incorporation of the GEF
project parks into the overall APN system, the goal of ensuring the parks are financially
sustainable is considered successful. This finding is further substantiated by the fact that each of
the 5 Project supported parks is now receiving annual allocations from APN (see table below),


                                                   54

who has assumed all associated costs of the parks from the GEF. (The overall 2008 APN budget
has increased by AR$40 million over the last year to AR$131 million with important additions in
field personnel and infrastructure investments.)

   GEF Project - Protected Areas              2008 Budget (US $)
        Quebrada del Condorito                      270,016
             San Guillermo                          349,253
                  Copo                              234,287
              Monte León                            239,589
              Mburucuyá                             197,727

Finally, although the Project supported parks still do not charge entrance fees, they are now ready
to so as the infrastructure investments have improved visitor services and set the stage for APN to
begin to generate modest amounts of revenue.

Conclusion

The analysis indicates that the decision to blend the GEF Biodiversity Conservation Project with
the IBRD Native Forests and Protected Areas Project was correct. While the GEF project is not
self-sustaining in a stand-alone form, its blending with the IBRD and the formal incorporation of
the parks into the APN system ensures their sustainability. The 5 Project-supported parks are now
ready to generate revenues through entrance fees and some will likely begin to charge them in
2009. At the same time, it is important to emphasize that the objective of the GEF was strict
biodiversity conservation, and it has achieved this, with the sustainability of outcomes ensured
through its incorporation into the wider APN system, including the parks supported by the
partially-blended IBRD project, which are the main sources of revenue for APN.

INTRODUCTION

In 1998, the GEF Biodiversity Conservation Project (BCP) was approved and began its
implementation by APN, under the SRNyAH. Shortly thereafter, APN was transferred to
the Ministry of Tourism, where it remains today. The BCP's objectives are to

    · expand and diversify the existing National Protected Areas System (NPAS) to
       include several of the country's most globally significant but inadequately
       protected ecoregions
    · create the conditions for their sustainable management through investments in
       institutional strengthening, refined mechanisms of consultation and participation,
       and improved biodiversity information management.

The project has three main components (a) Protected Areas, (b) Biodiversity Information
Management and (c) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The project's
main beneficiaries are

    ·  The government institutions responsible for the management and sustainable
       development of protected areas;
    ·  Rural populations in the zone of influence (and within the protected areas in
       certain areas);
    ·  Park visitors (through the provision of improved facilities, management and
       services in the new parks);
    ·  The tourism sector (through new infrastructure which attracts increased numbers
       of park visitors to rural areas);
    ·  The education sector (through the development of teaching materials and training
       programs for rural schools relative to conservation)

RESULTS

Component A "Protected Areas". The main goal of the component was the
establishment of five national parks in priority ecosystems, including the

    · Pampas
    · Central Andean Dry Puna
    · Semi-Arid Chaco
    · Córdoba Montane Savannas
    · Patagonian Steppe and littoral and wetland habitat

During implementation, four parks were established in the above ecosystems, and a fifth
in the Humid Chaco. Activities financed by the project included

    · Procurement of lands


                                             59

    · Land titling
    · Boundary surveys
    · Designation of the procured areas as national parks
    · Institutionalization of the parks (within APN)
    · Investments in works and equipment
    · Assigning permanent park personnel to the new areas
    · Sustainable Development Projects in buffer zones
    · Public Participation
    · Mitigation of social situations

Rating for Component A. Satisfactory.

The project supported the establishment of five national parks in priority ecosystems,
assigning 31 park rangers and 36 administrative and support staff to them, completing 39
infrastructure works, 53 meetings of consultative commissions, 8 families included in
mitigation activities reducing impacts in the parks due to incursions and disturbances,
monitoring of biodiversity indicator species, and the completion of 62 subprojects in the
buffer zones. (The project did not finalize the establishment of a national park in an area
of Pampas grassland, as originally proposed. Instead, it included a national park in the
Humid Chaco, also identified as a high priority for biodiversity conservation. )

Component B. Biodiversity Information Management. The main objective of the
component was to provide ready access of information for decision makers concerning
conservation issues and the sustainable use of biodiversity. The component completed the
establishment of five data management nodes in various geographic regions of Argentina,
including:

    · Headquarters, Buenos Aires
    · Patagonia
    · Central Region
    · Northwest Region
    · Northeast Region

Each node now collects, organizes, reviews, quality controls and enters data/information
about the protected areas in its respective geographic area; the information is later
transferred to the Internet. The Buenos Aires nodes coordinates the work Information is
processed at each node using databases developed by the Patagonia node. Several
individual databases are supported, including those for public use, residents, biological
surveys, land registry, fires, etc. and can be linked to conduct various queries.

Rating for Component B. Highly Satisfactory

The Biodiversity Information System (BIS) was completed and on the internet at
www.sib.gov.ar , and includes 3,196 source documents, 227 maps, 458 species
photographs, and information about 24,267 species, subspecies, and varieties of flora,
13,842 species of fauna, 2,081 of mushrooms, and 244 of bacteria and cyanophytes. The


                                              60

five data management nodes are fully operational and BIS personnel have been hired by
APN to continue the work. The BIS has an annual budget allocation from APN and
participates in annual planning exercises.

Component C Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. This component financed
technical assistance, equipment and incremental operational costs needed to strengthen
the capacity of APN to manage the overall program. It also supported scientifically sound
monitoring of biodiversity at globally significant Protected Areas sites. The PIU staff
demonstrated a high degree of dedication to their work and during the project's lifetime
conducted 58 workshops, and processed over 400 separate contracts (for consultants
services,and works).

Rating for Component C: Satisfactory (see above)

OVERALL PROJECT PERFORMANCE

Rating: Satisfactory. APN considers the performance satisfactory, considering that the
project succeeded in the incorporation of over 380,000 ha in five priority ecosystems; the
Cordoba Montane Savanna, Central Andean High Puna, Semi-Arid Chaco, Patagonian
Steppe and Oceanic Patagonian Littoral and Humid Chaco, Iberá Wetlands. Although the
protected areas was not procured at closure, APN has now prioritized the need for
protection of this ecosystem. Although the ten-year timeframe was long, this was in large
part, due to the economic crisis of 2001-2003.

ASSESSMENT OF BANK PERFORMANCE

Preparation. Satisfactory. The Bank performance in the identification and preparation of
the project was satisfactory. However, the Bank did not sufficiently estimate the
complexity of procurement and legal designation of new lands for national parks in
Argentina.

Supervision. Satisfactory. There were two task team leaders over the course of the project.
The experience and quality of the supervision team contributed to the project's success.
There were a total of 21 supervision missions. The interdisciplinary nature of the
supervision team provided value added to the work. Biodiversity specialists, institutional
experts, foresters and economists participated in the supervision missions.

ASSESSMENT OF APN PERFORMANCE

APN Performance. Satisfactory. APN provided the necessary administrative, financial
resources (counterpart funds) and personnel to support the project and conducted the
work in an efficient manner. APN participated in Bank missions and complied with
fiduciary requirements, including audits. They worked diligently to correct or resolve
issues during implementation, and kept the project on track. The institution also
participated actively in the closure of the project.




                                              61

ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE

Borrower Performance. Satisfactory. Overall borrower performance is considered
satisfactory given the level of government commitment during the project's tenure. The
government assigned a high priority to the establishment of five new national parks y
collaborated extensively with the Bank in the effort. During the crisis the government
was able to maintain the project, and provide some counterpart funds, which kept it from
failing.
