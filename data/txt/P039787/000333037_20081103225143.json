satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: development is not a linear process, and\n            processes need to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to\n            changes on the ground. Although the project experienced some\n            setbacks, including delays and difficulties during\n            implementation, it managed to produce highly relevant\n            impacts for the protected area sector by closing. The Bank,\n            as an institution, should ensure that its instruments,\n            philosophy and approaches to development are flexible enough\n            to adapt to the changing country conditions, while\n            maintaining focus on the project development objective. The\n            creation of a protected area is a complex process that\n            involves diverse actors and requires substantial\n            coordination. In future projects, sufficient time should be\n            allocated according to the complexity of participatory\n            processed and taking into account the number of actors and\n            decision makers involved. This is especially important in\n            situations where a diverse spectrum of stakeholders are\n            concerned (private land holders, intermediary agents,\n            stakeholders, federal, and provincial governments).\n            Participation is critical at all levels, yet it is time\n            consuming and the outcomes are unpredictable."}, "docdt": "2008-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
