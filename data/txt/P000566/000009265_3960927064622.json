farmers by facilitating the development and\n            dissemination of a relevant agricultural technology.  It\n            will be the first phase of a longer-term program aimed at\n            building a national extension and adaptive research system\n            responsive to farmers' needs, in particular those of\n            the two target groups : youth and women.  The project will\n            also address in an integrated fashion all relevant aspects\n            of smallholder farming systems.  Project components include\n            the following : a) reorganize and strengthen the Extension\n            Service along the basic principles of the Training and Visit\n            (T&V) system; b) strengthen the adaptive research\n            program; c) implement a comprehensive staff training and\n            rural promotion program using appropriate media\n            capabilities; d) implement a Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) program; e) provide management support; ) promote\n            extension support for small ruminants husbandry and inland\n            fish farming; and g) strengthen agricultural planning capabilities."}, "docdt": "1990-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
