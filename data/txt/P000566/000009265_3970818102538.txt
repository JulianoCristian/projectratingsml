PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
REPUBLIC OF CONGO
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION AND ADAPTIVE RESEARCH
PROJECT
(LOAN 3256-CG)
PART I
This is the Project Completion Note (PCN) for the Republic of Congo National
Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project (Loan 3256-CG). It was prepared
by Desire R. Coquillat, Consultant, reviewed by Eavan O'Halloran, Consultant and by
Joseph Baah-Dwomoh, Technical Manager.
This PCN has been prepared in lieu of an Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) because no disbursement took place and, after several extensions of the
effectiveness date, the loan was canceled on August 5 1994, effective June 30, 1994. The
note is based on internal Bank documents, supervision reports and interviews with Bank
staff associated with the Project.
A. Background
1.    The Project was a direct result of the Bank's dialogue with the Government of
Congo in the framework of the 1987 SAL, which was financed by the Bank and IMF
programs. During the negotiations for the SAL, the need for an agricultural project was
identified as agricultural development was considered crucial to offset some of the GDP
decline which resulted from the collapse of oil prices since 1985 (GDP declined by 7
percent in 1986 and by 5 percent in 1987). Oil revenues in excess of CFAF 200 billion
per year during the booming years, representing two-thirds of total budget revenues at
that time, had shrunk to CFAF 40 billion in 1988, resulting in a 55 percent decrease in
total revenue. The SAL was put in place to monitor the budget and ensure discipline in
budgetary management.
2.    Prior to this project, Bank's direct involvement in the agricultural sector had been
the Livestock Development Project (Cr. 435-COB), completed in 1982, and the agro-
industrial Wood Processing Project (Ln 2298-COB), to diversify exports and promote
regional development which was started in January 1984. However, there were other
projects that touched on issues in the sector, such as the second Bank-financed Technical
Assistance Project (Ln 2753-COB) that dealt with investment programming, credit, a
review of the potential for expanding cocoa, coffee, maize and rice production, and
improvements in marketing. The Public Enterprises Institutional Development Project

(Ln 2868-COB) also included a component aimed at addressing management problems in
agricultural parastatals. The Bank, on behalf of IFAD, was involved in the appraisal and
supervision of the Kindamba Food Crop Development Project (1987-1995), which
supported rural development in one district. It also supported nation-wide cassava
development through a biological disease control program and better research facilities
for improved production. In support of the Government's strategy aimed at strengthening
extension services, the weakness of which was a key constraint in improving agricultural
productivity, the Bank, with cofinancing from UNDP, launched in mid-1987 a Pilot
Agricultural Extension Operation.
3.    The Pilot Agricultural Extension Operation (PAEO) was initiated by the
Congolese Government in May 1987 in 10 of its 47 districts selected in 5 of its 10
regions, representing an appropriate cross-section of agro-ecological and social
conditions. The objective of the PAEO was to improve agricultural productivity by
introducing and adapting the main principles of the T&V system of extension. Financing
was provided by the Bank (two PPF advances of US$750,000 each) and UNDP
(US$105,000 for technical assistance) to carry out the pilot operation while the proposed
national project was being prepared. FAO was the executing agency for the UNDP
component. The objectives of the PPFs were to: (a) carry out training of project staff;
(b) start pilot extension activities in five regions; (c) build up implementation capacity
through provision of technical assistance, vehicles, equipment and operating costs;
(d) establish adequate accounting procedures; and (f) finance the project preparation by
independent consultants.
4.    The Project was preappraised in February 1988 and appraised in June 1988.
There were three post-appraisals, which also supervised the pilot operation in October
1988, January 1989 and April 1989. Following suspension of lending to Congo,
beginning in 1989, the Project could not be negotiated. The pilot phase continued with
PPF funds under a minimal program that was extended to mid-1990. In November 1989,
the Bank resumed lending to Congo following completion of a satisfactory financial and
economic program, resulting in a reappraisal of the Project undertaken from January 29,
1990 to February 15, 1990. The US$15.8 million loan was approved by the Bank on
September 11, 1990. The Project was signed on November 29, 1990. Congo again fell
into arrears and disbursements were suspended on December 4, 1990. Congo was placed
on non-accrual status on September 3, 1991, and hence, the project could not be declared
effective.
5.    During 1993 and 1994, Congo suffered severe socio-political troubles due to the
escalating civil war throughout the country. This increasingly difficult environment, the
lack of counterpart funds, and the continuing non-accrual status led the Bank to postpone
loan effectiveness several times. The country eventually settled its arrears to the Bank on
June 29, 1994, which was just one day before the agreed loan closing date of June 30,
1994. However, the drastic changes in the country's circumstances in the four years
following the loan signing required a redesign of the project and the loan was
subsequently canceled on August 5, 1994 (effective June 30, 1994). Congo had been



- 3 -
declared eligible for IDA funding following the CFA franc devaluation of January 1994.
Thus upon cancellation of the loan, the Bank proposed to the Government that a new
smaller project, addressing many of the same issues as the original project but more
adapted to the country's new circumstances, would be considered for IDA funding.
B. Project Objectives and Description
6.    Project Objectives. The Project's objectives were to support government efforts
to increase production efficiency and the income of small traditional farmers by
facilitating the development of relevant agricultural technology and its dissemination.
7.    Project Description. The Project included the following components:
(a) Agricultural Extension Services - to organize and strengthen the extension service by
supporting and gradually expanding the Pilot Agricultural Extension Operation's
activities; (b) Adaptive Research - to tailor broad-based findings from applied research to
the requirements of more location-specific, agro-ecological and/or social environments;
(c) Training, Information and the Media - to: (i) acquaint key government officials with
the new extension system; (ii) strengthen the PRDFV's (Direction de la Recherche, du
1)eveloppement, de la Formation et de la Vulgarisation) training service to ensure
adequate programming and implementation of the training program; (iii) improve the
capability of both trainers and field agents in educational and communication skills so
that they effectively share ideas with farmers (including rural woman); and (iv) improve
the technical knowledge of all staff; (d) Monitoring and Evaluation - to carry out the
expanded program envisaged under the Project and initiate a forced early retirement
program and a voluntary departure program; and (e) Preparation of Follow-up Projects -
to initiate preparatory activities for an Agricultural Sector Project, which would include a
component aimed at, inter-alia, assisting the government in reintegrating departing civil
servants in the agricultural sector.
C. Major Features
8.    Project Conditionality. The Project contained a number of conditions related to
financial management and logistical operations in the agricultural sector: (i) availability
of counterpart funds; (ii) identification and selection of the research center sites for
negotiations and acquisition of land; (iii) establishment of a National Agricultural
Extension and Research Committee; (iv) creation of a salary structure for extension staff
that should make these positions attractive. The Project was reappraised in 1990 and
changes were recommended because: (a) the PIP (Public Investment Program), since
appraisal, had changed with certain operations, on which the R&E project depended for
generation of technical themes, left without financing; and (b) project costs needed to be
updated.



- 4 -
9.    Major changes in the reappraised project design were: (a) reduction in the
geographic scope of extension activities; the pace at which districts were to be phased in
was substantially reduced, bearing in mind that the project was only the first phase of a
longer term program and given the formidable logistical constraints that still prevailed in
the context of Congo; (b) adaptive research activities were focused more on addressing
production systems rather than individual crop activities, and on addressing longer term
issues, in particular, the sustainability of soil fertility; (c) training activities were
strengthened with the incorporation of two person-years of resident technical assistance,
an increased reliance on national and short-term consultants, and greater use of training
devices and media; (d) inclusion of a rural promotion component, focusing on women
and the young, aimed to address the broader context in which extension activities take
place and promote the emergence of grassroot work groups; (e) sub-contracting of
activities upstream of extension -- e.g., specific adaptive research programs, supply of
genetic/animal material, provision of training -- to existing research and extension
institutions in the fields of small ruminants, fish farming and specific crop breeding;
(f) addition of a component designed to strengthen the Ministry of Youth and Rural
Development's (MJDR's) strategic planning capacity; and (g) other additional
expenditures, including minimum support to districts not covered by the project to ensure
proper liaison with project activities, creation of two additional Technical Support
Centers, and renovation of a center for small ruminants.
10.   The changes, to a large extent, offset one another in terms of costs and resulted
only in a limited increase in costs in real terms. The 16 percent cost increase in nominal
terms represented the normal cost increase since the original appraisal date (June 1988).
The Bank agreed to finance, on an exceptional basis, 70 percent of total costs, equivalent
to US$15.6 million, instead of the standard cost sharing of 50 percent. The reappraisal
permitted the establishment of improved liaison with other donors that would cofinance
project activities, in particular, the EEC, AFDB and IFAD. These donors, together with
U NDP, which was associated from the start, would pick up about 10 percent of project
costs, with the Government left with the remainder of about 20 percent of project costs.
11.   Loan effectiveness was postponed several times because of the non-accrual status.
Meanwhile, a Technical Assistance Fund was requested in May 1992 through the
Japanese Grant Facility for an amount of US$500,000 to pursue the Pilot Extension
Operation. The requested funding was important since PPF funds were exhausted and
preinvestment actions were required to capitalize on results achieved during the pilot
phase. However, the request was not approved.
D. Lessons Learned
12.   The main risks identified in the SAR were deficiency in local budgetary support
and implementation of the T&V system of extension that may be hindered by ineffective
management and lack of farmer incentives to adopt improved technical
recommendations. The SAR also added that, "failure of the adaptive research program to



- 5 -
produce appropriate recommendation is a risk inherent in research". Project execution
might also be affected if the Government was unable to move quickly as planned in
carrying out its economic adjustment efforts. In retrospect, it is clear that the Project
should probably not have gone forward in the absence of a credible macro adjustment
program, especially in light of the collapse of oil prices and Government revenues. The
Bank should have taken the decision to cancel the loan earlier because of Congo's non-
accrual status.
13.   The technical messages used during the pilot phase were on simple basic "first
generation" technologies that permitted farmers to increase their yields with a potential to
do better. The pilot phase also showed that it was possible to restructure and streamline
the agricultural extension service to make it more cost-effective. Thus the pilot phase
demonstrated that simple productivity improvements were possible and that the project
could have been successful had the financial conditions been met.
E. Follow-up
14.   The country was declared eligible for IDA lending following the CFA Franc
devaluation of January 1994. The Bank proposed to the Government in two letters (dated
May 17, 1994 and August 5, 1994) that a new, smaller project, more adapted to the
present country circumstances, could be considered for IDA funding, provided the
Government took a lead role in the design of such a project. The Government responded
favorably and sent a draft project proposal on September 1, 1994. However, discussions
on a new project have stalled as there has been no agreement reached yet on a national
agricultural development strategy. It is important that any future project must explicitly
take into account the country's constrained macro-economic framework and the low level
of the public administration's technical expertise.
