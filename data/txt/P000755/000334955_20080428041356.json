Lessons\n            learned from the projects included: (i) even in a very low\n            income country, a successful infrastructure program can be\n            established with strong government commitment, sound\n            preparation, continuity of management and funding flow, and\n            a coordinated multi-donor approach. The RSDP support project\n            showed that the up-front focus on policy issues can\n            contribute substantially to a successful outcome; (ii) a\n            successful roads program needs to be monitored by means of\n            establishing appropriate and practical indicators with a\n            dedicated unit to measure progress and report regularly to\n            the decision-makers. The indicators need to be able to\n            establish progress with the softer issues such as income\n            generation, improvements in skills levels, and creation of\n            employment opportunities; and (iii) in a large road program,\n            specific attention needs to be given to effective contract\n            administration. The appointment of dispute resolution\n            experts can yield significant benefits including avoidance\n            of costly arbitration."}, "docdt": "2008-03-10T00:00:00Z"}
