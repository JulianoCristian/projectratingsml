Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The primary aim of the proposed Road Sector Development Program Support Project (RSDPSP) is to contribute to Ethiopia's economic
 development by (i) improving trunk and regional rural road access and utilization to meet the agricultural and other economic development needs;
 (ii) building up the institutional capacity in both the public and private sectors for sustainable road development and maintenance; and (iii) providing
 economic opportunity for the rural poor both through increased employment in rural road works and development of appropriate and affordable
 means of transport and services.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 Project Status and Decisions Testing on Sept-05-2015..... Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
 been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
 specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
 in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
 PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
