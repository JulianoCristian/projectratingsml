                              test april 5 Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of tuberculosis and the worst treatment
                              outcomes, with the continent contributing significantly to the global rise in TB. While other
                              regions have shown a steady decline in the TB burden, the numbers of new cases and mortality
                              rates have been on the rise in Africa since 1990, fuelled by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Of the 22 high
                              burden countries worldwide nine are in Africa (DR Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria,
                              South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe) . About a dozen countries on the continent are
                              afflicted with the highest incidence rates in the world, including Swaziland, Lesotho, Botswana,
                              Zambia, and Malawi.

                              Sectoral and institutional Context
                              test april 5 The average incidence rate on the continent is about 350 cases per 100,000 in contrast to
                              62 per 100,000 in Brazil, 102 per 100,000 in China and 4 per 100,000 in the United States. Sub-
                              Saharan Africa represents about 10 percent of the global population yet carries over 30 percent of
                              the global burden of TB cases and related deaths. In 2006, Africa reported an estimated 2.7 million
                              new cases of TB and 600,000 deaths, with tuberculosis figuring among the top causes of adult
                              mortality in the region. Tuberculosis programs in Africa are finding only 50 percent of TB cases
                              and successfully treating only 70 percent of those, in comparison to the global targets of detecting
                              70 percent of cases and treating 85 percent of these cases.

                              The World Bank's support to and association with the India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control
                              Program (RNTCP) spans over a decade and a half. Since 1997, the International Development
                              Association (IDA) has financed over USD 312 million (TB control project, Credit 2936-IN, USD
                              142 million, closing September 2005; and RNTCP II, Credit 4228-IN, USD 170 million, closing
                              September 2012) of the program costs for TB control; in the past five years, the Bank contribution
                              to the program costs being almost 46%. This investment and commitment has reaped rich dividends.

                             global targets, exceeding 70% detection of new smear positive TB cases (73.5% to the third
                             quarterof2011) and successfully treating over 85% of those cases (87.6% to the third quarter of
                             2011). During this period, the program examined more than 36 million persons through sputum-

                             smear microscopy and treated more than 7.5 million TB patients, saving more than 1 million lives.
                             The RNTCP II has firmly established decentralized diagnosis through 13,000 quality-assured
                             microscopy centers embedded in the health system and has expanded community-based treatment to
                             a network of more than 600,000 community treatment providers. The quality of program
                             management, monitoring, and supervision systems are notable. The RNTCP has intensively
                             upgraded the response to multi-drug resistant TB, rapidly established forty-two specialized
                             laboratories and ensured basic services to diagnose and treat multi-drug resistant cases, which are
                             available in half of the districts in the country. ThemajorityofTBpatientstreated under the RNTCP
                             are now screened for HIV, and an increasing proportion are linked to anti-retro viral treatment.
