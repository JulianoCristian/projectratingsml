Ethiopia\u0092s development has been\n            held back by an infrastructure gap- it has one of the lowest\n            road densities in Africa. For the government to sustain its\n            economic growth and poverty reduction initiatives, it is\n            imperative to address Ethiopia\u0092s severe infrastructure\n            constraints. The project was designed to support the first\n            phase of the government\u0092s 10-year road sector development\n            program (1997-2007). The primary aim of the project was to\n            contribute to Ethiopia\u0092s economic development by: (i)\n            improving trunk and regional road access and utilization to\n            meet agricultural and other economic development needs; (ii)\n            building up the institutional capacity in both the public\n            and private sectors for sustainable road development and\n            maintenance; and (iii) providing economic opportunity for\n            the rural poor both through increased employment in rural\n            road works and development of appropriate and affordable\n            means of transport and services."}, "docdt": "2007-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
