PREFACE
This is the completion report on the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project,
for which Loan 1575-IVC in the amount of US$ 20.0 million was approved on
May 23, 1978. The project was completed in September 1982, some fifteen months
ahead of the original completion date.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Regional Mission
in Western Africa (RMWA). It is based on several sources of information including
project files, staff Appraisal Report (N° 1735-IVC dated April 28, 1978).
President's Report (N° P-2271-IVC dated May 5, 1978), Development Loan Agreement
dated June 9, 1978 and Substitution Loan Agreement dated August 6, 1980, Super-
vision Mission Reports and a contribution from project management for this report
in the form of a financial as well as a training report.
A completion mission visited the project site from August 8 to 12, 1983.
The visit coincided with a short trip by a senior staff from Michelin France,
responsible for the management team of expatriates working on the project.
Discussions were held with Project Management, Government services as well as
representatives of Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique and Fonds Europeen de
D6veloppement.
The Regional Mission in Western Africa gratefully acknowledges the
kind assistance provided by the Government, the project staff and representatives
of the co-donors. Their assistance was much appreciated.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower and co-donors on
March 15, 1985 for comments. Comments received have been incorporated into the
report as Annexes 4-6. The project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) because this second project provided follow-up support to the First
Grand-Bereby Rubber Project which had been scaled back due to worldwide inflation,
initial inefficient management and labor shortages. This second project, therefore,
was essentially to complete the objectives achieved by the first project, which was
the subject of an in-depth audit by OED (Report No. 3516 dated June 23, 1981).

SECOND GRAND-BEREBY RUBBER PROJECT
(LOAN 1575-IVC)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project was a follow-up development of the
rubber plantation at Grand-Bereby, in the South West of the Ivory Coast. The project
wer prepared by the Government with assistance from the Bank's Regional Mission in
West Africa. The first project (Loan 938-IVC) had started in 1973 with a physical
target of 13,500 hectares to be planted by 1979. It ran into difficulties caused by
technical problems, high turn-over of management, labor shortage and inflation.
Objectives had to be reduced and by 1978 only 7,000 hectares of rubber had been
established.
The Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project included the maintenance of the
existing 7,000 hectares, the extension and upkeep of 6,500 additional hectares, the
purchase of vehicles and equipment, the construction of houses, social facilities, a
first stage rubber processing factorv and the provision of loans and extension
services to farmers for a 500 hectares pilot outgrowers' program.
The planting target of 6,500 hectares was exceeded in October 1981, one
year ahead of schedule. With a total project area under rubber amounting to 13,526
hectares or 32 percent of the country's 41,600 he tares of rubber plantings in
1983, the Grand-Bereby rubber estate is presently vne of the largest in the world.
The high standard of planting has resulted in the immature period of trees now
coming into production being reduced from an appraisal estimate of 7 years to an
average 5.5 years. The average production is some 10 to 14 per cent above
appraisal forecasts.
Sufficient labor is currently available and the turnover has markedly
decreased. The project training program for tappers is most impressive and could
serve as an example for other rubber estates in Ivory Coast and West Africa. A
substantial construction program was carried out including an administrative
center, 14 villages, a hospital and social facilities. The road program included
some 910 km of all weather roads with an average one culvert per kilometer. The
first unit of the rubber factory financed by Michelin was completed on time. The
pilot outgrower planting did not take place because of unresolved land tenure
problems and technical difficulties during the project. Also, initially, the local
*        population, who are mainly fishermen and seafarers showed little interest in the
outgrower scheme. Overall management was satisfactory and the project is rightly
seen as a success.
The investment period was to extend over a seven-year period
(1977-1984), external loans being disbursed over the first five years and both the
Government and SOGB financing the last two years. The Bank loan of
US$ 20.0 million was fully disbursed by November 1983. Other co-financers included
CCCE and FED who contributed US$ 8.6 million and USS 5.5 million respectively.
Total costs amounted to some US$ 47.4 million or CFAF 11,950 million or 106
percent of the appraisal estimate of CFAF 11,000 million.



(v)
The economic rate of return of the combined 1st and 2nd project has been
reevaluated at 13.5Z, slightly higher than the appraisal figure of 12 % due mainly
to more favorable rubber price projections and a slightly higher production
forecast over the project life span, which more than compensated for the increase
in costs and the longer project construction period.
The project has largely contributed to the Government's program of
agricultural diversification - away from the traditional export crops, coffee,
cocoa and timber - and regional development of the south western part of the Ivory
Coast. The main lessons which emerge from the project's implementation experience
include : (i) providing adequate housing and social amenities is the key to
retaining labor and avoid expensive recruitment schemes (paras. 3.14 and 3.15);
(ii) the thorough training of tappers and foremen is essential insofar as having a
major positive effect on the project main physical asset, the trees (paras 3.21
and 3.22) (iii) the timely and adequate compensation of dispossessed farmers is
essential to ensure full participation of the latter in any scheme (para 3.23)
(iv) the complexity of turning traditional subsistence farmers into rubber growers
especially as most of the farmers had better cash incomes as fishermen and
seafarers (para. 3.25 and 3.26) and (iv) lengthy bureaucratic procedures
particularly in approving the annual budget and processing disbursement
applications can unnecessarily jeopardize the smooth implementation of a project
(para. 4.07 and 4.08).
Other points of interest are
-    the gradual and carefully planned Ivorization of management,
-    the semi autonomous status of the project which together with an
experienced and dedicated management team implemented the project
with success and,
-    the continuous and strong back-up from Michelin which through its
industrial approach to an agricultural venture kept innovating
and improving the work quality at both field and factory levels.



PROJECT CO04PLETION REPORT
IVORY COAST : SECOND GRAND-BEREBY RUBBER PROJECT
(LOAN 1575-IVC)
I. BACKGROUND
1.01.     The Ivory Coast, with an area of about 322,000 km2, has a population of
8.5 million (mid 1981), growing at some 5 percent a year 1/ and including over two
million immigrants from neighbouring countries. With an average population density
of 26 per sq.km. there is no overall scarcity of land. Per capita GNP amounted to
US$ 1,150 in 1981, having averaged 2.3% p.a. increase thrcughout the 70's, one of
the highest growth rates for a non oil exporting country in the world. Agriculture
continues to have the main potential for expanding output and employment as well
as for reducing regional income disparities. About 70% of the population depends
directly on agriculture which has developed rapidly as a result of abundant land,
immigrant labor and a policy of large scale expansion. However, the prosperity of
the sector is heavily dependent on coffee, timber and cocoa which together
accounted in past years for about 75% of the value of total exports. Because of
highly variable commodity prices, the Government opted in the early 70's for the
diversification of crops. Thus, in addition to coffee and cocoa, the production
base was gradually diversified to include cotton, oil palm, coconut, pineapple,
sugar and rubber. Important food crops include maize, which constitutes nearly 60%
of the current overall cereals production of about 6-700.000 tons, rice, and to a
much lesser extent, groundnuts, sorghum and millet. The starchy staples are
estimated at some 3 million tons, about 30Z of which is yams, 30% cassava. 25%
plantain and 15% cocoyam.
1.02      The Bank Group lending policy in the Ivory Coast's agricultural sector
has mainly been so far to assist the country in increasing the availability of raw
materials for its agro-industries. A total of 17 projects have been financed in
the rural sector by the Bank over 1969/83, amounting to US$ 213.8 millioa .nd
covering cocoa, coffee, rubber, oil palm, forestry, cotton and food crops.
1.03     Commercial rubber cultivation is rather recent in the Ivory Coast, as
first plantings started in 1953 and production in 1961. Since then, significant
progress was achieved with an overall 41,600 ha planted by end 1983. Of this total
area, some 85% is under public large scale estate management, 6% belong to a
private company and 9% were established by outgrowers. The Government intends to
increase the share of the outgrowers to up to 26% by 1990 when the total area
under rubber is expected to reach some 78,500 ha. Another important feature is
that by then 55% of the planted area would be located in the South West against
45% in 1983, thus further contributing to the economic growth of the region. The
latest estimates are for the foreign exchange earnings derived from rubber to
exceed the rapidly declining export revenues from palm oil, between 1985 and 1990.
By the end of the century the country's production of rubber should amount to
200,000 tons per annum which although impressive would represent only 2.5% of
estimated world production.

1.04      The introduction of rubber in the Botanical Garden of Dabou, in the
Ivory Coast was followed by the establishment, at the beginning of the century, of
small plantations at Tiassale, Dabou and the lower Cavally, in the forest zone.
In 1953-54, the Compagnie Francaise des Cultures d'Extreme-Orient et d'Afrique
(FCEOA) planted 400 ha to the north of Bingerville on the site of a former oil
palm estate. In 1964, the Compagnie des Caoutchoucs du Pakidie (CCP) was created
which currently owns 2800 ha of rubber plantations including the 400 ha planted by
the early FCEOA.  Previous Bank interventions in the sub-sector included a US$8.4
million loan in 1973 for the first Grand-Bereby rubber project (Loan 938-IVC) to
establish 7,000 ha of estate in the South West, managed by Societe des Caoutchoucs
de Cote d'Ivoire (SOCATCI); and a US$ 20.0 million loan in 1978 for the Societe
Africaine de Plantations d'H&vdas (SAFE) rubber project (Loan 1633-IVC) 1/ to
develop 2,000 ha of nucleus estate and 3,500 ha for smallholders, in the South
East.
1.05      SOCATCI was created in 1972 to become the borrower of the Bank loan for
the First Grand-Bereby Rubber Project. Furthermore SOCATCI was made responsible
for the creation and operation of industrial rubber estates together with
conducting all related commercial, industrial and financial operations. Because of
the lack of expertise on rubber within SOCATCI, the Government signed an agreement
with a foreign technical partner, Societe d'Applications Techniques Agricoles et
Caoutchoutieres (SATAC) a wholly owned subsidiary of Michelin, whereby this
company was to assist with the project management. SOCATCI was dissolved,
October 7, 1977. In March 1979, after completion of the first project, the
Government created Societe des Caoutchoucs de Grand-Bereby (SOGB), a mixed economy
company shared both by Government (90Z) and Michelin (10%).
1.06      The First Grand-Bereby Rubber Project was divided into two phases. The
first phase was to develop 13,500 ha of rubber plantation between 1972 and 1979
whereas the second phase between 1980 and 1985 was to include both further
maintenance of the plantation and the constructi*jn of processing facilities. The
first phase which commenced in January 1973 was to cost US$ 33.0 million of which
the Bank, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and Fonds Europeen de
Developpement (FED) agreed to finance US$ 8.4 million each. Project implementation
met with serious difficulties mainly due to high worldwide inflation, inefficient
management during the initial years and labor shortages. By end 1975, project
costs had exceeded appraisal estimates by 40-50 percent and revised estimates put
the total cost of phases I and II for the full development of the anticipated
13,500 ha at US$ 65.0 million without contingencies. This was twice the original
estimate of US$ 33.1 million with contingencies, set at appraisal. At a meeting
with Government in January 1976, the co-lenders decided to pursue Implementation
of the project but reduced it to a 7,000 ha program.
1.07.     As a follow-up, the Bank agreed to provide a US$ 20.0 million loan for a
Second Grand-Bereby Rubber project, approved in May 1978, to help the Government
further expand the area under rubber through the implementation of 6,500 ha of
nucleus estate and 500 ha of outgrowers, some 75 km west of San Pedro. The project
also comprised maintaining the 7,000 ha of immature trees planted under the first
Grand-Bereby Rubber project and the related access roads, providing housing for
workers and staff, building schools, dispensaries and necessary social
1/ With co-financing from CCCE (US$ 1.5 million) and CDC (US$ 3.0 million). A PPAR
for the first Grand-Bereby project was prepared in March 1981. A PCR for the
SAPH project will be started in mid-1984.



infrastructure, providing agricultural credit and extension services to farmers,
building the first stage of a rubber processing factory and training personnel.
The CCCE and FED were to contribute US$ 8.3 million and US$ 5.5 million
respectively whereas the Government was to provide some US$ 19.0 million. While
the project was to be implemented over seven years at a total cost of US$ 60.4
million of which the Bank loan represcited 33Z, the various loans were to be
disbursed over a five-year period. Tl'e Government was thereafter to provide
additional financing of US$ 15.2 million to bring the plantation to maturity, to
provide additional processing facilities and ensure debt service for the loans
used under the first project as well as the follow-up project. The loan agreement
between the Government of Ivory Coast and the Bank was signed June 9, 1978 and was
fully disbursed by November 1983 - fourteen months ahead of the original closing
date.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification, Preparation, Appraisal, Board Recommendations
2.01      Identification. At the time of a visit to the Ivory Coast by a joint
Bank and Caisse Centrale mission, in September 1973, the Minister of Agriculture
asked if a second rubber project could be considered. The Government wanted to
slow down on oil palm planting while accelerating rubber development. The Bank
reacted favorably. Subsequently the Agriculture Minister dropped consideration of
an earlier request by the Goodyear Company which had expressed interest in
implementing a 15,000 ha rubber estate in the San Pedro area. However as time
elapsed and costs overruns of the first Grand-Bereby Rubber project escalated the
idea of having a follow-up project instead of a new rubber project gradually
prevailed.
2-n2      PreDaration !nd Appraisal.  Preparation of the second Grand-Bereby
Rubber Project under the responsibility of the West Africa Projects - WAPA 2 - was
held back until late 1975 while awaiting a review of the first project. The review
carried out by the Resident Mission in Western Africa (RMWA) in February/March
1976 served as a basis for the Ministry of Agriculture feasibility report which
was officially transmitted to the Bank on April 7, 1977. Appraisal took place in
April/May 1977, with a mission of three Bank staff, one consultant and
representatives of CCCE and FED.
2.03      The project proposal submitted by the Government included, over a 5 year
period :
(a) maintenance of all areas planted under the first project except for
the areas coming into production;
(b) planting 6,500 ha and their subsequent maintenance during five
years;
(c) opening access roads to the new areas to be planted;
(d) provision of housing for estate workers, schools, health facilities
and other social infrastructures;
(e) procurement of vehicles, equipment and materials
(f) financing technical assistance, salaries, operational costs;
(g) building a factory to process production from the first project,
housing factory workers and purchasing a fleet of trucks to
transport the latex and finished product.
2.04     During appraisal, the Government asked the mission to consider



- 4 -
(i) an outgrowers component of about 500 ha - the mission expressed a
negative view to the Minister of Agriculture who remained admant,
insisting that such a component be included in the follow-up project
-- an outgrowers' program was subsequently included in the project
(para.3.23) and,
(ii) a food crop growing program for farmers living on the rubber
concession as well as for laborers working on the estate - the
mission felt that any food crop action should be financed by the
Goverment and entrusted to a specialized organization.
(Para.3.17)
2.05      In the Issues papers dated May 26, 1977, the appraisal mission
highlighted the following main points:
(a) Government should be asked to submit evidence that an additional 500 ha
of suitable land would be made available to complete the total area
under rubber at 13,500 ha;
(b) although insufficiently prepared, funds should be included in the
project to finance the planting of the 500 ha outgrower component;
(c) SATAC accounts were unsatisfactory, therefore a follow-up project
would be subject to the Bank receiving financial statements fo: th^
year ending September 30, 1976, duly reviewed by Auditors;
td)  the Bank should have for examination the legal document reorgantizing
SOCATCI as well as the final text of the new srrangements betwe«i
SOCATCI and SATA5 or between Government and Michelin.
2.06      A rubber unit was set up in the Ministry of Agriculture to which key
personnel from SOCATCI was transferred. The unit became responsible for the
technical supervision of the project and for determining a national policy for
the rubber sub-sector.
2.07      It was estimated at appraisal that the project total costs would reach
US$ 45.0 million 1/ of which US$ 16.7 million was to maintain plantings under the
first project, US$ 4.0 million for a rubber processing factory and US$ 24.3
million for the new 6,500 ha. During processing total project cost estimates
were increased to US$ 60.4 million 2/. The Bank thus provided a US$ 20.0 million
loan or 37.5% of total project costs excluding taxes. Other donors contributed:
CCCE, US$ 8.3 million (15.5%), FED, US$ 5.5 million (10%), BEI, US$ 4.5 million
(8%) and Goverment US$ 15.3 million (29%). In September 1977, the Government
also asked BADEA for financial assistance and although BADEA had earmarked
US$ 6.0 million, they did not participate.
2.08      The main points raised by Executive Directors, at Board presentation
included queries on: i) the reason why the initial plantation of 7,000 ha had to
be completed to 13,500 ha, considering labor constraints (para.3.14) ecology
(para.5.07) and a lower rate of return than for a 7,000 ha estate (para 6.02);
ii) whether the Bank was involved in the outgrower component (para.3.23); iii)
how did the factory component fit into the project and who would finance it
(para.4.03) and iv) what were the arrangements for the transfer of skills and
training under the project (para.7-05).
2.09      Negotiations took place in April, 1978 and the project was approved by
the Board, May 23, 1978. The loan was signed June 9, 1978, but only became
effective, September 15, 1980 because of problems over tecimical assistance and
1/ Over a 5 year period.
2/ Over 7 years.



- 5 -
partnership arrangements. In November 1978, the Government reversed its earlier
refusal to enter into partnership with the Compagnie Generale des Etablissements
Michelin to develop and operate the Grand-Bereby rubber estate. Michelin therefore
became a shareholder and agreed to finance the processing plant and provide
technical assistance. Thus the BEI loan for building the factory was no longer
required. The new company was to be directly responsible for marketing the rubber
produced as well as for developing the outgrower component.
2.10      Because of the above several changes, renegotiation of the legal
documents leading to a loan agreement between the Government and the Bank and
between SOGB and the Bank was envisaged. A contract for the construction of the
plant as well as for technical assistance was signed between SOGB and Michelin in
November 1979. In addition, the same two entities signed a rubber marketing
contract in December 1979. Because of the above delays, the Bank decided to
renegotiate the loan on the basis of the revised agreements. Renegotiation took
place on March 21-22, 1980. The substitution loan agreement was finally signed on
August 6, 1980 and became effective September 15, 1980. Most of these delays
resulted from the Government seeking the best possible solution for the company's
ne-w management structure which was to include participation in management and
equity by a private company. Thus the drafting of the contract, the first of it's
kind, between the Government and the private partner (Michelin) had not been
finalized as the negotiations with the donors were initiated. However, with
hindsight having Michelin involved as a shareholder instead of as a Technical
Assistance partner proved beneficial to the project.
2.11      Project Description. The project comprised : the maintenance of immature
rubber already established during the first phase; the planting and upkeep of
6,500 ha of additional plantation and the opening of the related access roads; the
purchase of vehicles and equipment; the construction of houses for estate workers
and staff, social infrastruczure and a first stage rubber processing factory; the
provision of credit and extension services to farmers for a 500 ha pilot
outgrowers' program; the provision of management and technical services and tae
training of personnel. The project introduced high planting and cultivation
standards for rubber on the estate, practices that would serve as a model to
outgrowers in the area. The project was to be administered by SOGB. The investment
period was to extend over seven years whereas external loans were to be disbursed
over the first five years of implementation, the Government and SOGB financing the
last two years.
2.12      Field Development. An important new feature was the adoption of a
greater diversification of planting material. This was a major departure from the
first project when high priority was given mainly to the GTI clone.
2.13.     Housing and Social Services. The bullding program to accommodate the
estate workers and staff was to be based on standards found on plantations
elsewhere in the Ivory Coast. Workers were to be housed in temporary wooden
villages to be dismantled as the planting program progressed whereas permanent
canton villages of concrete bock construction were to be built prior to the
exploitation period. Social services were to include medical facilities, schools
and shops.
2.14.     Training. The project was to continue the training program which had
been successful under the first project. The program was to include the training



- 6 -
of tappers, budders and agricultural labor through the level of overseer. Also
field management was to go through formal and on-the-job training.
2.15.     Outgrowers' Proram. A feasibility study leading to a small 500 ha pilot
project was to be carried out by the Agronomic Department of the estate with the
support of the Ministry of Agriculture's (MOA) "Cellule Hevea". The study was to
be followed-up by the implementation of the pilot project in PY3 once the
participation of farmers obtained, land tenure arrangement identified,
organizational, credit and other support requirements determined and after the
recruitment and proper training of extension staff. The three-year program was to
involve 400-500 families, each with rubber plantings of one-half to two hectares.
2.16.     Project Benefits. Based on actual results obtained in the Ivory Coast
and other countries from plantings of the clones used at Grand-Bereby, the
appraisal report anticipated an initial production of 118 tons of rubber in 1979
to peak at 31,050 tons in 1997 while declining thereafter. Yields were to increase
from 600 kg/ha in the first year of tapping (N+6) to 2,300 kg/ha after 19 years,
levelling of at 1,400 kg/ha by the end of the tapping period (year 41). The
project, through its support services including farm inputs, credit and marketing
facilities was to allow outgrowers to diversify their traditional cropping pattern
and raise their incomes. Secondary benefits were to be derived from the provision
of access roads, education and health facilities as well as the strengthening of
-OA's technical ability to supervise the rubber sub-sector.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Effectiveness. The loan was expected to be effective by October 9. 1978,
but this had to be extended first to December 8, 1978, then to December 29, 1978,
December 28, 1979, April 30, 1980. and finally to September 15, 1980 (para.2.10).
The conditions of effectiveness were a) assurance that the Substitution Loan
Agreement had been fulfilled; b) the signing of the CCCE and the FED loan
agreements and effectiveness of these agreements; c) assurance that the BEI loan
was forthcoming; and; d) assurance from the Executing Agency that all necessary
measures were taken to enable the Borrower to fully comply with its obligations.
3.02      Prior to the conditions of effectiveness being met the project
experienced delays when on April 24, 1978, the Government decided to stop the main
operations at Grand-Bereby while awaiting for funds to be made available by the
donors. The purchasing of vehicles was thus further postponed, together with
equipment and inputs required to implement the 1978 program. While Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement - CAA - was ready to prefinance part of the second project, SATAC
had not received authorization from MOA to go ahead. The authorization was only
notified, July 21, 1978, after both the Bank and FED had voiced concern, in June
1978, that the lack of operations at the project site was likely to result in
unnecessary delays and large costs overruns. The Government's attitude was due to
the fact that in the absence of a formal agreement, it did not want to commit
itself to large expenditures without first receiving an assurance from the donors
that they would provide their financial contribution in the future. While the
conditions in relation to the FED and the CCCE loan agreement were fulfilled in
July 1978 and June 1979 respectively, there were considerable delays in meeting
the other conditions. Effectiveness was finally reached some three years and four
months after project appraisal. (Para. 2.09 and 2.10).

3.03      Land Preparation. During the first project land clearing included both
manual and mechanical means, the latter in most cases making up for the scarcity
of labor which then prevailed. By the end of 1977, results from surveys carried
out by Institut de Recherches sur le Caoutchouc (IRCA) and from experiments
conducted jointly by IRCA and the Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique
Outre-Mer (ORSTOM) showed that Rigidoporus lipWsus or Fomes which is responsible
for a severe root disease (para.3.13) was more common on parcels which had been
cleared manually rather than mechanically. It was therefore decided, in June 1978,
that land clearing during the second project would be exclusively through
mechanical means using the existing fleet of heavy tractors plus additional units
provided for under the second project. The equipment consisted of heavy bulldozers
mounted either with a K/G blade or a tree-pusher. Trees too large for the
bulldozers to slice or push over were felled by chainsaw. Planting lines were then
opened according to contours using v-blades, while a 1.20 meter deep sub-soiling
with a ripper was carried out in a single operation. Other operations included
burning without stacking, lining, holing and establishing the cover crop Pueraria
phaseolides shortly before the rainy season. Although there is no mention in the
appraisal report on how the vast quantity of wood and timber were to be disposed
of, the project took advantage of land clearing to use large amounts of wood in
its construction program.
3.04      The overall planting target during the second project was for the
establishment of 6,500 ha of rubber over a five-year period. Based on previous
experience gained from the first project, a slower annual rate of planting was
adopted at 1,750 ha, down from 3,000 ha. Achievements actually exceeded the new
goals in 1977, 1979 and 1980 as shown below and led to the planting program being
completed one year ahead of the second project implementation schedule.

3.05      Planting Techniques. Only the polybag planting method was recommended
under the second project. It was indeed the most reliable method when compared to
the planting of seed at stake or of 18 months-old budded stumps. The polybag
method permits a longer planting period only excluding the dry season from January
to April. By contrast, seed at stake were subject to heavy losses (up to 50Z) to
rodents and insects while planting was limited to September and October, the only



- 8 -
seeding time. Finally, bare root budded stumps were too sensitive to weather
vagaries and transplanting shock. In addition, a major limiting factor was the
very short planting period which consisted of only 3 to 4 weeks during the main
rainy season.
3.06      A detailed annual breakdown of areas planted using the various planting
material is in Annex 1. table 1 while the final distribution per planting method
over the first and the second project, is shown below
(i)   budded stumps            1,803 ha
(ii) field budded seedlings 2,191 ha
(iii) polybag                  9,535 ha
Total                   13,526 ha
Planting density for the 6,500 ha established under the second project was
555 trees per hectare with an average interval of 2.25 m in the line and 8 m
between lines. The initial stand was then subsequently reduced through a two stage
thinning operation to 500 and 450 trees per hectare respectively. This compares
with the 600 points per hectare density that had been adopted for implementing the
7,000 ha under the first project. The resulting economy of planting material was
partly justified by the satisfactory uniformity of the areas planted.
3.07      Clonal Distribution. When the first Grand-Bereby project was initiated,
priority was given to the planting of the GT1 clone which had a good record in the
Far East. As a result, some 3,500 ha or 80 X of the project planted area was under
GTI, in 1976. Other clones included : PR107 (10 Z), PB86 (5 Z) and a mix of RRIM
600, PB 5/51 and Avros 2037 (5 %). Based on recommendations from IRCA, new clones
were to be introduced for the 6,500 ha of rubber to be established under the
second project. The clones included : PR 261, AF 50, AF 51 and AF 53. Meanwhile
both the RRIM 600 and the PB86 were eliminated from future plantings as the former
was too susceptible to wind breakage and the latter had shown poor results. Clones
on the decrease comprised : PR107 (down from 25 Z to 10 %) because of slow starter
characteristics and sensitivity to leaf diseases and PB 5/51 (from 10% to 5%) due
to its limited production potential under the local conditions. Further
observations showed that PR 261 presented the same main weaknesses as PR107. The
area under PR 261 was thus kept to a minimum. The final mix of clones was markebly
modified from previous forecasts, as is shown in Annex 1, table 2. Project
management continuously adjusted the planting program so as to benefit from the
best clones as they became available. This was made possible through the close
cooperation which prevailed between the Project and IRCA.
3.08      Maintenance. As a consequence of an overall improved labor situation
(para. 3.20), maintenance of immature areas remained satisfactory throughout the
second project. Interventions mainly consisted of weeding using the chemical weed
killers MSMA and Gramoxone on the lines of newly established plots to control
growth of both weeds and the cover crop. The latter was regularly slashed back in
the interrows until such time when the canopies met and the cover crop gradually
receded. It should be noted that the project always gave priority to the hiring of
labor for weeding avoiding the systematic use of expensive herbicides.
Tractor-mounted-rotary slashers were used on boundary plots especially during the
dry season as on effective means against fires (para.3.26). Regarding nutrition,
fertilizer applications were made during the initial year of planting at a rate of
38 kg of urea, 169 kg of rock phosphate and 42 kg of potash per hectare. Finally
during the second year of tapping deperdition was compensated for by the



- 9 -
applications of 26 kg of urea, 13 kg of rock phosphate and 42 kg of potash per
1000 kg of dry rubber produced per hectare. Finally a joint Bank-FED supervision
mission made a strong case in February 1982 for the marking of all plots and
villages on the estate for proper identification by newcomers, visitors and
persons involved in the project. Funds were made available for such markings, in
1983.
Disease Control
3.09      During the first project, newly established rubber plots suffered
damage mainly from rodents and a leaf disease : Gloeosporium glaucum. The former
is no longer a threat since most plantings have grown into trees. Also the
percentage of both PR107 and PB261 had been markably reduced because of
sensitivity to leaf disease. While the Gloeosporium altered the growth of trees
during the first three years, those infested were subsequently able to catch up
with the other clones. Finally, Fomes did not present any particular threat during
the first project. However, concern was suddenly triggered by a note from the
Abidjan office of the Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED), in April 1978. The
move followed disquieting reports on the increasing incidence of Fomes root
disease at Grand-Bereby. A meeting was convened at the Ministry of Agriculture in
May 1978 during which IRCA was requested to carry out a survey in order to
assess the influence of various land clearing and planting techniques on the
spread of the disease. The severity of the attacks was said to be associated with
the land clearing methods. ORSTOM experts who were also conducting surveys of
their own, predicted up to 30 % losses of trees at Grand-Bereby after ten years.
3.10      IRCATs conclusions were made public in October 1978. The risk of Fomes
at the project site was not negligible and certainly more serious than initially
anticipated. A correlation between the land clearing method and the spread of the
disease was found which led to the abandoning of manual clearing during the second
p-;oject. An inspection and control team was trained by IRCA experts to detect the
disease and systematic surveys were conducted on an annual basis. The actual
incidence of Fomes at Grand-Bereby has now been estimated by both IRCA and the
Project Management at between 0.9 % and 1.2 %, which is still reasonable. In 1982,
IRCA recommended that trees be treated starting the second year after planting
the Fomes being more visible. An anti-fungus chemical, Calixin was then used, with
encouraging results, spread liquid at the foot of the trees. For instance trials
showed that 65 Z of previously infested trees had recovered after two years.
Although less important, otber closely monitored fungus diseases included
Sphaerostilba repens, or purple mold, that affected trees on heavy soils under
waterlogging conditions and, Phytophtora palmivora or black stripe. The latter
affected mostly the clones PR107 and RRIM 600. The treatment consisted in applying
an anti-fungus chemical "Difolatan" on the tapped bark, after each tapping during
the rainy season and once per month in the dry season. Other measures included
interrupting tapping for a few weeks while preventive action required the
application of flint coat on all wounded bark.
3.11      Exploitation. While tapping at Grand-Bereby was initiated in April 1978,
large scale exploitation only started on March 26, 1979. The project adopted the
tapping system recommended at appraisal i.e. the half spiral tapped twice weekly



- 10 -
(1/2S.d3Id/4) 1/ for 45 weeks a year. Trees were opened when 250 trees (55X) per
hectare had a girth of 0.50 meter measuzed at 1 meter above the graft union 2/.
The tapping intensity retained corresponding to about half of the 1/2S.d2 system
taken as reference, trees are stimulated on average 3-4 times per year with
Ethrel. Both the frequency of application and the quantity of stimulant are
adapted to the various clones, in close links with IRCA's recommendations. For
instance, stimulation varied from 2 grams of ethrel per tree, 3-4 times a year on
GTI to I gram per tree, 8 times a year on Avros 2037. Stimulation is always
adjusted so as to prevent over-production of the trees and a possible decrease in
production at an early stage. The project therefore recorded annual girth
increments for both immature trees and trees undergoing tapping. Yields per
tapping were also recorded in order to get information on the response to
stimulation and growth and evaluate the possible interaction between yields and
girthing 3/. Finally, it should be noted that the high standard of planting
resulted in the immature period before coming into production being reduced from
an appraisal estimate of 7 years to an average 5.5 years. By September 1982, the
area under tapping amounted to 3,095 ha and reached some 6,000 ha, in November
1983.
3.12      Tapping Tasks. The area allocated per tapper depended on the number of
tappable trees. It was estimated at appraisal that each task would number 520
trees from inception (year 6) to year 14. The task would be reduced thereafter
to 450 trees as they became larger per unit and fewer in number. It was also
suggested at appraisal that the periodic collection of latex coagulated in plastic
bags as an alternative collection method could, in future, be used to reduce
labor costs. However, because of remaining technical problems, the daily crop was
collected as liquid latex and transported in tankers to the factory. Although not
entirely abandoned the polybag collection system accounted for only 1.5 ton of
rubber in April 1983, or 0.6 % of the 225 tons collected in that month. The main
disadvantages of the periodic collection of latex in plastic bags included both a
lack of homogeneity and difficult quality control since the latex would accumulate
from 5 to 6 tappings. Overall the quality of the rubber thus obtained was
irregular.
3.13      Considerable improvements were made in 1981 when the project introduced
the double cup system. It consisted in equipping each tappable tree with two cups.
The one containing coagulated rubber from the previous tapping was alternated with
the empty cup positioned on an adjacent support. The main advantages of the above
system included : i) a 19 Z increase in the number of trees tapped per task, from
520 to 620 as cups were cleaned after and not before tapping ii) a shorter tapping
period, and iii) an increased productivity per tapper especially in the rainy
season when cup lumps were collected in the same task. The project estimated the
additional cost for equipping the trees, each with two cups, of the entire
13,526 ha estate at about CFAF 300 million. This compares with an anticipated
annua'l saving of some CFAF 314 million as the overall number of tappers needed in
1986 could be reduced by 630, from 3,900.
1/ 1/2S.d3/d4 means 1/2 spiral tapped at an interval of three days (d3) followed
by an interval of four days (d4) between two tappings.
2/ Girth increments of some 1,500 trees were measured since November 1980 on a
quarter yearly basis.
3/ 1,000 trees were controlled on an annual basis. However the data could not be
properly used because girth measurements which were at 1 m above the graft
union on immature trees, had to be raised to 1.70 m as trees were in tapping.

3.14      Labor and Social Services. The shortage of labor remained a constant
concern throughout the first project. At appraisal, the uncertainty attached to
the availability of labor in a sparsely populated region was ranked high among the
risks likely to hamper the second project. The situation improved markably in 1978
ivaen the project was able to provide more housing and social amenities. Chronic
shortages of agricultural labor remained nevertheless a common feature especially
during the rainy season when some workers returned to their villages for foodcrop
cultivation. The shortfall of labor was partly compensated by female labor and
overtime work. Absenteeism which was high until 1978, gradually decreased to about
5%. However, the turnover of personnel remained important although decreasing
from 154 % in 1978, down to 120 Z in 1980 and 72 Z in 1982. In January 1984, the
proiect total labor force comprised 3298 persons of which 1,098 were Ivorians and
2,200 non-Ivorian Africans.
3.15      The project carried out an active recruitment campaign through three
recruitment centers; one at Ferkessedougou to the North of the country and two
located near the Ghana border. Minibuses were purchased to transport the recruited
workers from the centers to the project site. The number of workers hired every
month culminated at 300 before decreasing steadily to about 100 by end-1982.
Furthermore as spontaneous inflow of workers became predominant the center at
Ferkessedougou was closed in March 1983 while the two centers at the Ghanaian
border were merged. Besides the two main administrative centers and their
satellite living quarters, the project had completed 14 villages by the end of
1982. Each village included one office with store, 136 houses for workers and 12
for junior staff. All villages were provided with water (wells) and electricity
(35 kwh generators). Other amenities included a dispensary, a market, a soccer
field, and a television set per village. Three schools were built on the estate
whfrh accommodated somo 550 p"'r4s. A forty-bed "ospital was also completed by the
project and monthly medical con _'tations averaged 22,000 patients, in November
1983 as medical treatment was extended to the workers' families as well as to
people from nearby villages. Other facilities provided by the project included
free transportation, once a week, to the main market at Grand Bereby. Finally the
project made available to the workers, basic items at cost including rice, edible
oil and fish. The above housing program and social services further contributed to
stabilize the labor force. One very interesting feature of the building program
which could be replicable on similar projects in both the Ivory Coast and
elsewhere was that wooden villages had been built during the implementation phase.
The houses were dismantled and rebuilt as implementation progressed. Villages made
of concrete block houses were built once the plantation was complete in a given
area. This practice allowed the project to rapidly accommodate a minimum number of
workers at a low cost. By the end of the project some wooden houses had been moved
up to five times. Out of the existing 14 villages, 9 were made of concrete, 3 made
of wood but were to be rebuilt; while 2 were 70% complete by September 1983. Also
worth mentioning was a 1,000 m airstrip which was officially opened to traffic in
mid-1983.
3.16      Project management was confident that sufficient labor would be
available in future, especially in 1985-86 when a 4,500-5,000 labor force would be
required. The project nevertheless initiated in 1982 the training of women
tappers. As a result 31 women were tapping by mid-1983. Should labor shortages
occur in future another alternative would be for the project to adjust the
frequency of tapping through a careful dosage of stimulant. (Following results of
ongoing experiments by IRCA).

3.17      F'odcrop2. Government had explicitly asked during appraisal that a
foodcrop growing program for farmers living on the rubber concession and for
laborers working on the estate be included in the project. This was done at a late
stage although the appraisal team was convinced that farmers and laborers did not
need any special action in order to grow foodcrops. The project however cleared
some 20 ha of land for each village. Seed for both rice and maize were provided
free by SODEPALM, in 1982. Other crops Included bananas and a root crop, cocoyam.
The project did not have a well defined program as such leaving the initiative to
both farmers and laborers. This appeared to be the most reasonable solution at a
time when project staff was establishing one of the largest rubber plantations in
the world.
3.18      Roads. Some 910 km of all weather roads were completed during the
project. These included 105 km of 8 meter wide access roads and 805 km of 6 meter
wide estate roads. The ratio of road length per hectare planted ranged from 57
meters per hectare to 82 meters with an overall average of 67.3 meters. This is
some 18 % higher than the 55 meters per hectare estimated at appraisal. It
underlines the rather broken topography prevailing at the project site, where
plots are often separated by bottomlands. Another consequence was the
implementation of one culvert per kilometer of road unit, which is high. The
longer road network will no doubt have some negative effect on the daily
transportation costs of latex.
3.19      In 1981, a 30 km stretch of road was improved by Government between the
project and the Nero river. Also the road had been redesigned and shorten by some
15 km. These improvements however did not prevent the main road
Grand-Bereby - San Pedro being closed 10 to 12 days a year because of floodings
during the rainy season. As a result, some 220 tons of rubber had to be stored at
the factory although no storage facilities existed. The problem was not acute at
the time as new tranches of the factory were being built while waiting for the
equipment to arrive. This will no longer be the case in 1984 and adequate storage
facilities will need to be implemented.
3.20      Anti-fire measures. The project gradually build up an efficient
anti-fire system. While workers and nearby villagers were made aware of the risks
of fire at the onset of the dry season, various preventive actions were taken in
the field. Planting of food crops was carefully controlled and burning between
crops was banned. Large firebreaks as well as the plantation boundaries were
cleared of all vegetation, using tractor drawn heavy discs. A senior staff member
was on duty on week-ends and during holidays, from January to April, to direct and
advise anti-fire teams which were on the alert round the clock. Bicycle mounted
patrols toured the plantation regularly, following well defined itineraries.
Communications were through radio transmitters and several trucks equipped with
tanks and pumps were always ready to intervene at short notice. A watchtower was
built on a trial basis in early 1983 to become operational in 1983/84. The above
measures were well rewarded in 1983 when the country experienced an unusually long
dry season. While fires damaged ir, varying degrees, some 700 ha of rubber
throughout the coastal area of the Ivory Coast, only 7 ha 1/ were partly burnt out
of a total 13,526 ha planted at Grand-Bereby. Finally new regulations had been

issued and trespassers were taken to court. Taking all costs into account, the
project estimated the anti-fire measures to amount to CFAF 16.6 million or an
equivalent of CFAF 1236 per hectare of rubber planted.
3.21      Training. The project training program for tappers and foremen was most
impressive especially from 1981 onwards. It could definitely serve as an example
for other rubber estates in the Ivory Coast and elsewhere in Western Africa.
Courses were provided for all tappers in batches of 12 over a four week period.
Those who succeeded the various tests were confirmed as tappers and received
higher salaries as well as bonuses. Women underwent the same training with much
suLcess.
3.22      The project also initiated an adult literacy course for all volunteer
workers. This latter course was met with enthusiasm and results were remarkable.
Complete illiterates were able to write short texts after an average two month
training. Prepared by professionals, the courses stretched over two years. The
above training programs have had a direct impact on both the productivity and
efficiency of most workers.
3.23      Outgrowers'Program. During appraisal, Government asked for an outgrower
program to be incorporated into the second project. This was in line with its
increasing emphasis on income distribution through the promoting of smallholders
in conjunction with estate development to achieve balanced regional development.
At appraisal the mission had expressed a negative view because of insufficient
ground on which to recommend an outgrowers program but the Government insisted
that such program be retained. A 500 ha outgrowers component was therefore
included in the second project. Also funds were made available for a feasibility
study to be carried out which was to lead to a small pilot project. SOGB produced
a brief study, in December 1979, wbich concluded that a 500 ha outgrower scheme
was feasible. Because of low population density, the program was to be established
over a three year period starting in 1980. The Bank indicated, as early as June
1977. that it was not convinced the outgrowers' program could be easily
implemented. Furthermore it felt that additional data was necessary before any
decision could be made. A first tranche of 50 ha was therefore delayed until 1981.
Meanwhile a study was undertaken by BETPA, the MOA's project preparation agency,
whose conclusions became available in August 1980. According to the study the
major problem the Government had to face was one of credibility. Implementation of
the Grand-Bereby Rubber Project had required the partial relocation of the local
population. To facilitate the relocation, the Government had promised to
compensate the dispossessed farmers, to rebuild their villages and to create the
necessary social infrastructure. The report which had found that the Government
had not kept the above promises, concluded that the local population was likely to
reject any program as long as compensation would not materializs. Both the
Government and the Bank views differed significantly from one another. For the
former, the question was an internal matter which it was not prepared to discuss
with the co-financers. The Bank's concern was mainly based on the fact that in the
absence of sufficient funds the Authorities might have been prepared to rely on
persuasion rather than on social projects to convince the farmers of its
seriousness. The Bank therefore took the position that implementation of the
outgrowers component would be subject to the Government specifying, funding and
implementing the necessary measures to regain its credibility with the local
population.



- 14 -
3.24      Implementation of the outgrowers component did not start before
end-1982. This was mainly due to initial problems created by delays in
compensating the settlers from the ared. The matter was only solved in 1982 with
the initial payment of some CFAF 27 million by the Ministry of Agriculture. Also
the settlers'request to have new village sites cleared was met at a late stage.
Not surprisingly the local population who were mostly fishermen and seafarers,
showed little interest in the project. It was not until October 1982 that a
meeting took place at Grand-Bereby, attended by the heads of the local
administration, Ministry of Agriculture, SOGB, villagers and village
representatives to discuss the outgrower program. Finally, a committee was formed
to select possible candidates and retain land for the planting.
3.25      By January 1983, SOGB had one middle level staff and two extension
workers to look after the outgrowers' component. Some 41 ha of forest had been
cleared, put under rice and subsequently planted with rubber by September 30.
1983. Once the land had been cleared by the farmers, SOGB would fell the large
trees at it's own expense. An additionnal 160 ha were cleared and planted during
1983-84. Finally, to complete the initially envisaged program of 500 ba, provision
has been made for forest clearing and planting to rubber of 150 ha in 1984-85 and
1985-86 seasons.
3.26      By September 30, 1984 the smallholder program supervised by SOGB
amounted to some 204 ha belonging to 71 farmers, each with an average area under
rubber of 2.9 ha. This should be compared to the projected 500 ha for the fifth
year of the project. As a consequence of the little interest then shown by farmers
in the outgrowers'program under the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber project no such
component was included in the follow-up project. A d- matic change has taken place
since 1983 as villagers are increasingly interested in the outgrowers scheme.
According to Project management there are some 600 applications from villagers
willing to grow rubber. The corresponding amount of funds thus required till
1985/86 is estimated at CFAF 100 millions, representing the cost of extension.
3.27      Field Trials. It was felt at appraisal that field experiments aimed at
resolving technical problems as they appeared, were necessary. In line with this
approach the project prepared annual applied research programs. Responsibility
for the trials rested with the project Agronomic Director whereas IRCA advised and
monitored the trials on a continuous basis. The main trials included :
i) adoption of new clones - to examine their characteristics at the
project site,
ii) tapping systems and periodicity - in order to find possible
alternatives to reduce labor needs,
iii) use of stimulants at various concentrations - to adjust
production without affecting the trees'productivity,
iv) use of fertilizers -- to maintain future production at the
anticipated level and,
v)   preventive and curative measures against FOMES -  finding the
cheapest and most efficient means to control the disease.
3.28      Project management found most trials as being relevant to the project
needs. However, it would have appreciated it if IRCA could have released some of
its recommendations, especially regarding the use of Calixin against Fomes, a



- 15 -
little earlier 1/. Cooperation between IRCA and SOGB remained nevertheless good
throughout the project life.
3.29      Rubber Factory. The building of the first unit of the factory was
initiated in April 1980 and completed on time and with the expected capacity, in
December 1982. The same processing method was used as suggested at appraisal. The
main equipment included two latex lines and one field coagulum line. Liquid latex
was transported to the factory on a daily basis by a fleet of 13 trucks and two
tractors with trailers. Latex was coagulated, rolled into sheets, macerated in a
creper, hammered in a mill, reduced into granules dried,weighed and pressed into
33 kg blocks which were finally wrapped in polyethylene film and loaded in 18 ton
capacity containers. By the end of the project - September 1982 - some 2,744 t of
rubber had been produced compared with an anticipated 2,632 t. This is some 4%
above appraisal estimates although the project experienced several delays in
putting new areas under tapping due to the late delivery of equipment. The average
daily quantity of latex processed soared from 40,000 liters in September 1982 to
60-70,000 1. in August 1983, with a dry rubber content (DRC) of up to 30% in the
dry season and 26% in the wet season. Meanwhile a second unit of the factory was
started in December 1982 increasing the daily processing capacity from 11 t of
rubber to 30 t. Finally, the only significant change to the appraisal proposals
was the operation of steam dryers using fuel oil (55 1 per ton of dry rubber)
instead of wood since the latter would have become increasingly difficult to
collect sufficiently close to remain economical.
IV. FINANCIAL-ASPECTS
Costs
4.01      The actual cost of the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber project amounted to
CFAF 11,950 million when comDleted in September 1982, as compared to
CFAF 11,000 million estimated at appraisal. (Annex 2 table 1). This represents a
rather modest 9% increase in CFAF terms. However, added to the costs of the first
project (CFAF 7,355 million), the final cost of the rwo phase project to establish
13,500 ha of rubber from 1972 to 1978, reached CFAF f9,303 million i.e 286% of the
initial estimate of CFAF 6,758 million. The 186% cost overrun was mostly due to
some three years delay in the implementation schedule, a higher inflation rate
than expected and an underestimation of costs. Because the physical and price
contingencies are not specifically allocated to individual categories of
expenditure in the SAE, overall contingencies have been applied to each category
as below
1/ IRCA is of the opinion that before making recommendations, Research should be
sure that there would be no side or long term effects (for instance, phyto-
toxicity).

4.02      While it was anticipated at appraisal that the inflation coefficient
would range from 7 to 9% the actual inflation index remained at an average 12 to
14% 1/. Costs overruns for the newly established 6,500 ha amounted to
CEAF7 400 million including some CFAF 223 million as more tracks than envisaged bad
to be opened together with a higher construction standard and, CFAF 177 million
because of a 14% inflation index on fertilizer instead of 7% and a doubling in the
cost of herbicides. An additional CFAF 292 million were spent on infrastructure
not foreseen at appraisal including a well equipped 40 bed hospital, an airfield,
a market and electrification of the workers quarters. Finally an extra CFAF 116
million was needed because of an increase in the cost of building materials,
especially cement which rose 25% per annum during the project life, instead of 9%.
Financing
4.03      It was anticipated at appraisal that four cofinancers including the
Bank, CCE, FED and BEI were to participate with the Government, in the financing
of the project. However in 1979, Michelin agreed with the Government to meet the
costs of the factory. Thus the related US$ 4.5 million loan from BEI was no longer
required. Meanwhile contributions from the three remaining cofinancers were left
unchanged as shown below
1/ In the SAR, inflation for buildings was estimated in CFAF terms at 9% in 1978
and 1979 and 8% tbereafter. Inflation for equipment and vehicles were estimated
at 7,7%, and at 7% for all other costs. Actual inflation reached 14% in 1978/79;
10% in 1980 and 14% in 1981-82 and 83.

The average exchange rate varied little throughout the project from
CFAF 245 to CFAF 248 to the US dollar despite lows of CFAF 211 in 1980 and highs
of CFAF 340 in 1983 at time of last disbursements. This nevertheless provided the
project with a CFAF 62 million gain on the Bank loan and a CFAF 122 million
surplus from the FED loan, of which CFAF 37 million unallocated were transferred
to the Government. The latter amount was subsequently called for by SOGB when the
Government was having increasing difficulties in providing its counterpart funds.
The Bank loan covered 49.5% of the direct agricultural costs of the project,
housing construction, salaries, vehicles and outgrowers program. It did not in any
way contribute to the factory investment which was paid for by Michelin.
Procurement
4.04      While under the first Grand-Bereby Rubber project procurement was
through international competitive bidding (ICB) for all individual international
contracts exceeding US$ 50,000, this amount was increased to US$ 100,000 during
the second project. Similarly local competitive bidding (LCB) were increased from
US$ 20,000 to US$ 50,000. The project did not experience any significant
procurement problem and the suppliers kept up to their commitments. As under the
first project, FED continued to take the lead on both procurement and disbursement
matters. This also consisted in representing the co-lenders at bid openings and
bid awards.
Disbursement
4.05      Despite lengthy delays in effectiveness (para. 3.01), disbursements
exceeded appraisal estimates until the end of the project when actual
disbursements came in line with the schedule. The US$ 20 million loan from the
Bank was completely disbursed by November 30, 1983 (Annex 2 table 2). Below is a
comparison of actual and appraisal disbursements :

4.06      Although the project was only signed June 9, 1978 (para 2.09)
implementation of the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber project had been initiated
without waiting for effectiveness. However, in April 1978, the Ministry of
Agriculture suddenly decided to stop all development work pertaining to the
follow-up project, while awaiting for funds to be made available by the
co-financers. The decision partially reflected the fact that the Government had
not officially approved the project. When the Ministry enquired on possible
retroactive financing for the development costs already incurred since January 1,
1978 or to be incurred in future, the colenders stressed the need for early and
clear decision on project acceptability by the Government. The Government decision
was logical since the funds were likely to be made available much later than
anticipated. Meanwhile CAA had been prefinancing the project although for unknown
reasons SATAC had not received authorization from MOA to go ahead with the second
phase. Following concern voiced by both FED and the Bank in June 1978, at the
negative impact that would result from a sudden interruption of all development
work, MOA notified SATAC to proceed with implementing the second phase project, on
July 21, 1978. Nevertheless, the several months disruption resulted in serious
delays in the purchase of vehicles, equipment and inputs required to implement the
1978 program.
4.07      In June 1980 the project experienced new delays when CAA which had
so-far prefinanced up to CFAF 2.6 billion, suspended all financing to SOGB. Again
the colenders took prompt action and expressed their concern to the Ministry of
Finance on July 1, 1980. The situation had become critical as on July 16, 1980 the
Bank had already received four requests for reimbursement from the project,
totalling CFAF 2.1 billion (US$ 10.0 million equivalent) or half of the Bank loan.
Furthermore, by mid-August 1980, project management had not enough funds to meet
the September salaries. Because of the above large overdraft, CAA was making
advances to SOGB amounting only to 35Z of its needs. Most of the overdraft was
accounted for by delayed reimbursement by the Bank pending loan effectiveness.
There is no record on file of any action taken at the time by the Ministry of
Finance. The project finally became effective September 15, 1980 thus allowing the
financial situation to ease considerably.
4.08      Additional delays occured as the Government had not, by January 1981.
approved SOGB's annual program for 1980/81 which had already started in October
1980. As a consequence the project could not go to tender for urgently needed
equipment and spare parts. Furthermore, counterpart funds from Government (CAM)
were increasingly late 11. For instance, by April 1981, SOGB had some

US$ 4.3 million committed since early February. The minimum period for suppliers
to be reimbursed went from 60 to 90 days. As a result, an increasing number of
suppliers became reluctant to meet the projects many demands, which in turn made
it more difficult for management to run the project. Delays of up to three months
occurred at times in the processing of applications for reimbursement including
two months in the Ivory Coast and one month within the Bank. It must be noted that
the disbursement documents forwarded to Washingtnn would on average require some
three weeks to reach the Disbursement Division. These delays were considerably
reduced - down to 72 hours - starting January 1982 when RMWA had its urgent mail
sent through a specialized agency for quick delivery. Once the applications were
processed by the Disbursement Division, it usually took between two to three weeks
for the funds to be transferred from BCEAO (Centrale Bank) to CAA and for SOGB to
be notified.
Auditing and Accounting
4.09      The project had a record of late auditing of its accounts. Also yearly
budgets were not always submitted on time mostly because of the Government's
financial constraints. Considerable improvement was recorded in early 1983 when
the 1982/83 audit report reached the Bank in April 1983. Meanwhile, the Government
had changed the Auditors based on the rule that Auditors should not work on the
same project for more than four years in a row. The project accounts have always
been certified.
Reporting
4-1O      The management contract with the Government provided for three types of
report : (a) monthly, summary activity reports, (b) quarterly, more detailed
repcrts with cost data and (c) annually, reports relating actual achievements with
anticipated targets, the corresponding costs and justifications. While monthly
reports of good quality, were regularly sent to RMWA, delivery of the quarterly
and annual reports was rather erratic. Quarterly work programs with their related
budgets were also submitted to the Government and the co-financers for approval.
Finally a descriptive report was received in July 1983 - giving details of
functions and operations of the plantation training center. SOGB had been
repeatedly encouraged by Bank supervision missions to give more publicity to this
very positive aspect of their activities.
Compliance wita Covenants
4.11      The Government complied with most of the covenants included in the
Development Loan Agreement with the exception of Section 3.06 whereby the Borrower
was to furnish annual budgets and other financial plans at least three months
before the beginning of the fiscal years to which they were related- the matter
was regularly taken up with Project Management. However much of the delays
originated in the MOA (DPBCG) where the budget review was timed to be finalized by
the beginning of the calendar year (Government fiscal year) instead of the 30th
September (project fiscal year).
V. PROJECT IMPACT
5.01      The main objectives of the project included the maintaining of some



- 20 -
7,000 ha of rubber plantation established in previous years, implementing an
additional 6,500 ha of new plantings and bringing an Increasing area under
production 1/. Also, a 500 ha outgrowers' program was to be implemented although
it was very difficult, at the time to estimate how the program would evolve in a
region with virtually no farming activity.
Incremental Output
5.02      Anticipated primary benefits were to include increased production and
export of rubber, which at full development would amount to some 31,000 tons or
33% of projected Ivorian production at the time, and annual rnet foreign exchange
earnings of US$ 24 million. The annual quantities of rubber produced were as
follows

5.03      It was estimated during appraisal that yields would start at a more
modest 600 kg/ha the first year of tapping (year £) instead of 1,000 kg/ha as
originally foreseen during appraisal of the First Grand-Bereby Rubber project. The
increase in yields were to reach 2,300 kg/ha in year ten, remain at the same level
for 10 years and decline thereafter to 1,400 kg/ha by the end of the tapping
period (year 41). So far the average annual yields per tapping year remain
satisfactory when compared with appraisal estimates, as shown below

At times project yields exceeded appraisal estimates by up to 20 per cent.
However, project management felt that the increase in production over appraisal
estimates was likely to level off at about 10% in 1984. Regular girth measurements
were carried out in relation to production. However, the period of measurements
was too short to single out any meaningful correlation. There would definitely be
a need for a longer time span before modifying future production estimates in
coming years.
1/ While 3,095 ha were under production by completion of the Second Grand-Bereby
Project, nearly 6,000 ha were under tapping in December 1983.



- 21 -
Market and Prices
5.04      A contract was signed in 1980, between SOGB and Michelin by which the
latter agreed to purchase all rubber produced by SOGB at a price related to world
market prices. A large increase in the price of crude oil in 1979 helped sustain
the price of natural rubber as it caused the price of synthetic rubber to rise
significantly. The cost-induced increase in the price of synthetic rubber brought
an increase in the price of natural rubber in 1979-80. However, prolonged world
recession depressed the average world market price from US$ 1.34/kg (RSS-1 CIF
London) down to US$ 1.25/kg in 1981 and US$ 1.02/kg in 1982. Prices rose again in
1983, reaching US$ 1.24/kg. Projections in 1983 constant dollars put the price at
US$ 1.29/kg in 1984 and US$ 1.27/kg in 1985 whereas in the longer term prices are
projected at US$ 1.37/kg in 1990 and US$ 1.53/kg in 1995.
Social Impact
5.05      It was estimated at appraisal that the project would provide employment
for some 4,500 workers once the plantation is in full production. This would add a
population of 15,000 to the area, to serve as a focal point for the development of
supporting services and other economic activities including the generating of
indirect job opportunities. The total labor force which numbered 2,688 persons
including 29 Ivorian senior and middle level staff and 15 expatriates, in
September 1982, reached 3,298 persons with 14 expatriates, in January 1984. The
resulting population on the estate was thus estimated at about 8 to 9,000 people
when family members were accounted for. The number of medical visits reached an
impressive 22,244, in November 1983, of which 20,628 were for workers alone and
their related family. Stabilization of labor improved over recent years. For
instance, while 48 workers were seeking employment at the project site in
September 1982, an additional 169 had to be recruited at high costs from distant
recruiting stations. In November 1983, the figures were 67 and 60 respectively.
The project provided for the training of numerous workers including adult literacy
courses as well as on the job training for the many skills required to run a large
rubber plantation. A sizeable number of permanent jobs were thus created.
5.06      Although the outgrowers' program started after completion of the current
project it should benefit in the years to come from the nucleus plantation with
outgrowers approach, which offers advantages in the sphere of employment,
extension and large-scale central processing. The possibilities of employment on
the nucleus plantation would serve as a valuable extension factor in the outgrower
planting sector. Finally another benefit from the project was that of improving
the capability of Ivorian nationals to operate and manage a rubber project,
through technical assistance and continuous training.
Environmental Aspects
5.07      Substantial destruction of forest took place over some 15,000 ha 1/ of
land, using heavy equipment. The methods adopted, however, prevented to a great
extent both soil degradation and eroslon by (i) using chainsaws to fell the larger
trees instead of uprooting them, (ii) planting a cover crop immediately after
windrowing to prevent water erosion and exposure of fragile forest soil to the
scorching sun, (iii) replacing tropical rain forest with rubber, a perennial tree
crop meant to occupy the soil for some 40 years and, (iv) planting along contour
lines whenever needed.
1/ 13,526 ha of plantations and about 1OZ for roads and villages.



- 22 -
5.08      Regarding the rubber factory stringent anti-pollution measures were
adopted in line with the suggestions made at appraisal. The processing of latex
was already requiring a continuous 12 m 3 per hour 1/ flow of water in September
1982. Effluent from the factery was purified before being discharged into natural
waterways. To that end water was first filtered at the factory level before
running into two decanting tanks made of masonry. The water would then flow into
two artificial lakes the second of which was stocked with fish in 1983.
VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION 2/
Financial Analysis
6.01      Estimated cash flow statement, income statement and balance sheets from
1987 through to 2025 for the SOGB are presented in the SAR for the Fourth Rubber
Project (Loan 2323-IVC). These show that self generated funds will remain at a low
yearly level of approximately US$ 3.7 million (1982 terms) between 1982 and 1987,
as production builds up. During the following 22 years of full production self
generated funds would average US$ 37.0 million p.a. Annual operating surpluses
(before debt service) are expected, in line with the second project appraisal
report to appear in 1985, which is the year during which Bank financing under the
Fourth Rubber Project terminates. No financial rate of return was apparently
calculated in the appraisal of the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project. A
calculation of the financial rate of return 2/ carried out for this completion
report on the basis of data presented in the Fourth Rubber Project SAR gives a
satisfactory result of 10.4% taking into account all costs and investments since
1972, with a cut off after 40 years (Annex 3 table 1).
Economic Benefits
6.02      The project can justifiably be considered to have furthered Government's
program of agricultural diversification and regional development in the south
west. Primary benefits from increased production and export of rubber are expected
to be slightly in excess of the 30,000 tons foreseen at the time of appraisal of
the second-Grand Bereby project and are estimated at 30,800 tons during the period
(1989-2007). By early 1984, the project is already providing employment to 3,300
people and this is expected to increase to 4,500 when tapping is in progress
throughout the estate in 1987.
6.03      A detailed economic analysis of the Grand-Bereby plantation was
undertaken in 1983 in the course of the appraisal of the Fourth Rubber Project
which includes a follow-up to the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project. No separate
analysis has been carried out for this Completion Report in view of the short
period of time which has elapsed since then and of the insignificant differences
in performance levels. The first project appraisal calculated a 13.2% rate of
return for the full 13,500 ha, which were never, in fact, realised under the first
project. The second project appraisal using efficiency market and shadow prices
1/ 16 m3/h in August 1983.

produced economic rates of return between 11Z-12% for the full 13,526 ha estate.
The latest economic analysis of the Grand-B8reby plantation prepared in 1383 for
the project appraisal report returned an ERR of 13.5Z over 40 years for the 13,526
ha estate, (Annex 3, table 2). Although there have been some changes in the
assumptions used, the main reasons for the slight increase in ERR are the improved
projected production levels and price outlook (para. 5.04) which have more than
compensated for the project cost increase.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
7.01      Responsibility for executing the project was vested in SOGB, a mixed
company 90% owned by the Government and 10% by Michelin. The company was
officially created by decree N' 79223 of March 22, 1979 and its statutes were
approved on April 18, 1979. SOGB which was headed by a Managing Director, had a
similar organizational chart to that of the First Grand-Bereby Rubbi..r Project with
the exception that the Administration Department was split into three departments
including : Administration, Finance and Marketing. The company had a Board
comprising nine members, seven of whom were jointly nominated by the Ministries of
Finance and Agriculture and two by Michelin. The main functions of the Board were
to : (i) formulate policies (ii) approve the capital structure (iii) designate the
Managing Director to be nominated by both the Ministries of Finance and
Agriculture (iv) delegate to the Managing Director all the necessary
responsibilities to run the project efficiently and, approve the annual reports
and accounts. Meetings of the Board were convened on a bi-annual basis. This
practice was more or less adhered to as seven such meetings were recorded between
April 1979 and November 1982. Topics discussed during these meetings were mainly
on financial matters but also i-cluded : the designation of a Managing Director,
the need for Michelin staff to adequately train counterpart personnel, the fact
that all personnel should be unuer the direct responsibility of the Managing
Director, technical improvements originating from SOGB should be protected by
Trade Marks and a close follow-up on the project policy towards replacing
expatriates by Ivorians.
7.02      Two Ministries had direct responsibilities towards the project : the
Ministry of Finance that provided funds through CAA to prefinance the project
activities and, the Ministry of Agriculture that supervised the project
technically and approved the annual programs and budgets. Both Ministries
experienced difficulties in carrying out their responsibilities. Because of the
country's financial constraints, CAA was unable to meet its monthly financing thus
creating continuous cash flow problems to the executing agency. In fact, SOGB
managed to maintain its working program mainly by drawing on suppliers' credit.
Regarding the supervision of the project, the Minist-y of Agriculture replaced its
only senior advisor familiar with rubber, in 1979 with a young Ivorian
agriculturist whose contribution within the Ministry's "Cellule Hevea" remained
limited. On the Government side, annual budgets were usually approved between 5
and 6 months after the beginning of the financial year by the Budget department.
7.03      The project experienced a continuously high turnover of staff. A new
Managing Director was appointed in June 1979, who relinquished his position in
July 1983. The Plantation Manager left after three years and was replaced in



- 24 -
August 1982. The Financial Director was replaced in March 1981 and his replacement
had his contract terminated in mid-1983 1/. In addition, several rotations took
place at the project level, between 1980 and 1982 2/. It appeared in most cases
that the changes resulted from Michelin's Personnel policy - allowing for rotating
and promoting staff after two to three years. SOGB and Michelin usually notified
the Bank about the replacement of the Plantation Manager but not always about the
other Directors changes. Furthermore CVs were either sent late and/or
incomplete. Although most nominees proved competent, reminders had to be sent to
SOGB Management requesting compliance with the project agreement (section 3.01
(b)) whereby the qualification and experience of the candidates had to be
satisfactory to the Bank.
7.04      The team seconded by Michelin did very good work and overall the high
turnover ef staff did not prove to be detrimental to project implementation.
Members of the team were competent, dedicated and extremely cooperative with
co-lenders missions. Also worth mentioning was the continuous and strong back-up
support p.rovided by Michelin from its headquarters in France. Altogether this
resulted in continuous improvements in the field i.e. the approach to training was
remarkable, the quality and control of tapping was excellent and anti-fire
measures proved most effective, to name a few. Finally the team managed to instil
the same spirit to some of the Ivorian staff, which is most encouraging.
7.05      The project did not include a program of replacement of expatriates by
Ivorians. Instead, management prepared in April 1982 a training program for senior
and middle level staff with the view of gradually replacing expatriates with
competent Ivorians. However, finding suitable local senior staff remained
difficult during most of the project due to i) the remoteness of the project site
ii) the tight discipline required on the estate and iii) the salaries offered
which were less attractive than those in the private sector and other state-owned
ventures i.e. Palmindustrie. According to the Plantation Manager, there was a
significant improvement in the demand for employment on the estate and in the
quality of new senior Ivorian recruits in 1982/83. This was directly related to
the increasing difficulty for graduates to find jobs in the country.
VIII. PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
8.01      The Bank's overall performance has been creditable. It designed and
supported a follow-up project based on the experience gained from the First
Grand-Bereby Rubber Project. It was only under heavy pressure from Government that
the Bank agreed to include after appraisal an outgrowers' program on a pilot basis
as well as a food crops component. The former program did not materialize during
the project for reasons explained in (para.3.23 to 3.26) whereas the latter
component required only nominal involvement from the project.
1/ Comments from SOGB management are in annexe 4.
2/ The workshop manager left the plantation in early 1982 following the death of
his wife in a car accident just outside the estate.



- 25 -
8.02      The Bank maintained as much staff continuity as possible during the six
missions which took place from 1979 to 1983 1/. Although five different persons
were on those missions at one time or another, two supervised the project on two
to three occasions. In addition to the field visits, RMWA staff was always
available at short notice to attend meetings in Abidjan in relation to accounting
and procurement matters. While this explains the more than one year interval
between the 11179 and 09/81 visits, it does not reflect the actual large
involvement of the Bank. Also, FED which had kept the leadership from the first
project on procurement and disbursement matters sent several separate missions to
the project site. These latter missions decreased the cost of Bank supervision
while maintaining contacts between project management and co-lenders at a
sufficient level. In retrospect however, it would have been of great assistance
to the project if the supervision missions had given at an early stage, even
greater emphasis to the problems connected with road maintenance, especially
between the project site and the port of San Pedro, and to the compensation issue
of dispossessed farmers, with a view to getting them resolved by the Ministries
concerned.
8.03      One interesting feature of supervision from RMWA was that because of the
proximity of Project Management as well as Government Services, verbal follow-up
was often a common practice. Hence when consulting the files it sometimes appears
as if follow-up was not always adequate. For instance, a letter was sent by RMWA
to CAA on January 2, 1979 urgently requesting the sending of a statement of all
funds and the sources thereof received by CAA for the purpose of the program
during the preceding fiscal year of the Borrower. A written reminder was sent to
CAA on November 23, 1979. The reply from CAA was dated December 21, 1979, which
tends to suggest that written follow-ups were more effective than verbal ones.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      Overall, the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project was successfully
implemented and well managed. The planting target of 6,500 ha was completed in
October 1981, one year ahead of schedule. The high standard of planting and
maintenance and the appropriate choice of clonal material resulted in trees coming
into production on an average 5.5 years instead of the 7 years anticipated at
appraisal. Production remained most of the time above appraisal forecasts, by some
6 to 10%. With the exception for the outgrowers' program, the other main
components reached at least the level initially set at appraisal.
9.02      Project preparation was carried out without any major difficulty and
appraisal took place shortly after transmission of the feasibility study to the
Bank, by Government. It was unfortunate that the Government chose to indicate at a
late stage, at appraisal, that it wanted an outgrowers' program included in the
project. It also requested a food crop component which in the end involved very
little in terms of commitment by the project. The Bank which had great doubts on
the future success of an outgrowers prograr in a sparsely populated area, rightly
asked for a survey to be carried out. in fact two surveys were produced whose
conclusions were somewhat contradictory. Government tended to play down the issues

beyond the completion date of September 1982.



- 26 -
especially on land compensation and made promises as to the resettlement of
dispossessed land owners. The outgrowers program only started at the end of the
project mostly because the Government was late in compensating people.
9.03      The overall cost of the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project was only 9%
higher than anticipated. This was reasonable given the average 14% annual
inflation rate compared to 8% as estimated at appraisal. Project implementation
was at times seriously hampered by delays in obtaining counterpart funds from the
Government. Also lengthy bureaucratic procedures in processing application forms
for disbursement added to the project's continuous financial difficulties.
9.04      More positively, the project senior staff was motivated and competent.
Sufficient labor became available and the training program for workers was most
impressive to the extent that it could serve as an example for other rubber
estates in Ivory Coast and Western Africa. The main reason for the success of the
training program stemmed from the full time availability of a training specialist.
9.05      Although the project is rightly considered as a success some lessons can
be learned :
a) Labor : Establishing an industrial plantation requiring a large labor
force, in a sparcely populated area often results in serious
problems. Although the lack of sufficient labor in the project area
was not flagged during the first project as a potential issue, it
remained a major constraint throughout the first and second projects.
The pace of construction of houses was always well behind the arrival
of new labor. Also an expensive recruitment scheme had to be adopted
whereby the project sent transportation facilities to the distant
North of the country as well La to the Ghanaian border to tap
incoming labor from neighbouring countries. Better coordination at
the national level might have eased the problem and lowered the
costs.
b) Outgrowers' Program : As anticipated at appraisal, implementation of
this component turned out to be difficult for reasons including i)
too light and too late a feasibility study (completed in 1980) to
help solve the main issues ii) insufficient involvement of the local
population at an early stage iii) lack of interest in the project as
a large portion of the population was made up of fishermen and
seafarers iv) land tenure problems and v) slow compensation and
resettlement of dispossessed farmers by the Government. As a result
only 41 ha out of the anticipated 500 ha had been established by
September 1982. Consequently the outgrowers component was left out of
the fourth rubber project.
c) Disbursement : While the project experienced increasing delays in
obtaining counterpart funds, the procedures for processing
applications for disbursement were unnecessary long. Also, the
Government would only approve the project budget in January when
SOGB's annual program would actually start in October. Subsequently
the procedures for processing applications for disbursement were
notably shortened when preparing the Fourth Rubber Project.

9.06      The Main reasons which led to the success of the Second Grand-Bereby
Project include :
i) the simplicity of the project which was mainly a follow-up to
previous actions initiated during a first phase, these comprised the
implementation of a nucleus plantation, a small pilot outgroNers'
scheme, a factory and a building and road construction program,
ii) the efficiency of the expatriate management team which proved to be
competent and dedicated,
iii) the continuous and strong back-up support to the project by
Michelin-France. This led to high standards of management being
maintained as well as to several innovations being adopted which
proved beneficial i.e mostly for tapping and at the factory,
iv) the outstanding training methods for tappers and junior level staff,
v) the project geographical location not far away from the port of
San Pedro and,
vi) the relative autonomy of the project which was under the
responsibility of a statutory entity with little outside
Interference.

Dear Sir:
I am in receipt of the draft Completion Report on the Second
Grand-Berby Rubber Project (Loan 1575-IVC, 1978), and wish to make the
following comment:
Page 30, para. 7.03 [TN: Page 31 in the copy provided as background material;
page 24 in the English version.]:
"The Financial Director was replaced in March 1981 and his
replacement had his contract abruptly/suddenly (brusquement)*
terminated in mid-lQ83."
Because the letter Cppointing Mr. Caylar to SOGB did not indicate a
specific period for his secondment, we consider it inaccurate to refer to his
contract as being abruptly or stddenly terminated. However, it is a cause for
satisfaction that this personnel change did not adversely affect the progress
of the project or disrupt the Finance Department's operations.
In fact, the Ivorian official responsible for internal auditing
acted as Financial Director for four months after Mr. Caylar's departure,
followed by a further two months after the arrival of the new appointee,
Mr. Weiller. SOGB's Managing Director applied to Michelin for a short-term
mission to facilitate the transfer of duties, and, to this end, Mr. Caylar
returned to SOC-B from November 7 to 15, 1983, this period being considered
adequate by Mr. Weiller.
Yours, etc.
pp. the Managing Director

(Attention: Mr. Ameur)
Dear Sir:
In answer to your letter of March 15, 1985, I am pleased to inform
you that I have no objections to raise as regards the Completion Report on the
Second Grand-Bereby Rubber Project (Loan 1575-IVC).
I wish only to emphasize that this project, in addition to helping
diversify the export crops produced by Ivory Coast, is a major factor in the
development of the Southwest of the country.
It is gratifying that the project was completed about 15 months
before the date originally set, and I think the project's management deserves
credit for the fact that current average production exceeds projections by
more than lOZ. I am therefore convinced that the Second Grand-Bereby Rubber
Project is a great success.
Yours, etc.

Education and the Director of

Dear Mr. Watanabe:
I apologize for not answering your letter of March 15, 1985,
regarding the completion report for the second Grand Berby Rubber project
more promptly.
I am pleased to note that everything looks good, very good in fact.
As you well know, the same cannot be said of a number of other agricultural
projects.
This report will make a most useful contribution to our
"agro-industrial projects" sectoral evaluation currently under way.
I greatly appreciate your sending this report.
Yours sincerely,
Hellmut Eggers
