The\n            project achieved its objectives, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, providing adequate housing and social\n            amenities is the key to retaining labor and avoiding\n            expensive recruitment schemes. Second, the thorough training\n            of tappers and foremen is essential, insofar as having a\n            major positive effect on the project's main physical\n            asset, trees. Third, the timely and adequate compensation of\n            dispossessed farmers is essential to ensure full\n            participation of the latter in any scheme. Fourth, turning\n            traditional subsistence farmers into rubber growers was\n            complex, especially since most of the farmers had better\n            cash incomes as fishermen and seafarers. Finally, lengthy\n            bureaucratic procedures, particularly in approving the\n            annual budget and processing disbursement applications, can\n            unnecessarily jeopardize the smooth implementation of a project."}, "docdt": "1985-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
