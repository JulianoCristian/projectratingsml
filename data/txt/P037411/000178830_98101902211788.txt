INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
ISRAEL BANK OF AGRICULTURE LIMITED WITH THE
GUARANTEE OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL FOR A SECOND
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Israel Bank of Agriculture Limited (IBA), with the guarantee of the
State of Israel, for the equivalent of US$35 million to help finance a second
agricultural credit project. The loan would have a term of 15 years, includ-
ing three and a half years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
Part of the proceeds of the loan would be relent to two other agricultural
banks, Yaad Agricultural Development Bank Ltd. (YAAD) and Nir Ltd. (NIR),
and to the Government for its Agricultural Research Organization (ARO) on
the same terms. The three banks would on-lend to subborrowers at 9 percent
interest with varying maturities depending on the type of subproject. ARO's
portion would be used for carrying out project-related research.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum entitled "Current Economic Position of Israel" (341-IS),
dated February 25, 1974 has been distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. Country Data sheets (Annex I) are attached.
3.        Israel's economy has grown rapidly during the 1960's, GDP growth
averaging around 9 percent per year. Because the country has few natural
resources, growth has been based largely on the skills of its people, and
on a very large capital inflow from abroad. Although the domestic market
has expanded considerably (per capita income reached $2,476 in 1972), ex-
ports remain crucial for continued growth and economic viability.
4.        The gross domestic product at factor cost grew by over 11 percent
in 1971 and 1972 in real terms with industry growing at 11 percent, agri-
culture at 12 percent and services at 12 percent in 1972. Consumption grew
less rapidly as public consumption was held constant and the gross savings
rate increased sharply from 6 percent of GDP in 1970 to 16 percent in 1972.
The investment rate rose from 27 percent of GDP in 1970 to 30 percent in
1972. The resource gap fell from 21 percent of GDP in 1970 to 14 percent
in 1972. Following relative price stability during 1968-69, prices rose by
12-13 percent annually in 1971 and 1972, and by 25 percent between December
1972 and December 1973, due to a significant rise in import prices and to
demand pressures fuelled by monetary expansion. Large capital inflows led
to increased exchange reserves and contributed to the growth of the money
supply. The Government and the Bank of Israel are both attempting to ab-
sorb liquidity, restrain demand and slow price rises.



- 2 -
5.        Public sector expenditure has been around 60 percent of GDP since
1970, with its increased role in the economy made possible by the restraint
of private consumption through tax increases and compulsory loans, as well
as a growing public sector deficit financed increasingly from abroad. De-
fense expenditure accounted for about half current: expenditures and 20 per-
cent of GDP in 1972, and had declined by about 10 percent in real terms since
1970. Budgetary transfers for interest pavments, subsidies for export pro-
motion and price stabilization, and transfers to local authorities accounted
for another 25-30 percent of current expenditures. Public capital expendi-
tures which represented 9 percent of GDP irn 1972 have grown by 20 percent
annually in current terms since 1970, with about one-third going for housing
finance. Tax revenue went up by over 25 percent annually in current terms
and represented 35 percent of GDP in 1971 and 1972. The public sector def-
icit has been around IS 5 billion annually since 1970 but has dropped as a
share of GNP from 25 percent in 1970 to 18 percent in 1972. Gross financing
requirements which include amortization were about IS 7 billion ($1.7 billion)
in 1972/73. Slightly more than half is met from abroad and the rest from
domestic financing, particularly compulsory loans, with credit from the bank-
ing systenm reduced from 40 percent in 1969 to nil in 1972.
6.        Exports grew faster than imports in both 1971 and 1972, but the
current account deficit remained over $1 billion. Unilateral transfers have
risen sharply and reached $1,054 million in 1972, Lhe equivalent of the cur-
rent account deficit. The transfers are divided in fairly equal proportions
between restitution paymentS by West Germany, personal cash transfers by new
immigrants and residents, anid institutional transfers.  Gross foreign capital
inflow has been around $1 billion per annum and net loans about $600 maillion
since 1970.  Borrowing terms have improved, witn sales of development bonds
and US military credits precdominating. The big capital inflows since 1970
have permitted large increases in official exchange reserves, which reached
$1.5 billion gross in Septenmber 1973 (and $1.3 billion net), equivalent to
nearly six months' imports of goods. The Israeli pound was devalued relative
to the US dollar in August 1971 and has moved with it since; revaluation and
upward floating of European currencies vis-a-vis the dollar until July 1973
brought some benefit to Israeli exports to the ElC.
7.        The Government's indicative plan, prepared before the October 1973
war, had aimed at an annual rate of real GNP growth of almost 8 percent in
the years 1974-78, to enable the absorption of about 65,000 immigrants ex-
pected annually and permit a steady increase in investment and living stand-
ards. The growth target had been based largely on a projected expansion of
exports by 13 percent per annum. Agriculture provides an important share
of exports and Israel has been successful in exporting high-value specialty
crops to the European off-season market. Industrial exports have been diver-
sified rapidly although polished diamonds remain the large item. Since the
expanded EEC takes almost 40 percent of Israel's exports and provides half
its imports, the terms of the new trade agreement being negotiated could be
important for Israel's export potential. Both side, aim to establish an in-
dustrial free trade area. after a transition period to permit Israel's indus-
tries to adjust to European competition.



8.        The October 1973 war caused the mobilization of perhaps 30 percent
of the labor force from both private and government sectors and the requisi-
tioning of most road transport. It was announced in November that mobiliza-
tion would be continued at a high level for a further three months. Prelim-
inary indications are that GNP fell in the fourth quarter of the year, off-
setting the growth achieved during the first nine months of 1973 and result-
ing in little if any overall growth above 1972 levels. The impact has however
been uneven among the various sectors. Agricultural activity continued normal-
ly in the relatively slack season in spite of the mobilization of 40 percent
of the agricultural work force, as other normally economically inactive persons
filled the gap. Industry has been more heavily affected since 30 percent of
its labor force was withdrawn and the pattern of demand has shifted abruptly to
defense-oriented output and away from consumer items. Construction activities
virtually ceased. Tourist arrivals are estimated to have fallen by 10 percent
in 1973 but earnings in dollars were about 10 percent higher owing to price
rises in Israel. Exports of goods are estimated to have been about 25 percent
higher in 1973 than in 1972, thanks to the rapid growth until September, which
was due mainly to rises in the prices of exported commodities. Imports, how-
ever, were probably more than 40 percent higher than in 1972, with a consequent
widening of the trade gap.
9.        To mobilize resources to meet the increased budgetary needs, severe
fiscal measures were introduced in November 1973, involving a compulsory and
a 'voluntary' loan related to incomes, a 5 percent increase in all indirect
taxes including the rate of import duties, 30-50 percent increases in fuel
and electricity prices and cuts in subsidies on certain essential consumer
items. These measures were expected to raise revenues by almost $1 billion
per year. The import needs arising from the war cannot be estimated at present.
The terms on which $2.2 billion in emergency aid approved by the US Government
will be provided are not yet determined, but are expected to contain a con-
siderable proportion in grants, the rest being relatively concessionary loans.
Appeals to world Jewry are expected by the Israel Government to raise up to
$2 billion by the end of 1974, of which about $1.35 billion in grant form
and the rest as loans (Israel Bonds) on concessionary terms.
10.       The consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices can only
be estimated roughly at present. Israel is cushioned from the foreign ex-
change effects as long as it holds the Sinai oil fields. In any case, the
increase in the oil import bill would be secondary to the economic conse-
quences of the war - including the likelihood of increased capital inflows -
and would not be expected to have an important independent effect on economic
activity.
11.       The most recent debt figures available indicate that Israel's total
external public debt (including undisbursed) stood at $3.9 billion on Decem-
ber 31, 1972, and disbursed debt at $3.6 billion. Service payments on public
debt in 1972 represented 17 percent of exports of goods and non-factor serv-
ices. These actual debt service payments in foreign exchange are normally



- 4 -
less than the payments due, since part of maturing debt is rolled over while
another sizeable part is repaid in local currency. 1/ Service on existing
debt is expected to peak in 1979.
12.       The likelihood of additional military debt, combined with a slow-
down in the growth rate of exports, implies a short-term rise in the debt
service ratio from its present level, the size of which may be limited by
the grant element in new capital inflows. While it is not possible at pres-
ent to make firm predictions about the future debt burden, the effects of
the October war on borrowiag and exports are likely to raise the debt serv-
ice ratio above its present level for at least a few years. Much depends
on the terms on which the new substantial debts are contracted.    Export
capacity may be expected to recover rapidly and then increase steadily
once the level of mobilization is reduced, although part of the resources
that could contribute to exports may continue to be directed to defense and
other domestic needs, including the settlement of immigrants. Economic man-
agement may be expected to remain prudent and efficient, despite the strong
pressure of investment and consumption demand. A large part of the debt is
owed to creditors who may be expected to ease repayment if necessary in con-
tinued support of Israel's economic stability. The relatively high debt
service though burdensome mnay therefore be regarded as manageable. The
Bank's share in total debt outstanding in December 1972 and debt service
during 1972 was 4.4 percent in each case, and with the growth of the total
debt, is expected to fall steadily. Overall, Israel can support additional
debt on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ISRAEL
13.       The Bank has to date made nine loans for projects in Israel total-
ling $214.4 million. Three loans have been made to the Industria'l Develop-
ment Bank of Israel (IDBI) for financing of industry ($60 million), one for
the expansion of a potash plant ($25 million), one for the port of Ashdod
($27.4 million), two for highways ($52 million), one for a national sewerage
project ($30 million), and one to the Israel Bank of Agriculture (IBA) for a
first agricultural credit project ($20 million). Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans as of January 31, 1974 and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
14.       Foreign exchange earnings and employment opportunities are being
increased through the three IDBI loans, whichi have helped finance investment
in export industries, and through the first agricultural credit project, which
has financed the production of flowers, fruit and vegetables for the European
1/   Israel's balance of payments figures contain items such as payments in
local currency, prepayments of bonds, and payments on non-guaranteed
debt and are therefore higher.   For a full discussion see paragraph
33 of the recent Economic Memorandum.



market. The two highway projects and the port project have contributed to
basic infrastructure improvements needed to service the growing economy; the
sewerage project will help avoid increasing pollution and health hazards while
making water available for re-use in irrigation. Project implementation has
been satisfactory.
15.       An IFC equity investment of $1.75 million in, and a convertible
loan of $1.75 million to, Makhteshim Chemical Works Limited, a producer of
pesticides, was approved by the Board on March 5, 1974.
16.       Israel's relatively high and fast growing per capita income and its
access to substantial foreign funds make it a marginal claimant on Bank re-
sources.  However, its persistently high capital requirements resulting from
a need to increase productivity and exports in order to improve its balance
of payments, warrant continued Bank assistance for the time being. Only one
additional operation, a fourth loan to IDBI, is at present being prepared.
It is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors in the next fiscal
year. It would provide funds for industrial development in the less developed
areas of Israel, mainly for exports, as well as for vocational training and
research.
PART III - THE SECTOR
17.       The relative importance of agriculture in the economy is declining -
in 1972 it contributed 6.5 percent to GDP and employed 8.5 percent of the labor
force, but still accounted for 13 percent of commodity exports. Output in-
creased with favorable weather conditions by 10 percent and 12 percent in the
crop years 1970/1 and 1971/2 respectively. Agricultural exports, however, in-
creased by only 3 percent in 1972 after a 20 percent rise in 1971, reflecting
a fall in the quantity of citrus exports. After 1960, a strategy of self-
sufficiency gave way to a policy of export promotion and production increased
rapidly. Citrus has been the mainstay, accounting for 21 percent of agricul-
tural production and 68 percent of agricultural exports in 1972, but the
limited growth potential of this market and competition from other Mediter-
ranean producers have led to attempts to diversify exports. Good market pro-
spects in Western Europe during the off-season, coupled with Israel's compara-
tive advantage due to her climate, strong marketing organizations, and high
levels of technology and innovation in production, have directed efforts towards
high-value specialty crops such as cut flowers, subtropical fruit and winter
vegetables. Replacement of dairy product and beef imports by local production,
as well as the development of low-cost substitutes for beef, have also been
encouraged.
18.       Israel's Five Year Plan for Agriculture, 1971/2 to 1975/6, aims to
raise the real value of agricultural output by 5 percent annually. Net invest-
ments required would be about $340 million with rather more for infrastructure
than for on-farm investments. About 40 percent of the increased production
would be exported.



- 6 -
19.       Increases in agricultural production are constrained by limited
availability of water and labor rather than land. Half the cultivated area
is irrigated and water and labor-saving devices are being widely installed,
while water availability will gradually be increased by re-use of treated
sewage. Increased productivity of water and labor can also be expected from
changing cropping patterns towards high-value products. The five year plan
targets appear reasonable but growth of agricultural output could slow down
in the longer run. Extensive research programs are underway, oriented towards
farmers' needs, and must be supplemented to provide the basis for sustained
growth. A large, highly-qualified extension service ensures rapid dissemina-
tion of research results to the farm level.
20.       The three banks participating in the project, together with their
parent institutions, provide over 80 percent of all institutional credit to
agriculture. As of February 1973 the three banks had a total of $239 million
in outstanding agricultural loans. A system of supervised credit provides
for the financial requirementsof communal farms (kibbutzim) and integrated
cooperatives (moshavim). Development loans are granted on terms of three
to seventeen years at a rate of 9 percent per annuam. All are granted for
specific purposes, in acco:rd with national plans For agriculture which base
proposals for new investment on sophiisticated analysis of economic costs and
benefits. In consequence the interest rate plays a relatively minor role in
the allocation of capital within agriculture.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Historical
21.       A Bank loan for $20 million equivalent in support of a first agri-
cultural credit project became effective in January 1971. Progress has been
good, with nearly all of the loan committed and over 90% disbursed to date.
Disbursements should be completed in the third quarter of FY74. The project
has helped finance greenhouses for flowers, subtropical fruit plantations,
harvesting and post-harvesting equipment, packinghouses, and terminal market-
ing facilities for export. Improved irrigation systems, water reservoirs and
drainage have also been financed. Subloans have been fairly evenly distributed
among kibbutzin, moshavim and private farmers. A Project Coordination Com-
mittee has been functioning smoothly, and cooperation among the three partici-
pating banks has been good. Their financial positions remain sound and arrears
on loans have been negligible. Exports of cut flowers grew by more than 20
percent per annum in 1971 and 1972. Most fruit exports have also risen sub-
stantially. Much of this success is due to the close cooperation between
growers, cooperative packers, and the principal marketing agencies.
22.       In September 1972. the Government of Israel requested a Bank loan
to finance a second agricultural credit project. The proDosed project was
appraised in March 1973.   Negotiations were held in Washington in September
1973. The agricultural banks participating in the project were represented
by Mr. J. Intrator (Israel Bank of Agriculture) and the Government by Messrs.
A. Brum (Director-General, Ministry of Agriculture), H. Stoessel (Accountant-
General) and A. Losovik (General Counsel, Bank of Israel).



-7-
The Project
23.       An appraisal report entitled "Israel - Second Agricultural Credit
Project" (No. 234a-IS) dated March 13, 1974 is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as
Annex III.
24.       As under the first project, subloans will be made for export crop
development and handling facilities -- cut flowers (roses, carnations, glad-
ioli), subtropical fruits (avocados, mangoes, tangerines, grapefruit) and
winter vegetables (celery); and for water-saving developments -- improved
irrigation equipment, use of sewage effluents, construction of reservoirs
and drainage facilities. Two components not financed under the first project
would be included: livestock production (beef, milk, turkey and goose liver)
and project-related research on citrus, other subtropical fruits, turkeys and
mutton.
25.       Some part of the loan will undoubtedly be utilized for investments
on lands abandoned during the period of hostilities in 1947/48 which, under
Israeli legislation, became vested in a Custodian of Absentees' Property,
and have been sold by him to the Development Authority (a general land de-
velopment agency). The Israeli authorities have informed the Bank that the
legislation expressly provides for release of the proceeds of such sales
(with interest) to the absentees concerned, but that those who are living
in countries engaged in hostilities with Israel will have to await an over-
all settlement between the countries involved. The Bank has been informed
that it is the intention of the participating banks that no subloans will be
made for development located outside Israel's borders as of January 1, 1967.
Cost and Financing
26.       Total project cost is estimated at $84 million equivalent, of which
42 percent would be foreign exchange. The largest category of expenditure
would be the credit program for water development (40 percent), followed by
export production (26 percent), livestock development (23 percent) and export
handling facilities. Project-related research (including current expenditures)
would cost US$5.3 million equivalent or 6 percent of the total.
27.       Financing of the credit program would be provided through contribu-
tions by subborrowers (20 percent), the participating banks IBA, YAAD and NIR
(20 percent), the Government (17 percent), and the proposed Bank loan (43 per-
cent). The Government would undertake to lend Ih 57.5 million ($13.7 million
equivalent) to the participating banks to cover its contribution. The pro-
posed Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange component of the credit pro-
gram (estimated at $33.5 million). It would also provide $1.5 million to the
Agricultural Research Organization to cover the estimated foreign exchange
component of expenditures for investment under the research programs. The
Government would provide a further US$3.8 million equivalent to ARO to cover
remaining investment and all current expenditures, both foreign and local,
under the research programs.



- 8 -
Administrative and Financial Arrangements
28.       The Project Coordination Committee formed under the first project
comprises representatives of the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture, the
Borrower and the other two participating banks. 'It would continue to advise
on overall project lending policies and monitor subloan procedures, and would
coordinate the services to be provided by the various participating organiza-
tions. Under the proposed project, the Committee would also approve the com-
modity research budgets ancd plans of the Agricultural Research Organization,
and review ARO's annual report on the progress of the research programs under
the project. As a condition of effectiveness a representative of ARO would
be added to the Committee.
29.       The three participating banks provide nearly all medium- and long-
term loans to agriculture in close support of the Government's development
plan. They are the Israel Bank of Agriculture Ltd. (IBA), 90 percent Gov-
ernment-owned; Yaad Agricultural Development Bank Ltd. (YAAD), a private
bank; and Nir Ltd. (NIR), owned by the National Labor Federation. The
banks' resources comprises their own funds and the proceeds of debenture
issues. Under Israel's supervised credit system, the farmer is free to
choose any one of the three banks, but must thereafter conduct all his busi-
ness with the chosen bank. All three banks are well managed, have consider-
able experience in agricultural credit including the first project, and are
capable of handling the proposed loan. Credit control is efficient and ar-
rears average less than 0.1 percent of loans outstanding, partly because,
if required by the lending bank, marketing organizations pay crop proceeds
directly to the bank for prior recovery of loan payments due.
30.       The financial position of IBA, which would be the Borrower of the
Bank loan, is sound. Profits and reserves have shown a steady increase over
the years. In the fiscal year ending March 1973, after-tax income earned
was lh 9.4 million ($2.2 miLlion) on gross revenues of IS 59 million ($14.6
million); IS 2.7 million ($0.6 million) was added to reserves. Return on
equity is satisfactory. IBA's maximum ratio of secured debt to equity will
be raised from two to four times in line with the expansion of its opera-
tions and changes in the structure of its debt. The other two banks are
also in sound financial condition.
31.       IBA would relend part of the Bank loan to YAAD and NIR, part to
its own customers, and $1.5 million to the Government for ARO. Apart from
the research sub-project, the loan proceeds would be divided between the
banks on a first-come, first-served basis, and their shares cannot be deter-
mined in advance. The proceeds would be relent to YAAD, NIR and the Govern-
ment on the same terms as the Bank loan. To complete the financing required
for the credit program, Government funds would be lent to the three banks at
an interest rate of 7 percent with the same term and grace period as the
Bank loan.
32.       The Government would enter into loan agreements with each of the
participating banks with respect to Government funds made available to them.
IBA would enter into subsidiary loan agreements with YAAD, NIR and the Gov-



- 9 -
ernment (acting for ARO) with respect to those parts of the Bank loan made
available to them. Completion of these agreements would be a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank loan. The Bank itself would enter into project
agreements with YAAD and NIR containing provisions regarding the use of pro-
ceeds of the Bank loan. Any subloan, or total outstanding subloans to any
one subborrower, in excess of $300,000 equivalent would require prior approval
by the Bank, as under the first loan. All sub-loans would be made in Israeli
currency, and the Bank has been informed that the foreign exchange risk would
be borne by the Government in accordance with existing arrangements.
33.       Loans by the three banks to subborrowers - individuals or collective
settlements - would carry an interest rate of 9 percent per annum, with ma-
turities from 7 to 13 years depending on the type of subproject. The pro-
posed on-lending rate would be the same as that charged under the first
project and is the prevailing rate for medium- and long-term loans to agri-
culture. As noted earlier, the interest rate plays only a limited role in
the allocation of resources in the sector since the Government allocates
available capital to agricultural branches following economic analysis of
the returns to alternative investments. This system has worked well in
practice as evidenced by the sector's past development. Bank appraisal
has confirmed the high return to investments in the branches chosen for
inclusion in this project.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       Contracts for export handling facilities involving expenditures of
or over $250,000 equivalent for civil works and $50,000 equivalent for equip-
ment and machinery would be awarded according to the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement and after international competitive bidding. For breeding animals,
bids would be required from at least three sources. Other on-farm investment
items and smaller export handling and research facilities are not suitable
for bulk procurement and would be supplied through regular commercial chan-
nels. Major international companies are represented in Israel and many items
required for the project are also manufactured locally. Supplies are adequate,
prices competitive and servicing good. No tariffs are levied on agricultural
machinery and irrigation equipment, which may be freely imported.
35.       The Bank would reimburse IBA 53 percent of sub-loans made by the
three participating banks under the credit program. For investments under
the research subproject, the Bank would reimburse IBA 66 percent of investment
expenditures by ARO.
Marketing
36.       Israel has demonstrated that it has the necessary organization to
produce high-value and highly perishable agricultural products (flowers,
fruits, vegetables) for the European off-season and deliver them to the
market at the optimum time. The Citrus Marketing Board for oranges, grape-
fruit and tangerines, and the Agricultural Export Company (AGREXCO) for other
perishable produce, are responsible for the marketing efforts. They handle
export shipments, exert strict quality control, and feed market information



- 10 -
back to producers. European consumption is rising rapidly along with quickly
rising incomes. In spite of strong competition in these markets, Israel's
efficient marketing and quality control should enable it to sell the addi-
tional exportable production at good prices. Livestock products will find a
ready sale in the domestic market where they will replace current or antic-
ipated imports.
Returns
37.       The economic rate of return on total project investment is estimated
at about 21 percent. Financial rates of return to farmers range from 13 per-
cent to 32 percent after payment of income tax. When all subloans have been
repaid, the project is expected to provide about $11 million additional dis-
posable income annually to participating farmers, about $3 million annually
in increased net revenues to Government, and some $24 million annually in
additional exports. The project will also assist Government in its policy
of increasing rural employment opportunities.
38.       The war in October 1973 and Israel's changed economic situation
are not expected to have any adverse impact on the project's viability. The
Government has reaffirmed the high priority it attaches to the project and
its intention to make available all funds and other facilities required for
its implementation. Any increase in investment costs above those projected
could be met by making fewer subloans, since this is mainly a credit project,
with only a small impact on the high economic rate of return. About half the
project output will be exported, and Israel's sales seem likely to stand up
well to market conditions resulting from a possible slowdown of economic
growth in Western Europe; Israel holds small shares in many markets and is
highly competitive. For products to be sold domestically, increases in in-
vestment costs are expected to be offset by higher output prices; some
price rises have already taken place. In spite of expected slower economic
growth, this output is expected to be absorbed without difficulty, since much
will replace imports.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and IBA, the draft Guar-
antee Agreement between the State of Israel and the Bank, the draft Project
Agreement between the State of Israel and the Bank, the draft Project Agree-
ment between the Bank and YAAD, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank
and NIR, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
40.       The draft agreements conform generally to the normal pattern for
loans for agricultural credit projects and in particular that of the first
project in Israel.



- 11 -
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION --
Ln. No. 689:   Third Industrial Finance Project; $25.0 million Loan
of June 15, 1970; Closing Date: (original) June 30, 1973,
(current) June 30, 1374.
IDBI's portfolio and financial position are sound. Its earnings
record is satisfactory. IDI3I's volume of operations increased significantly
during 1972 compared with 1971; 1973 is expected to be another record year
as regards both loan approvals and profits. IDBI was granted two extensions
of six months of the terminal dates for submission of projects and for dis-
bursements. The latest extension enabled IDBI to make full use of the Bank's
loan by reallocations of the proceeds. The loan is fully committed and IDBI
expects to disburse it fully before the current closing date.
Ln. No. 709:   First Agricu:Ltural Credit Project; $20 million Loan
of October 21, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
P;ogress under this project has been very satisfactory. Disbulrse-
ments are on schedule and it is expected that they will be completed in the
third quarter of FY74. Results have been satisfactory for all components:
greenhouses for flowers, fruit plantations, export handling and terminal
facilities, water distribution systems, storage reservoirs and drainage.
Participation has been divided almost equally among communal farms (kibbutzim),
integrated cooperatives (moshavim) and private farners.
Ln. No. 781:    Second Highway Construction Project; $30.0 million Loan of
July 14, 1971; Closing Date:   June 30, 1976
Overall execution of the project is generally satisfactory but diffi-
culties in obtaining right-of-way, extension of bidding periods, and mobiliza-
tion of equipment in the October 1973 war are expected to result in a delay of
up to one year in completion of the construction program. Because of a 20%
devaluation of the Israeli pound in August 1971 and high inflation, total
project costs are expected to be about 55% higher than estimated at the time
of appraisal.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projerts in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 869:   National Sewerage Project; $30 million Loan of
December 21, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project has been delayed for about three months and no dis-
bursements have yet been made. The delay is due mainly to administrative
and legal problems. In view of the complexity of the project these diffi-
culties are relatively minor and at present are no cause for concern.
