SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a second Bank-assisted Project for agricultural
credit in Israel. The proposed loan of US$35 million, equivalent to the foreign
exchange component of 42%, would serve to mobilize an additional US$49 million
equivalent within the country to meet the total cost of the Project - approxi-
mately US$84 million.
ii.       The Project would be a continuation of the first loan (709-IS), and
include similar investments for: export crop development -- cut flowers (roses,
carnations, gladioli), subtropical fruits (avocados, mangoes, tangerines,
grapefruit), and off season vegetables (celery); export handling facilities
packinghouses for flowers, subtropical fruits and celery} and increased effi-
ciency of water use - improvement of irrigation equipment, use of sewage
effluents, and construction of reservoirs and drainage facilities.  The
Project would include two new components:  one for livestock production
milk, beef, turkey meat and goose liver; and the other for Project-related
research on citrus (grapefruit and tangerines), subtropical fruits (other
than citrus), turkeys and mutton.
iii.      The agricultural sector employs some 9% of the total labor force,
generates about 7% of net domestic product, and contributes around 15% of all
export earnings. Citrus accounts for about 20% of the value of agricultural
production and 70% of the value of agricultural exports. Given Israel's high
levels of technology and innovation, particularly in the fields of irrigation
and subtropical fruit and vegetable production, together with favorable
marketing opportunities expected in Western Europe, the ?roposed Project is
important for the development of the country's overall economy. It would also
assist Government in its policy of increasing rural employment opportunities.
iv.       The research component of the Project would have the dual objective
of strengthening the country's competitive position in. export markets for
subtropical fruit (particularly citrus) and, by examinitg more efficient
methods of producing turkey meat and mutton, of reducing the reliance on
costly beef imports. The program is expected to take at least five years.
The Bank would provide US$1.5 million over the first three years to help
finance the estimated foreign exchange cost of investment items including
buildings and structures, equipment and materials, expert and consultant
services, and overseas fellowships for Israeli staff. The Agricultural
Research Organization of Israel (ARO) would be responsible for managing the
research subproject and would deploy multidisciplinary research teams for
each of the four commodities. It would be ARO's intention to disseminate
the results of the research in a manner that would make them readily and
promptly available internationally.
v.        The range of items to be financed is wide.  With the exception of
breeding animals, for which bid quotations would be required from at least
three sources, none of the on-farm investment items would be suitable for
m        bulk procurement.  Any individual subloan exceeding US$300,000 equivalent
would require prior approval by the Bank.  Investments in export handling



- ii -
and research facilities would also be varied, involving the expansion and
improvement of existing, as well as the construction of new, facilities.
In the case of export handling facilities, however, contracts exceeding
US$250,000 equivalent for civil works and US$50,000 equivalent for equip-
ment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
according to the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement.  Major international
companies are actively represented in Israel, supplies are adequate, prices
competitive and servicing good.
vi.       As under the first loan, the Israel Bank of Agriculture (IBA) would
be the borrower and would establish a Project Fund into which proceeds of the
loan would be paid. For the research subproject, IBA would disburse from the
Fund 66% of eligible investment expenditures undertaken by ARO. For all other
investments under the Project, the participating banks - IBA, YAAD and NIR
- would refinance 53% of eligible subloans through the Project Fund, on the
same terms as the Bank loan. With the exception of the research subproject,
all subborrowers would contribute 20% of their total investment requirements.
Government's contribution to total Project cost (including current expendi-
tures under the research subproject) would amount to 21%, the participating
banks 19% and the Bank 42%.
vii.      All loans to subborrowers, excepting those for research, would carry
the same interest rate as under the first loan, 9%' per annum.  For the re-
search subproject, subloans would carry the same interest rate, term and
grace period as the Bank loan to IBA, except that IBA may add 1/8 of 1% to
t-he interest cnarge to cover its associated administrative expenses. Gov-
ernment would be responsible for repayment to IBA of ARO's subloans.
viii.     The estimated financial rates of return to Project beneficiaries'
investments, after income tax, would range from 13 to 32%. The overall
rate of return to the economy is estimated at about 21%. After all subloans
have been repaid, the Project is expected to provide about US$11 million
additional disposable income annually to beneficiaries, about US$3 million
annually in increased net revenues to Government, and about US$24 million
annually in additional exports.
ix.       The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$35 million, for a
term of 15 years, including a grace period of three and a half years. The
Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.

ISRAEL
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank of Israel, on behalf of the Goverxunent, has requested a
Bank loan of US$35 million, disbursable over four years, to help finance a
second agricultural credit project. The Project would be a continuation of
the first loan, covering similar investment categories for export crop devel-
opment, export handling facilities, and water development (including drainage).
Additionally, the Project would contain components for livestock development
and for Project-related research. The Project was prepared by the Ministry
of Agriculture, together with the Israel Bank of Agriculture.
1.02      The first project (709-IS) became effective in January 1971 and
performance has been very good. All funds are committed and more than 98%
of the loan had been disbursed as of the end of February, 1974. Government
officials have publicly recognized the impact of subloans on export perfor-
mance (mainly flowers) and improved water utilization. Other current Bank
operations include: Sewerage (US$30 million, 1972); Roads II (US$30 million,
1971); and Industrial Development Bank (US$25 million, 1970).
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission which
visited Israel in March 1973, consisting of Messrs. H. von Oppenfeld, J. Bloom,
R. Hanan, and D. von Samson (Bank) and K. Anderson (consultant), all of whom
contributed to its preparation.  Additional contributions were made by Mr. I.
Khan (Bank). Mr. J. Metz (consultant) contributed to the integrated research
component.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Israel is situated at the eastern littoral of the Mediterranean.
It covers about 21,000 km2, being some 420 km long and varying from 15 km
to 110 km wide.  The climate is characterized by a clear division into a
rainy season (winter) and a dry season (summer). The annual rainfall -raries
from 50 mm in the south to 900 mm in parts of the north. TemperatureE gen-
erallv increase from north to south and vary according to altitude. Jerusalem,
800 m above sea level, has an absolute maximum of 45°C and a minimum of minus
30C. In the Jordan Valley, the mean winter temperature is 10-20°C rising to
360C in summer. In the south, temperatures rise to well over 40°C.
2.02      Israel's population, about 3.1 million, has been growing at about
2.9g per year, half of which is due to natural increase and the remainder to
net immigration. Gross National Product (GNP) rose by about 13% annually in
1971 and 1972, but in 1973 the rate is expected to be less because of severe
crop damage in the winter of 1972/73.  GNP per capita in 1972 was IJS$2,476.
This rapid growth has been accompanied bv a strengthening of the balance of
pavments.  The resource gap has fallen from 21% of GDP in 1970 to 14% in 1972.
Prices rose by 12-13% annually in 1971 and 1972, and accelerated further in



-2-
the first half of 1973. This period has been quite exceptional in relation
to Israel's long-run experience. The average annual price increase from 1955
to 1972 was 6% with, for the most part, relatively little variation from year
to year. Between 1965 and 1970 the rate was 4%. The recent rapid rises were
due in large part to the two devaluations of the Israel pound which followed
immediately upon the devaluations of the US dollar in August 1971 and February
1973. The effects of increased export and import prices (imports account for
46% of GNP) have been augmented by monetary expansion resulting from large
inflows of foreign capital. The Government instituted several restraining
measures in 1973 which it hoped would reduce the rate of inflation. These
measures included postponing public construction and limiting private con-
struction, particularly of housing, implementation of a seven-month price
freeze from June 1973, and a concerted effort to curtail demand by absorbing
liquidity from the banking system.
2.03      A memorandum on the Current Economic Position of Israel (No. 341-IS
dated February 25, 1974) was distributed recently to the Executive Directors.
It is summarized in the President's report on the "Proposed Loan to the Israel
Bank of Agriculture Ltd." (No.P-1317a-lS dated March 13, 1974). The Government
has reaffirmed the high priority it attaches to the project and its intention
to make available all funds and other facilities required for its implementa-
tion. The October 1973 war and the changed economic situation are not expected
to have an adverse impact on farmers' ability and willingness to take up sub-
loans and carry out the project, nor on the proposed research programs.
B. The Agricultural Sector
General
2.04      The relative importance of agriculture in the economy is declining
(Annex 1).  Its contribution to net domestic product fell from almost 8% in
1968 to 6.5% in 1972 (at current prices), while its share of the labor force
declined fron 11 to 8.5%. In addition, agricultural exports as a percentage
of all exports dropped from 17% to 13% over the same period. Only 20%, or
400,000 ha of the total land area is cultivated and half of this is under
irrigation (one-third citrus).
2.05      Export earnings from agriculture have been increasing since the
mid-1960's at an average rate of almost 9% per year; in 1968 and 1972 they
amounted to US$112 million and uS$160 million, respectively. Agricultural
policies continue to be directed toward encouraging products with rapidly
growing export demand and a large value added compared to the imported raw
material component. Citrus remains the most important product group, ac-
counting for 21% of the value of agricultural production and 68% of agri-
cultural exports. Because of increasing competition from other citrus pro-
ducers in European markets, however, expansion of orange production is being
deemphasized. Much of the new investment is being directed toward high-value
specialty crops for which a steadily increasing demand exists in Europe; par-
ticularly cut flowers (roses, spray carnations and gladioli), subtropical
fruits (avocados, mangos, anonas, etc.), winter vegetables (spring onions,
celery) and grapefruit and tangerines. Imports of agricultural products
consist mainly of feed grains, wheat and frozen beef.



- 3 -
2.06      Due to the development and wide adoption of modern production methods,
particularly water use and biological techniques, Israeli agriculture exhibits
a high degree of technical efficiency. Increased agricultural production is
constrained not so much by land, but by the limited availability of water and
labor; further increases in productivity of these resources are to be expected
through changing cropping patterns to high value products, but without new
technologies to apply, the rate of growth of agricultural production may be
expected to decline.
Settlement Structure and Farm Organizations
2.07      The settlement structure of farms in Israel, based on kibbutzim
and moshavim in the social sector and private farmers, is unique (Annex 2).
A kibbutz is composed of individuals who have united voluntarily to estab-
lish a settlement based on principles of equality among all members, mutual
responsibility, the absence of ownership of private property, and the
organization of all production and consumption on a collective basis. In a
moshav, on the other hand, each settler supports himself by farming his in-
dividual holding and cooperation is limited to specific spheres such as the
sale of produce, purchase of supplies and equipment and provision of credit.
Both kibbutzim and moshavim have their own settlement organizations which
represent them politically and promote their overall interests.
2.08      From production and financial points of view, a kibbutz is regarded
as one large farm.  The average size is about 500 ha, with a labor force of
about 100 workers (women and men), supporting a total farm population of
some 400 people. A typical moshav, on the other hand, consists of 50-150
independent farming families, each with a production unit averaging 3-4 ha.
2.09      There are presently about 370 moshavim and 230 kibbutzim with 28%
and 33% respectively of the total cultivated land and supporting a farm pop-
ulation of some 200,000. The remaining 39% of the cultivated land is operated
by private farmers and supports a farm population of just over 100,000.
Irrigation
2.10      The low and poorly distributed annual rainfall makes Israeli agri-
culture dependent on irrigation. In the last 12 years, total annual water
use has grown from 1,000 million m3 to about 1,600 million m3, which is more
than 90% of total available supplies (Annex 7). Agriculture accounts for 80%
or 1,300 million m3 each year. About 65% of the water supply comes from wells
in the northern part of the country and along the coastal plain. The remainder
(surface water) is pumped from Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) and from storage
reservoirs into canals and pipelines for distribution to the south as far as
the Negev Desert. The average quantity pumped annually from Lake Kinneret is
320 million m3.
2.11      All water supplies are considered a national resource, and their
development and use are strictly controlled under a Water Law administered
by the Water Commissioner. The law provides for the metering of annual quotas
for all consumers and for the licensing and metering of all sources of supply.



-4-
About 60% of all water used is delivered by the Mekorot Water Co. Ltd. which
is a public corporation responsible for major water resource developments, for
the operation of the National Water Carrier System, and for the collection of
water charges from all users in accordance with the Water Law. The actual
cost of water at primary points of delivery varies from less than IT 0.02 to
over IL 0.40 per m3, depending upon location and type of supply. In order to
narrow this spread, a Water Equalization Fund has been established. This fund,
administered by tne Water Commissioner, is sustained by annual levies on low-
cost private water sources and contributions from Government. High-cost points
of delivery are subsidized by the fund, resulting in a price to all agricultural
users of not more than IL 0.105 but not less than IL 0.06 per m3.
2.12      The limited supplies of water have made it necessary for Israel to
maximize agricultural output per unit of applied water. With wide use of
sprinkler, including "trickler" and "pulse", methods and other specialized
equipment, a high level of irrigation efficiency has been attained. In the
near future, additional water supplies for irrigation will come largely from
water saved through more efficient use of existing supplies.
Research and Extension Services
2.13      Research.  The Agricultural Research Organization (ARO) was estab-
lisned in 1971 under the Ministry of Agriculture and is responsible for the
country's agricultural research.  14ost of this research is conducted by the
ARO's Volcani Centre at Bet Dagan, with additional contributions from academic
institutions such as Hebrew University and the Veterinary Institute.  In 1972,
ARO personnel included some 300 researchers and over 800 support staff.
2.14      ARO's budgetary appropriations are supplemented by levies charged on
farmers' and cooperatives' produce at the marketing stage and various contri-
butions from interested firms and organizations. Research programs are highly
oriented towards solving identified problems and are undertaken only after a
comprehensive evaluation of farmers' needs, available funds, and manpower
priorities.
2.15      Extension.  The Extension Service, a branch of the Ministry of
Agriculture, comprises seven central specialist departments and 11 district
offices (Annex 3). It has an experienced staff oi over 600, of whom some
450 are specialists. Farmers participate actively in a variety of training
courses and study groups conducted by the Extension Service at the village,
district and national levels.
Production Incentives
2.16      The Government provides budgetary assistance to the agricultural
sector in three important ways: capital investment grants, recurrent sub-
sidies, and an exchange rate premium for exports KAnnex 11). Investment
grants, equal to 20% of total investment costs, are available to producers
to help stimulate production of selected crops for export, chiefly flowers
and subtropical fruits.  The grants are also available to cooperative pack-
ing plants for these crops.  Output subsidies are applied to staple commodi-
ties that are produced primarily for domestic consumption. For milk, eggs



-5-
and poultry meat, these subsidies in 1970/71 amounted to 20%, 8% and 7% of
total values of production, respectively.  Input subsidies are provided prin-
cipally for water, fertilizer and feed, and in 1970/71 covered 27%, 8% and
6% of the respective costs. All exporters of agricultural goods from Israel
receive IL 5.09 for each US dollar's worth of foreign currency earned, which
is 21% higher than the official exchange rate of IL 4.2 per dollar.
C. Investment Plans for Agriculture
2.17      Israel's Five Year Plan for Agriculture, 1971/72 to 1975/76, pro-
jects gross investment of IL 2,210.0 million (US$562.2 million) or net in-
vestment (excluding replacement) of IL 1,414.3 million (US$336.7 million)
to be divided between on- and off-farm projects, as follows:
Percent of Net Investment
On-farm Investment                                                   43.2
Greenhouses                                      10.4
Livestock development                             7.9
Fruit plantations                                 7.6
Irrigation and drainage                           6.4
Poultry development                               5.8
Machinery and miscellaneous                       5.1
Infrastructure                                                       56.8
Water development                                30.1
Regional processing services                     17.7
Forestry and land development                     7.8
Miscellaneous                                     1.2
TOTAL                    100
2.18      These investments, about 25% of which would be financed under the
proposed Project, are expected to raise the real value of agricultural out-
put by 28% over the five-year period, or by 5.1% per annum. About 40% of
the increased production would be exported. The priority of these invest-
ments has been established on the basis of their likely economic costs and
benefits. The methods of evaluation are sophisticated and involve the shadow-
pricing of scarce factors of production such as land, labor and water, and
the use of the actual exchange rate (including premium) received by exporters
rather than the official rate.
D. Agricultural Credit
2.19      The three banks currently engaged in agricultural lending - the
Israel Bank of Agriculture Ltd. (IBA), 90% Government owned; Yaad Agricul-
tural Development Bank Ltd. (YAAD) and Nir Ltd. (NIR), both privately owned -
are limited liability companies registered under the Companies Ordinance and
subject to control by the Central Bank. These banks, together with their



-6-
respective parent institutions, provide over 80% of all institutional credit
to agriculture. Furthermore, they have good working relationships with each
other and with the Ministry of Agriculture and, as demonstrated under the
first project, are well-managed and capable of participating in the proposed
loan.
2.20      Israel Bank of Agriculture.  IBA was incorporated in 1951 by the
Government of Israel, which now holds over 90% of the voting shares. Ordi-
nary share capital, supplemented by preference shares and reserves, provides
a capital base of IL 170 million (US$41 million). Its major sources of funds
are interest-bearing deposits from the Treasury of IL 300 million (US$71 mil-
lion) and deposits and loans from other banks of IL 158 million (US$38 mil-
lion). About 70% of these resources are used for granting agricultural de-
velopment loans (the bulk at 9% interest), with most of the remainder for
short-term loans to the agricultural sector. IBA's portfolio totals more
than IL 620 million (US$148 million). In the fiscal year ending March 1973,
IBA earned an after-tax net income of IL 9.4 million (US$2.2 million) on
gross revenues of IL 59 million (US$14.1 million), representing a 6% return
on equity; IL 2.7 million (US$0.6 million) was added to reserves. Borrowers
include 260 kibbutzim and moshavim and over 1,500 private farmers.
2.21      IBA's headquarters are in Tel Aviv and adequate agency arrangements
have been made with other financial institutions throughout the country. Its
board, which presently includes representatives of the Ministries of Finance
and Agriculture and the kibbutzim and moshavim settlement organizations, meets
at least once a month and approves all loans. Loan applications are examined
in detail by a loan committee prior to board presentation. Loan appraisal,
review and supervision practices are good and the staff of about 100 is ex-
perienced. The accounting system, which is fully computerized, produces
adequate data and statistics for management.
2.22      Yaad Agricultural Development Bank.  Established in 1922, YAAD is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank Leumi, the largest banking group in Israel
with assets exceeding US$4,000 million equivalent. YAAD's capital and re-
serves amount to IL 12 million (US$3 million). Debentures and interest-
bearing deposits from Treasury provide the bulk of YAAD's resources which
are channeled into long-term agricultural loans, totalling IL 204 million
(US$49 million) in February 1973. Nearly all short-term credit for YAAD's
clients is provided by Bank Leumi. In FY 1972, YAAD earned an after-tax
net income of IL 2 million (US$0.5 million) on gross revenue of IS 86 mil-
lion (US$20 million), representing a return to equity of 17%.
2.23      YAAD's appraisal, review and supervision procedures are similar to
IBA's in their thoroughness. Drawing on Bank Leumi's extensive branch office
and computer networks, YAAD serves almost 1,300 clients with its own profes-
sional staff of 15 and support personnel from the parent bank.
2.24      Nir Ltd.  NIR was established in 1934 and is currently owned by the
National Labor Federation (Histadrut) and its banking group, Bank Hapoalim,
the second largest group in Israel with assets of US$1,700 million equivalent.
The bank's resources consist of capital and reserves of IL 15 million (US$3.5
million), debentures of Ib 23 million (US$5.4 million), and interest-bearing



- 7 -
S          deposits and loans from Treasury and other banks of IL 164 million (US$39
million). In February 1973, the loan portfolio stood at IL 176 million (US$42
million), being predominantly agricultural development loans at 9% interest.
Short-term credit for NIR's almost 1,000 clients is provided by Bank Hapoalim.
Gross revenues, IL 16 million (US$3.8 million) for FY 1972, yielded an after-
tax net income of II 1.6 million (US$0.4 million) representing an 11% return
on equity.
2.25      Loan appraisal, review and supervision procedures are good and its
staff of 18 is competent and experienced. From its headquarters in Tel Aviv,
NIR operates through Bank Hapoalim's branches and is moving towards an auto-
mated accounting system.
Supervised Credit
2.26      The supervised credit system covers some 550 cooperative farms, i.e.
over 90% of all kibbutzim and moshavim. Borrowers can choose to conduct their
business with any one of the three banks but having chosen, they must conduct
all their business with that same bank (or the bank's parent organization),
obtaining all their short-term as well as medium- and long-term credit re-
quirements. Marketing organizations may pay crop proceeds directly to the
bank concerned, which recovers payments due before crediting the balance to
the borrower. This ensures that the lending bank has complete information
about a borrower's financial transactions.
2.27      Every year, a detailed technical and financial plan is prepared for
each borrower in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture, the bank con-
cerned and the settlement organization. On the basis of this plan, a kibbutz'
or moshav's needs for seasonal credit and investment capital are determined.
Cash flows are examined monthly and any marked deviations from the plan are
investigated immediately. A more comprehensive check is made half-yearly
with instructions for the remainder of the year (Annex 6). With this tight
control system, the extent of default has not exceeded 0.1% for each of the
three agricultural banks.
E. Evaluation of First Credit Project
2.28      Through medium- and long-term loans by the three participating
agricultural banks, the first project has supported export crop development
(flowers, subtropical fruits and off-season vegetables); improvement of
existing, and establishment of new, export handling facilities; and the
development of water resources. More specifically, the project has helped
finance construction or improvement of greenhouses (150 ha) for cut flower
production; establishment of subtropical fruit plantations (2,750 ha); pro-
curement of harvesting, packing, handling and cooling equipment (about 100



subloans); construction of 11 new and improvement of 22 existing packing-            t
houses; and expansion and improvement of terminal marketing facilities at
Lod Airport and Ashdod Port belonging to the quasi-public Agricultural Ex-
port Company (AGREXCO).  The project has assisted also in th e construction
of new water distribution systems, saving about 25 million m of water an-
nually; 33 water reservoirs with a total capacity of 11 million m3; and the
drainage of over 5,000 ha,
2.29      US$19.6 million of the US$20 million loan had been disbursed by the
end of February 1974. All project funds are committed. Subloans have been
fairly evenly distributed between moshavim, kibbutzim and private farmers,
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The Project, which would be part of Israel's Five-Year Development
Plan for Agriculture, would help finance the lending program of the three
agricultural banks (IBA, YAAD and NIR) under a supervised credit program.
As under the first project, loans to subborrowers would support export pro-
duction, marketing facilities and water development. The Project would in-
clude two new components - one to assist livestock development, and the other
to help finance Government research directly related to Project investments.
3.02      The principal objectives would be to assist expansion of agricul-
tural exports (flowers, fruits, off-season vegetables and goose liver); in-
crease production of import substitutes (milk, beef and turkey meat); and
improve efficiency of water use (construction of reservoirs, drainage facil-
ities, use of sewage effluents, and replacement and improvement of on-farm
irrigation eauipment).
3.03      Examples of investments for representative (model) units to be fi-
nanced by subloans would be as follows:

B. Detailed Features
Export Production
3.04      Flowers.  Subloans would assist the new construction or renewal of
about 40 ha of hothouses 1/ for the production of roses and about 28 ha of
greenhouses 1/ for the production of carnations, together with the associated
heating, ventilation, pest control and watering devices.  Subloans would also
be provided for the production of gladioli; for removable plastic covering
against hail, and irrigation, cold storage and other equipment to serve growing
areas amounting to about 9 ha. A typical subborrower would be a moshav member
or private farmer. About 360 such farmers would participate in these subproj-
ects. Detailed financial models for investments in roses and carnations are
presented in Annex 4.
3.05      Subtropical Fruit.  Subloans would be made for establishing avocado,
tangerine, mango, and grapefruit orchards. Major investment items would
include the cost of land preparation, planting materials, trellises, irrigation
networks, water, labor and various minor expenditures during the first two
years of orchard establishment. A typical subborrower would be a kibbutz with
about 10 ha planted in avocado, tangerine or grapefruit. Representative
models are presented in Annex 4. As under the first project, however, individual
moshav members and private farmers establishing much smaller orchards (often
less than 1 ha per farm) would also be eligible for subloans.  Approximately
800 ha of avocado, 550 ha of tangerine and mango, and 1,500 ha of grapefruit
orchards would be developed under the Project.
3.06      Celery.  The production of celery has grown rapidly over the last
few years and opportunities for increasing exports to Europe are considered
excellent. Compared to only 90 tons exported in 1967/68, around 14,000 tons
were exported in 1971/72. Most of the production, however, has been under-
taken by moshav and private farmers and has been necessarily labor intensive.
Under the Project, two relatively large subloans would be made to kibbutzim
t      ort mechanized celery production.  In each case, five kibbutzim would
cooperate in the purchase and operation of planting and harvesting machinery,
as well as in the construction and operation of a celery packinghouse.  The
articipating kibbutzim under each subloan would devote a total of about
110 ha to production; this area would yield sufficient celery to operate a
packinghouse economically. A model depicting this situation is given in
Annex 4. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that before any disburse-
ment is made for either celery production or celery packinghouses, IBA would
ensure that the participating kibbutzim under each subloan would devote a
minimum of 100 ha annually to the production of celery for at least five years.
3.07      Goose Liver.  Subloans would be made available for farm buildings,
equipment and start-up costs for rearing and fattening about 360 geese (four
1/   Hothouses have heating systems, whereas greenhouses do not.



S                                              -11,-
batches) per year. The estimated 200 mandays required would provide a pro-
fitable supplementary enterprise for family farm members. About 100 moshav
or private farmers are expected to participate in this subproject. Goose
liver and feathers are exported and goose meat is consumed locally. Further
details are in Annex 4.
Export Handling Facilities
3.08      Cut flowers, subtropical fruits, offseason vegetables and goose
liver require special handling facilities, including refrigerated storage,
packing and transport, if they are to reach overseas markets in a condition
to command high prices. Financing therefore would be provided for farmer
cooperatives' harvesting, sorting, grading, packaging and storage facilities.
Investments would include the construction and equipping of packing plants
(two for flowers, six for fruit and two for goose liver). The terminal
marketing facilities at Ashdod Port and Lod Airport, which were financed under
the first project, are considered adequate. Further details on export handling
facilities are in Annex 5.
Livestock Development
3.09      Beef.  About 23 subloans would be provided for increased production.
Phased over two years, each subloan would support a five-year program of herd
expansion from about 300 to 550 beef cows, with the dual objective of breed-
ing and fattening. A typical subborrower would be a kibbutz and investments
are expected to cover pasture improvement, fencing, provision of drinking
water, access roads, expansion and improvements of buildings, and purchase
of equipment and breeding cattle, both locally and abroad. A representa-
tive model is given in Annex 6.
3.10      Dairying.  Recently, Government began encouraging small dairy farmers,
particularly those in moshavim, to expand their herds and increase their milk
production. Phased over two years, about 325 subloans would be made for the
expansion and improvement of dairy farm buildings, and the purchase of equip-
ment and breeding animals. Some 300 subloans would enable an expansion of
dairy herds from 10 to 15 to between 20 and 30 cows, which would help provide
full employment for an efficient family farm dairy operation. A representative
model is in Annex 6. In addition, about 25 subloans would be made av llable
to kibbutzim to build their herds up to about 300 cows.
3.11      Turkeys.  Turkeys contribute an increasingly important share (about
20%) of Israel s meat supply. Over 400 subloans would be made to support
turkey production by providing turkey-raising sheds, feeding and watering
systems and start-up costs of the enterprises (1,000 day-old poults and feed
to raise them). A typical subborrower would be an individual moshav or
private farmer. He would have around 1,000 birds at any one time and would
spend less than four hours per day attending them. An enterprise of this
size provides an additional source of income to small farmers who otherwise
may not be fully employed, or to members of their families who are available
for part-time work. A representative model is given in Annex 6.

Water Development
3.12      Water Management.  Subloans would provide for investment in modern
labor and water saving techniques, including permanent or semi-permanent
plastic pipe networks in orchards (replacing hand-moved aluminum pipes),
solid-set (buried) aluminum pipe networks in vegetable fields, water-saving
controls and valves in some 14,000 ha of existing irrigation systems* and new
irrigation facilities on about 6,000 ha. The typical subborrower would be a
kibbutz or a moshav in which farmers have pooled part or all of their land
to achieve economies of scale in cereal, fruit and vegetable production, under
centralized management. Although kibbutzim and moshavim would be the princi-
pal subborrowers, individual moshav and private farmers also would be eligible
for these subloans. A representative model, provided in Annex 7, describes
the cropping system and financial details.
3.13      Reservoirs.  Approximately 45 reservoirs with 18 million m  total
storage capacity would be constructed on or adjacent to natural drainage ways
to store flood water. Subloans would be for reservoir construction, pump
sets, electrical installations, and permanent and portable irrigation systems.
A kibbutz or moshav would be the typical subborrower, using the additional
water to irrigate about 100 ha of cotton on land not previously irrigated.
Cost and return calculations shown in Annex 7 are based on the assumption
that due to occasional droughts the reservoir cannot be filled one out of
ten years.                                                                            £
3.14      Effluents.  Due to the scarcity of water, re-use of treated efflu-
ents for irrigation is an established practice in Israel, providing some 28
million m3 of irrigation water annually. The Project would make provision
for the use of sufficient treated effluent to irrigate about 4,000 ha of
formerly unirrigated land. Subloans would help finance pumping stations,
pipelines, reservoirs and irrigation systems. A typical subloan would en-
able a kibbutz or moshav to irrigate about 400 ha of field crops such as
wheat, cotton and potatoes. Further details are provided in Annex 7. Addi-
tional effluents would become available through new collection and treatment
plants in urban or rural settlements supported by the Bank loan for sewerage
(para 1.02).
3.15      Drainage.  Inadequate surface and subsurface drainage is a con-
straint to productivity in many citrus orchards and cotton fields. Subloans
would enable improvements of drainage on about 6,000 ha through a combination
of surface and subsurface drains (buried, perforated plastic pipes). A
typical subborrower would be a kibbutz or moshav. Individual moshav or
private farmers, however, also would be eligible for drainage subloans.
Further details are in Annex 7.
Agricultural Research
3.16      In addition to the aforementioned subloans, the Project would help
finance investments in Project-related research to be undertaken by ARO (para
2.13).  It was agreed during negotiations that ARO would deploy multidisci-
plinary research teams on four clearly defined commodity priorities (Annex



- 13 -
S        10) - turkeys, citrus (grapefruit and tangerines), subtropical crops (other
than citrus), and mutton. The research programs would be conducted over a
period of at least five years. The Bank's participation would be limited
to investments in buildings and structures, laboratory equipment and mate-
rials, expert and consultant services, and overseas fellowships for Israeli
staff. It is expected that investment expenditures for these items would be
incurred during the first three years of the Project.
3.17      The Director of ARO would be responsible to the Project Coordina-
tion Committee (PCC - para 4.01) for carrying out all aspects of the research
subproject agreed upon between ARO and the Bank, and would designate a leader
for each of the four commodity research programs. It was assured during nego-
tiations that ARO's budgets and plans under the Project and any changes there-
in would be subject to approval by PCC. Reimbursement requests to the Bank
would be accompanied by certification by PCC that subproject expenditures
were for the research programs agreed upon with the Bank.
3.18      ARO would follow its normal evaluation procedures for subproject
research programs and, if requested by the Bank, would include a monitoring
system satisfactory to the Bank which would permit cost/benefit evaluations
of such programs.  This was assured during negotiations.  Within two months
after the end of each fiscal year, however, the Director of ARO would submit
a report to PCC containing details of subproject research accomplishments to
date, and of construction of new facilities, purchases of equipment, visits
3eb      from consultants, and fellowships for subproject staff.  PCC would review
the ARO report and submit it, with its comments, to the Bank within three
months after the end of each fiscal year. It is the intention of Govern-
ment, that important conclusions from any subproject research program would
be published promptly.
C.  Cost Estimates and Financing
Project Cost
3.19      Total Project cost is estimated at IL 353 millioii (US$84 million),
of which 42%. would be foreign exchange. Cost estimates by major categories
are summarized below.  They include physical contingency allowances of 10%
for those investment items for which definite physical dimensions are pro-
posed; export flowers and celery production and all export handlinQ facilities.

s ~~Financing
3.20      A Bank loan of US$35 million, equivalent to the estimated foreign
exchange component, is proposed; US$33.5 million of the loan would be for
the credit program and US$1.5 million for Project-related research.

For the credit subprojects, the Bank loan would cover 43% of subborrowers'
investment costs, which represents the estimated foreign exchange component.
Subborrowers would be required to contribute 20%, which is considered rea-
sonable and within their means; the participating banks 20%; and the Govern-
ment the balance of 17% (para 4.04). For the research subproject, the Bank
loan would cover US$1.5 million, which is the estimated foreign exchange
component, or 66% of investment costs. It was assured during negotiations
that the local currency component of investments would be contributed by
Government. Government would provide funds for all necessary recurrent ex-
penditures - both local and foreign - to support the research subproject.
Government's share of total Project costs would be about 21% and the Bank's,
42%.
3.22      The Bank loan would be made to IBA for 15 years, including three
and one half years of grace on the principal. It was assured during negotia-
tions that IBA would make the proceeds of the loan available to YAAD and NIR
on the same terms (para 4.03) and that IBA would be responsible for the Bank's
commitment fee of 0.75% per annum on the undisbursed balance. The term of



- 16 -
the loan is based on a commitment period for subloans of up to three years             I
and repayment periods of up to 13 years. Government would assume the for-
eign exchange risk.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.23      The range of items to be financed is wide.  For example, depending
on the flowers to be grown (roses or carnations), greenhouse and hothouse
structures differ as to type, roof and wall material (glass or plastic) and
heating method (hot air or water). Orchard, livestock and water development
would be undertaken by individual private farmers, moshavim or kibbutzim and
would require a varied mix of inputs. Investments in research facilities
would also vary from case to case. None of these investment items would be
suitable for bulk procurement or international competitive bidding and would
be procured through local trade channels. Major international companies are
actively represented in Israel, supplies are adequate, prices competitive and
servicing good. Investments in export handling facilities (flowers, fruits
and vegetables) would involve expansion and improvement of existing, and the
construction of new, facilities, and some of these items may be suitable for
international competitive bidding. Therefore, assurances were obtained dur-
ing negotiations that contracts exceeding US$250,000 equivalent for civil
works and US$50,000 equivalent for equipment for these facilities would be              _
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding under procedures
consistent with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
3.24      Procurement of imported breeding animals would not be suitable for
international competitive bidding because the stock needed to improve herd
productivity involves selected bulls (Charolais, Hereford, Santa Gertrudis,
Simmentaler), dairy calves or heifers (Holstein), and native heifers. Breed-
ing bulls would have to be procured individually by subborrowers through
auction sales or negotiated contracts. In order to achieve the projected
beef and dairy herd expansion, approximately 40% of the beef and dairy
heifers would have to be imported. Accordingly, some 900 native breed
heifers (up to 18 months old) would be obtained from countries with a
similar ecological environment to Israel's, and about 2,000 Holstein dairy
cattle or heifers (up to five months old) would be! procured following bids
from at least three sources. IBA would be responsible, with the assistance
of the Ministry of Agriculture, for arranging the procurement of these stock,
the estimated cif cost of which would be about US$1.8 million equivalent.
All purchase contracts between IBA (or its agents) and the suppliers would
require the latter to ensure satisfactory arrangements for delivery and be
responsible for the cattle until received by Project subborrowers. IBA
would submit to the Bank consolidated annual summaries, prepared in con-
sultation with the Ministry of Agriculture showing the quotations received
and their evaluation, together with copies of the contracts awarded to suc-
cessful bidders. Assurances on the foregoing were obtained during negotia-
tions.                                                                                  i

Disbursement
3.25      On submission of appropriate documentation, certified by IBA, the
Bank would reimburse IBA 53% of all subloans for credit subprojects disbursed
by the three participating banks. For the researchi subproject, the Bank would
reimburse IBA 66% of investment expenditures undertaken by ARO, after certifi-
cation by PCC that subloans for the amounts specified had been made for ap-
proved purposes (para 3.17). Disbursements would ae mace against Statements
of Expenditures certified by IBA. The supporting documentation would be re-
tained by IBA and would be available for review during Project supervision.
The estimated schedule of quarterly Bank disbursements is given in Annex 12.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Administration
4.01      The Project Coordination Committee (PCC), established under the
first agricultural credit project, has been functioning well and would con-
tinue to coordinate the activities of the organizations involved in execut-
ing the proposed Project. The Committee is composed of representatives of
the Ministry of Finance; the Credit, Planning and Development, and Extension
Departments of the Ministry of Agriculture; and each of the three participat-
ing banks (para 2.19). For the proposed Project, a representative of ARO
would be added to the Committee. As under the first project, PCC would con-
tinue to: 1) advise on overall Project lending policies; 2) standardize loan
application, reporting and supervision procedures; and 3) coordinate the serv-
ices to be provided by the various participating organizations. Assurances
on the composition of PCC and its functions, as detailed in Annex 9, were
obtained during negotiations.
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
Project Fund and Project Account
4.02      A Project Fund, into which the proceeds of the Bank loan would be
paid, would be established within IBA which, through subsidiary loan agree-
ments, would onlend to YAAD and NIR. IBA would also establish a consolidated
Project Account which would reflect the condition of the Project Fund and of
IBA, YAAD and NIR with respect to all sub-lending operations under the Proj-
ect. Additionally, each bank would maintain a Government Loan Account which
would reflect the status of Project funds received from the Government.
4.03      Each participating bank would pay interest of 7-1/4% per annum to
the Project Fund for subloan reimbursements.  In additioa, IBA may collect
io     krom YAAD and NIR a fee not exceeding 1/8 of 1% of balances outstanding to



cover Project Fund adi,unistration and accounting costs.  For IBA's disburse-
meats for Project-related research investments, Government would agree to re-
pay the princ'ipal witi-t interest at 7-1/4% per annum to the Project Fund as
well as 1iIS of t7% of balances outstanding to IBA to cover its administration
costs.  Bach bank would be individually responsible for the approval, admin-
istration and collection of its subloans and would assume the financial risk.
individual subloans exceeding US$300,000 equivalen-t, or cases where more than
one subloan to a subborrower would result in an ouostandillg balance exceeding
US$300,000 equivalent, would require prior approval by t1ke Bank. Assurances
o0l thie above lendiag policies and procedures were obtained at negotiations.
Terms and Conditions of Credit Subloans
4.04      For the credit subproiects, participating banks would lend only for
farm development plans which had been approved by the Miinistry of Agriculture
(para 4.06). The banks would obtain their funds as long-term loans from IBRD
and Covernnment, and from their own resources, which are normally raised by the
sale of debentures (para 3.21).  The net cost of these debentures has remained
at 7% for the pasc three years.  It was assured during negotiations that Gov-
ernmnot wouid oiake its funds available to participating banks for a term of
15 vears, inciuding three and a hal` years of grace, and at an annual interest
rate of 7%. it was also assured that the rate of interest to be charged all
subborrowers would be the same as under the first project, i.e. 9% per annum.
"his is the prevailing rate and is considered appropriate. Interest rates
serve only a limited function in allocating capital with^in `.ie agricultural
sector (para 2.18).  The total onlending spread would be  %.  Upon deduction
of an administration fee of 1/8%, incurred by IBA ana pad by YAAD and NIR,
the net spread of 1-7/8% would adequately cover expenses and allow a suffi-
cient margin of profit (Annex 13).
4.05       Based on typical farm models, loans to subborrowers would not ex-
ceed the following grace and total repayment periods:

- 19 -
During negotiations, agreement on the above terms was obtained.
Subloan Appraisal and Supervision
4.06      Potential subborrowers would be required to prepare detailed tech-
nical and financial plans in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture
and the lending bank which would determine the creditworthiness of each
applicant and soundness of the investment. The various departments of the
Ministry of Agriculture (Credit, Extension, Water, Livestock, Marketing, etc.)
would be responsible for providing the necessary technical advice and serv-
ices. Assurances were obtained that security, lending and supervision pro-
cedures (para 2.27 and Annex 8) would not be altered without prior approval
of the Bank.
Accounts, Auditing and Project Evaluation
4.07      The three participating banks' accounting systems are satisfactory.
Their operations are examined by the Examiner of Banks of the Central Bank
and their accounts are audited by firms of independent auditors. The follow-
ing assurances were obtained during negotiations: that the participating
banks' accounts would continue to be audited by independent auditors accept-
able to the Bank; that the Government Loan Accounts (para 4.02) and the Proj-
ect Account (maintained by IBA) would be subject to separate audits; that IBA
would send to the Bank, within three months of the end of each bank's fiscal
year, audited accounts together with copies of the auditors' reports; that
YAAD and NIR would make available to IBA all their books and records relat-
ing to Project sub-lending; and that Government would make provisions satis-
factory to the Bank for monitoring the impact of investments financed under
the credit part of the Project, as well as those financed under the first
project.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND MARKETING, AND
PRODUCER BENEFITS
A. Production, Markets and Marketing
5.01      It is expected that Government will continue to encourage the pro-
duction of high value specialty products for export such as cut flowers, fresh
fruits, off-season vegetables and goose liver (para 2.16). At the same time,
Government is acutely conscious of the high foreign exchange cost of importing
basic food products such as beef and milk, and wishes to encourage their do-
mestic production as well as the production of substitutes such as turkey
meat. Both these objectives would be supported under the Project.
5.02      The following table illustrates expected quantities of incremental
production going for domestic use and exports under the Project at full physi-
)        cal development, together with the value of such exports at fob prices and
the value of total incremental production at farm gate prices.

5.03      Increased per capita incomes in Western Europe have helped Israel
to become a major exporter of horticultural produce, initially with citrus
and in the last eight years also with cut flowers and fresh vegetables.
Israel's share of the Western European market varies greatly according to
season and crop. For grapefruit, it is as high as 70% of the total market
between October and April, but for vegetables and flowers it is considerably
lower. For example, although the Federal Republic of Germany took almost 60%
of Israel's flower exports in 1972, these amounted to only 4% of the Federal
Republic's flower imports in that year. Both the total market and Israel's
share, however, are increasing steadily under the influence of an aggressive
marketing policy. The high degree of marketing organization required to
build up and maintain its position is the responsibility of the Citrus Mar-
keting Board for oranges, grapefruits and tangerines, and of the Agricultural
Export Company (AGREXCO) for perishable horticultural produce. These organ-
izations have offices throughout Western Europe. AGREXCO, which would handle
most of the export production under the Project, works on a commission basis
and handles produce from port of shipment through to the point of sale in
the main wholesale markets of Western Europe. With integrated marketing and
strict quality control, wholesalers in the importing countries have the as-
surance of receiving regular supplies of even the most perishable produce
in good condition. Flowers are presold in Europe at fob Israel prices. Con-
trolled by a comprehensive computerized system, they are picked in Israel,
transported by air over night, and marketed in Frankfurt and Zurich the next
day.



- 21 -
30       5.04       During the limited winter period in Western European countries when
domestic supplies are short there are no restrictions on the importation of
horticultural produce. Since several competitors, particularly other
Mediterranean countries, have similar ecological conditions to Israel, how-
ever, the timing of sales to obtain highest prices is particularly important.
Advanced agricultural technology, such as that leading to the development of
early and late ripening varieties, has enabled Israel to provide produce at
optimal times. The proposed Project-related research program (paras 3.16-3.18),
together with the effective extension service (para 2.15) and the highly or-
ganized marketing system, should help ensure that this comparative advantage
is maintained.
5.05      To encourage exports, producers receive a 21% preferential rate of
exchange, namely US$1.00 - It 5.09 instead of the current official rate of
US$1.00 = Ih 4.20. In the case of AGREXCO's sales, producers receive the sale
price in Europe less import duties, transport costs, port expenses, cost of
packing and packing materials, and AGREXCO's commission. Similar arrangements
apply for citrus products. The prices used in the Project models reflect
actual prices received over the last three years with an additional margin of
about 10% due to the January 1973 devaluation of the israeli pound relative
to principal European currencies. Prices are expected to remain firm since
Project produce faces a relatively high income elasticity of demand in Western
Europe. Israel's cooperative system of production and marketing is ideally
suited to maintaining high and uniform quality standards.
)                                  B.  Producer Benefits
5.06      Most production under the Project would be additional to subbor-
rowers' existing enterprises. In the case of roses and carnations, however,
it has been assumed that the land (0.2 ha per subborrower) was previously
producing a variety of vegetables. This opportunity cost has been accounted
for in the representative models, as has also the increased income tax pay-
able on net income from the remaining productive land due to these moshav
and private farmers moving into a higher (graduated) tax bracket as a result
of the Project.
5.07      The following table is derived from the production models (Annexes
4-7) and illustrates producer benefits with and without the Project.

7h   At full development, defined as the year in which each subproject is
expected to attain maximum physical production.
/c   After incremental income tax.
Id   Project is a new enterprise in a kibbutz.
5.08      Israeli farmers pay income taxes which begin at 22.5% (average)
on taxable family income of IE 2,500 per annum. At a taxable family income
of It 32,500 the average rate of tax is 47%; all taxable income in excess of
It 32,500 attracts a marginal tax rate of 62.5%. Before taxes, the finan-
cial rates of return to subprojects are expected to range between 38% and
15%. After tax, rates of return would range between 32% and 13% and would
be sufficient to make the proposed investments attractive to potential sub-
borrowers.
5.09      Sensitivity tests on subproject cash flows prior to taxes (Annexes
4-7) showed: (1) if Government investment grants (para 2.16) were excluded,
the financial rates of return for export production and handling facilities
would fall by between 2 and 6%; (2) if subproject investment costs were in-
creased by 10%, the rates of return would fall by between 1% and 6%; if the
value of producers' sales were to fall by 10%, rates of return would fall by
between 2 and 23% (goose liver); and if producers' operating expenses were
to increase by 10%, subproject rates of return would fall by between zero
and 19% (goose liver).
5.10      Subproject cash flows indicate that the time required to amortize
Project subloans would range from seven to 13 years (para 4.05). Total in-
cremental benefits after taxes to Project beneficiaries in year 15 of the
Project - the year after the last principal repayments by subborrowers -
would be approximately US$11 million.

VI.  ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The economic rate of return to the credit component of the Project
is estimated at approximately 21%, after incorporating all significant ad-
justments to producer benefits that were necessary to reflect more accurately
the real costs and returns to the economy. If investment costs were 10%
greater than projected, the economic rate of return would fall to 19%. Should
incremental production be valued at 10% less, due to either a drop in all out-
put prices or a shortfall in physical production, the economic rate of return
would drop to 12%. With a 10% increase in all operating expenses the rate
would be 15%.
6.02      As noted in para 5.04, continued realization of Project benefits
would be dependent on research. No attempt has been made to estimate the
rate of return to research expenditures, since the numDber of beneficiaries
would be far greater than the number of subborrowers under the Project.
6.03      The proposed Bank loan of US$35 million would serve to mobilize
an additional US$49 million equivalent of domestic funds (para 3.19). After
accounting for net transfers (subsidies, grants, taxes) within the economy,
the Project would provide net annual revenues to Governraent of about US$3
million from the seventh year onwards (Annex 14). The Project would assist
Government's policy of restraining the exodus of people from farms to urban
areas, by providing greater employment opportunities in both the private and
social farming sectors.  Considering the high levels of technology and in-
novation in Israeli agriculture and the steadily developing markets in Western
Europe for export produce, the Project is economically sound.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMWE-NDATLON
7.01      During loan negotiations, the principal assurances obtained from
the Government and the participating banks were that:
(a) ARO's budgets and plans under the Project and any changes there-
in would be subject to approval by PCC (para 3.17);
(b) for investments under the credit subprojects, subborrowers would
be required to contribute at least 20%, the participating banks
at least 20%, and Government 17%; and for the research subproject,
Government would contribute the local currency component of in-
vestments, as well as the necessary recurrent expenditures
(para 3.21);
(c) for export handling facilities, contracts exceeding US$250,000
equivalent for civil works and US$50,000 equivalent for equip-
ment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding under procedures consistent with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement (pars 3.23);



- 24 
(d)  IBA would establish a Project Fund and consolidated Project                 t
Account; and each of the three participating banks would
maintain a Government Loan Account (para 4.02);
(e)  with the exception of the subloans to ARO, the rate of interest
to be charged all subborrowers by the participating banks would
be 9% per annum. Government funds for the Project would be
lent to the banks for 15 years, including three and a half
years of grace, at an annual Tnterest rate of 7% (para 4.04).
7.02      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
Oc US$35 million, for a term of 15r years includin- a three and a half year
grace period.  Rae Borrower would be the Israel Bank of Agriculture (IBA).
Following the procedures under the first project, there would be a Loan
Agreement with IBA and Project Agreements with YAAD ana NIR. There would
also be a ProJect Agreement with the State of Israel.

The Settlement Structure of Israeli Agriculture
1.        Both the kibbutz and moshav are cooperative societies but of an
unusual character, differing from similar groups in other countries. Today,
these two forms of settlement are dominant in Israeli agriculture in regard
to population, area cultivated, and value of production. They use the largest
part of the credit directed to the agricultural sector. Settlers are free to
choose the type of organization they wish to join according to their ideology.
Details on control of resources and contribution to output by kibbutzim,
moshavim and private farmers are in Appendix 1.
Kibbutzim
2.        A kibbutz consists of individuals who have united voluntarily to
establish a settlement based on the principles of absolute equality among all
its members, mutual responsibility, the absence of ownership of private pro-
perty, and the organization of all production and consumption on a collective
basis. It is an independent entity owned by the members, whose standard of
living depends upon the successful running of the enterprise. It is governed
by the general meeting of its members which elects the principal officers and
various committees which deal with specific activities.
3.        In the beginning, kibbutzim were largely based on agriculture, but
in recent years they have entered the industrial field and a substantial part
of some kibbutzim income now comes from industry. The industries include the
manufacture of irrigation equipment, plywood, plastics, furniture, kitchen
equipment and canning of fruits and vegetables. Where it has been found eco-
nomical to do so, kibbutzim have affiliated to run regional enterprises such
as ginneries, poultry slaughterhouses, packing plants, and feed mills.
4.        There are at present about 230 kibbutzim in Israel with a population
of about 96,000.
Moshavim
5.        A moshav is a village engaged exclusively in agriculture in which
each settler supports himself by farming his individual holding (with the
help of his family) on his own account and responsibility. He is free to
engage in whatever branch of agriculture he chooses. The cooperative princi-
ples are normally limited to such spheres as the sale of produce, the purchase
of supplies and equipment, the operation of heavy agricultural machinery, the
provision of credit, accounting services, and the allocation of water. However,
some moshavim farm part of their land collectively to use modern equipment and
management more effectively.

6.        The supreme public body is the annual general meeting which elects
the Village Council, which in turn appoints various committees to assist in
the day-to-day operations of the settlement.
7.        In the case of water, an overall allocation is made to a moshav and
the appropriate committee allocates the water to individual farms in accord-
ance with the type of farming being undertaken. In the case of credit, the
loan is made to the moshav which onlends to the individual farmers. Only in
rare cases do the agricultural credit banks lend directly to individual members
of a moshav.
8.        There are about 350 moshavim in Israel at present, each with between
50 and 150 family farming units, and supporting a total farm population of
about 100,000. In addition, there are 27 moshavim shitufiim with a total farm
population of about 5,000.
9.        Moshavim shitufiim are an intermediate form between moshavim and
kibbutzim. All farm land is operated under cooperative management and on joint
account. However, consumption is determined by individual family preference.
Private Sector Farms
10.       The private sector includes quasi-public companies and individual
farmers. The sector supports a total farm population of some 105,000, of
which about 11,000 are Jewish and about 89,000 belong to minority groups.
For purposes of marketing they are either organized in specialized cooperatives
or they have access to marketing facilities of the cooperative sector.

ISRAEL
SECOiD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Livestock
A. Background
General Conditions
The climate of israel provides good conditiors for livestock pro-
duction. Especially ir. the northern part of the country, the annual rainfall
of up to 900 inm and lower temperatures favor the growth of forage and pasture
grass. Mean minimum temiperatures of 5° to 10°C in the winter permit low in-
vestment costs for shelter and housing.
2.        The limited availability of water permits irrigation of forage
crops only in very restricted areas. In spite of this) the milk yield of
the Israeli cow is one of the highest -- if not the highest -- in the world.
Forage is substituted to a large extent by concentrates. There have been
successful experiments in feedinig high yielding dairy cows on 80% concentrate
.-     and 20% roughage.  A few farmers even keep their cows exclusively on concen-
trates and roughage without feeding any forage, ar.d przcduce about 4,000 to
4,500 kg of milk per cow annually.  Ingredients fcr the manufacture of con-
centrates (corn, barley, milo corn, soya and fish meal) are imported.
3.        The production of eggs and poultry meat does not require extensive
areas, but only limited space for housing. It is extremely well suited for
a small country where land is one of the major constraints.
4.        The livesLock inventory (Appendix 1) shows a general increase in
the national herd and flocks from 1968 to 1971: cattle (beef and dairy), 13%;
laying hens, 16%A.; and turkeys, geese and ducks, 33%.  The number of sheep and
goats is decreasing.
Production and Consumption
5.        The Government usually regulates the production of livestock products
(meat, milk, poultry) by fixing production quotas, The allotment of quotas to
individual producers avoids overproduction and slumping prices, and aims at
2 itmore even income distribution.  The Government and the marketing agencies
(M11ilk, Poultry and Beef iarketing Boards) with representatives of the farmers
determine the total production volume after annually reviewing the market
situation of the country. Producers are informed two years ahead of the in-
troduction of quotas. Additionally, it is important to control the density
of poultry enterprises in order to maintain satisfactory standards of hygiene.

ANNEX 6
Page 2
The demand for beef and milk presently permits unrestricted
,Zodiictior, An expanding population (immigrants and birtla rate together,
3,b1- aznxual)' and a general change in food habits towards the consumption
9~f rtre food of high value create a continuously increasing demand for live-
s5,ock p-ohuicts (see Appendix 2).
Beef.  The total demand for beef is about 55,000 to 60,000 tons
(carcass weight) per year.  The annual production is about 20,000 tons, of
which neji;:ly 17,000 tons originate from the dairy herd. More than 65% of
the demarxd, therefore, or 35,000 to 40,000 tons of beef, must be imported
rearly at an expenditure of nearly US$30 million. The beef price of the
world market shows a tendency to further increase.
82.       -la order to save the considerable foreign exchange expenditure,
i i.s planned to initially increase the yearly beef production by 900 to
b?'000 tons from the beef herd. Along with an increased beef production from
the expanded dairy herd by rearing and fattening all calves not needed for
he;d replacement, the total production could be about 29,000 to 30,000 tons
or 40% of the demand in 1975-76. Sixty percent of this demand of 75,000
tons will therefore have to be imported.
9.        Dairying.  At present Israel needs about 465 million kg of milk per
year. The production of the national dairy herd (82,000 cows) is about 420
million kg.  The annual per capita consumption of milk and milk products has
risen from 130 kg in 1968 to 155 kg in 1972 and is expected to further increase.
Through the subsidized milk price (the Government bears processing and distri-
bution costs) of IL 0.65 per kg as well as educational campaigns on health
and nutrition, the Government is attempting to increase milk consumption and
elevate levels of protein nutrition.
10.       In 1972, 6,000 tons of skimmed milk powder and several hundred tons
of butter were imported. There is no longer a Government restriction on milk
production and all potentials are being exploited. The estimated demand for
milk for 1975-76 is 580 million kg and production will be about 440 mil-
lion kg in 1972-73.  An increase of 140 million kg will aave to be achieved
within three years. Contracts for the import of 7,000 tons of skimmed milk
powder and 500 tons of butter in 1973 have been made. In 1974, the planned
Import wTill amount to 8,000 tons of skimmed milk and 600 tons of butter, both
to be used in the production of cheese and other sour-miik products. This
imrort will cost nearly US$6 million.
11.       Increasing prices of milk powder and butter on the world market and
the continuously rising demand for milk within Israel require an increase in
the local production. It is planned to initially expand the national dairy
therd by 6J 000 zows, additionally producing about 30 millJon kg of milk per
year. Simultaneously, the yield per cow is expected to increase through man-
agement improvement; an increase of 10% in the present herd would add another
40 to 45 million kg of milk to the present total.
_.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
12.       Herd expansion as well as management improvement in the fattening
of bull calves could result in raising the sales weight per animal by 5% and
would initially increase the total beef output from the dairy herd by about
1,000 tons. Israel exports about 1,500 breeding heifers each year to neigh-
boring countries.
13.       Turkeys.  In Israel, turkey is no longer a delicacy for festive
occasions but a source of meat and a substitute for beef. A turkey industry
has developed during the past five years. Consumers mainly buy deboned car-
casses of processed meat and no longer the dressed bird, which weighs about
10 kg and is too much for a single household. The establishment of turkey
enterprises and their production are regulated by production quotas.
14.       The annual consumption per capita is presently about 7-8 kg of turkey
meat. The total consumption increased from 7,050 tons in 1968 to 19,500 tons
in 1972. The comparatively high price of beef considerably supports the in-
creasing turkey meat consumption; the retail price of turkey meat is about
IL 6.0 per kg, whereas frozen (imported) and fresh beef cost IL 10.0 and
IL 19.0 per kg, respectively. The expected turkey meat consumption in 1979
will be about 13 kg per capita.
15.       It is planned to increase turkey meat production by 4,500 tons
annually in order to retard the growth of imported frozen beef and to save
foreign currency.
16.       Goose Liver.  Production of liver is the only purpose for rearing
geese in Israel. More than 90% of the produce is exported to France. There
is no Government restriction on goose liver production. The French demand
and the number of farmers rearing geese determine the production. Rising
salaries in Europe and the trend toward increased consumption of delicacies
like pate de foie gras cause the increasing demand for goose liver. Liver
exports to France increased by 139% during the period 1963-69. Sixty-two
tons were exported in 1968-69 and 120 tons in 1972 at US$13,150 per ton fob.
The export value of goose liver, fat, meat and feathers amounts to US$1,878
million, or more than 30% value of all poultry export. There is a yearly
contract with France, fixing the amount and price of liver to be traded. The
export development of the past permits the assumption of a further increasing
demand. An optimistic forecast indicates an annual export increase of 25 tons,
i.e. from 120 tons in 1972 to nearly 200 tons in 1975.
Extension Service and Input Supply
17.       The Director of Animal Husbandry in the Ministry of Agriculture heads
the Livestock Department, consisting of five divisions: beef, dairy, poultry,
sheep and goats, and bees. There is a total of 17 specialists working under
the heads of the divisions at headquarters in Tel Aviv. The Livestock Depart-
ment also operates an extension service with 70 District Extension Officers
in the field, and each officer is responsible for a relatively small area.
Frequent refresher courses and opportunities for training in foreign countries
make the extension service attractive as well as efficient.  The high standard



ANNEX 6
Page 4
of technical knowlege of the well-organized, intensively operated extension              t
service results in a high production level for livestock. Increasing numbers
of personnel with university background are being recruited. The close coop-
eration of administration, research and extension supports the increase in
production.
18.       Frequent training opportunities are offered to farmers, varying from
one week to several months. Members of kibbutzim generally participate, while
it is hard for moshav members to leave their family farms in the evening.
19.       Unique and of great advantage is the highly developed cooperative
system in Israel. There are considerable savings on all input costs because
the manufacturers and/or suppliers generally are cooperative societies. Every
farmer is a member of at least one cooperative. Chickens, poultry and goslings,
equipment for poultry houses as well as various feeds are produced by coopera-
tively owned enterprises. Inputs are available and supplied directly to the
farm on relatively short notice. Also, processing and marketing of dairy and
poultry products are generally done by farmer-owned cooperative enterprises.
B. Project Livestock Component
General
20.       The proposed Project aims to reduce necessary imports of meat and
milk, and to contribute annually to foreign exchange (nearly US$2 million)
through the export of goose liver. The Project would help utilize the avail-
able potential for meat production. Pastures as well as their management
intensity would be increased for beef production. Yearly, 1,000 additionally
born breeding heifers would make a further contribution to production. Exist-
ing dairy farms would be improved and upgraded to economically viable produc-
tion units. Surplus family labor would find part-time employment in rearing
geese or turkeys.
21.       The Project would assist in:  the expansion of 23 beef herds by 250
cows each; the expansion of 471 family dairy farms from 13 to 25 cows and 25
kibbutz dairy herds from 300 to 550 cows each; the establishment of 420
family turkey farms for meat production; and the establishment of more than
100 family geese farms for the production of goose liver. Additional family
income would be an important benefit of the poultry subproject and of the
family dairy subproject (see Appendices 3-7 and Annex 4, Appendix 7).
22.       The typical farm to participate in the beef subproject would be the
kibbutz with a cattle herd of 300 to 500 head. A kibbutz generally manages
a few hundred hectares of agricultural land and often has an industrial enter-
prise in addition. A family farm of 3 to 4 ha, generally a member of a moshav,
would be the typical participant in the dairy or poultry subproject (turkeys
or geese). A moshav normally consists of 60 or more families who form an



ANNEX 6
Page 5
IN       agricultural cooperative unit.  The management of a moshav has to approve and
recommend loan applications of its members before the Ministry of Agriculture
or its regional center in the field can consider them. There are specific
Government rules to assure safe lending. Besides other prerequisites, an
applicant for a dairy loan has to have his herd milk recorded monthly; his
annual sale of milk should be at least 4,000 kg per cow.
23.       An intensivrely operated extension organization is needed, especially
for the dairy subproject, to give it a sound start as well as continuity. In
early 1973, there were 30 District Extension Officers for about 5,000 dairy and
beef farms. Under the Project about 500 additional family farms would require
expert assistance. Another three extension agents were appointed in 1973 to
devote 100% of their time to small dairy farmers expected to be included in
the Project. Government plans to appoint more such agents during the commit-
ment period.
24.       The prepared models for typical loans in the livestock subprojects
(Appendices 3-7 and Annex 4, Appendix 7) are based on costs and prices prevail-
ing at the time of appraisal in March 1973 and data supplied by the Government
and collected during appraisal.
Beef
25.       Natural pastures with a variety of annual and perennial grasses are
the main base for rearing beef cattle. Cows and calves of various crossed
)       breeds graze together until weaning on rainfed pastures.  Thereafter stubble
fields serve as pasture. Pasture management seldom exceeds one yearly applica-
tion of 100 kg of nitrogen per ha. Israeli research experiments, however,
show a significant rate of increase in grass vield when an application of up
to 400 kg of nitrogen is made. There is still unused grassland in the north
and in the center of the country which, since it is unsuited to other forms
of production, could be converted into pastures.
26.       A model for a typical loan for a beef subproject (Appendices 3-4)
indicates financial rates of return on the investment of 18% before tax and
17% after tax. The investment would include pasture development, livestock
and buildings. Access roads, fences, drinking water installations, and fer-
tilizer application by plane are the main expenses for pastures. Stud bulls
of beef-producing breeds like Hereford, Simmentaler, Charolais and Santa
Gertrudis and heifers from Mediterranean countries have to be imported in
order to combine a high daily weight gain with hardiness and resistance. Cows
for herd expansion would be purchased locally. A building has to be added for
the fattening of bulls - nearly 100 additional animals would be fattened in
a feedlot.
27.       The Beef Marketing Board issues weekly tenders for the sale of
finished cattle. Buyers collect the fattened bulls from the farm, slaughter
them and sell them to butchers. Farmers are paid per kg live weight after a
reduction of 5% of the weight ("pencil shrinkage") for the last feeding before
sale. Prices range between IL 5.25 and IL 6.00 depending on the quality of
j      the individual animal.  There are only two cooperative slaughterhouses, where
prices are fixed according to actual carcass weight and grade.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
Milk
28.       Nearly 60% of the investment proposed for the livestock subproject
would be for the dairy subproject. Almost half of the country's milk pro-
duction comes from family farms. The dairy herd of Israel is based on cross-
breeds of Dutch Friesians and local cows. A later intensive crossbreeding
program introduced  ollstein Friesians from the U.S.A. and Canada.  Dairy
farms are distributed all over the country except for the extreme south.
A typical dairy loan (Appendices 5-6) would be for the expansion and improve-
ment of buildings and purchase of animals and equipment. Most of the moshav
farms were established more than 20 years ago on 3 to 4 ha. The farmers got
a limited loan from the Settlement Department of the Jewish Agency for
Palestine to buy a few cows and to build a small cowshed. These farms are
no longer economical. The proposed investments show rates of return of 19%
before tax and 16% after tax. Dairy heifers have to be imported in order to
meet the requirement of the country's herd expansion and to maintain the high
production level. About 25 kibbutz dairy herds will be expanded and their
buildings and equipment improved.
29.       A moshav generally maintains a center to collect the milk of its
members. Eighty-five percent of the milk is processed by the cooperative
enterprise TNUVA. A yearly review of production costs serves as Government's
basis for determining the milk price. Presently, farmers receive a fixed
price of IL 0.65 per kg.
Turkeys
30.       Almost 40% of the total loan proposed for the livestock subprojects
will be for the production of meat (turkey 23%, beef 15%). The broad breasted
white empire turkey is used for meat production. Investments will go mainly
to the establishment of new family farms, where about 2,000 birds per year
will be reared. Taking into account the loss of one full batch of birds (1,000)
every eight years, the model for this subproject (Appendix 7) indicates finan-
cial rates of return on the investment of 24% before tax and 22% after tax.
The loan would be used for the construction of a shed and for the purchase of
rearing equipment as well as to meet the start-up cost of the enterprise
(1,000 poults and feeding cost for the first batch). All facilities needed
for the expansion of the country's turkey flock, i.e., parent stock for
laying flocks, inctubating and rearing equipment, are available in Israel.
A small part (10%) of the subloan for turkeys is proposed for the investment
in laying farms where hatching eggs will be produced.
31.       Under the Project, poults would be used exclusively from farms which
have the prerequisites to produce stocks free of mycoplasma infections. In
addition, only one age group of turkeys would be kept on a farm ("all in-all
out system"). By following these two rules the normal bird loss of 15% may
be reduced to as little as 5%.



ANNEX 6
Page 7
32.       The Poultry Marketing Board holds auctions for the sale of turkeys
for slaughter. Bids come from about one dozen buyers who collect the birds
from the farms. Also, TNUVA buys a part of the birds produced in the country.
The farmer gets IL 3.60 per kg live weight.
Goose Liver
33.       The brave goose grows a liver of nearly 1.5 pounds in a lifespan of
about 4 months for the gourmet who likes pate de foie gras. She is a cross
of Toulouse, Emden and Chinese breeds. The maximum number of geese a part-
time worker can care for is about 100 to 120, provided his feeding equipment
is fully mechanized.
34.       Investments will go to the establishment of new goose farms, where
about 360 geese will be reared and sold each year. Construction of buildings,
purchase of equipment and the payment for the start-up cost of the enterprise
will be included in the investment. The farm model for this subproject
(Annex 4, Appendix7) -indicates a financial rate of return on the investment
of 36%. Prerequisites to expand the country's flock of geese are already
available.
35.       A vehicle comes three to four times a week to collect the finished
geese.  Liver-growing geese have to be handled very carefully, especially
towards the end of their life. The bigger the liver becomes the more delicate
the bird will be. Often the farmer has to arrange for an independent transport
in between in order to avoid the mortality of a few geese by waiting for the
next pickup service. There are three private and three cooperative slaughter-
houses. The farmer gets a price which accounts for the weight and quality of
the liver as well as the carcass weight. Producers prefer cooperative slaughter-
houses since the grading is done by the slaughtering enterprise.
36.       About half of the proposed loan for the goose liver subproject will
be needed to expand slaughtering and processing facilities, which are inade-
quate at present. The proposed slaughterhouse will be a cooperative enterprise.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Water Development
A.  Background
Land and Climate
1.        Israel is situated at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea be-
tween latitudes 290 30' and 330 15' north. It has a total area of about
21,000 km2 (2.1 million ha), being some 420 km long and from 15 to 110 km
wide (see map). Of the total land area, about 420,000 ha (20%) is cultivated
of which over 180,000 ha is irrigated.
2.        The climate is characterized by a distinct rainy season in winter
and a dry season in summer. The mean annual rainfall varies from 50 mm or
less in the extreme south to 900 mm in parts of the north. Rainfall gener-
ally decreases from the Mediterranean inland and from north to south, and
generally increases at higher elevations. Essentially no rain falls during
June-August, with most of the rain occurring from November to March. Tem-
peratures generally increase from north to south and vary with elevation.
Mean minimum temperatures are generally from 5 to 10°C in winter with mean
maximums of 30 to 35C in summer. Daily summer evaporation rates in the
principal agricultural areas are 8 to 10 mm (Appendix 1).
Water Supply and Use
3.        The total annual water use in Israel is now about 1,600 million m3
or more than 90% of the total available supply. Agricultural uses account
for 80% or 1,300 million m3 each year (Appendix 2).
4.        About 65% of the total freshwater supply comes from wells in the
northern part of the country and along the coastal plain. Many of the wells
are artificially recharged, during periods when excess surface water is
available, to avoid depletion of the aquifers and to prevent saltwater intru-
sion along the coascal plain.
5.        Most of the remainder of the nation's water supply (surface water)
is pumped from Lake Kinneret (Tiberias or Sea of Galilee) into the canals and
pipelines of the National Water Carrier System for distribution to the south
as far as the Negev Desert. The average annual supply from the lake is 320
million m3.

ANNEX 7

6.        Water from Lake Kinneret has a chloride content of about 400 parts
per million which is too high for irrigation of sensitive crops such as citrus.
Additional freshwater supplies of better quality, largely from wells, are
accordingly mixed with the lake water to meet the quality requirements of all
users.
7.        The development arnd use of al' water supplies in Israel are strictly
controlled by a Water Law, administered by the Water Cormissioner, which pro-
vides for an annual quota for all consumers and for a licensing system for all
supply sources. Supplies from private sources are developed by the owners
(often with loans from the agricultural banks), w4ho are responsible for all
subsequent maintenance and costs. Privately developed supplies are often
interconnected with the National Water Carrier System to provide for integ-
rated operation on a national basis, for water quality control, and for ar-
tificial recharge of groundwater. All sources of supply and all deliveries
to consumers are metered.
8.        Publicly developed supplies, about 60% of the total use, come from
Nekorot Water Co. Ltd., a public corporation responsible for major water re-
source developments in Israel and for operation of the National Water Carrier
System. In 1972/73 Mekorot will supply a total of about 835 million m3 of
which 646 million m3 (77%) is for agriculture and the remainder for domestic
and industrial use.
9.        Mekorot is also responsible for the collection of water charges
from all users in accordance with the Water Law.  Because the actual cost of
producing water varies greatly depending upon location, type and method of
development (from less than I  0.02 to over Ib 0.40 per m3), a Water
Equalization Fund has been established so that the charges to all consumers
can be somewhat equalized regardless of the local variations in actual costs
of production. This fund, administered by the Water Commissioner, is com-
prised of annual levies on low-cost water production and contributions from
Government. The total amount of the fund (subsidy) in 1973/74 is expected
to be about IS 52 million of which IL 32 million will be for agriculture
(Ib 2.5 million from levies and IL 29.5 million from Government). The effect
of the fund management is generally to bring the cost to the consumer of all
agricultural water to levels ranging from lb 0.06 to IL 0.105 per m3 at the
primary point of delivery.
Irrigation
10.       Because of low annual rainfall, and the absence of any rain during
the summer months, agriculture in Israel is dependent upon irrigation.
11.       Israel is a world leader in the development and use of efficient
methods of irrigation, particularly sprinkler methods and equipment. The
limited available water supply has made it necessary for Israel to maximize
the agricultural returns per unit of applied water. Essentially all irriga-
tion is by sprinkler methods and specialized equipment and techniques have
been designed and manufactured to achieve maximum irrigation efficiency.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
Israel has pioneered the research and development of such techniques as
"trickler" and "pulse" irrigation, two methods designed to match accurately
the feeding or supply of water to daily or even hourly crop demands. In the
"tricker" method a continuous slow drip of water is applied to the ground
above the root zone; in the "pulse" method, a normal sprinkler application
rate is made but for only a few minutes each hour. Both methods have resulted
in significant improvements in crop yield (15-50%) and quality, with accompany-
ing reductions in total water and labor requirements.
12.       The principal irrigated crops are plantations (citrus, olives, and
other fruits), field crops (cotton, groundnuts, sugar beets and green fodder),
and vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, etc.).
13.       Irrigation water use depends upon the type of crop and climate,
generally ranging from 4,000 to 12,000 m3 per ha. Overall average use in
Israel has been steadily declining, with the introduction of more efficient
practices, to about 7,000 m3 per ha, accompanied in most cases by increased
crop yields and quality.
14.       Additional water supplies for irrigation in the near future will
come from water saved by more efficient use of existing supplies, from stor-
age and use of minor flood runoff water, and from re-use of sewage effluents.
The long-range possibility of adding significantly to the nation's water re-
source will probably be dependent upon desalinization of seawater and saline
groundwater.
B. Project Water Development Component
General
15.       The proposed Project is designed to improve water management on
about 16,500 ha presently irrigated, resulting in improved yields, reduced
input costs for labor and water, and additional new irrigation (about 2,800
ha) with the water saved; to construct about 45 reservoirs from storage of
floodwaters to irrigate about 4,500 ha; to provide for the re-use of sewage
effluents to irrigate about 4,000 ha; and for surface and subsurface drainage
of about 5,600 ha to improve crop production.
16.       The Project would comprise a logical extension of the successful
first agricultural credit project which incorporated all the above components
except for the re-use of sewage effluents.
17.       The existing organization and staff within the Ministry of Agriculture
are fully adequate to technically evaluate applications and supervise the con-
struction under loans made to subborrowers for water development projects.
40



ANNEX 7
Page 4
18.       In preparing models for typical loans for water development projects
(Appendices 3-8), construction costs have been used which prevailed at the time
of appraisal in March 1973. Foreign exchange components have been estimated
for each type of construction, based upon data supplied by Government and
collected during appraisal.
Water Management
19.       About one-half of the investment proposed for water development would
be to improve water management in existing irrigated areas. The main invest-
ments would be for improving irrigation systems to reduce labor requirements
and to save water by increasing the irrigation efficiency, and for replacing
existing old leaking or corroded main distribution networks. Some water-
saving would result from modification and improvement of poultry house sprinkler
cooling systems.
20.       Although the amount of water saved would be significant (enough to
irrigate about 2,800 ha of presently dry-farmed land), the principal benefits
derived from the investments would probably be the reduced costs for labor
and other farm inputs and the increased yield and quality of crops.
21.       A model for a typical loan for a water management subproject
(Appendices 3 and 4) indicates financial rates of return on the investment
of 38% before tax and 32% after tax. The investment would include replace-
ment of hand-moved aluminum pipe networks in orchards with permanent or semi-
portable plastic pipe networks, addition of new aluminum pipe networks in
vegetable fields to provide a solid-set system, installation of water-saving
controls and valves in field crop systems, and new irrigation of field crops.
Reservoirs
22.       Approximately 45 reservoirs would be constructed on or adjacent to
natural drainage ways to store flood runoff for irrigation of the adjacent
lands presently dry-farmed.
23.       A typical reservoir would provide about 400,000 m3 for the irrigation
of 100 ha of a field crop such as cotton. Allowing for occasional shortage in
available supply because of inadequate runoff, the model for a typical loan
(Appendices 5 and 6) indicates financial rates of return of 23% before tax
and 21% after tax.
24.       More than 30 such reservoirs have already been constructed and placed
in successful operation during the first credit project. Applications have
already been received, and approved from technical considerations, for an
additional 30 reservoirs to be constructed under the proposed Project (see Map).



ANNEX 7

Effluents
25.       The scarcity of water resources in Israel has already led to wide-
spread use of sewage effluents for irrigation. Present re-use amounts to about
20 million m3 from the urban sector and about 8.5 million m3 from rural areas.
With the construction of many new collection systems and treatment plants under
the new Bank sewerage loan (869-IS), additional treated effluents will become
available for irrigation.
26.       The proposed Project would provide for additional re-use to irrigate
about 4,000 ha of presently unirrigated land. The size of individual sub-
projects would vary depending upon the quantity of effluent available. A
typical development, however, would provide for irrigation of 400 ha, and a
model for the Project (Appendices 5 and 7) indicates financial rates of return
on the investment of 23% before tax and 20% after tax.
Drainage
27.      Mlany presently irrigated areas are limited in productivity, par-
ticularly some citrus orchards and cotton fields, because of inadequate
surface or subsurface drainage. Areas of heavy clay soils frequently have
reduced productivity because of high water tables and waterlogging, or be-
cause of the inability to get lieavy farm machinery onto crop lands at proper
times for land preparation, seeding, cultivation or harvest.  The proposed
*0      Project would provide proper drainage for about 5,600 ha resulting in in-
creased crop yields and reduced farm operating problems.
28.       The model for a typical drainage subproject (Appendix 8) indicates
financial rates of return on the investment of 35% before tax and 20% after
tax. The typical investment is considered to provide proper surface drainage
for 40 ha of cotton and for both surface and subsurface drainage (buried per-
forated plastic drainpipes) for 10 ha of citrus orchard.

ISRAEL
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Credit Services
A. General
Supervised Credit
1.        The supervised credit system was established ,n 1964 to alleviate the
illiquid position of many Israeli farms at that time. The system serves to
channel long-term development funds to farms through the three agricultural
banks, while ensuring that: 1) funds are used consis-ent with national
planning targets and the best interests of the settlements; 2) necessary
seasonal credit and working capital are available, and 3) financial discipline
and responsibility are maintained. It has grown to encompass 549 kibbutzim,
moshavim and other cooperatives out of a total of 603 - over 90%; moreover,
about 60% of all credit to agriculture from the banking system is granted
under the system, and the three supervising banks provide nearly all institu-
tional agricultural credit.
2.        Borrowers are free in their initial choice of which of the three
banks they wish to work with; however, to maintain continuity under the system
a borrower must transact all agricultural finance through the bank chosen.
A new settlement is usually established with the help of concessional finance
from the Jewish Agency; once the settlement has achieved financial viability,
it will join the supervised credit system, in transition to complete independence,
and choose a bank to work with. Aside from a small number of service coopera-
tives, the clients supervised are kibbutzim and moshavim. The relationship
with a kibbutz is relatively straightforward since all production, consumption,
investment and marketing are communal; therefore, all loans, guarantees, and
the accounts reflecting them are for a single entity. For a moshav, however,
only marketing is necessarily communal; production, consumption and investment
may take place both communally and individually. To streamline the lending
system, all loans are made to the moshav and are distributed as investments
eithler by the commune (e.g. irrigation networks) or by individual members (e.g.
greenhouses). Similarly, the moshav as a whole 'egal entity undertakes to
guarantee all loans. Individual members are Jointly and severally liable for
all loans to the commune.
3.        Each year, a borrower prepares a detailed plan of operations for the
following year and projections for the next three to five years; these plans
include expected inputs and outputs, in both physical and monetary terms, as
well as proposed investments and sources of finance.  The plans are formulated
44      with the advice and assistance of the local extension agent and specialists.
They are reviewed, modified if necessary, and approved successively by the



ANNEX 8
Page 2
regional and national offices of the Ministry of Agriculture, the bank's staff,
a committee including representatives of the Ministry and the bank and, finally,
the bank's loan committee and board of directors. This process normally takes
from four to ten weeks. A monthly cash flow is then prepared to estimate
seasonal credit needs.
4.        Disbursements for investment loans unider the system are made after
the regional Ministry office has verified that specified segments of the work
have been completed. Monthly detailed cash flows and semi-annual reports
on actual costs, revenues and results provide further supervision, which is
supplemented by at least semi-annual visits of the bank staff to the farms.
Finally, within three to six months of the end of the fiscal year, audited
balance sheets and income statements must be submitted.
5.        In general, moshavim and kibbutzim provide between 40 and 60% of
their financial requirements from internal sources (i.e. profits, depreciation,
etc.). In the case of an individual moshav member, the required equity share
of investment cost may be met with a loan from the moshav. External sources
include development loans, earmarked for specific purposes, and directed credits.
The latter fill the resource gap between approved investment plans and other
sources. The great majority of development loans and all directed credits
carry an interest rate of 9% per annum; the terms of the former are related
to the cash generation of the specific investment while the latter are amortized
over 15 years.
6.        The guarantees which secure supervised loans are quite complete.  As
settlements do not own their land but have long-term leases from the Israel
Land Authority, mortgages provide only that the land may not be transferred
without the bank's consent. A secondary security provided is a floating
charge, or non-specific chattel mortgage, on all the movable property of the
settlement. Thirdly, in many cases, a settlement instructs its cooperative
marketing agents to direct all sales proceeds to its current account with the
agricultural bank (or its parent institution) where payments of interest and
principal due are automatically deducted. Further guarantees may be sought
from marketing cooperatives and settlement organizations on behalf of a
member. The centralization of all these securities in one bank, or banking
group, greatly facilitates loan processing, obviating the need to obtain new
securities for each new loan.
Other Lending Programs
7.        Historically, loans from the Jewish Agency for 35 to 50 years at
about 2% interest have been important in establishing new settlements. The
Government-sponsored development loans described above are available to all
farmers, under the supervised credit system or not. These are the most
important source of external long-term finance for the sector and are granted
on terms of three to seventeen years at a rate of 9% per annum. Loans from
banks' own resources are on similar terms. Loans under the first agricultural
credit project are granted on terms similar to those of the Government loan
program, varying from 10 years for a greenhouse (including two years of grace)



ANNEX 8
Page 3
o i- 'ars (three of grace) for irrigation equipment, all at 9% interest.
WIth. _'nc n7cption. of the first project, loans are usuall'7 granted for 40 to
cf: es ts;-al itrvestmPnt cost; under the first project, loans were given for
31.17.4f.tmCflt Cost,
8.        All long-term loans are granted for specific purposes, in accord
ie:. nationeal plans for agriculture.  Thus, the Ministry of Agriculture reviews
.o5e  (.;-3J4ations for:  1) consistency with these plans; 2) suitability of
crvirontmental and agronomic conditions, and 3) technical competence of the
farmer, After this scrutiny, the final decision on all loan applications
rests w.th the banks, regardless of the source of funds.
9.        Security requirements for non-supervised borrowers are similar to
those fo.;- suDervised clients. The chief difference is that a bank will usually
rxigitnr a specific chattel mortgage from an individual farmer when a loan
is gr~arted for specified equipment (e.g. a tractor). Othenrwise, similar
arAd mortgages, joint guarantees and securities are sought from individual
barrowers. The default rate is extremely low, less than 0.1%,
Short-term Credit
1n.       Shcrt-term credit is available under three distinct programs.  First,
fLor producers of specified export crops, advances of approximately 50% of pro-
duction costs are available during the growing season at an annual cost of
6%. Such loans are secured by a lien on crop sales proceeds. Second, working
capital overdrafts cost 11-1/2% per annum for all agricultural producers.
1sin credit is, however, limited in amount and the banks allocate it somewhat
even]ly among their customers. Third, short-term funds in excess of those
availaMle under the first two programs carry interest rates of from 15-1/2 to
18% per annum for agricultural borrowers, the rate varying directly with the
awourrt borrowed.
Sourc~ees of Funds
11        Prior to 1972, the agricultural development banks' main source of
funds was deposits from the Treasury. These were direct deposits of monies
from the national development budget. Alternatively, the banks sold deben-
tures to the public which were linked to either the cost of living index or
the ILs/TJSS exchange rate. The proceeds from these sales were deposited with
Government on terms of linkage and repayment identical to those received by
the purchpser.  In turn, the Treasury redeposited the funds with the banks
as fixed-term, fixed-rate, unlinked deposits, for the specific purpose of
granting unlinked loans under Government development progranms.
i2.       At present, no development budget funds are deposited with the banks
except Goirernment's 25% share of subloans under the first agricultural credit
p-?ject. Although Zovernment wishes to continue this system under the proposed
Project, it has been abolished for all other purposes, Similarly, the deposit
and redeposit scheme has been replaced. Currently, the banks sell five to
18 year debentures in the public market, which carry a coupon rate of 6%,
410     pla- Tlnkoge to the cost of living index.  Costs of issuance and management



ANNEX 8
Page  4
amount to an annual cost of about 0.66% per annum. In return for an under-
taking to lend the funds in accord with national agricultural plans, the
banks insure the linkage payments with the Treasury for an annual fee of
0.34% of principal amount of debentures outstanding. Thus the net cost of
these funds to the banks is 7%, i.e. coupon rate (6Z) plus management costs
(0.66%) plus insurance premium (0.34%). In essence, the premium fee is set
arbitrarily to provide a 2% spread over the cost of funds for agricultural
loans at the mandated interest rate of 9% annually.
13.       Not all debentures sold by the banks, however, raise funds for agri-
cultural lencding.  As part of its policy of slowing monetary growth, Govern-
ment has required banks to sell debentures, the proceeds of which are deposited
with the Treasury and stay there. One banking group, for example, sold over
IL 900 million (US$215 million) of debentures in 1972, but was permitted to
retain only 22% of that for loans as outlined above.
t4.       Deposits from customers and smaller banks provide a secondary source
of funds.  Dermand deposits yield 4 to 5% per annum, depending on size and
activity, but the Bank of Israel requires a 70% reserve to be deposited with
it, raising the net cost of these funds to between 13 and 17% annually.
Similarly, time deposits longer than six months cost a net 13%, based on 10%
yield to the depositor and a 25% reserve.
15.       The high reserve requirements are a further reflection of Government's
policy of monetary constraints.  However, exemptions from these requirements
are granted.  The funds freed by such exemptions must be used for short-terst
agricultural credit, under terms and conditions set by Government. Baniks
.which do not have a large agricultural clientele will lend freed reserves
to the agricultural banks for on-lending to farmers.
16.       Finally, share capital and retained profits provide additional
resources for loans.
B. Participating Barts
Israel Bank of Agriculture Ltd. (IBA)
17.       IBA was organized in 1951 by the Government of Israel, which niow
holds 93% of the outstanding voting shares. The Board of Directors is elected
directly bv che s'aareholders (in effect, thle Government) and consists of rep-
resentatives of the Ministries of Agriculture and Finance, representatives of
the moshavim and kibbutzim movements, farmers and senior management of the bank.
18.       The total staff is 106.  In addition to the six top managers, there
are four econorists, three agronomists and various other professionta.ls. Many
of the emplovees have had long experience in banking with either IBA or
similar institutions.



ANNEX 8
Page  5
19.       More than one-half of the bank's loans are granted umder the super-
vised credit system (paras 1-6) and are evaluated within that framework.
About two-thirds of all loans are approved by a joint committee of the bank
and the Ministry of Agriculture. Thus, IBA relies on the Mizistry for much
of the technical and financial appraisal of investment projects. The bank's
review is limited to an evaluation of creditworthiness of the borrower once
all technical approvals have been secured. As most loans are made to clients
with a continuing relationship with IBA, existing securities are reviewed and
augmented if necessary for each new loan. Therefore, the loan processing time
is very short, on the order of one to three weeks. An established electronic
data processing system permits up-to-date supervision of all borrowers and
good management control. For the convenience of its clients, IBA maintains
a relationship with a small bank with offices throughout the country which
serves as a payments agency.
20.       IBA serves 110 kibbutzim, 150 moshavim and about 20 cooperatives
and agricultural schools under the supervised credit system. These account
for approximately 55% of all loans outstanding. More than 1,500 individuals,
cooperatives and companies account for the remainder.
21.       Authorized ordinary share capital equals IL 105 million (US$25 million),
of which IL 81 million (US$19 million) has been paid up. Three series are
7,      cumulative preference shares, totaling IL 15 million (US$3.6 million), are also
=0       outstanding.  In addition, the bank has registered a series of preference shares,
denominated in US dollars, for sale outside Israel, to raise about US$14 million.
22.       Whereas in previous years, the chief sources of funds for IBA were
the sale of debentures and direct loans from the Treasury, the largest portion
in recent years has come from increased deposits and loans from banks. About
one-half of these funds are the proceeds of IBRD Loan 709-IS (first agricultural
credit project) which are on-lent to the other two participating banks and
directly to farmers. Similarly, about half of the increase in direct deposits
from the Treasury has been for this project. IBA also has received large
deposits from several Israeli banks that wish to utilize their relatively low
cost funds, freed by exemptions from Bank of Israel liquidity requirements,
specifically for agricultural lending; these deposits and matching loaY3 also
permit consolidation of securities if IBA and another bank lend to the s2ame
settlement for agricultural and industrial projects. Retention of profits,
the sale of preference shares and increases in joint funds deposited by the
Kibbutzim and moshavim movements have also been substantial sources of funds.
23.       The majority of loans outstanding are long-term development loans
at an interest rate of 9% per annum. However, about 30% of the portfolio
carries lower rates due to previous government policies, while almost 15%
are short-term loans at rates between 9 and 15% per anrum. As actual loan
losses have been negligible, indeed nil in three of the last five years, the
provision for loan losses, equal to 2% of loans outstanding, is adequate.
_       Moreover, the general reserve of IL 25 million (US$6 million) provides addi-
40      tional security.



ANNEX 8
Page  6
24.       IBA's profit for the last fiscal year (1972/73) was IL 9.4 million
(US$2.2 million). Dividends of 4 to 13% were paid on the three series of
preference shares and 6% on the ordinarv shares, leaving IL 2.7 million for
additions to reserves (29% of net income).
25.       Under the first agricultural credit project (Loan 709-IS), IBA has
granted a total of 1,207 loans for IL 63 million (US$15.0 million). As the
borrower, it has maintained close cooperation among the three participating
banks and has worked with the Project Coordination Committee (Annex 9) to
foster successful execution of the project.
26.       As demonstrated by its performance under the first project, IBA is
a well-managed, financially sound institution capable of administering the
proposed IBRD loan.
YAAD Agricultural Development Bank Ltd. (YAAD)
27.       YAAD is the successor to the Central Bank of Cooperative Institutions
in Palestine Ltd. established in 1922; it has been operating in its present
form since a merger in 1962 with two other financial institutions. It is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank Leumi Le-Israel, the largest banking group
in Israel with assets of IL 17.8 billion (IJS$4.2 billion), which is controlled
by the Zionist Organization.  The Board of Directors consists of representatives
of Bank Leumi and the Ministry of Agriculture.
28.       YAAD is managed jointly with Otsar La'Taasiya, an industrial develop-
ment bank of roughly the same size. In addition to a common administrative
staff of 30, YAAD's professional staff numbers about 15, most of whom have
had long experience in banking. Bank Leumi's agricultural credit staff of
eight provides additional support.
29.       Over two-thirds of the bank's loans are granted under the supervised
credit system (paras 1-6). These and various other loans are subject to
review and approval by a committee consisting equally of representatives of
the bank and the Ministry of Agriculture. The chief criterion of approval
is creditworthiness, as the Ministry bears the responsibility for evaluating
the technical viability of a project. The great majority of clients maintain
a continuing relationship with YAAD and Bank Leumi, so that securities on new
loans are easily obtained. Consequently, loans are processed rapidly. yAAD
makes use of Bank Leumi's extensive computer accounting system, facilitating
good management control. Of the approximately 270 branches of Bank Leumi
throughout Israel, YAAD uses about 60 as paying and receiving agents.
30.       YAAD serves 83 kibbutzim, 95 moshavim and several other institutions
under the supervised credit system. These account for approximately 68% of
loans outstanding. The remainder is held by over 1,100 individuals, companies
and cooperatives.



ANNEX 8
Page 7
31.       Authorized and paid-up ordinary share capital is IL 6 million
(US$1.4 million).  In addition, IL 4 million in preference shares is authorized
but only IL 0.5 million (US$0.1 million) is paid up.
32.       Although YAAD raised almost IL 200 million through the sale of
debentures in 1972 (both abroad and in Israel), 85% of this amount was
redeposited with the Treasury. Nevertheless, these debentures accounted for
almost 60% of net sources of funds. Most of the remainder come from deposits
under the first agricultural credit project, either as subloans from IBA
(from the IBRD loan) or as deposits of Government's share.
33.       As with IBA, most of YAAD's loans are long-term development loans
at an interest rate of 9% per annum. Almost IL 50 million or 23% of all
medium- and long-term loans, are outstanding at lower rates from previous
special Government loan programs. As clients borrow nearly all their working
capital from Bank Leumi, short-term loans, at rates of 10 to 16% per annum,
constitute less than 2% of the bank's portfolio. The provision for loan
losses is adequate, based on past default experience. The general reserve
of If 5.9 million (US$1.4 million), equal to 3% of loans outstanding, is an
additional safeguard.
34.       YAAD's profit of IL 2 million represented a return on equity of 17%
up from an average of 15% over the preceeding five years during which net
income grew about 17% a year. Dividends of 5% on preference shares and 10%
on ordinary shares left almost 70% of net income (IL 1.4 million) for additions
to reserves.
35.       YAAD has granted 1,344 loans totaling IL 37 million (US$8.8 million)
under the first agricultural credit project. Due to its affiliation with Bank
Leumi and the consequently higher proportion of small loans to individuals,
YAAD's average loan size has been considerably smaller than that of IBA or
NIR.
36.       YAAD is a financially sound, well-managed bank, capable of continuing
under the proposed second loan the same successful performance it has exhibited
under the first project.
NIR Ltd.  (NIR)
37.       NIR was founded in 1934 by two affiliates of the national labor
federation, Histadrut, which retains 60% ownership. Bank Hapoalim, the
second largest banking group in Israel with assets of over IL 7 billion
(US$1.7 billion), owns almost 20% of NIR: Histadrut directly holds more than
50% of Bank Hapoalim. Representatives of the parent bank, the kibbutzim and
moshavim movements, Government and the national labor federation comprise the
Board of Directors.
38.       NIR's staff numbers 18.  Due to the continuity of organization and
management, most have had long experience with the bank. Bank Hapoalim
X      provides some professional services from their own staff.



ANNEX 8
Page 8
39.       Almost three-quarters of all loans are granted under the supervised
credit scheme (paras 1-6), subject to review and approval of a Joint bank/
Ministry of Agriculture committee. As with IBA and YAAD, this is mainly an
evaluation of creditworthiness. Bank Hapoalim established a single subsidiary
to hold guarantees and securities from all clients of its subsidiaries,
thereby facilitating and speeding the processing of new loan applications.
Thus, NIR can process most loan applications in less than three weeks. NIR
plans to switch its accounts to a computerized service bureau within the year.
Bank Hapoalim has about 205 branches throughout the country, of which NIR
uses almost 40.
SLo.      Under the supervised credit system, in conjunction with the Ministry
of Agriculture, NIR serves 51 kibbutzim and 26 moshavim. Additionally, five
kibbutzim and three moshavim have entered voluntary supervised arrangements
with NIR while 29 younger kibbutzim and moshavim clients are supervised for
the Jewish Agency which is sponsoring these settlements. Besides these 114
farms, NIR serves about 800 individuals, companies and cooperatives which
account for some 26% of loans outstanding.
As of the last audit, authorized ordinary share capital was IL 8
million of which IL 7.6 million (US$1.8 million) was paid up. Of a further
IL 4 million in preference shares authorized, IL 3.3 million (USS0.8 million)
is paid.
42.       The main source of funds for NIR's operations has been increased
deposits from other banks and the Treasury, almost 20% of which were provided
under the first agricultural credit project. Sales of about IL 2 million in
debentures and stock as well as retention of profits provided smaller amounts.
43.       Of the total loan portfolio, almost all is long-term development
loans at 9% interest. Loans at lower and higher rates constitute a minor
proportion of those outstanding. Similar to YAAD, clients of NIR obtain
nearly all their working capital from the parent, Bank Hapoalim. NIR, there-
fore, has practically no short-term loans outstanding. The provision for
loan losses, imbedded in the general reserve of about IL 4 million, is ade-
quate based on previous loss experience.
L4.       NIR's profits have been growing about 23% annually to IL 1.6 million
(US$0.4 million) in 1972, representing an increase to 11% return on invested
capital. Dividends of 8% on ordinary shares and 5.5% on preference shares
left almost 60% of net income or IL 0.9 million for additions to reserves.
h5.        NIR has granted 1,050 loans for IL 25 million (US$5.8 million) under
the first agricultural credit project. With a much lower proportion to green-
house development and a much higher percentage for water development projects
on kibbutzim and moshavim, the average size of NIR's loans under the project
has been the largest of the three banks.
h6.       Following its successful performance under the first project, NIR
is a well-managed, financially sound bank, capable of participating in the
proposed loan.

ISRAEL
SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Project-related Research Compgnent
Introduction
1.        A part of the US$35 million Bank loan for the Project would be used
in Israel to support agricultural research programs related to the Project.
About US$1.2 million would be made available over a three-year period to help
finance investment items, buildings and structures, equipment and materials,
expert and consultant services, and overseas fellowships for Israeli staff.
The research program is expected to take at least five years and operating
expenses would be met from local sources. The Agricultural Research Organi-
zation (ARO) of Israel would be responsible for management of the research
subproject.
Rationale for a Project Research Component
2.        Israel must expand agricultural production for import substitution
40        in the face of growing domestic demands, and for increasing exports to help
achieve a favorable balance of trade. Increased production must come from
limited resources, particularly labor and water. Improved product quality
and lower production costs would strengthen the country's competitive posi-
tion in export markets. Yields and product quality can be increased and unit
costs reduced through development of technology based upon research.
3.        The proposed investment of Project funds would improve the nation's
research capability. Farmers who would invest under the Project to expand
production would benefit financially from the research as they adopt the new
technology. A strong extension organization already exists in Israel and new
knowledge would be transmitted quickly to farmers. The Israeli farmer is
known for rapidly adopting new techniques and technological innovations.
The benefits of the research would be available also to other countric
with similar soil, water and climatic conditions.
4.        The research for which Project funding is proposed is already in
progress or is being planned for the future, and would be undertaken even
without Project funding, but at a much reduced level. The additional finan-
cial support would expand the scope of research, improve its quality and ac-
celerate the development of new knowledge needed to increase productivity.
5.        Agricultural researchers in Israel are in general well-trained, ca-
pable scientists who have demonstrated the value of their research to the
country's agriculture. The principal existing needs are new buildings, lab-
oratories and equipment to utilize more fully the scientific personnel. The
40       research component of the Project would assist in the provision of these needs.



ANNEX 10
Page 2
It would also provide for accelerated exchange of knowledge through fellow-
ships for Israeli scientists and through short-term assignments in Israel of
specialized consultants from abroad.
Research Priorities
6.        In order to obtain the maximum benefits from the research subproj-
ect investment, priorities have been established. Consideration has been
given to the importance of the problem or commodity to the country, the ap-
propriateness of the research to the purposes of the Project, the short- and
long-term impact on agriculture, potential returns on investment, the avail-
ability of scientists for concentrating in the area, and the feasibility of
performing the research.
7.        Project funds would support research by interdisciplinary teams of
scientists on a limited number of commodities. The concentration of effort
would produce a maximum of research for the investment during the life of the
Project and also would provide a firm base for longer-term research in the
areas selected.
8.        Highest priority on a commodity basis would be given to turkeys and
citrus (grapefruit and tangerines). The second priority group includes other
subtropical fruit and mutton.  All four commodity areas offer opportunities
for multi-disciplinary research and scientists are available in Israel to
participate in the team efforts.
Cost of Research Subproject
9.        The success of the research subproject would be contingent upon a
continuous research effort over a period of at least five years, and it is
important, in supporting the investment, to ensure that funds for current
costs would be made readily available. All current costs over the five
years have been included in the total cost of the research program; the
Government would meet these current costs - both local and foreign - from
its own resources.
10.       The following table provides estimates of the annual investment and
current costs to be incurred in each of the five years. All subproject in-
vestment, IL 9.44 million, is expected to be completed in the first three
years of the Project; the foreign exchange component would amount to about
IL 6.2 million equivalent (US$1.48 million), or 66%. The Bank would contribute
about IL 5.0 million equivalent (US$1.2 million), which is 81% of the foreign
exchange component.

Commodity Research Areas
11.       Citrus Research Program.  Citrus is Israel's most important agricul-
tural export commodity. There are opportunities for greatly increased exports
of grapefruit and tangerines, particularly to Europe, provided production of
acceptable varieties and quality can be continually improved. The opportun-
ities for increasing exports of oranges are more limited and are not included
in the proposed research program.
12.       Investment under the Project for increased citrus production would
be about the same as that for turkeys. Additional investments in water man-
agement and drainage would open up new lands suitable for grapefruit and tan-
40      gerine production.



ANNEX 1 0
Page  4               r
13.       It has been estimated that citrus production costs could be reduced
by as much as 30% per hectare (about It 15 million for 5,000 ha) through
improvements that can be developed by research scientists. Improved pest
control knowledge and practices could increase yields by 10%.
14.       The citrus research program would be an integrated activity with 11
principal scientists and supporting staff. The principal objectives of the
program would include breeding and selection of varieties and production of
high quality fruit that better compete in world markets; developing a
dependable supply of virus-free budwood for expansion of plantings; developing
biological means of pest control; improving water management methods; develop-
ing mechanical pickers and smaller trees suitable for use with such equipment;
improving packaging, storage and transport of fruit; and developing additional
uses for fruit not suitable for export.
15.       Project funds would support major investment in facilities and
equipment required to expedite citrus research; facilities to be developed
would include new plantings and irrigation systems. The total cost of the
proposed five-year citrus research program would amount to IE 13 million
(US$3.1 million). Of this amount the Bank would contribute about US$620,000.
16.       Turkey Research Program.  Per capita consumption of broilers in
Israel is the highest in the world, about 35 kilos per year, and further
increases in production above that required for population expansion appear
unlikely. Or, the other hand, turkey consumption is only 7.5 kilos per person
per year, and turkey production is expected to double in the next four or five
years. Turkeys represent an important substitute for imported beef. They
can be served in a variety of ways including steaks, cutlets, turkeyburgers,
hot dogs, salami, and other specialty meat forms. The feed conversion rate
for turkeys is less efficient than for broilers, but more efficient than for
other livestock.
17.       The proposed investment under the Project in new or expanded turkey
production facilities is substantial, representirng about 7% of the Bank loan.
Over 400 farmers would benefit. It has been estimated that unit costs of
production may be reduced by as much as 25% as new knowledge is developed
by the research team.
18.       Currently, there is relatively little research on turkeys being
undertaken throughout the world, and that which has taken place has generally
focused on local problems that have limited application for Israel. The
western world's move toward smaller turkeys has been contrary to Israel's
needs, where turkeys are sold in cut-up or pre-processed form rather than as
whole birds. A large bird is therefore preferred. Israel is striving also
to produce turkeys on a year-round rather than on a seasonal basis, and
this will require more knowledge of hatching egg production.



ANNEX 10
Page 5
19.       The objectives of the research into turkeys would include developing
efficient feed formulations for various climatic conditions related to stages
in the life cycle of the birds; reducing the cost of hatching eggs through
improved nutrition, management and fertility of breeding flocks; preventing
and controlling disease; developing new and improved consumer products using
turkey meat; and developing uses for by-products, including turkey manure.
20.       Since feedstuffs constitute about 70% of total costs of turkey pro-
duction in Israel, studies on nutrition offer considerable opportunity for
cost reduction. New methods of management, including confined rearing under
controlled climatic conditions, need to be investigated. Separate facilities
would be required for research into diseases and management. The use of manure
in ruminant feedstuffs would also be investigated.
21.       In addition to support personnel, the research team would include
10 principal scientists who have had previous experience with interdiscipli-
nary research. They would cover expertise in nutrition, physiology, repro-
duction, environmental physiology, disease, environmental engineering, by-
product use, and food science. Breeding would be left to the large coamercial
companies which have developed facilities and capabilities that would be dif-
ficult to match at an experimental station. A review panel, including repre-
sentation from the research disciplines and an economist, would be formed to
evaluate results, make recommendations to farmers, and plan future research.
22.       Total cost of the five-year research program on turkeys would be
It 5.9 million (US$1.4 million). Of this amount the Bank would contribute
about US$290,000.
23.       Subtropical Fruit Research Program (Other than Citrus).  The sub-
tropical fruit export market (other than citrus) has been expanding rapidly
and Project funds would increase production capacity. Investments would in-
clude new on-farm plantings and irrigation systems as well as new facilities
for packing. Avocados represent the principal fruit to be financed, but mango
plantings also would be supported.
24.       Due to the relatively long gestation period of these orchards,
short-term returns to this research investment would be limited.  In the Longer
term, however, the impact would be significant. Preliminary research in Israel
indicates that avocado yields could be doubled, and additional research would
help provide the knowledge needed to achieve these yields at the farm level.
25.       The principal objectives of the program include the introduction
of new fruit crops and improving productivity of avocado and mango orchards;
developing vegetative propagation methods for avocados and mangoes; and im-
proving post harvest keeping quality.
-     26.        Experimental plots of Chinese gooseberries, lychees and macadamia
4     nuts would be planted.  With the development of vegetative propagation methods,
avocado and mango cuttings could be grafted to rootstock that have tolerance
to calcareous and heavy soils, and to saline water. Improved storage and
shipping methods are needed to increase shelf-life and reduce spoilage in



ANNEX 10
Page 6
transit.  For mangoes it is hoped to increase shelf-life from four to eight
days currently to 20 days.
27.       Three scientists would comprise the team in this research program
together with support personnel. The scientists' special areas of interest
include physiology and production, propagation, and post harvest physiology
and storage. The five-year total cost of the subtropical fruit research
program, including current costs, would amount to IL 1.7 million (US$0.4
million). The Bank would contribute about US$98,000.
28.       Mutton Research Program.  Increasing mutton (lamb) production
represents another opportunity to reduce imports of beef. In the past,
farmers in Israel have emphasized milk production in native sheep and the
value of the animals for wool and meat was relatively low. Some research
on a modest scale has been carried out in Israel with crossbreeding to im-
prove wool and meat production and promising results have been obtained.
Current research is focusing on increasing the number of lambs to two (now
about 1.6) per parturition and parturitions to three every two years.
29.       The specific objectives of the mutton research program include in-
creasing the fertility of ewes to obtain two sets of twin lambs per ewe per
year; developing feeding systems incorporating natural pastures, cheap feeds
and by-products; and improving growth rate and feed-use efficiency of lambs.
In addition to research on nutrition, breeding, fertility and management, the
growth response of lambs to inclusion of citrus and poultry by-products in
feed mixtures would be studied. Results of this research would be made avail-
able to countries with agricultural conditions and consumer demands similar
to those in Israel.
30.       Five principal scientists, together with supporting staff, would
participate as a team in the mutton research program. The scientists have
expertise in physiology, nutrition, genetics, husbandry, and range manage-
ment, and have worked together before on an interdisciplinary basis. In-
vestments would include facilities, equipment, animals, consultants and
fellowships.
31.       The total cost of the five-year mutton research program, including
operating expenses, would amount to about IE 1.09 million (US$260,000). Of
this amount, the Bank would contribute US$72,000.
32.       Special Equipment.  Funds would be made available to support the
purchase of specialized equipment which would be used by the research teams
in the four subproject commodity areas. The equipment includes an electron
microscope with accessories, and farm implements such as tractors, cultivators,
sprayers, and other small implements. The estimated cost of this equipment is
IE 607,000 (US$145,000), which would be entirely foreign exchange. Of this
amount the Bank would contribute about US$117,000.

Research Management
33.       Agricultural research in Israel is the responsibility of the Agri-
cultural Research Organization (ARO), and most of the Project-related research
would be undertaken at the ARO Volcani Centre. A major share of the invest-
ments would be for new facilities and equipment at the Centre's research in-
stitutes and field stations. The balance would be for facilities and equip-
ment at Hebrew University and the Veterinary Institute.
34.       The Director of ARO would be responsible to the Project Coordina-
tion Committee (PCC) for carrying out the research subproject and would des-
ignate a leader for each of the four commodity programs to be investigated
by multidisciplinary teams. The leaders would be the principal investigators
and would coordinate the activities of the participating scientists from the
various institutes of the Centre, the Hebrew University, and the Veterinary
Institute. Each leader would hold regular meetings with participating sci-
entists to plan and coordinate the research. Results of the research would
be communicated to extension personnel, farmers and members of agricultural
organizations, and published for general dissemination.
Financial Procedures
35.       Consistent with the agreed research proposal, the ARO Director would
4        prepare detailed budgets prior to each fiscal year for approval by PCC.  Any
changes within the year would be reviewed and approved by PCC. Reimbursement
by the Bank would require certification by PCC that expenditures were for
purposes agreed upon with the Bank and approved by PCC.
Evaluation
36.       ARO would follow its normal evaluation procedures for subproject
research programs, including an annual review by the ARO management evalua-
tion team and by established technical advisory committees. An annual pro-
gress report would be prepared by the team leader for each subproject com-
modity and submitted to the Director of ARO. Progress reports would include
a statement on research accomplishments as well as developments relating to
construction of new facilities, purchases of equipment, visits from corsul-
tants, and tours and training programs for scientists. Each of the reports
would also be accompanied by a plan of work describing the research proposed
for the year ahead, together with a plan of projected expenditures of local
and Bank funds for the same period. A monitoring system would be initiated
which would permit a cost/benefit evaluation of subproject impact.
37.       The Director of ARO would consolidate the four reports into one
subproject report, a copy of which would be transmitted to PCC no later than
two months after the close of each fiscal year. PCC would review the report
and submit it to the Bank with comments within three months after the end of
each fiscal year.  An on-site review of the research would be made annually
410     by a Bank representative.

SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Incentives, Subsidies and Taxation
Capital Investment Grants
1.        Grants equal to 20% of total investment cost are available to
producers to stimulate production of selected export crops, chiefly flowers
and subtropical fruits. Similar grants are available to cooperative packing
plants for these crops. These are parallel to grants for industrial projects
which range from 10 to 33-1/3% of investment. In the case of flower produc-
tion facilities and all packinghouses the grants are paid two years after
start of development if the producer or operator has in fact exported his
output during the first two years. For fruit plantations, grants are paid
during the five (or more) years of development upon annual certification that
the farmer is continuing the necessary care of the investment; after completion,
a reasonable share of output must be of a quality suitable for export. For
all investments, the investor pays interest on the grant component of the
investment, which initially is part of the loan, as well as on the balance of
4I    the loan itself.  When the grant is given, it is immediately applied to reduce
the outstanding balance of the loan. In the event that export conditions are
not met, the grant becomes a loan payable on the same terms as the other loan
finance for the investment.
Exchange Rate Premium
2.        All exporters of goods from Israel receive IL 5.09 for each dollar's
worth of exports; this is 21% higher than the official exchange rate of IL 4.2
per dollar. This premium is intended as a refund of high indirect taxes im-
posed on inputs; such taxes include purchase taxes and import duties of up to
45% each, and an additional blanket import levy of 20% on almost all imports.
Thus, the premium serves to reduce the burden of these taxes and to help
restore the competitiveness of Israeli exports in world markets.
Subsidies
3.        Recurring subsidies for agricultural products can be viewed in three
groups: 1) those which maintain low consumer prices; 2) those which maintain
output prices; and 3) those which reduce costs of certain agricultural inputs.
Their magnitude is indicated in the Appendix. Output subsidies primarily
affect commodities produced for domestic consumption.
4.        As consumer prices are a key factor in Government's annual wage
negotiations with the National Labor Federation, Government controls the prices
of about a dozen staple commodities, including milk, potatoes and eggs.  Out-
40   put is bought from farmers and resold to consumers at almost equal, fixed
prices. In effect, Government pays the storage, packing, and processing costs



ANNEX 11
Page 2
to the marketing cooperatives. Since producer prices are comparable to those
prevailing in other countries, Government argues that this policy is a con-
sumer subsidy rather than a producer subsidy. Funds for these subsidies
derive entirely from the national budget.
5.        The second group of subsidies consists of minimum prices on locally-
consumed poultry, beef and selected fruits and vegetables. In the event of
an oversupply of these commodities, the cooperatively-owned marketing boards
intervene to buy and resell produce at the fixed minimum prices and store any
surpluses. Producers contribute at least half of the funds for the support
of fruits and vegetables.
6.        Subsidies on input costs come largely from Government's budget.
For example, in livestock feed, Government supports an equalization fund
which helps cushion the impact on domestic prices of short-term fluctuations
in world market prices. While the objective is for the fund to balance, the
usual result is a net support by Government of about 5% of the cost of the
feed. Water for agriculture, discussed in detail in Annex 7, is subsidized
with payments to high-cost producers from the budget together with assess-
ments on low-cost producers.
Income Taxes
7.        Income taxes are paid at rates ranging from 25% on the first IL 1,000
in excess of IL 2,500 (US$595) per family to 69% of any income over IL 32,500
(US$7,700). All farmers pay income taxes on the same basis as non-farm workers.
Cooperatives, including kibbutzim and moshavim, are taxed on their income pro-
rated over all members. To facilitate collection of taxes on agricultural
income, taxes due are calculated on the basis of standard sales and cost es-
timates which are revised annually in negotiations between Government and
representatives of all farmers.

ANNEX 14
ISRAEL
SECOiD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rate of return from the Project has been estimated at
21% after making appropriate adjustments for taxes, subsidies and grants in
the Project production models (Annexes 4-7). Since income tax on producer
income is a transfer payment within the economyn, no adjustments were made
to the net benefit streams (before tax paid) of the models. Adjustments to
the net benefit streams were made, however, for indirect taxes on investment
and current cost items as well as for government grants and subsidies on
these items. These adjustments are as follows:
(a) Indirect taxes - mainly import duties and sales taxes on
investment and current cost items are not a cost to the
4                         economy and, therefore, were added to the net benefit
streams of the models.
(b) Subsidies on investment and current cost items as well as
government grants for investment are, however, a cost to
the economy and were deducted from the net benefit streams.
2.        Due to the difficulty of quantifying expected benefits from the
Project-related research component, the associated cash flows were
excluded from the economic rate of return calculation. No adjustments
were made for the preferential exchange rate applied to exports.
3.        If investment costs or operating expenses of subprojects
increased by 10oj, or the value of sales decreased by 10%, the econoraLc
rate of return would fall to 19%, 15% or 12%,respectively.
