the Bank. The\n            principal aim of the program is to keep the balance of\n            payments manageable while restoring the growth momentum of\n            the economy. To achieve these medium-term objectives,\n            specific actions will be taken: (i) to save imports\n            (particularly energy-related imports); (ii) to promote\n            exports and improve industrial efficiency through\n            consolidation of investment, further opening of the economy\n            and reducing government intervention; and (iii) to\n            strengthen domestic resource mobilization efforts. The\n            foreign exchange provided by the loan will be used to\n            finance essential imports."}, "docdt": "1981-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
