                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) will be to extend and promote the sustained and effective use of the HIS by all potential users concerned with water resources
                         planning and management, both public and private, thereby contributing to improved productivity and cost - effectiveness of water related investments in the 13 States
                         and with Central agencies. The coverage of existing states under the project is to help these agencies from moving over from development of HIS (as in HP-I) towards
                         use of HIS in water resources planning and management. The PDO will be achieved by : (a) strengthening the capacity of hydrology departments (surface and
                         groundwater) to develop and sustain the use of the HIS for hydrological designs and decision tools thus creating enabling environment for improved integrated water
                         resources planning and management; (b) improving the capabilities of implementing agencies at State/Central level in using HIS for efficient water resource planning
                         and management reducing vulnerability floods and droughts and thereby meeting the country's poverty reduction objectives; (c) establishing and enhancing user -
                         friendly, demand responsive and easy accessible HIS to improve shared vision and transparency of HIS between all users; and (d) improving access to the HIS by public
                         agencies, civil society organization and the private sector through awareness building supporting outreach services. Greater use of an improved HIS is expected to
                         have a broad but definite impact on the planning and design of water resources schemes, from which the rural and urban poor will have secure and sustainable access
                         to water for multi - purpose livelihood uses. The conceptual framework of outcome and output indicators is outlined below. Specific measurable indicators will be
                         developed by the project's Management Consultants in consultation with the participating agencies, during the design of the project monitoring system.

                         A review on some key components was held in October 1 – 5, 2012 confirming the approval of the project extension (till May 2014). The objectives of the mission were to: (i) review
                         the overall performance of the project, including the progress with the annual work plans for each Implementing Agency (IA); and (ii) review the progress with the new activities
                         included during the extension period. This mission followed technical review visits that were conducted earlier in March and June 2012.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since the last mission, an extension of the project (till May 31, 2014) was approved. The extension was granted to complete those activities already started and committed and to
                         focus on providing technical support to ensure long-term sustainability of project outputs in the 13 States and eight Central agencies. This strategy allows for sufficient time for all
                         agencies to troubleshoot the newly developed hardware and software systems and tools with continued access to technical support by the PCS, TMC, and Bank teams. The
                         extension period would also give all IAs the opportunity to generate public awareness of these data systems and various research studies (through agency websites and various
                         forums) to ensure full impact and dissemination.

                         Since the approval of the extension notable progress has been made in several areas. This includes progress with advancing the pilot aquifer mapping program (a joint program of
                         the CGWB and the National Geophysical Research Institute has been formally established), continued excellent progress with the Maharashtra real-time decision support system for
                         flood forecasting, and the expansion of monitoring networks across several IAs, particularly those in Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka (Surface Water-SW) and Andhra Pradesh
                         (Ground Water-GW). Unfortunately, other items continue to be marred with delays. This includes the finalization of real-time data acquisition systems in Tamil Nadu, Orissa, and
                         Madhya Pradesh. Queries raised by the finance departments for many of the central agencies (particularly CGWB) also continue to contribute to significant delays in delivering the
                         work program. Due to this, the implementation progress (IP) rating has been kept at Moderately Satisfactory. Achieving the Project Development Objective (PDO) remains also likely
                         and so this rating is maintained at Moderately Satisfactory. Ratings will be upgraded only after all major procurements are fully committed. The strongest performers include
                         Karnataka (SW), Andhra Pradesh (GW), Himachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra (SW). These IAs have strong management support and remain active in implementing the work
                         program. These agencies may wish to expand further their work program if required. The IAs that require close monitoring in the next 6 months include CGWB, CPCB, BBMB, Tamil
                         Nadu, Kerala (SW and GW), Orissa (SW and GW), Chhattisgarh (GW), Karnataka (GW), and Madhya Pradesh (SW and GW). Of these, CGWB, CPCB, BBMB still have significant
                         remaining activities to be committed (within the next few months) and completed. These IAs continue to need focused technical support and engagement to ensure that the remaining
                         work program is completed according to the agreed time lines.
