                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) will be to extend and promote the sustained and effective use of the HIS by all potential users concerned with water resources
                         planning and management, both public and private, thereby contributing to improved productivity and cost - effectiveness of water related investments in the 13 States
                         and with Central agencies. The coverage of existing states under the project is to help these agencies from moving over from development of HIS (as in HP-I) towards
                         use of HIS in water resources planning and management. The PDO will be achieved by : (a) strengthening the capacity of hydrology departments (surface and
                         groundwater) to develop and sustain the use of the HIS for hydrological designs and decision tools thus creating enabling environment for improved integrated water
                         resources planning and management; (b) improving the capabilities of implementing agencies at State/Central level in using HIS for efficient water resource planning
                         and management reducing vulnerability floods and droughts and thereby meeting the country's poverty reduction objectives; (c) establishing and enhancing user -
                         friendly, demand responsive and easy accessible HIS to improve shared vision and transparency of HIS between all users; and (d) improving access to the HIS by public
                         agencies, civil society organization and the private sector through awareness building supporting outreach services. Greater use of an improved HIS is expected to
                         have a broad but definite impact on the planning and design of water resources schemes, from which the rural and urban poor will have secure and sustainable access
                         to water for multi - purpose livelihood uses. The conceptual framework of outcome and output indicators is outlined below. Specific measurable indicators will be
                         developed by the project's Management Consultants in consultation with the participating agencies, during the design of the project monitoring system.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an interim ISR to be be fully completed after the next full mission (May/June TBD). This interim ISR follows several technical visits by the team since the previous full mission.
                         The current main issues regarding implementation status include (a) loan utilization concerns given that the project closes May 31, 2014, (b) delays in the processing of payments
                         especially with GoI implementing agencies and (c) the strategy for the remaining year of the project. In anticipation of the close of the project, it will be important in this final year that
                         the numerous activities are consolidated and that a preliminary stock taking exercise begin. Moreover with many of the major procurements completed, including the establishment of
                         various hydrological monitoring systems, much more attention this year can be given to training and ensuring the sustainability and usability of these systems. Much more focus will
                         also be placed on dissemination of the results of various activities (e.g. purpose driven studies, decision support system development outputs) to a broad audience/stakeholders. A
                         full review will be completed after the next mission including a revisit of the ratings.
