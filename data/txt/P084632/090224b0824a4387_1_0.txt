                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) will be to extend and promote the sustained and effective use of the HIS by all potential users concerned with water resources
                         planning and management, both public and private, thereby contributing to improved productivity and cost - effectiveness of water related investments in the 13 States
                         and with Central agencies. The coverage of existing states under the project is to help these agencies from moving over from development of HIS (as in HP-I) towards
                         use of HIS in water resources planning and management. The PDO will be achieved by : (a) strengthening the capacity of hydrology departments (surface and
                         groundwater) to develop and sustain the use of the HIS for hydrological designs and decision tools thus creating enabling environment for improved integrated water
                         resources planning and management; (b) improving the capabilities of implementing agencies at State/Central level in using HIS for efficient water resource planning
                         and management reducing vulnerability floods and droughts and thereby meeting the country's poverty reduction objectives; (c) establishing and enhancing user -
                         friendly, demand responsive and easy accessible HIS to improve shared vision and transparency of HIS between all users; and (d) improving access to the HIS by public
                         agencies, civil society organization and the private sector through awareness building supporting outreach services. Greater use of an improved HIS is expected to
                         have a broad but definite impact on the planning and design of water resources schemes, from which the rural and urban poor will have secure and sustainable access
                         to water for multi - purpose livelihood uses. The conceptual framework of outcome and output indicators is outlined below. Specific measurable indicators will be
                         developed by the project's Management Consultants in consultation with the participating agencies, during the design of the project monitoring system.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is central to efforts in India to improve the planning, development, and management of water resources, as well as flood forecasting and reservoir operations in real-time.
                         For the first time in India, a real time flood management system with a real time hydro-meteorological monitoring system and advanced river basin modeling for reservoir operation
                         has been introduced for three river basins, including the Bhakra Beas System with the Bhakra Beas Management Board and the Upper Krishna and Upper Bhima river basins in
                         Maharashtra State. Realizing the importance of real time data monitoring six more States have started to upgrade their hydrological information systems with real time data
                         acquisition systems. Further, the project has provided decision support systems (DSS) for water resources planning and management which has been piloted for 13 river basins in
                         the country and can be up-scaled to other river basins in India. The pilot aquifer mapping program introduced later in the project has yielded interesting findings and has
                         demonstrated the use of advanced techniques for aquifer mapping in six pilot watersheds, including heliborne Transient Electro Magnetic (TEM) geophysical survey techniques.
                         Eventually this will lead to the development of an efficient and time-saving approach for the country-wide National Aquifer management program, to be initiated under the 12th Five
                         year Plan (2012-2017).
