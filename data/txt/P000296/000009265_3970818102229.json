The\n            project includes the following five main components: 1)\n            agricultural research; 2) agricultural extension (rainfed\n            and irrigated crops, livestock, natural resource\n            management); 3) animal health and pastoralist promotion; 4)\n            pilot programs consisting of: (a) promotion of farmer\n            organizations; and (b) a program for small rural\n            infrastructures to study the processes and feasibility of\n            financing village-level operations intended for communal\n            usage; and 5) restructuring of agricultural services."}, "docdt": "1997-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
