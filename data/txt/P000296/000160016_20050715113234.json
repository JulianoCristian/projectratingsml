Among the lessons cited were:\n            1) Achieving an integrated extension service requires a\n            unique institutional setting particularly in an environment\n            where coordination and communication are ineffective. The\n            split of the Ministry of Agriculture into two ministries\n            made the implementation of this approach impossible. Project\n            implementation proved, in the livestock sector, that the\n            extension service delivery should have relied more on\n            livestock specialists for pastoralist and semi-intensive\n            production systems, and on private veterinarians for animal\n            health. 2) Monitoring and evaluation activity should be put\n            at the forefront of project design and implementation. Two\n            ways to achieve that in this case are to: (a) make every\n            effort to effectively involve all national institutions\n            responsible for data collection and management, or (b)\n            create a Network of Impact Studies integrating the\n            institutions in charge of data collection and management\n            under the auspices of a strong national research\n            institution. 3) For service delivery to be efficient and\n            sustained, a holistic approach should be pursued based on:\n            (a) a more professionalized and decentralized service\n            delivery accountable to farmers; (b) improved market and\n            credit access to create incentives to increase productivity\n            and new technology adoption; (c) promoting small rural\n            agro-industries in which the private sector, particularly\n            professional organizations, have a key role to play; and (d)\n            a sustainable financial mechanism to fund extension and\n            research service delivery. 4) Empowering farmers and\n            communities is a long process whose outcome cannot be\n            achieved overnight. 5) Privatizing service delivery happened\n            to be more complex than anticipated. This requires an\n            enabling environment, a strong political will, a critical\n            mass of private actors and more experienced professional\n            organizations supported by a strong capacity building\n            program to foster public-private partnership."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
