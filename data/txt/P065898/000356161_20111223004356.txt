                         Extension of Closing Date

1.    The closing date for Vietnam-Water Resources Assistance Project [Credit
No.3880-VN] will be extended 12 months from December 31, 2011 until December 31,
2012.

2.     The project comprises four components: (1) Irrigation Modernization (US$154.7
M); (2) Dam Safety Management (US$10.2 M); (3) Thu Bon River Basin Development
(US$ 2.6 M); and (4) Project Management and Capacity Building (US$ 8.7 M). The
total project cost was US$ 176.2 of which IDA financing would be up to US$ 157.8 M
or SDR 105.7 M equivalent. The project has been executed by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). The Development Credit Agreement
was signed in August 19, 2004, and the Credit became effective on December 21, 2004.
The original credit closing date was December 31, 2011.

3.       The Project experienced a long initial delay in implementation. The QCBS
process to secure international consulting services to prepare the detailed engineering
designs for irrigation modernization works took over two years. During this initial time
period, the only implementation activities occurring related to dam safety upgrades and
auditing and training related to irrigation modernization concepts. Major construction
works (under Component 1) did not begin until early 2008. Since that time, project
implementation has been progressing satisfactorily. By November 2011, some 90% of
the physical work was completed, major advances had occurred in non-physical goals
(i.e. irrigation management plans; emergency preparedness plans for dams), and $131
million (or 80 %) of the IDA credit had been disbursed. Due to the appreciation of the
SDR vis-avis the US$, an additional US$7.1 is now available, bringing the total credit to
US$ 164.9 million.

4.      On December 6, 2011, the Government of Vietnam approved an extension of 12
months for this project and on December 14, 2011, an official request to extend the
project closing date was sent to the Bank by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV). The
proposed 12 months extension of the closing date would allow the Borrower to (i)
complete the installation and commissioning of Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems for the five largest irrigation schemes included under the
project; (ii) complete construction of critical secondary and tertiary canals following
modernization designs; (iii) complete implementation of pilot initiatives on irrigation
management transfer to water user associations; and (iii) prepare a new irrigation project
for future Bank financing using a remaining balance of credit resources.

5.      The project implementation has been satisfactory and there are no significant
issues related to either fiduciary or safeguards policies. The executing agency, MARD,
has prepared detailed implementation and disbursement plans for the remaining activities
towards project completion. A review of these plans showed that all activities shall be
                                             5
fully completed by the new closing date. In addition, the preparation of a new irrigation
project shall be in advanced stages given the readiness of fund to support preparation
activities.

6.      This will be the first extension of the project and, following the Bank
restructuring procedure, it would require the approval of the Country Director of the
World Bank in the Vietnam Country Office.
