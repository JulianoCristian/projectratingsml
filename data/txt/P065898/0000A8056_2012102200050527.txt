                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the Project are to modernize and increase the productivity of Vietnamese agriculture, improve the management of water resources and reduce dam
                         safety risks through: (i) the modernization of irrigation services in selected irrigation schemes within the Project Provinces; (ii) the improvement of dam safety and
                         management; and (iii) the integrated development and management of the Thu Bon River Basin in Quang Nam Province.

                         The project is achieving its objectives though the following major achievements:
                         •        The original conveyance capacity of the project irrigation schemes has been restored through rehabilitation of the critical canals identified during appraisal. The rehabilitation
                         works include canal lining to reduce seepage losses, and installation of additional control structures such as cross-regulators and long rested weirs to enable more timely water

                         delivery management.
                         •          Ten medium size dams have been fully rehabilitated and improved for safety through improvement works. Works have included slope protection both upstream and
                         downstream of the main dams and all auxiliary dams, concrete grouting to reduce seepage, rehabilitation and expansion of existing spillways, construction of emergency fuse-plug
                         spillways and installation of safety monitoring devices.

                         •          Irrigation modernization guidelines and dam safety technical manual have been prepared. It is expected that these guidelines and manuals would be shortly approved by the
                         MARD.
                         •          SCADA systems are being installed and put into operation in 5 schemes under the project. This instrument will help operational staff and managers of irrigation management
                         companies to monitor and operate the scheme as per agreed water scheduling, while quantitative impacts would occur after the completion of the project.
                         •          Establishing 66 Water Users Groups (WUGs) within the project command area and piloting irrigation management transfer (IMT) in three selected provinces to induce
                         incentives for more efficient use of irrigation water. These pilots shall provide practical models for scaling up for the future.
                         •          Completion of a master plan for the Vu Gia-Thu Bon River Basin and establishment of an inter-provincial Basin Coordination Committee covering the province of Quang
                         Nam and the city of Danang. Preparation of two highest priority investments recommended by the Master Plan is being carried out and will be completed by the closing date. These
                         priority investments shall be financed by other Bank-financed project named Vietnam-Managing Natural Hazards (VN-Haz) which will be effective in late this year.
