                         The objectives of the Project are to modernize and increase the productivity of Vietnamese agriculture, improve the management of water resources and reduce
                         dam safety risks through: (i) the modernization of irrigation services in selected irrigation schemes within the Project Provinces; (ii) the improvement of dam
                         safety and management; and (iii) the integrated development and management of the Thu Bon River Basin in Quang Nam Province.

                         January 2012. The proposed extension of the project is to respond to the Government's request for the Bank to continue its engagement in the irrigation sector, by building on the
                         lessons of this project, but also moving to another region and using more Government system. An AAA will be identified and conceptualized in January to assist with the process of

                         modernization initiatives for 5 biggest irrigation schemes included in the project; (ii) complete upgrading of selected critical secondary and tertiary canals to ensure the system perform
                         as designed; and (iii) to scale up participatory irrigation management (PIM) program designed under the scope of project activities with initiation of irrigation management transfer
                         (IMT) and development of benchmarking program for irrigation management companies (IMCs) in order to help improve the water use efficiency through better physical system and
                         improved management capacity.
