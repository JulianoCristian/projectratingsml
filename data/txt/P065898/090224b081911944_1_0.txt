                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the Project are to modernize and increase the productivity of Vietnamese agriculture, improve the management of water resources and reduce dam
                         safety risks through: (i) the modernization of irrigation services in selected irrigation schemes within the Project Provinces; (ii) the improvement of dam safety and
                         management; and (iii) the integrated development and management of the Thu Bon River Basin in Quang Nam Province.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has largely achieved its development objectives.

                         The main benefit of the project is likely to come from increase in irrigated area, mainly achieved through irrigation improvement provided by the project. The project did not directly

                         project areas and will be quantified in the Implementation Completion Review (ICR) report.

                         The first PDO level indicator of implementing an irrigation modernization training program has been achieved, with more people trained than targeted. The second PDO level indicator

                         of establishing a National Irrigation Performance Assessment Program has partly been achieved through (a) development of a benchmarking guidelines; and (b) application of the
                         guidelines for six schemes included under the project, out of a targeted ten schemes.

                         Substantial progress on the institutional development of dam safety has been achieved through issuing a new regulation on dam safety which applies to all dams, not only the ones
                         managed by Ministry of Agriculture Rural Development (MARD). The regulation is complemented by detailed guidelines and manuals which are prepared under initiation of the Dam
                         Safety Unit (DSU) which is established and hosted under the Department of Water Resources. In addition, a draft Dam Safety Manual has been prepared and was discussed with
                         different agencies.

                         This objective of integrated development and management of the VuGia-ThuBon River Basin in Quang Nam province and the city of Danang has largely been achieved through
                         establishing river flows to Danang City by means of river flow stabilization works and preparing two feasibility studies for two priority projects identified in the VuGia-ThuBon River
                         Basin Master Plan. The original third indicator for this component on the establishment of a functioning river basin committee was dropped through an amendment of the Credit
                         Agreement in 2010 due to the transfer of government mandates for such committees from Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to Ministry of Natural Resources and
