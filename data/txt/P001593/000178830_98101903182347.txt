REPORT ATD RECOI4OqDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO rH3 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPNENT CRJDIT TO TIE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
FOR THE PHASE II LILONGW,E AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following repor-t and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$7.25 million
to the Republic of MIalawi.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The I4alawi Government has requested an IDA credit to finance
the second phase of the Lilongwe Land Development Program. The first
phase was financed by a $6 million IDA credit (113-MAI) signed February
5, 1968. The Lilongwe Land Development Program is based on a plan
prepared with the assistance of staff of the Permanent Mission in
Eastern Africa and the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, drawing on the
experience of a pilot scheme financed in 1965 by the United Kingdom.
3.       Before the advent of the Land Development Program, farmers in
Lilongwe district used traditional methods without even such simple
soil conservation measures as ridging or bunding. They used hardly any
fertilizer and there was no systematic selection of planting seed.
Plots were irregular in shape and their boundaries poorly defined.
Soil erosion was wsidespread and crop yields in the area were stagnant
or even declining. A principal obstacle to farm improvement was that
under the traditional system of matrilineal succession a male fairmer
could not be sure from one year to the next which plots of ground he
could cultivate.  He was reluctant, therefore, to build ridges and
bunds or to buy fertilizer, since the benefits might accrue to another
family the following year from whom he could expect no compensation.
4.       2cperience at Lilongwe has demonstrated convincingly thet, by
reorganizing the boundaries of the farmers' fields, creating the
possibility for estaolishing title, and providing access roads and
drainage ditches, farmers are induced to invest more time and money in
the improvement of their farms, to plant their crops earlier and to
purchase farm inputs such as improved seed and fertilizer. Even
without any radical change in cropping patterns or methods of
cultivation, the result in most cases has been a doubling of crop
yields and a significant increase in the farmers' standard of' living.
Once the feasibility of this kind of cihange has been demonstrated to
the farmers, they have taken over and continued the improvements on
their own, withi only supporting services and guidance from the
auth3rities.  The Shire Valley Agricultural Development Project for
which the Association made a credit of $3.7 million in 1968, and the
first phase of the Lilongwe Project are essentially similar. Both havre
been successful and their progress corroborates the effectiveness of this
integrated appronch to agricultural development in Malawi.



- 2 -
5.       The proposed Phase II Lilongwe Project was appraised in
September 1970 and recommends an extension and continuation of the
program of agricultural development substantially on the lines of
the first phase project. An appraisal mission is currently visiting
Malawi to appraise the Karonga project, another regional package
agricultural development program based on the Lilongwe approach, but
.ncluding irrigated rice production. I expect to present the
Karonga project to the Executive Directors in the coming fiscal year,.
6.       Formal negotiations took place in Washington in March 1971.
The Borrower wras represented by Messrs. Goodall E. Gondwe, Under
Secretary, Treasury; Levson S. Mihowa, Administrative Officer,
Treasury; E.T. Wilmot, Under Secretary, Agriculture; Andrew MIercer,
Lilongwe Project Manager; Robert Reader, Economist, Lilongwe Project;
and 14. Ian MacLennan, Assistant General Manager, Agricultural Development
Marketing Corporation (ADMIARC).
7.       Beginning in 1967, the Bank Group has made six IDA cre 'its to
Malawi totalling $33.25 million. The following is a summary statement
of IDA credits to Malawi as at March 31, 1971:
Amount (US$ million)
Credit No.    Year    Purpose                      IDA      Undisbursed
S-2 MAI       1967    Highway Engineering           0.49         -
102-MAI       1967    Education                     6.30        1.92

Total now outstanding            32.75
Total undisbursed                            14.11
Disbursements under the existing credits were slow to begin with but
the progress is now satisfactory.  In the case of the two agricultura:l
development projects the slow initial rate of disbursement reflected



only difficulties on the Malai side in furnishing adequate informnation
to support withdrawal requests.
8.       There have been no IFC investments in 1MalawJi.
9.       The main priorities in developing Nlalawi's economy will remain
in agriculture, infrastructure and training and they will be reflected,
as in the pDst in Bank Group lending operations over the next few years.
PART II - DESCRIPTIN OF THE PROPOSED CR-MIT
10.  Borrower:                   Republic of Malawi
Purpose:                    To help finance the four year (1972-75)
second phase of the Lilongwe Land
Development Program.
Amount:                     US$7.25 million equivalent in various
currencies.
Amortization:               In 50 years, including a ten-year
period of grace, through semi-annual
installments of half of 1% from July
15, 1981 thirough January 15, 1991 and
of 11-2% from July 15, 1991 through
January 15, 2021.
Service Charge:             3/4 of 1%.
Estimated Economic Return:  13% on Phases I and II combined.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.      The appraisal report entitled "Phase II Lilongwe Agric-ultural
Development Project" (PA-76a dated April 19, 1971) is attached.
12.      The proposed project wiould be the Second Phase of the
Lilongwe Land Development Program and would be carried out over the
four financial years 1972 - 1975 (the financial year in Malawi ends in
March). Progress of the on-going Lilongwe Land Development Project,
Phase I, has been very good; physical targets will be completed almost
a year ahead of schedule. With the approval of the Association,
infrastructure development has been started on a further 100,000 acres,
which is expected to be completed by October 1971.  Under the proposed
Phase II project, the Program Area will be further expanded to a total
of about 1.1 million acres, and a ranch for livestock will he
added. The Phase II project will include the construction of 540 rmiles
of roads, 1,700 miles of drainage ditchies, 160 boreholes and 1 service
centers, all of which vwould serve some 2it0,000 acres of arable land.
Provision is also being made for the continuation of extension, credit
and marketing services throughout the areas under the two phases.



13.      The total cost of the project is estimated to be $8.59
million, of which the foreign exchange costs would be $3.35 million.
The proposed IDA credit of $7.25 million would finance 84 percent
of the total project costs and 74 percent of the local cost. The
justification for local cost financing is discussed in paragraph 31.
The Government's contribution and the project farmers' participation
in the project wrill respectively amount to 11 percent and 5 percent
of total project costs. The main items financed by the proposed credit
would be buildings, roads, and land development; service center units;
extension, training and marketing; and ranch development.
1.      The existing Phase I project is being carried out by a section
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (IMNR), headed by
a Program Manager. Management at the project level has been good, but
inter-ministerial coordination could be improved. It is proposed
therefore to strengthen the project organization by providing for
adequate supporting staff for the Program Manager and a project liaison
committee under MANIR to coordinate the activities of all the authiorities
concerned with both the existing and the proposed project. Provision Es
also being made for training of project and extension staff. The
Farmers Marketing Board, which is being reorganized and renamed the
Agricultural Development Marketing Corporation (ADVMAC), will be
responsible for the construction of markets and storage, and for
purchasing the crops produced in the area. While project staff *will
provide agricultural credit for farmers' inputs, credit repayments wrill
be collected by ADIKARC when farmers sell their produce at its markets.
To facilitate project management and farm development the program area
has been divided into units of about 20,000 acres; fourteen have been
established during Phase I and twelve more will constitute Phase II.
Targets for physical development have been laid down for each unit for
road construction, rainfall diversion channels, markets and storage.
During the first two and a half years after establishing a unit, one
extension wsorker would serve 200 farm families, the ratio being reduced
to one worker for 400 families in the following two and a half years.
Assurances have been obtained from the Malawi Government that adequate
agricultural extension services would continue to be provided in the
program area after the project is completed.
15.      The Phase I project did not include development of the
livestock potential in the Lilongwe area, which is considerable. The
proposed Phase II project envisages the development of a ranch of about
161,000 acres in the Dzalanyama Forest Reserve Area to provide upgraded
feeder stock for stall fattening by program area farmers. The ranch
would be started initially with Zebu type animals purchased locally.
16.      Procurement of vehicles, machinery, equipment, fuel and
fertilizers would be subject to international competitive bidding,,
except for individual tenders totalling less than $25,000. The
Project's building program of housing and stores costing about $800,0C0
would be too small to attract international competition. These would
be subject to local competitive tender and there are enough local
contractors to ensure an adequate degree of competition. It has been



necessary to start development of the project ranch to prevent delays
in livestock development to be included in Phase II. Satisfactory
procurement procedures have been followed and it is recommended that
past expenditure on ranch development from October 1970 and amounting
to about $105,000 be financed.
17.      Primary benefits from the IPhase I and Phase II projects would
be the increased production of maize, groundnuts and beef with a
resultant annual foreign exchange earnings or savings amounting to
about $5 million at full development. The ecology of the developed
areas would be substantially improved by the project.   The slow wasting
of soil by erosion would be halted by the construction of drainage
ditches and contoured ridges. Timber planting on non-agricultural land
would assist in soil and water conservation. Boreholes for potable
water would help to improve the human environment by reducing water borne
diseases. The average net income to the farmer of a 10 acre holding
in the project area would increase from about $96 a year before develop-
ment to about $170 at full development. As the experience of Phase I
has shown, an increase in income of this order provides a satisfactory
incentive to the farmers.
18.      The calculation of economic rates of return has to take into
account that the proposed project is part of a continuing development;
the significant rate of return is that of Phase I and Phase II at full
development taken together. That is estimated to be about 13 percent
without charging for family labor.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS MMD AUTHORITY
19.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Malawi and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
20.      The draft Development Credit Agreement specifies that Hvlalawi
shall relend a part of the proceeds of the Credit to the Agricultural
Development and Marketing Corporation (ADI11RC) on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.03(a)). Provision has also
been made to ensure that adequate agricultural extension and credit
services will be maintained during and after completion of the Project
(Sections 3.06 and 3.07).
PART V - THE ECCIOMY
21.      An economic report entitled "The Current Economic Situation
and Prospects of N4almil' (AE-5a dated December 12, 1969) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on January 7, 1970. A basic data slheet is
annexed.



- 6 -
22.      i4alawJi became independent with the brealc-up of the Federation
of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1964. At that time, Halawi, known as
Nyasaland, was the poorest of the three countries forming the
"Federation" and received budgetary support from the United Kingdom
amounting to Kwacha (K) 13 million or just over LO% of its current
expenditures.
23.      Since then, GDP at constant prices has risen by about 5.3%
a year principally as a result of growing productivity in agriculture,
the successful introduction of import substitution industries and a
substantial rise in investment. In addition certain external factors
had played a part, particularly in recent years, such as the boycott of
Southern Rhodesia by a large number of countries wihich lead to higher
tobacco exports from Malawi.  Furthermore, the price index of Nilalawian
exports rose by about 23% between 1967 and 1970, particularly because
of price increases for tobacco, tea and groundnuts.
2h.      Since independence, agricultural yields and production have
risen. W1ith a rapid expansion of agricultural extension services,
new techniques and improved inputs were introduced. There was a sharp
rise in the application of fertilizers and insecticides, an increasing
use of hybrid maize and an increase in early planting. Yields and
quality therefore improved.
25.      Industrial production rose by 22% a year on the average since
independence and now accounts for 9% of GDP. The Government was
successful in encouraging the establishment of a number of import
substitution industries by providing industrial sites and services and
by permitting drawbacks of custom duties paid on material used in the
manufacturing of exported articles. It also introduced a generous
system of initial depreciation allowances and, in certain cases, where
it was felt that the investment was large in relation to the size of
domestic market, it also granted an exclusive right of production in
Malawi for a limited time to the new enterprise. The scope for
further import substitution industries now seems almost exhausted.
26.      Gross investment rose from 11% of GDP in 1964 and 1965 to 17%
for the last two years. Part of this increase was financed by a rise
in net capital inflow from K 6 million in 196h-1965 to K 14 million in
1969-1970 and part was covered by an increase in domestic savings.
While in 1964 domestic consumption almost equalled GDP and gross
domestic saving in the following year was only K 1 million, Malawi now
saves about K 10 million annually which represents about 23%O of total
investment. However, some of tlhe increased in-vestment is accounted for
by projects which were undertacen earlier tihan the growth of demand
would justify. These include a railway link to the port of Nacala in
Nozambique, which is now completed, a new capital now under construction
at Lilongwe and possibly some investments in roads.
27.      Perhaps the clearest improvement in performance was in tha
fiscal field.  The overall public deficit declined from K 12 million in
1964 to K 3 million in 1970/71. There was a slight improvement in
the position of the public entities, but the major improvement was in
central government budgets. The current deficit was halved to reach



- 7 -
K 7 million in 1970/71 and, British budgetary support was consistently
reduced until, in the current year 1971/72, it is expected to finance
only 10% of recurrent expenditures as compared with 40% in 1964.
28.      Revenue increased by over 15% per year between 1964 and
1970/71 against a 7% expansion of recurrent expenditure. While the
largest part of the rise in current revenue was a result of an increase
in the rates of indirect taxation part of it was due to the process of
monetization of the economy. The progressive income tax structure also
played some role as did the gradual using up of the initial capital
and special depreciation allowances for new industries, some of which
were introduced shortly after independence.
29.      Last year the Council of Iiinisters ap)roved certain overall
rates of increase for the different types of recurrent expenditure for
the next 3 years in order to contain the overall rise in recurrent
expenditures to 6% a year.  Furthermore, the Government's objective is to
eliminate British budgetary support by 1974, except for the "topping up"
of salaries of British expatriate civil servants in Nalawi.   The chance
tlat the Government will succeed in this objective seems reasonably good.
30.      Population was thought to be increasing at 3% a year, but as a
result of a new survey the rate is now believed to be between 1.9 to
2.5%. The structure of population and the high fertility ratios, in
addition to the pressure of population on land, could create a serious
der;iographic problem, particularly if there is some improvement in health
services on which expenditure is at present very low.
31.      The service on Malawi's external public debt as of December
1970 amounted to $5.7 million or about 9 percent of export earnings.
According to an estimate prepared by the i4alawi authorities, if new
borrowing amounts to K 24 million ($29 million) a year, which is not
an unreasonable figure, the debt service will rise to 17 percent by
1978/79, even if only 10 percent of the borrowing is on hard terms and
if exports grow by 7 percent a year. Moreover, since the Malawri
Government has first to eliminate the need for external budget support
before it can make any net contribution to financing investment, it
will have to rely to a large extent on external aid for some considerablde
time. Hence, H4alawi's need for aid on concessionary terms is clear.
Because of the high proportion of investment which rnust be financed by
external assistance, it is necessary for aid to cover a substantial
portion of total project costs, including some local expenditure.
