provide the facilities\n            needed to improve the water supply system and abate water\n            pollution in the city. The water supply and sewerage systems\n            would be rehabilitated and expanded and a sewage treatment\n            plant would be constructed. Essential features of the\n            project are: (a) Water Supply: (i) construction of an\n            infiltration gallery, reservoirs and pumping stations, and\n            expansion of existing reservoirs and pumping stations, (ii)\n            installation and replacement of water mains and distribution\n            pipes, and replacement of obsolete service connections,\n            (iii) installation of a control system and master meters,\n            (iv) hydro-geological studies to prepare a water resources\n            master plan, (v) construction of headquarter's offices\n            and supply of office equipment, and (vi) engineering\n            services for designs, supervision, project administration\n            and training. (b) Sewerage: (i) construction of collectors\n            and main sewers and replacement of worn-out sewer laterals\n            and service connections, (ii) construction of sewage\n            treatment facilities (including a pilot plant for\n            experimentation to attain optimal utilization of the main\n            plant), sludge filters and facilities for disposal of\n            sludge, and (iii) engineering services for designs,\n            supervision, project administration and training."}, "docdt": "1976-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
