(i)
the Bank  shall  have  determined  that all further
withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provi-
sions of  paragraph
(a)
of  Section
2.02
of this
Agreement; or
(ii)
the total unwithdrawn amount  of the Loan allocated
to the eligible Categories  less  the amount of any
outstanding special commitment  entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section
5.02 of the General Condi-
tions with respect to  the  Project, shall be equal
to an amount equivalent to  twice the amount of the
Authorized Allocation.
 
(b)
Thereafter, withdrawal  from  the  Loan  Account  of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures  as the Bank shall specify
by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made
only after and to the extent  that the Bank shall have been satis-
fied that all  such  amounts  remaining  on  deposit in the Bauchi
State Special Account  as  of  the  date  of  such  notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
 
6.   (a)
If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
payment out of the Bauchi State  Special Account: (i) was made for
any expenditure or in  any  amount  not eligible pursuant to para-
graph
2
of  this  Schedule;  or
(ii)
was  not  justified by the
evidence furnished to the Bank,  the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from  the  Bank,  deposit  into  the  Bauchi  State Special
Account
(or, if the Bank shall  so request, refund to the Bank)
an
amount equal to the amount of  such payment or the portion thereof
not so eligible or justified. No  further deposit by the Bank into
the Bauchi State Special Account  shall be made until the Borrower
has made such deposit or refund.
 
(b)
If the Bank shall have  determined  at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Bauchi State Special Account will not be
required to cover further  payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice  from the Bank, refund to the
Bank such outstanding amount for crediting to the Loan Account.
