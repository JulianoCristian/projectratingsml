The main\n            objectives of the project were to: (i) strengthen the\n            agricultural services in the Agricultural Development\n            Project (ADPs), in order to raise agricultural production\n            and incomes of an estimated 1.1 million farm families; (ii)\n            improve the coverage and maintenance of supporting rural\n            infrastructure, especially the rehabilitation of 925 km of\n            rural roads and the provision of 975 potable water points;\n            (iii) strengthen supporting commercial services, through\n            privatization of input distribution and technical assistance\n            and operational support to the cooperative financing\n            agencies (CFAs); (iv) strengthen the management and\n            technical staff capabilities of the ADPs; (v) strengthen the\n            capacity for policy formulation, planning, and expenditure\n            programming in the state Ministries of Agriculture and\n            Natural Resources (MANRs); (vi) strengthen the Agricultural\n            and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI)'s\n            curriculum, outreach and revenue base; and (vii) strengthen\n            the Federal Agricultural Coordinating Unit (FACU)'s\n            capacity to provide preparation and implementation\n            assistance to the ADPs. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) ensure that\n            appropriate sectoral and macro policies are, or will be, in\n            place to support project implementation before a loan is\n            approved; (ii) develop the skills of ADP staff for\n            mobilizing communities and individuals for greater\n            participation in project activities and for dealing with\n            other stakeholders; (iii) strengthen procurement and\n            disbursement monitoring by project management; and (iv)\n            monitor the effectiveness of the project executive councils\n            during supervision missions as this has serious implications\n            for management stability and achievement of project objectives."}, "docdt": "1995-12-27T00:00:00Z"}
