The positive lessons learned convey\n            that technical assistance (TA) is most effective in\n            supporting policy, and institutional reforms, provided these\n            reforms are linked to future investment support, i.e.,\n            incentives such as access to external investment, to prod\n            positive responsiveness by State road agencies, including\n            the serious application of environmental and social laws,\n            and regulations, procurement, and financial management. As\n            well, having the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) a\n            non-sector specific body as the central implementing agency,\n            was successful in delivering a TA project to time, quality,\n            and cost constraints. Moreover, the adoption by\n            participating states of a standardized project\n            identification and preparation framework, allowed the\n            efficient delivery of multiple project preparation, both for\n            the states, the DEA, and the Bank itself. Other lessons to\n            be addressed in the future suggest the development of\n            performance indicators to measure project results on\n            institutional impacts, including more formal mechanisms to\n            involve non-government stakeholders in the preparation of\n            institutional, and policy reform elements. Likewise,\n            requirements for investment projects preparation in meeting\n            environmental, and social safeguards, need to be applied on\n            a consistent basis, to minimize clients' uncertainty,\n            while, the states' experience with the standard terms\n            of reference (TORs) for project coordinating consultancy\n            services, proved mixed; rather the secondment of road agency\n            staff to the project coordinating consultants, or explicit\n            TORs that specify the required staff skills'\n            development outcomes, should be practiced."}, "docdt": "2002-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
