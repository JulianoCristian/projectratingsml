The main objective was\n            achieved. Sixteen states ended up meeting entry conditions\n            and became participants in the project, compared to fifteen\n            potential candidate states identified at appraisal.\n            Activities related to institutional development were carried\n            out, but they were intended to help prepare institutional\n            development changes rather than carry out reforms. A key\n            indicator of the project's sustainability is the\n            satisfactory progress, with just minor exceptions, in the\n            implementation of the several follow-on state road projects\n            that were originated by the technical assistance (TA)\n            project. The following lessons were learned: The risks of\n            multi-state projects should be carefully assessed during\n            preparation, especially due to the greater complexity of\n            supervision required. Entry conditions requiring commitment\n            to reforms are useful when such commitments are formalized\n            vis-a-vis of both the central government and the Bank.\n            Resettlement and rehabilitation policies are an issue which\n            can cause conflict especially in states which are confronted\n            with Bank regulations for the first time."}, "docdt": "2006-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
