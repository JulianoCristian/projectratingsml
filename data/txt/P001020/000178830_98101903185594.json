The expansion\n            of the OFAB infrastructure involves the provision of a\n            waiting basin in the port and further dredging, the\n            lengthening of railway passing loops, heavier rails, and\n            extensions to the Kamsar townsite and hospital. The total\n            cost of these works will amount to US$12.9 million\n            equivalent, of which the Boke - UNDP Technical Assistance\n            loan of US$9.0 million will cover the foreign exchange\n            component.
