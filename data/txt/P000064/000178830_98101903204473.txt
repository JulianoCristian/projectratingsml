DAHOMEY
ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the development of cotton and
food crop production in the Center and North of Dahomey. The project-would
be the Bank Group's second operation for agriculture in Dahomey. 1/ Under
the project the cotton area would expand from 29,000 ha on 29,000 farms to
59,Q00 ha on 41,000 faris, and project area production would increase from
25,0 tons in 1910 to 56,000 tons of seed cotton by 1974.  Cotton is Dahomey's
main export earner after oil palm products -- and recently cocoa smuggled
from Nigeria - and accounts for 14% of exports. Production generated by the
project would amount, by 1974, to about 67% of the country's total cotton
prQd3Âctàon.  Project produced cotton would be exported but this would not
have a significant impact on world market prices since Dahomey's exports of
the crop would constitute only about 0.3% of world trade. The project repre-
sents one of the best means, foreseeable at this time, of substantially im-
eproving the standard of living of a large segment of the rural population
and improving Dahomey's balance of payments.
ii.       The project would be the final phase of a long term program
designed to establish a cotton industry in Dahomey capable of competing
efficiently on world markets. Until now, the program, which started in 1964,
has been supported largely with financial aid from France and from the
European Common Market. The project would be carried out over a four-year
period commencing in 1971. Production would be increased by expanding the
cotton area; by împrovîng credit, extension and marketing services, as well
as communications in the project area in coordination with the IDA-financed
highway maintenance program; and by providing cotton ginning facilities.
The project would also provide rice milling facilities; funds for applied
research; and funds for a feasibility study for diversification in the
project area.
iii.      Project costs are estimated at US$12.7 million with a foreign ex-
change component of 60%, or US$7.6 million;  about US$5,9 million would be
for creating, initial staffing and equipping Societe Nationale Agricole pour
le COTON QSONACO) to administer extension, credit and marketing services in
the project area. Direct investments in ginneries, housing, offices, equip-
ment and road improvement accounts for 27% of project costs. IDA would
finance 48% of total project costs; FAC 24.5%; and Government, largely from
project generated funds, 27.5%.  The½prôposed IDA credit would meet costs of
building construction, purchase of equipment and vehicles, feeder road
construction, revolving farm credit fund, research, and the feasibility

development in 1969 (144-DA, Hinvi Project).

study, and would be equivalent to 80% of the project's foreign exchange cost.
Procurement would be by international competitive bidding where orders and
contracts are of a sufficient value to justify this procedure, and goods and
services procured in this way are estimated to have a value of US$8.0 mil-
lion. 1/
iv.       The Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperation would be
responsible for the project through the recently established Societe
Nationale Agricole pour le Coton (SeNACO--ihic-I woul-d iégage--Cotpagnie
Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT) and Societe
d'Aide Technique et de Cooperation (SATEC), both non-profit oriented French
technical assistance agencies, to provide personnei  to manageg operations in
the two pro4ect districts where they have been responsible for agricultural
development since 1965. A joint venture arrangement would be established
under which CFDT w-uld manage ail ginneries in the project area:  three
owned by CFDT, and three owned by Government including the two new ginneries
to be constructed under'the project.  Most project funds would be handled
through SONACO.
v.        At full development the project would double foreign exchange
earnings from cotton and it vould raise the income of about 41,000 partici-
pating farmers.  Dahomey's annual export earnings from cotton at the end
of the project development period are estimated at US$20 million as compared
to estimated export earnings from cotton of US$9.5 million in 1970/71.
Based on the Bank's price forecasts and assuming a project life of 10 years
the economic rate of return from investment in the project is estimated at
34%.  A sensitivity analysis shows that, if cotton yields or prices were 10%
less than projected, the return would be 19Z.  The return is calculated on
the basis of incremental benefits generated by the project.  These are
high rates of return because of (i) previous sunk investments made by the
Government with French assistance, particularly in extension services,
processing facilities and roads, and (ii) the high family labor component.
vi.       Estimated revenues to Government from project operations would
permit Government to maintain present producer prices up to 1977 despite
anticipated downward trends in world cotton prices and, in addition, to
finance fully extension costs and gradually decreasing fertilizer sub-
sidies. The average yield of seed cotton in the project area is estimated
to increase from 880 kg/ha in 1970 to 950 kg/ha in 1974. Other crops would
also benefit from the project, principally from the residual effect of
fertilizer applied to cotton.  The average farm net cash income is estimated
to increase from a range of CFAF 3-10,000 (US$12-40) at present to one of
CFAF 20-60,000 (US$78-234) by 1974.
vii.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$6.1 million.
1/   This includes all purchases of annual farm inputs financed by the
revolving credit fund during the credit disbursement period.



DAHOMEY
ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Dahomey Government has requested an IDA credit to help finance
further development of the production of cotton and food crops. The project
vas identified in 1967 and, at the requestof "the Government, prepared in
1970 by the Bank's Permanent Mission in Western Africa (PMWA), assisted
by the Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT)
and the Societe d'Aide Technique et de Cooperation (SATEC). Delay vas due'
to political instability. The proposed project would be the Bank Group's
second operation in agriculture in Dahomey. IDA granted a credit of US$4.6
million for oil palm and food crops development in 1969 (144-DA, Hinvi
Project). Problems are being experienced with the Hinvi Project. While
oil palm plantings have been made as planned and are well maintained, the
annual crop program is far behind schedule, and, in addition, a substantial
cost over-run has been incurred on the palm oil mill which is to be financed
under the Credit 144. The project is under close supervision, and several
changes in organization and operation are underway.
1.02      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission
composed of Messrs. K. HaasJ*Baand K. Rîngskog (IDA), M. Palein (PMWA),
J. Cantournet and R. Chatéan (consultants), whîch visited Dahomey in
January/February 1971. Messrs. Darribere and Casse (FAC) appraised the
project at the same time for possible FAC participation in its financing.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      General.  Dahomey has an area of approximately 120,000 km, broadly
divided into two ecological zones: tropical rain forest in the South includ-
ing the Zou district and savannah in the North (Borgou and Atakora districts;
see Map 1). Soils are generally poor.
2.02      Population in 1970 was about 2.8 million; it is growing at about
2.8% annually; and 50% of it is concentrated in the three southern districts
which account for only 10% of the country's total area (see Map 2). The
vast majority of the population is engaged in agriculture.
2.03      In 1970 GDP totalled CFAF 69 billion (US$250 million), equivalent
to US$80 per capita, of which agriculture contributed 40%. The Government's
poor financial position is a major constraint for development. The 1969
budget deficit reached an all time high of about CFAF 1,360 million (US$4.9
million). France, through direct budget support amnounting to about US$1.8
million per annum in recent years has been absorbing a large part of such
deficits.  Development programs have been mainly financed from foreign



sources, such as the European Development Fund (FED), the French Fonds
d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC), and IDA. Debt service payments have risen
somewhat over recent years and are estimated to have required 10% of export
earnings in 1970.
2.04      Agriculture Sector.  Over the last five years GDF has increased by
5.5% per annum.  The rate of growth in agriculture was 8% in 1969, and 5.6%
in 1970.  Agricultural products which provide about 90% of all exportes were
valued in 1969 at US$30 million equivalent, with palm products accounting
for about 31% and cotton for about 14Z (see Annex 1, Table 1). Other agri-
cultural exports include groundnuts, and cocoa smuggled from Nigeria. Annual
rice imports amount to about 7,000 tons valued at US$1 million, as compared
to national production of some 1,300 tons in 1970. Food crops, mainly
for subsistence, occupy about 66Z of the cultivated area, about 10% of the
country's total area. Maize is the main commodity - nearly 70% of cereal
production (see Annex 1, Table 2). Livestock is important in the North, but
Dahomey is a net importer of about 10,000 head of cattle annually from Niger,
mainly for urban consumption in the South.
2.05      Cotton Production.  Seed cotton production grew rapidly from 1,400
tons in 1964 to 35,000 tons in 1970. Cotton acreage has expanded consider-
ably, and production increases have been brought about by higher yielding
varieties of superior staple length and lint output 1/; improved extension
services; and efficient arrangements for providing credit and inputs to
farmers, and for purchasing, ginning and marketing the crop.
2.06      National average yields increased from 270 kg/ha in the period
1961-1964 to 815 kg/ha in 1968/69, and rose to a record level of 918 kg/ha
in 1970 (Annex 1, Table 3). Cultivation methods have reached a relatively
high level; use of insecticides is mandatory throughout the country, and in
1970 fertilizers were used on 66% of total cotton area.
2.07      Institutions.  Responsibility for agricultural development policy
and planning is shared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning -
broad policy - and the Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperation -
detailed agricultural planning. Neither Ministry has had much impact,_and
what development has occurred has been due to aid donors requiring that the
projects they finance are carried out by autonomous development agencies
within the framework of policies agreed with the two Ministries. In the
case of oil palm development, for example, the agency concerned is Dahomean,
Societe Nationale pour le Developpement Rural du Dahomey (SONADER), but even
in this case the agency has received much foreign technical assistance in
planning. In the case of cotton programs, foreign development companies
have been used, SATEC in the Zou region, and CFDT in the Borgou. Recently
Government estab'iish da national ageney, Societe Nationale Agricole pour le
Coton (SONACO) to take responsibility for cotton development (see para 6.02
and Annex 2).
1/   Allen-333 (1"-1/32" staple, 38% lint to seed cotton) in the South
(introduction in the Zou started in 1962); BJA-592 (1"-1/16" utaple,
38% lint to seed cotton) in the North (introduction in the Borgou
started in 1965).



-3-
2.08      In the absence of its own national research agency, Dahomey
contracts out its agricultural research to well established and experienced
French institutes, sharing the cost with the French Government. This system
is common to most francophone countries in the West Africa and works satis-
factorily. In the case of the project described in this report research
bajk-up would be provided by Institut de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales
et des Cultures Vivrieres (IRAT) - food crops; Institut de Recherches du
Coton et des Textiles Exotiques (IRT) - cotton; and Institut de Recherches
pour les Huiles et Oleagineux (IR}IO) - groundnuts.
2.09      Institutional credit has not been available for agricultural pro-
duction since 1963 when the Banque Dahomeene de Developpement (BDD) ceased
lending for agriculture due to poor loan recovery. SATEC and CFDT operate
heavily_supeervised credit schemes for cotton growers. -Tiése work we11t'since
seasonal farm input credits are made in kind at 8% interest and repayments
deducted mandatorily from borrovers' cotton sales proceeds. Details of
these credit operations are at Annex 3. Funds for these credit operations
are provided by Fonds Autonome de Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix des
Produits a l'Exportation (FAS) from the surpluses it accrues in its export
commodity price stabilizatfiôn activities. These activities involve fixing,
in conjunction with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning, annual
producer prices. When export proceeds exceed the sum of the producer price
and export costs, funds accrue to PAS; when proceeds are lower, FAS meets
the deficit. As shown in Annex 4, FAS operations are small in scale. The
role of FAS in cotton marketing and in the proposed project is described in
para 6.06.
2.10      There are few fully fledged cooperative societies in Dahomey; but
some 400 village groups, a form of mutual guarantee society without legal
status, aré inÏexistence and have a total of more than 13,000 members.  This
movement is most advanced in the Zou where farmers must be group members to
participate in the cotton development program. SATEC channels its cotton
credits through these groups and the recovery ratio of such credits is 100%.
In the Borgou about 25% of cotton farmers are group members.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      Location, Population and Land Tenure.  The proJect area is situated
in the Center and North, covers about 70,000 km -- 60% of the country's total
area -- and comprises the departments Zou and Borgou (see Map 2). Population
is estimated at about 840,000 in 1969.-
3.02      The project area produces the bulk of Dahomey's cotton.  0f a total
of about 85,500 farms, 29,000 now grow cotton.  Average farm family size in
the Borgou is 11 persons who cultivate, on average, 5 ha annually; and in the
Zou seven persons who cultivate 3.5 ha. Most farmers have rights of usufruct
to their land and this does not impede the adoption of improved farming
practices.



- 4 -
3.03      Climate and Soils.  Annual rainfall is about 900 mm in a single wet
season in the Borgou and about 1,300 mm in the Zou in two seasons.  The
project area covers four climatic zones ranging from a savannah-type in the
North to a tropical coastal climate in the South. Soils and climate are
suitable for cotton cultivation.
3.04      Communications.  The main road network in the project area comprises
about 1,600 km of national roads maintained by the Public Works Department
(PWD). PWD is being reorganized and equipped under an IDA-financed highway
maintenance program (IDA Credit No. 215-DA; US$3.5 million). National roads
serve the four existing ginning centers: Kandi, Savalou, Parakou and Bohicon
(see Map 3). All are linked by road to Cotonou and the two latter have rail
connections. More than 3,000 km of departmental or tertiary roads link fields
to villages, and villages to national roads. Many tertiary roads are impass-
able by trucks in the wet season. While sub-prefectures are supposed to
maintain these roads, they do little for lack of equipment and funds. About
1,000 km of these roads serve as "cotton roads", and a tertiary road improve-
ment program would be initiated under the proposed project.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project comprises increasing the area of cotton grown in the
Zou and Borgou departments by some 30,000 ha to 59,000 ha. The expansion in
area would be brought about by increasing the number of cotton growers from
29,000 at present to 41,000 in 1974, and by increasing the area under cotton
on existing farms.  The additional cotton growers would come from farmers
already in the two regions but who do not grow cotton at present. In addi-
tion to increasing cotton production, the productivity of other crops grown
in rotation with cotton would be improved through the residual effects of
fertilizers applied to the cotton. A further component of the project would
be the increase of rice production through clearing and improving water
control on some 3,300 ha of low lying land, and providing rice milling
facilities.  The project would be the final phase of a cotton development
project initiated by French technical assistance in 1963 and financed since
that time by France and the Government.  Apart from the changes in organiza-
tion described in Chapter VI, project procedures would be those proven over
the last seven years in the project area. France, through the medium of its
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) would co-finance the project.
4.02      The project would be carried out over the four-year period 1971-
1974 and its principal components would be:
(a)  staffing and equipping the recently established Societe
Nationale Agricole pour le Coton (SONACO) to administer
extension, credit and primary marketing services in the
project area;



- 5 -
(b)  establishing a revolving fund to provide cotton growers
with seasonal'credits for insecticides and fertilizers;
and medium-term credit for,_he purchase of agricultural- --
equipment;
(c)  constructing two additional ginneries in the project area
to increase annual ginning capacity from 43,000 tons 1/
of seed cotton to 67,000 tons; and providing six small rice
hullers to process 3,600 tons of paddy annually;
(d)  rehabilitating about 610 km of tertiary roads;
(e)  carrying out field trials throughout the project area to
adapt research results for practical application by project
participants; and
(f)  preparing an agricultural diversification project in
Borgou and Zou.
4.03      S0NACO would be responsible for overall administration of the
project and for handling agricultural credit funds, and would contractS ATEC
r           project operations in the Zou, and CFDT for-operations- in the
Borgou.  CFDT would supervise construction of the two ginneries.  The
teriaUIry road rëhabilitation program would be carried out by PWD with tech-
nical assistance provided under the project. IRCT would be responsible for
cotton research and cotton seed multiplication; IRAT for research on food
crops and the use of ox-drawn implements; and IRAT assisted by IRHO for
research on groundnuts. Government would engage consultants to prepare the
crop diversification project. Organizational arrangements are described in
Chapter VI.
B. Detailed Features
4.04      Staffing and Equipping SONACO.  SONACO would assume responsibility
for all cotton development work in the project area. Staff numbers would
increase from the total of 487 now employed to 555 by 1974; giving a final
and satisfactory ratio of one extension worker to 100 farmers, see Chapter VI
and Annex 5, Table 3.  After '1974 it shiouidbe possible to decrease the
number of extension workers since by that time farmers will have had 10 years
of close supervision. Three houses and offices for SONACO headquarters would
be built at Parakou; and a total of 62 stores, two offices and 13 senior
staff houses in the Zou and Borgou, see Annex 5, Table 2. Vehicles would be
purchased in line with the needs of project activities and it is estimated
that 92 new and replacement vehicles would be required.
4.05      Credit Fund.  Details of seasonal and medium-term credit require-
ments are given in Annex 5, Table 5.  An amount of CFAF 737 million (US$2.88
million) woldJ be- ednee-  Lfinance the revolving credit fund.
1/   After completion of CFDT's expansion program; see Annex 6, para 2.

4.06      Ginneries.  Project area cotton is now ginned at four ginneries
at Parakou, Kandi, Bohicon and Savalou (see Map 2) with a total capacity of
36,000 tons. CFDT is expanding capacity at existing plants by 7,000 tons.
To process further incremental project production two new Government-own'ed
ginneries would be constructed: an 18,000-ton capacity plant in Glazoue ir:
1472, and a 6,000-ton capacity plant at Banikoara in 1973. This shoul?a
provide adequate ginning capacity until 1976/1977. Annex 6 gives dsta1is
of the present ginning situation, and the justification for locatjcuad
capacities of the ginneries to be constructed. Assurances were obt.-î--
during negotiations that planning, design, and supervision of the coc, Lr-ictico(t
of the ginneries would be the responsibility of CFDT.
4.07      Rice Hullers.  At present m»st paddy is hulled by pestle and1  o
This is excessively labor consuming and produces very low quality ric- due
to the high percentage of broken grain. To hull project production sIx
rice hullers with a capacity of 800 kg of paddy per hour each would be opera-
ted under CFDT's supervision. These should provide adequate milling cap:^cîty
until 1975. Details of the rice program are given in Annex 7.
4.08      Rehabilitation of Tertiary Roads.  The road improvement program
would involve about 610 km of roads used for cotton evacuation and would
entail grading and reshaping, improvement of drainage, and where necessary,
improving sections by regraveling, building culverts and fords, and other
auxiliary works. Road works would be carried out by PWD which would establish
and maintain, under the authority of its Director, a Special Unit for this
purpose. The Special Unit would recruit under terms of reference and con-
ditions acceptable to IDA, two highway technicians who would be responsible
for planning and supervising the road works and coordinating with SONACO.
The project would provide supplemental equipment for use by PWD. The feeder
road improvement program is described in detail in Annex 8. During nego-
tiations assurances were obtained that during the development period a
program of road improvement to be carried out by PWD would be agreed annually
by SONACO and IDA, and that the project area roads would be adequately main-
tained.
4.09      Applied Research.  The research program would include trials on
the efficiency and economy of cotton pest control; improved research on maize,
rice, and groundnuts, and tests on the impact of ox-drawn implements on farm-
ing systems.  Further details of the research program and of IRCT and IRAT
are given in Annex 9. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
research programs would be reviewed annually with IDA.
4.10      Preparation of Crop Diversification Project.  By the end of the
1974 season the potential for cotton development in the Zou will be exhausted.
Further development in the department will thus depend upon identifying other
viable agricultural projects - cattle, rice and maize production appear to
lend themselves to improvement. Consequently, international consultants,
satisfactory to IDA, would be employed to identify, establish the viability
of, and prepare a crop diversification project for the Zou, and in addition



for the Borgou which would benefit greatly from the diversification of its
cash crop production. Assurances to these effects were obtained during
negotiations.
C. Field Operations
4.11      Extension Methods.  Extension methods used would be those already
proven in Dahomey. Since all cotton farmers are required by law to use
insecticides, this is considered to be Development Stage 1. Extension is
aimed at inducing growers to move through three more stages of progressively
increasing production intensity:
Stage 2 - using fertilizers in addition to insecticides;
Stage 3 - growing cotton in blocks and observing crop rotations; and
Stage 4 - using animal drawn farm implements.
Each stage results in higher cotton production, and the residual effect of
cotton fertilizers increases the yields of the crop following cotton in the
rotation. Consequently, areas planted to food crops decline and land freed
is then planted to cotton and other cash crops. Details of crop rotations
and the use of inputs are given in Annex 7. Project extension workers would
also provide advice and services for both food and cash crops. In the Zou
all farmers use fertilizers and most are in Stage 3; since the bulk of cotton
cultivation is in closely supervised blocks, all new farmers in the Zou would
start off in this Stage. However, due to tse-tse incidence and lack of
knowledge of Zou farmers of animal husbandry few, if any would move to Stage
4. In the case of the Borgou where cattle cultivation is used, but where
block farming is practiced to a lesser extent than in the Zou it is estimated
that no participants would remain in Stage 1 at the end of the project devel-
opment period; and that about 74% would be in Stage 2; 16% in Stage 3 and 10%
would use ox-drawn implements -- Stage 4.  Farm models for the various
ecological zones are given in Annex 10.
4.12      Seed Supplies.  Cotton seed would be distributed free to farmers
and the cost recovered in fixing producer prices. Annex 11 describes the
seed multiplication process in detail. In the absence of improved varieties
durirg the project development period, most farmers would use their own
groundnut and maize seed. IRAT would be responsible for the supply of rice
seed, with SONACO coordinating seed multiplication and supply activities.
4.13      Fertilizers.  Project farmers would use a single annual application
of 150 kg/ha NPS 20-25-12 compound fertilizer, costing about CFAF 5,000.
4.14      Pesticides.  In the North at least five, and in the South at least
six annual sprays would be applied with hand-operated knapsack sprayers.
In both regions annual spraying programs are organized by CFDT which provides
sprayers and insecticides (sprayers are owned by Government and both sprayers



- 8 -
and insecticides are financed by FAS, see para 2.09; under the project SONACO
would take over ownership of the sprayers); and cotton farmers do the spray-
ing under supervision of extension agents. Currently a DDT-Endrin mixture
is used, costing about CFAF 1,000/ha per spray. Both DDT and Endrin are "hard"
insecticides, but they are cheap and efficient. During the project develop-
ment period trials would be made with less persistent and dangerous insec-
ticides (Endosulfan-Methylparathion) and research would continue to seek
improved and economic methods of pest control (see para 4.09).
D. Credit Arrangements and Supply of Inputs
4.15      Seasonal Credit.  In the Borgou a fixed amount per kg of seed cottoii
produced is deducted from growers' sales proceeds to pay for pest control.
This system penalizes good farmers since the costs of spraying per ha are the
saie, and the higher the yield the more the farmer pays.  When suitable
arrangements can be made, the costs of spraying would be charged on the basis
of actual costs incurred on the pesticides as is now the practice in the Zou.
Seasonal credit facilities for fertilizers would be extended to all project
participants.
4.16      Medium Term Credit.  Basic qualifications for obtaining medium term
credit for farm implements would be that the farmer grows cotton and owns a
pair of oxen. SONACO would manage a revolving fund adequate to meet all
"projected seasonal and medium term credit needs.  Details are given in
Annex 5, Table 5.
4.17      Appraisal Procedures.  All project participants would be obliged
to use cotton insecticides and would be eligible automatically for such
credit. Applications for fertilizer and medium term credit would be appraised
by the local extension worker or Village Group, and final approval would
rest with SONACO's Sector Chief. Criteria considered would be the farmer's
general standing in the community and his technical capability.
4.18      Interest Rates and Terms of Loans.  A commission of 5% on the
value of fertilizer and insecticides supplied on credit would be charged.
Taking into account a repayment period of about eight months, this is equiv-
alent to an annual interest rate of about 8%. Medium term loans would be
repayable vithin either two years (individual farmers) or three years
(members of Village Groups), and beneficiaries would be required to make
down payments of 33.3% and 25% respectively of the value of materials
supplied. The interest rate would be 8%. In addition Village Groups would
charge a fee of CFAF 600 for each loan; these fees would be credited to the
group's loan guarantee fund.
4.19      Credit Recovery.  On behalf of SONACO CFDT (Borgou) and SATEC (Zou)
would keep individual farmer loan records, and in the Borgou repayments would
be deducted from farmers' cotton sales proceeds. In the Zou Village Groups



would be responsible as nov for loan repayments of their members. It would
be necessary for farmers in both departments to sell their cotton to CFDT;
in practice there is no alternative market. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that, unless IDA agreed to their modification, the above
credit appraisal, issue and recovery arrangements would be employed by SONACO,
and that SONACO would charge 12% interest on repayments overdue and recover
equipment financed once repayments are 12 months overdue.
4.20      Supply of Inputs and Equipment.  Farm equipment, fertilizers and
insecticides would be procured by SONACO on the basis of estimates prepared
by CFDT and SATEC.  Inputs would be stocked at district stores from where
they would be issued to farmers by CFDT and SATEC on behalf of SONACO.
E. Development Schedule
4.21      The cotton area is estimated to increase from 29,000 ha in 1970
to 59,000 ha in 1974; rice from 1,000 ha to 3,900 ha; maize from 24,000 ha
to 34,000 ha; and groundnuts from 13,100 ha to 19,700 ha. The new Glazoue
ginnery would start operation in 1972; the Banikoara ginnery in 1973, and
final project ginning capacity would be 67,000 tons of seed cotton annually.
Five rice mills would be installed in 1972 and one in 1973, and final hulling
capacity would be 3,600 tons of paddy.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
A. Project Costs
5.01      Project cost estimates and their foreign exchange component are
shown in the following table and are elaborated further in Annex 5, Table 1.
Project costs are based on recent experience in Dahomey and include
provisions for price escalation equivalent to 5% compounded per annum on
agricultural extension, processing plants and research costs; and 10%
compounded per annum for road construction; physical contingencies of 5%
on the total costs of buildings, ginnery construction, and road construction.
All costs include duties and taxes with the exception of ginnery installa-
tions, rice hullers, inputs and farm implements and vehicles which Govern-
ment would exempt from import duties. Confirmation to this effect was
obtained during negotiations. Project costs include salaries and allowances
of all staff engaged in the project, staff training coats, SATEC and CFDT
fees and project operating costs for the project period 1971-74.

B. Financial Arrangements
5.02      It is proposed that IDA should make a credit of US$6.1 million.
Since the project would be carried out in the period 1971 through 1974 with
FAC and the Government meeting 1971 costa, the IDA credit would meet 48% of
total project coste and be equivalent to 80% of the project's foreign exchange
cost of US$7.6 million. FAC would finance 24.5Z of project costs and Govern-
ment, largely from project gen-ratedfunds, 27.5%.  During the disbursement
periods, when the Government has to provide CFAF 895 million, it is estimated
that the project will earn CFAF 929 million for the Government. FAC's con-
tributiQn of CFAF 795 million (US$3.1 million) would be a grant to the
Governmnnt of_which CFAF 289 million (US$1.04 million) would be applied to
meet the bulk of project costs in llU. Details of the proposed financing
are set out below and in more detail in Annex 12.

5.03      The proposed IDA credit would be made on standard terms to the Gov-
ernment of Dahomey. The Government would apply proceeds of the credit to-
gether with its own and FAC's contribution as follows:
(a)  to the Ministr: of Rural Development and Cooperation
(M)  CFAF 405 million (US$1.6 million) for construction
and equipment of the proposed ginneries and rice hullers;



- 12 -
(ii) CFAF 172.6 million (US$0.7 million) to meet costs of
applied research in the project area;
(iii) CFAF 15 million (US$59,000) to meet costs of the
feasibility study for a diversification project;
(iv) CFAF 736.6 million (US$2.9 million) to be used for
establishing a revolving fund for seasonal and medium
term credits, of which-CFAF 658.6 million for seasonal
credits made in kind; and CFAF 78 million for medium
term loans for equipment; and
(v)  CFAF 1,508.5 million (US$6.0 million) to meet SONACO
investment costs and its project extension salaries
and operating costs.
(b)  to the Ministry in charge of Public Works, CFAF 178.8
million (US$0.7 million) to meet the costs of the feeder
road rehabilitation program.
5.04      Funds required for the feeder road rehabilitation program would
be made available to the Ministry in charge of Public Works, and for SONACO
operations to the Ministry of Rural Development quarterly and in advance.
Allocations would be based on estimates prepared by CFDT and SATEC and
approved by SONACO and IDA, and the Ministry of Rural Development would
establish a project account with a banking institution satisfactory to IDA,
from which SONACO would be authorized to draw.
5.05      Cotton Fertilizer Subsidies.  Farmers now benefit from subsidies on
cotton fertilizer, but during the development period prices paid for ferti-
lizers by farmers would be increased progressively from CFAF 20/kg in 1971 to
CFAF 25/kg by 1974, and further increases to CFAF 35/kg by 1977 are assumed.
Actual 1970 fertilizer costs were CFAF 30/kg in the South and CFAF 35/kg in
the North (see Annex 7, para 5). Up to now and for 1971 fertilizer subsidies
have been financed by FED. FED has discontinued its subsidy policy, but
Government would be able to finance the new levels of subsidies proposed at
least up to 1980, through the margin earned by Government on its cotton in-
dustry operations; (see Annex 18, Table 1). A sharp increase in fertilizer
prices to farmers is undesirable since it could cause a drop in fertilizer
use and a commensurate decline in cotton production. Consequently, it is
proposed that subsidy arrangements should continue, albeit at a progressively
declining level. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the cotton
fertilizer subsidies would be reviewed annually with IDA in the light of
farmers' financial results with the objective of their elimination by 1981.
C. Procurement and Disbursement
5.06      Procurement of fertilizers, insecticides, sprayers, farm equip-
ment, corrugated steel culverts, vehicles, ginneries and rice hullers (total-
ling about US$8.0 million) 1/ would be by international competitive bidding.
1/   This includes all purchases of annual farm inputs financed by the
revolving credit fund during the credit disbursement period.



- 13 -
Tenders for the construction of stores, houses and offices, valued at about
US$0.3 million, would be let locally since the individual contracts (which
probably would not exceed US$15,000) would be too small to justify seeking
bids from outside Dahomey. Other goods (furniture and office equipment)
valued at about ?JS$45,000 and for which there is a satisfactory degree of
local competition, would be procured according to procedures for local
procurement agreed with IDA.
5.07      Disbursement of the proposed credit would be made against:
(a)  100% of the CIF Cotonou costs of goods directly imported for
the project such as ginnery equipment and rice hullers, cor-
rugated steel pipes and vehicles, estimated at US$1.1 million;
(b)  90% of the cost of office equipment and furniture, building
and road construction, applied research, and the feasibility
study, about US$2.Omillion; and
(c)  100% of the CIF Cotonou costs of fertilizers, insecticides,
and agricultural equipment, to be purchased before December
31, 1972 and 15% in each of the following years, about
US$2.6 million.
US$400,000 would be unallocated. Disbursement of the credit would be made
against import documents and appropriate records certified by SONACO, the
Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry in charge of Public Works,
and endorsed by the Ministry of Finance. A detailed disbursement schedule
appears in Annex 12.
5.08      It is recommended that any surplus funds remaining in the credit
account by the closing date should be cancelled.
D. Accounts and Audits
5.09      The Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperation and the Ministry
in charge of Public Works would keep separate accounts for their transactions
financed under the project.  SONACO would keep its own general accounts, and
a special account covering the agricultural credit fund including interest
income and which, except as IDA othervise agrees, would be,used exclusively
for SONÀCO's credit operations.  Ministerial accounts would be audited by
the Controleurs d'Etat who are directly responsible to the President of
Dahomey; and SONACO accounts would be audited by independent auditors accept-
able to IDA. FAS cotton accounts would also be audited by the Controleurs
d'Etat (see paras s    and7.05''  During negotiations assurances were
obtained that audited annual reports would be submitted to IDA not later
than four months after close of each financial year and that audit arrange-
ments would be acceptable to IDA.

VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Entities
6.01   ~Government is anxious to play a more direct part in cotton prcduc-
tiojuand processing than it has in the past.  Up to now these operations
have been handled almost solely by CFDT. On its side, CFDT is equally con-
cerned to demonstrate that it is neithr dominating nor making excessive
profits from the cotton industry. For the preceding reasons two major changes
in the industry's organization have been initiated. First, with the encour-
agementof--o FDT- -Societe Nationale Agricole pour le Coton (SONACO) has- been
created to organize cotton production, and second, Government and CFDT will
enter into a joint venture (the-Venture) for processing and marketing cotton.
These changes are exp-ectd to improve relations between Government and CFDT
without impairing the efficiency of Dahomey's cotton development program.
6.02      SONACO is an autonomous Government corporation responsible to the
Minister of Rural Development and Cooperation, and was established in 1971
(see Annex 2). Its objectives are to prepare and exe-cute cotton development
programs including other crops cultivated by cotton growers. The SONACO
Board comprises ten Government appointed members, and its Chairman is
nominated by the Minister of Rural Development and Cooperation and appointed
by the Council of Ministers. Key SONACO staff are its General Manager,
Deputy General Manager and Financial Manager. CFDT has been asked to
provide the Financial Manager and to assist in setting up SONACO.  A
condition of effectiveness is that the three key posts have been filled
by persons with experience and qualifications satisfactory to IDA. During
negotiations assurances were obtained that CFDT would be employed to help
set up the corporation's accounting system. It is not expected that
SONACO would make enough profits to meet its commitments; consequently it
would require annual subventions from Government for its operations, see
paras 5.04 and 6.06.
6.03      SONACO would, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, be
engaged by the Government to administer the Zou and Borgou cotton programs
and to provide extension, credit and primary marketing services. SONACO
would contract SATEC (Zou) and CFDT (Borgou)_to manage thep npram&- at the
departmental level. Such contracts are essential since without this
assistance, SONACO would be unable to mobilize the expertise to carry out
its programs. As SONACO gains experience and more Dahomean staff are trained,
it should be able to reduce its dependence on overseas technical assistance.
At the senior personnel level CFDT would provide a Chief of Operations, a
rice specialist, a technical adviser, and two training officers for the
Borgou; and SATEC a Chief of Operations, an administrative officer, three
training officers and an applied research specialist for the Zou. Signature
of a management contract between Government and SONACO, and service jontracts
between SONA Urand CFD'T and SATEC, satisfactory to I-A is a condition of
effectiveness of the credit. CFDT would not be precluded from sub-contracting



- 15 -
part of its obligations to agencies such as Compagnie Internationale de
Developpement Rural (CIDR), which now provides services in the Borgou area;
during negotiations assurances were obtained that such sub-contracts would
be entered into only with the approval of IDA.
6.04      The Venture between Government and CFDT would consist of a
Mandat de Gesti`oncov`ering an Association in Participation partnership agree-
ment which would require CFDT to put at the disposal of the Venture all of
its industrial and commercial installations in Dahomey; and Government to
put at the Venture's disposal its ginnery at Parakou and the two new ginneries
that would be constructed under the project. The Venture would be managed
by CFDT which would be responsible for collecting seed'-ottaoÎn fro'm''bùying -
stat àns at prices fixed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, see para 2.09.
After ginning, cotton lint and seed would be exported and sold by CFDT.
PrQfits, or losses, from these operations would be divided - 80% to Government,
and 20% to CFDT except for losses which would be attributable to the Govern-
ment excessive producer prices) or to CFDT (negligence). CFDT's liability
would be limited to the extent of its reserve account plus CFAF 5 million.
CFDT -would be required to invest the balance of its profits in Dahomey, but
it would also be paid 2% of the value of lint exported, and CFAF 2,000 per
ton of cotton seed sold, and such funds would be repatriable.  These arrange-
ments are basically similar to those made by CFDT and the Governments in
Cameroon and Upper Volta where they work satisfactorily; they differ in
that in the latter countries CFDT is not required to share in losses.
6.05      Annex 15 contains draft agreements between Government and CFDT for
the Venture. Signature of agreements satisfactory to IDA, setting up the
-'Venture would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
6.06      Under the old arrangements CFDT received a fee of CFAF 18,000 for
each ton of lint processed, and CFAF 3,100 for each ton of seed exported.
Government revenues from cotton were the surpluses accruing to Fonds
Autonome de Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix des Produits a l'Exportation
(FAS) in its producer and export price fixing operations, para 2.09. Gov-
ernment would from its share of Venture profits finance SONACO operations
(see para 7.08) and FAS producer price stabilization fund. Whenever the
balance of this fund would be below CFAF 500 million an amount of CFAF 100
million out of Government's annual profit share would be allocated to the
price stabilization account and the remainder would, to the extent necessary,
be available to finance extension services in the project area. The payment
of Venture profits to the Government was confirmed during negotiations, and
would be incorporated in the legislation creating the Venture which would be
subject to IDA_appoval.- Experience in Upper Volta indicates that with the
Venture, Government will obtain higher revenues from cotton exports than
under past arrangements. FAS management is weak, and its accounting system
is particularly so. A condition of effectiveness would be the implementation
by Government of a plan satisfactory to IDA for strengthening FAS management
and accounting procedures.



- 16 -
6.07      The Venture would take over cotton seed exports from the
Government's Office de Commercialisation Agricole du Dahomey (OCAD). OCAD
is an unnecessary component of the industry and is not especially efficient,
gee para 7.04. This change, which was confirmed during negotiations, would
be effected in the Venture's statutes.
6.08      In managing the Venture CFDT would be responsible to a committee
comprising three members appointed by Government and three by CFDT, and
Government would have the right to check all costs incurred by the Venture.
6.09      For the research program SONACO would engage IRCT, IRAT and IRHO
to carry out trials financed under the project, under contracts satisfactory
to IDA.
B. Staffing and Training
6.10      Annex 5, Table 3 gives project staff requirements at district and
headquarter level. While an additional 40 extension workers would be needed
for the Zou, no additional workers are needed in the Borgou where present
numbers are adequate. The qualifications of these staff would be literacy
and successful completion of in-service training under SATEC. 20 profession-
al agricultural staff would be recruited including specialists in rice
cultivation, applied research and training, as well as the three key SONACO
staff members and their support personnel.
6.11      CFDT and SATEC should have no difficulty in recruiting and train-
ing personnel. Most staff at levels above that of Sector Head would be em-
ployed directly by CFDT and SATEC, while lower level staff now mainly em-
ployed by the Ministry of Rural Development would be transferred to SONACO
and seconded to CFDT and SATEC to whom they would be fully responsible.
6.12      There is a shortage of Dahomean staff capable of filling key posts
at the level of Sector Head and above. It is expected that by 1972 19 or
48% of these posts will still be filled by expatriates, but in-service
training of Dahomean personnel during the project development period should
permit the replacement of 14 expatriates by 1975. Under present arrangements
counterparts to expatriate key personnel are not responsible to the expatri-
ates and tend to make a very small contribution. The proposed replacement
of expatriate staff by local staff makes it necessary that local staff fill
operational positions in a single chain of command and that responsibilities
be clearly defined at all times. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that Government would not appoint counterparts but deputies to
expatriates filling key posts and that there would, at all times and at
every level, be a single person in command.

VII. YIELDS AND PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FARMERS'
BENEFITS AND GOVERNMENT REVENUES
A. Yields and Production
7.01      Cotton.  The national average cotton yield increased from 270 kg/ha
in the period 1961-1964, to 600 kg/ha in 1965-1967 and 825 kg/ha in 1968-
1970 1/. The national average 1970 yield 2/ was 918 kg/ha, and 880 kg/ha in
the project area which has been and continues to be subject to intensive ex-
tension activity. By the end of the project development period the average
yield in the project area is estimated to increase to 950 kg/ha and total
production to about 56,000 tons compared with about 25,000 tons in 1970.
This is believed to be realistic and is based on the yield analysis shown
in Annex 7. IRCT and IRAT have obtained yields exceeding 1,700 kg/ha and in
the Kandi area farmers have obtained an average of 1,350 kg/ha.
7.02      Other Crops.  The average yield of other crops which would bene-
fit from residual effects of using fertilizer on cotton and improved crop
rotation, are given in Annex 7, Table 2. All these crops would financially
be less attractive than cotton, but, except for rice in the Borgou area,
would be an essential part of crop rotations. In the economic analysis of
the project no account is taken of the value of the project induced production
increases for these crops.
B. Narkets and Prices
7.03      Cotton.  All project cotton would be purchased by CFDT on behalf of
the Venture; and after processing lint would be exported, as in the past main-
ly to Europe, and cotton seed to Japan. Dahomey now produces about 0.12% of
total world supplies, and it is estimated that by 1975 this percentage would
amount to 0.27%; this should neither create marketing difficulties nor have
a significant impact on world prices. The International Cotton Advisory
Committee (ICAC) has been informed of the project, but has proferred no
comments.
7.04      Export prices used in project calculations are those forecast by
the Bank's Economics Department and are:  lint, African 1" - 1/32" CIF
Liverpool falling from 30 USe/lb equivalent in 1971/72 to 26 USA/lb in
1974/75, thereafter remaining constant; and seed, a constant price of US$108/m
ton CIF Osaka. See Annex 17, Table 4. The seed price is rather higher than
those obtained by OCAD in 1969 and 1970, but the latter prices reflect OCAD's
inefficiency, since CFDT obtained an average of about US$100/ton for its
seed exports from other African countries in 1970.
1/   Cotton is sown in June, harvested between November and Jmnuary and
ginned between November and April.
2/   The average 1970 yields in neighboring countries were: 817 kg/ha in
Ivory Coast and 975 kg/ha in Togo.



- 18 -
7.05      Producer Prices for Cotton.  Producer prices for cotton have been
almost constant in recent years but different price levels are maintained
for North Borgou, South Borgou and Zou, reflecting transport distances,
giving an average producer price of CFAF 33.71/kg. Price support has not
been necessary in recent years, and despite anticipated falls in world
market prices, Government, if it maintained present producer prices, would
accumulate in the FAS cotton account surpluses estimated to amount to
CFAF 600 million by 1977 after meeting full cotton extension and fertilizer
subsidy costs from the account, see Annex 18. However, Government would have
to support or reduce prices by 1978. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that FAS would maintain separate cotton accounts to be audited by
the Controleurs d'Etat under existing Government auditing arrangements;
that producer prices would be fixed annually in consultation with IDA; with
a view to ensuring recovery of capital and a reasonable profit to the venture,
taking one year with another; and that prices would be such as to maintain
FAS cotton accounts on a sound financial basis.
7.06      Other Crops.  The producer price for groundnuts is fixed annually
by Government and was increased in 1970 from CFAF 14/kg to CFAF 16/kg unshelled
to better reflect world prices (CFAF 28/kg FOR in 1970) and to revive farmers'
waning interest in this crop. Under the project SONACO would organize mar-
keting services to assist OCAD in buying groundnuts for export. On average,
Dahomey exports about 15% of its 50,000 ton annual groundnut production, and
the project would make an additional 5,000 tons of unshelled groundnuts avail-
able for export. It is assumed that farmers would sell their other surplus
commodities in local markets. The present producer price of CFAF 20/kg of
paddy would be retained for delivery made at SONACO's rice hullers and SONACO
would sell clean rice to wholesalers.
C. Farmers' Benefits
7.07      Farm budgets for typical farms at different stages of cotton produc-
tion intensity and in different ecological zones are given in Annex 10. Far-
mers who do not grow cotton now earn a net cash income of about CFAF 3,000-
6,000 (US$12-24) in addition to subsistence from the average farm of about
5 ha in the Borgou, and about CFAF 10,000 (US$40) from the 3.5 ha farm
typical of the Zou.  A Borgou farmer by growing cotton and reaching Stage 2
production intensity would be able to increase his cash income to between
CFAF 20,000 (US$80) and CFAF 25,000 (US$100) and still produce his subsistence
needs. By moving to Stage 3 his income range would increase to between
CFAF 34,000 (US$136) and CPAF 47,000 (US$190), and if he took up cattle cul-
tivation, he could increase this to between CFAF 61,000 (US$244) and CFAF 95,000
(US$380). It is estimated that by 1974 all Borgou farmers would be in
Stages 2, 3, and 4: 74%, 16% and 10Z, respectively. All Zou farmers would
start cotton growing at Stage 3 and their net cash incomes would range from
CFAF 15,000 (US$60) to CFAF 30,000 (US$120). Total annual net cash returns
on the project are estimated to increase from CFAF 580 mmillion in 1970 to
CFAF 1,570 million by 1975.



- 19 -
D. Impact of Project on Government Revenues and Expenditures
7.08      Annex 18 contains estimates of Government revenues and expenditures
incurred in carrying out the project. Project farmers pay a small per capita
tax of CFAF 1,600 for each adult family member but do not pay income taxes.
Consequently, Government revenues accruing directly from the project would
consist only of taxes on cotton lint and seed exports. These, estimated to be
CFAF 88 million (US$0.4 million) annually at full development, would be in-
adequate to cover the costs of extension services in the project area, either
in the development period or thereafter. It is in view of this and Dahomey's
financial situation that the assurances described in para 6.06 were sought,
i.e. that the Government from its share in venture profits would provide the
funds to meet SONAOO costs incurred in continuing cotton development after
the IDA credit disbursement period.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The major benefit of the project would be the expansion of cotton
production in Dahomey and generation of substantial foreign exchange from
cotton lint and seed exports. The economic rate of return on the project
is estimated at about 34%; see Annex 17. The calculation assumes that the
full costs of agricultural extension services are charged to the project
during its 10-year life. Other impcrtant assumptions are:
(a)  a price for lint of USJ30 CIF Liverpool per lb
ton in 1972, decreasing to US426 as from 1975;
(b)  a price for cotton seed of US$108 CIF Japan per metric
ton, remaining constant during the life of the project;
and
(c)  the opportunïty cost of farm family labor is zero since
there is no alternative economic use for such labor, even
at peak periods.
Even if the benefits were 10% lower, the rate of return on the project would
still be 19%. These are high returns because of (i) previous sunk investments
made by the Government with french assistance,, particu-arly in extension
services, processing facilities and roads, and (ii) the high labor component.
8.02      As mentioned in para 8.01 the project involves foreign exchange
earnings from tl.;e  £>c:t of proiect iîu-iced cotton production.  Based on the
above price assumptions for cotton expo: s, the present worth of the net
foreign exchange benefits over the life of the project would amount to US$28
million at a discount rate of 9%. Reliable information on the opportunity



- 20 -
cost for capital in Dahomey is not availF74e and the rate of 9% which is
considered to be a reasonable rate for Dahomey has been used since this is
the generally established Dpportunity cost  . >eighboring countries.  When
this is compared with the local costs of the project, also discounted at
9%, the effective exchange rate for the ore&ect is equal to CFAF 151 per US$
which is substantially more favorable than the current rate of CFAF 256 per
US$.  Annex 17, Table 5 shows the calculat Lon of foreign exchange benefits.
8.03      The project would enable some 12,000 farm famillies to take up
cotton growing and assist several thousands more to expand their cotton
pLantings.  By the end of the project development period, 1975, the average
per capita income of the project beneficiaries is estimated to reach US$25-50
depending on cultivation techniques used, compared to US$17-27 at present.
SLnce the per capita GNP in Dahomey is currently about US$86 and may reach
US$90 by 1975, the project would not only assist a very poor section of
the population, but would also make some contribution to a more equal income
distribution.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
9.01      During negotiations assurances were be obtained that:
(a)  planning, design, and supervision of the constructtion of
the ginneries to be financed under the project would be

(i) CFDT would be employed to help set up SONACO's accounting
system (para 6.02);
(j) sub-contracts between CFDT and SATEC and other development
agencies should be entered into only with the approval of

operations and FAS' cotton producer price stabilization
fund (para 6.06);
(1) CFDT, on behaif of the Venture, would take over cotton
seed exports from OCAD (para 6.07);
(m) SONACO would engage IRCT, IRAT and IRHO to carry out
research in the project area under agreements satisfactory
to IDA, and research programs would be reviewed annually
with IDA (para 4.09 and 6.09);
(n) Government would abolish counterparts positions and local
staff would fill operational positions in a single chain
of command (see para 6.12); and
(o) FAS would maintain separate cotton accounts to be audited
1;7the Controleurs d'Etat and to be used to stabilize
cotton prices only; producer prices would be fixed
annually in consultation with IDA, and prices would be
such as to maintain the FAS cotton account on a sound
financial basis (paras 6.06 and 7.05).
9.02      Conditions of effectiveness are:
(a) appointment to the SONACO posts of General Manager,
Deputy General Manager and Financial Manager of persons



- 22 -
whose experience and qualifications are acceptable to
IDA (para 6.02);

contracts with CFDT and SATEC satisfactory to IDA (para
6.03);
(c)  signature of agreements setting up the Venture between
Government and CFDT for ginning and marketing cotton lint
and seed, satisfactory to IDA (para 6.05); and
(d) implementation of a plan for strengthening FAS management
and accounting procedures (para 6.06).
9.03      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$6.1 million on
standard terms.

ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
SOCIETE NATIONALE AGRICOLE POUR LE COTON (SONACO)
Constitution
1.        SONACO was created in late 1971 as an autonomous Government Corpora-
tion and its statutes were approved by IDA.
Objectives
2.        SONACO's main objectives are to prepare and execute cotton
development programs, which would include other crops cultivated by cotton
growers, and to provide cotton growers with extension services and primary
marketing facilities. SONACO is also empowered to distribute farm inputs
and implements and handle agricultural credit operations. It can act
directly or through specialized agencies. It is established for 99 years
and is responsible to the Minister of Rural Development and Co-operation;
headquarters are at Parakou.
3.        Although SONACO's competence covers the whole territory of Dahomey,
its field of activity during the project development period are limited
to the Zou--an= Borgou_"departments".
Capital
4.        SONACO's initial capital is composed of fixed assets and
CFAF 10 million both of which have been donated by the Goverament. Modifi-
cations in capital structure require approval by the Council of Ministers
on the basis of proposals made by SONACO's Board of Directors.
Administration and Management
5.        SONACO is administered by a Board of ten members representing
various ministries, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, SONADER, and
SONACO's personnel.  Its President is nominated from among the members on
the recommendation of the Minister of Rural Development and, as are the other
members, appointed by decree of the Council of Ministers. Board meetings
are held at least twice a year and are attended by SONACO's Director
General, the auditors (Commissaires aux Comptes) and the State Controller
(Controleur d'Etat) in a consultative quality.
6.        The Director General has the power to act on behalf of SONACO
except in the sale of buildings and other fixed assets, in the mortgage
of such buildings and assets, or in negotiating loans.  Government retains
such powers.  The Director General has full authority in personnel matters



ANNEX 2
Page 2
with the exception of management staff for whicn Board approval is required
for employment, salary scales, and dismissal.
7.        During the project development period SONACO's management staff
would consist of the Director General, the Deputy Director General and the
Financial Director.
Accounting
8.        SONACO's fiscal year is from July 1 to June 30.  The Director
General submits annually, not later than one month after the opening of
the fiscal year, forecast financial statements to the Council of
Ministers; and not later than two months after close of the fiscal year,
an inventory, balance sheet and profit and loss accounts to the two
auditors (Commissaires aux Comptes) appointed by decree of the Council of
Ministers on recommendation of the Minister of Finance. Accounts are
audited at least once a year, and are also examined by the State Controller.
All accounts have to be approved by the Board and the Government. SONACO
is subject to all economic and financial controls provided for by current
laws. From the revenues of the corporation, after all charges and provisions
for depreciation have been met, 5% is allocated to a reserve fund until
this fund reaches an amount equal to 10% of the corporation's capital; and
10% to a special reserve fund until this fund has reached an amount equal
to 10% of the highest turnover achieved by the corporation in any one year.
Of the remainder of the net profit, 60% is allocated to the investment
account and 40% to the operation account.

ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
ACRICULTURAL CREDIT
A. General
Background
1.        The Banque Dahomeenne de Developpement (BDD), established in 1955
to provide agricultural and other credit facilities, has a record of poor
performance and requires a thorough reorganization if it is to resume lending
operations for agriculture which virtually ceased in 1963. In the absence
of any other official agricultural lending institution, Fonds Autonome-
de Stabtlisation-et de Soutien des Prix des Produits a l'Exportation (FAS;
see Annex 4) makes seasonal loans for cotton inputs to individual farmers,
Village Groups and cooperatives, through development agencies, in the frame-
work of these organizations' production programs. Official medium ternm
credit for the purchase of oxdrawn implements is not available (see para 3).
Sources of Funds
2.        Short Term Credit.  FAS resources for short term credit for cotton
fertilizers and insecticides consist now of:
-    FED funds for subsidizing cotton fertilizer prices (under these
arrangements farmers pay only CFAF 20/kg as against a full
price of CFAF 30-35/kg);
-    credits made by fertilizers manufacturers for 360 days at
interest rates equivalent to the BCEAO discount rate of 3.5%;
and
FAS funds accumulated in the course of its price stabilization
activities.
FAS funds are often short, and because of this CFDT pre-finances payments
to suppliers. Total 1971 requirements for fertilizers and insecticides amounted
to CFAF 440 million.
3.        Medium Term Credit.  Medium term credit for the purchase of ox-
drawn plows, ridgers and carts is at present available on a very limited
scale only to farmers in the Borgou who participate in an UNDP/FAO livestock
program. The program started in 1965 and is carried out with the assistance



ANNEX 3
Page 2
of Compagnie Internationale de Developpement Rural (CIDR). Contributions
from European charitable institutions to the amount of CFAF 5 million, and a
BDD loan of CFAF 2 million repayable over five years, have permitted CIDUR to
establish a revolving credit fund out of which the purchase of some 600
ox-drawn units has been financed. Recovery of loans made to farmers has
averaged 98%, and including profits made on lending activities the revolving
fund amounted to about CFAF 10 million in 1970.
B. Project Credit Arrangements
Revolving Credit Fund
4.        Under the project a revolving credit fund would be established to
provide cotton growers in the project area with seasonal credits for fertili-
zers, and insecticides; and medium term credit for the purchase of farm
implements. SONACO would, on behalf of the Government, operate this
revolving fund and be responsible for procuring and distributing inputs to
project farmers on the basis of estimates prepared with the assistance of
CFDT and SATEC. Procurement would be on the basis of international competitive
bidding.
Lending Policies and Procedures
5.        Eligibility.  All cotton farmers in Dahomey are eligible for short
term credit for pest control, and correct pest control is mandatory under
Decree No. 70-315 of December 5, 1970. All cotton farmers in the Zou are
eligible for fertilizer loans; in the Borgou, criteria are the farmer's
general standing in the community and his technical capability. Medium
term credit would be granted mainly to members of Village Groups but also
individual farmers who have performed well would become eligible on their
own account for medium term credit; criteria would be that the applicant
has a pair of oxen and has been growing cotton successfully for some time.
6.        Procedures.  Currently applications for short term loans are made
by individuals through their local extension agent or Village Croup. In
the Borgou, CFDT delivers fertilizers and insecticides directly to farmers
and itself organizes the spraying programs which are carried out by the
farmers. In the Zou, SATEC delivers both fertilizers and insecticides
provided by CFDT to Village Groups which are responsible for the distribution
of these to their members and for carrying out the spraying programs prepared
by CFDT. All loans are made in kind. In the Zou, Village Croups supervised
by SATEC are responsible for granting to and recovering short term loans
from their members; in the Borgou there are very few Village Groups and
the handling of individual accounts is CFDT's responsibility. No loans
are made for cotton sprayers; these are financed by FAS and made available
to CFDT and SATEC; farmers are debited with a charge to cover depreciation
which is repaid with their seasonal credit.
7.        Under the project, procedures for granting fertilizer credits would
be essentially the same as followed at present, except that in the Borgou,



eINEX 3
Page 3
loans to individual farmers would be gradually replaced by collective loans
to Village Groups, as the latter come into existence and develop the capacity
to handle such loans. SONACO would take over FAS financed sprayers in the
project area and be responsible for financing replacements and new sprayers.
The costs to these replacements and new sprayers would be provided for in
the revolving fund.
8.        Applications for medium term credits for ox-drawn equipment would be
made to the local extension agent; he would check the farmer's eligibility
and subnit his recommendation to the Sector Chief for approval. If the
applicant is a member of a Village Group, the approval of its committee
would be required also under the mutual guarantee arrangements. Applications
would be made in August; equipment would be ordered in September and
delivered to farmers in January when proceeds from cotton sales would be
available for down payments.
9.        Terms.  Currently the price of cotton fertilizer to farmers is
subsidized by FED and fixed at CFAF 20/kg; the subsidized cost includes
interest charges of 8%. Pest control costs charged to farmers include
interest at 8%, and in the North Borgou, South Borgou and Mono are repaid
through a fixed deduction per kg of seed cotton marketed; these are
CFAF 6.50/kg; CFAF 7.50/kg; and CFAF 8/kg respectively. In the Zou, Village
Groups are billed for actual purchases of pesticides plus 8% interest,
and a charge for the amortization of sprayers. Medium term loans only
granted by FAO/CIDR (see para 3) have a term of five years and a fixed
commission of 5% per annum which is charged on the full price of the material;
taking this into account the interest rate is equivalent to 7.5%.
10.       Under the project fertilizers would continue to be supplied to
farmers at a subsidized price, although the subsidy would be reduced pro-
gressively; see Annex 7, para 5.  The present system of charging a fixed
amount per kg of seed cotton for pest control in the Borgou would be
replaced gradually by the Zou system of charging actual costs of pesticides
plus 8% interest and costs of maintenance and amortization of sprayers.
Medium term loans for ox-drawn implements to Village Group members would
be for three years at an effective interest rate of 8%. A down payment
of 25% of the cost of the equipment would be obligatory to such borrowers.
In addition, Village Group members would pay a total of CFAF 600 to their
Village Group for establishment of a loan guarantee fund. For individuals
not covered by a guarantee fund the terms would be two years, and the
down payment 33%.  The terms of seasonal and medium term loans are summarized
in Table 1.
Security and Recovery
11.       Short term loans would, as now, be secured by the proceeds of cotton
marketed through CFDT. Costs of pest control and fertilizer credit repayments
would be deducted from payments to individual farmers in the Borgou while in
the Zou farmers would receive full paynent for their cotton and their Village
Groups, which guarantee their loans, would make the collective credit



ANNEX 3
Page 4
repayment.  Standard conditions for all medium term loans would be that:
(L) the down payment is made before delivery of the equipment; (ii) annual
repayments are collected not later than February in each year; and (iii)
when payment is overdue the rate of interest is increased by 50% for a
period not exceeding one year; beyond that limit the equipment is
repossessed by SONACO. All medium term loans would be covered by contracts
between SONACO and borrowers; loans to members of Village Groups would be
guaranteed by their Group.  Annual medium term credit repaynents would be
deducted from payments to farmers at cotton markets.

ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
FONDS AUTONOME DE STABILISATION ET DE SOUTTIEN
DES PRIX DES PRODUITS A L'EXPORTATION (FAS)
Organization and Objectives
1.        FAS was established in 1967 1/ and is responsible to the Ministry
of Economic Affairs and Planning. It superseded Fonds de Soutien des Produits
a l'Exportation which was created in 1961. Objectives are to guarantee
miniun producer prices for Dahomey 's principal export crops such as cotton,
gheanuts and groundnuts, and to promote agricultural development in general.
Operations
2.        FAS supports the minimum producer prices for export crops through
a scheme (bareme) under x^which actual exports prices are compared to a
"stati5tical" price for each commodity, based on a predetermined producer
price an(l including charges incurred by traders, manufacturers and exporters,
as well as a profit margin. Should the-actual export price exceed the
!statistical' price, FAS collects the difference, while in the event of
losses FAS reimburses the exporter's deficit.
3.        FAS also handles fertilizer and insecticide purchases for cotton
development programs, but lack of funds frequently has made it necessary for
CFDT to finance these operations; see Annex 3, para 2.
Financial Resources
4.        FAS receives a share of export and import taxes and duties on palm
kernels, sugar, rice and salt among others; these amounted to CFAF 166
million in 1970. In 1970 profits from cotton lint exports were the main
source of FAS income amoun_ing to CFAF 238 million. Another source of
income has been substantial FED grants for fertilizer subsidies which are
to be discontinued ir, 1972. FED provided CFAF 145 million for cotton
producer price subosidies in the period 1965/66 throuch 1967/68, and
about CFAF 560 million for fertilizer subsidies and other activities in the
period 1965/66 throueh 1969/70. Under the terms of the Venture agreement
between Government and CFDT (Annex 15) FAS would receive part of Government's
80% share of tne Drofîts f-rom the Venture's activities which would include
the export of lint and seed.
Financial Resu.l ts
5.        As FAS has nct 7pc-t proper accounts, its einancial position is not
clear.  Table '. shows acz_ai expenditure made to support producer prices
i/   Law No. 160/PR/PFAEP/AE.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
since its establishrient. With recent favorable export prices large sums
have accrued to FAS, but Governnent has required it to engage in operations
of doubtful financial merit, such as providing Governxnent with funds for
financing purchases of cotton ginning machinery and vehicles and recently,
cholera vaccinations. Throughout its years of operation, FAS has managed
to build up a small reserve but its liquidity position is weak because it
;-as had to make the bulk of these earnings available to Government.
Role in the Project
b.        Under the project SONACO would take over from FAS the handling of
fertilizer and insecticide purchases for the cotton development program in
the project area; and FAS would maintain a separate cotton account for the
prolect for price stabilization as required.

ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
COTTON GINNERIES
Existing Plants
1.        Cotton is now processed at six ginneries with a total capacity of
60,000 tons (see Table 1).  They have d-ffêientgIn equipment, but tnis
has been supplied mainly by one manufacturer (Lummus); four are owned by
CFDT and two by Government.  Four ginneries with a total capacityof36,000
tons nrY êtrh-projfect- area: Kandi, which is obsolete, Bohicon, which also
processes cotton from the Oueme; Savalou; and Parakou which, due to its
location, can use economically only two-thirds of its capacity.
CFDT's Expansion Program
2.        CFDT is expanding the capacity of the Savalou ginnery by 3,000
tons and will in 1971/72 construct a new 10,000-ton capacity ginnery at
Kancli to replace the old plant. After completion of this program, Dahomey's
total ginning capacity will be 67,000 tons, and that of the project area
43,000 tons.
New Government Plants for Project Area
3.        Cotton production generated by the project would exceed available
ginning capacity by 1972/73. Hence, the project would provide for the
construction of an 18,000-ton capacity ginnery in the Zou and a 6,000-ton
capacity ginnery in the Borgou. Projected cotton production and ginning
capacity during the 1971/72 to 1974/75 period are given in detail in
Table 2 and summarized below:

4.        Criteria for determining the site of the new plants would have
ta take into consideration: (i) distance to the railhead; çxports would
be sh'.pped to Cotonou via rail; (ii) availability ot manpower; (iii) avail-
abi!ity of water supply; (iv) communications with the project area; and
(v) location of centers of anticipated production increases. Considering
these criteria, a site near Glazoue railway station, seems preferable
»-r the Zou area. In the Borgou area, Banikoara appears a suitable
l.ocation because of the anticipated production increase from 3,500 tons
seec cotton in 1970 to 7,500 tons in 1974.  Actual sites would be determined
by a deta:.led study to be carried out by CFDT.
The plant at Glazoue would be equipped with three gins and
that at Banikoara with one gin, each with 128 saws and an hourly saw output
c' 7 kg. The capacity of a single gin would be 6,000 tons which could be
o9erated during a 125-day campaign with two 10-hour shifts per day. Exten-
siDn of the ginning campaign beyond the anticipated period would result in
loi--er qualifty lint.
6.        The new plants would be constructed in 1972 at Glazoue and
in 1973 in Banikoara. Although the plant at Glazoue would not operate
at fuil capacity during the first two years, no saving would materialize
fror. phasing installation of gins. The cost of a gin represents less than
1o'<nf machinery costs and about 2% of total costs.



AN EX,' (6
Page 3
7.        Turing the development period, seed cotton would be distributed
between the six project area ginneries according to transport distances
and the most economic use of ginning capacities.  By the end of the
development period, the quantity of non-project seed cotton to be
ginned in the project area in 1974/75, and estiriated at 10,000 tons,
would justify the construction of a ginnery in the Oueme, thus freeing
ginning capacity for further production increases in the project area.
8.        The Government would be the owner of the proposed new ginneries;
this would permit the Government to better understand and control the cotton
industry; and management would be supplied by CFDT under the Association
in Participation agreement (see Annex 15).

PRODUCTION AND PRICES
1.        The main cash crops grown in the project area would continue to
be cotton, maize, sorghum, millet and groundnuts; rice would be introduced
in the Zou. Data on labor requirements are given in Table 1. Annex 10
shows the areas of the various crops per farm in different project zones
by subsequent development stages.

2.        Farmers in the Borgou would move through four development stages
as follows:
(i)  Stage 1.  Introduction of cultivation of cotton; and full
control of cotton pests.
(ii)  Stage 2.  Expansion of the farm's cotton area and use of
fertilizers in addition to that of insecticides.
(iii)  Stage 3.  Growing cotton in blocks, observing crop rotations
and extending the cotton area; extension of area
under rice.
(iv)  Stage 4.  Use of ox-drawn implements and, consequently, further
expansion of cotton area and improvement of cultiva-
tion methods; use of fertilizer on rice.
In the Zou most cotton farmers have already attained Stage 3; however due
to tse-tse incidence and the lack of knowledge of Zou farmers of animal
husbandry, Stage 4 would be introduced on an experimental basis only.
Crop Rotation
3.        Cropping patterns and crop rotation vary according to different
ecological conditions in the project area, and would change on each farm
as the farmer moved through various development stages. In general, the
cropping pattern would meet the following conditions:
(i)  attain self-sufficiency in food crops for the farmer and
his family;



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(ii)  eliminate bottlenecks in land preparation, weeding and
harvesting; and
(iii)  enable cereals following cotton to benefit from the residual
effect of fertilizers applied to cotton.
A. typical crop rotation in the Borgou would be: yam; cotton; cotton;
cereals; cereais; followed by a fallow period of about four years depending
on the effect of cotton fertilizers on the level of soil fertility. In
the Zou with two rainy seasons changes in the rotation would be more
complicated for two reasons: (i) maize should not, as now, proceed cotton,
but be replaced by another crop (yam, groundnuts, or pulses); and (ii) upland
rice would have to be included in the rotation, since the Zou has no typical
low lying rice land like the Borgou. Rice would be sown between June 1 and
15. Cotton between June 5 and 25 in North Borgou, between June 15 and July
5 in South Borgou and between June 25 and July 10 in the Zou.
Inputs
4.        Pesticides.  It is mandatory _/ for cotton farmers to control
pests. This would require five to six sprays in the North and six to
seven sprays in the South using hnand operated knapsack sprayers. Spraying
would start 45 days after sowing; and thereafter be repeated every 12 to
15 days. Currently a DDT-Endrin emulsion is used consisting of 450 g DDT
and 120 g Endrin per liter applied at a rate of 10-13 liters/ha; and Lindane
at 3 liters/ha. Total costs are about CFAF 7,500/ha. Both DDT and Endrin
are "hard" insecticides and accumulate in body tissues; also Endrin has a
relatively high mammalian toxicity.  Less persistent and dangerous insecti-
cides could probably be used and during the project period the effectivity
o:- an Endosulfan-'-ethylparathion mixture would be tested.  CFDT would, as
now, disinfect cotton seeds at the ginnery before delivering them to project
Larmers.
5.        Fertilizers.  All project farmers in the Zou, and an increasing
num'ber of farmers in the Borgou would use a standard fertilizer treatment
for cotton comprising a single annual application of 150 kg 20-25-12 NPS
compound fertilizer per ha costing about CFAF 5,000/ha excluding any
subsidy. During the project development period the subsidy on fertilizers
would be reduced gradually and consequently the price of fertilizers to
farrers would increase from CFAF 20/kg in 1971 to CFAF 25ikg by 1974 and
CI'AF 30/kg by 1975 as compared to 1970 actual costs of CFAF 30/kg in the
South and CFAF 35/kg in the North. Fertilizers are not generally used
for crops other than cotton. Consequently, no other fertilizer costs are
irLcluded in project costs with the exception of those of rice fertilizers
wikich would be used by Stage 4 farmers at a rate of 150 kg Su1phate Ammonia
arnd 50 kg dicalciumphosphate, costing CFAF 7,000/ha. The value of the
1/   !ecrce 70-315 of December 5, 1970.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
yield increase per kg fertilizer costing about CAF 35 is estimated at
CFAF 120-200 (6-10 kg paddy). Introduction of a new groundnut variety
(see para 7) would require the use of a phosphate fertilizer, but during
the project development period this variety would be limited to trial
fields.
6.        Ox-drawn Implements.  The demand for ox-drawn implements is
increasing rapidly in the Borgou, while in the Zou their use is limited
to trials. It is assumed that the number of pairs of oxen would increase
as follows:

Total Borgou                     340      555     800   1,390    1,880
A unit consisting of a plow and a ridger costs CFAF 13,800.  The FAC
training center at Gamia in the Borgou would continue to train village
blacksmiths and oxen-trainers.  The number of the latter would increase
from 26 at present to about 45 by the end of the development period. The
training center at Bettekoukou in the Zou would continue its demonstrations,
but during the project development it is assumed that no oxen would be sold
to farmers. Use of draft oxen would not only allow an increase in cultivated
area, but also provide farmers with additional income from sales of cattle.
Farmers feed their oxen well, and in three working years (from the age of
3 until 6 years) an ox doubles its weight from 175 to 350 kg.
7.        Varieties.  Cotton varieties used are A 333 in the South and BJA
592 in the North. A 333 (1"-1" 1/32 staple) has a 39% lint outturn in
Dahomey which is high compared to other West African countries and equals
that of BJA 592 (1"-1" 1/16 staple). Rice varieties used are Sintane-Diofor
and Gambioka. The presently used groundnut varieties are mainly of local
origin, such as Axi Moto in the Zou and 48-57 in the Borgou. New high
yielding varieties are available at IRHO's research station at Niangoloko in
Upper Volta. In particular, variety 1040 which is rosette resistant would
be tested in the project area. During the development period a start would
be made with the introduction of hybrid maize (MHNI). Varieties now used
are Nicaouli 7 and other local varieties in the Zou, and Jaune d'Ina
in the Borgou.

Yields and Production
8.        The yield and production projections used in project calculations
are summarized in Table 2, and details on cotton production by sub-prefectures
are given in Tables 3 and 4. Projections for cotton yields are conservative
because present yields are already relatively high. Actual cotton yield
and production figures for 1961 through 1970 are given in Annex 1, Table 3.
The 1970 average project area yield of 880 kg/ha is considered to be higlI
and, therefore, for project calculations it is assumed that during the first
two years of the development period average yields would not exceed the
1970 level and production increases would be obtained mainly front additional
acreage.

ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
FEEDER ROAD IMPROVEMENT PROGRA1
Introduction
1.        The project area is served by about 1,600 km of national road
complemented by about 1,000 km of tertiary roads. National roads are
under the responsibility of the PWD. Until recently PWD lacked the
necessary funds and equipment to maintain them adequately. However, this
situation is expected to improve as a result of a four-year (1970-74)
maintenance program undertaken with IDA financial assistance including
procurement of equipment, renovation of workshops as well as budgetary
and organizational reform.  Implementation of this program is progressing
satisfactorily and it is expected by 1972 that PWD will have sufficient
capacity to maintain the national roads serving the project area.
2.        The tertiary roads consisting of primitive tracks are under the
responsibility of the local authorities which, however, lack the resources
and capacity to carry out the simple works necessary for their maintenance.
These roads play a vital role in linking cotton growing areas with markets
and stocking sites.  The fact that CFDT is required to guarantee cotton
collection even from the remotest areas illustrates the importance of reliable
road transport.  The present poor condition of feeder roads serving the project
area results in high transport costs.  A feeder road improvement program will
be carried out under the project to reduce transport costs and facilitate
access to new areas to be developed. The Governnent would make arrangements
satisfactory to IDA for the maintenance of project roads including the
feeder roads to be improved under the project.
Description
3.        The program would consist of the imnprovement of 611 km of
selected feeder roads (194 km in the Zou and 417 km in the Borgou; see
Table 1). Improvement works would entail upgrading sections by regraveling,
building culverts and fords, opening up lateral outlets and executing other
auxiliary works.
4.        Societe Nationale Agricole pour le Coton (SONACO) would establish
annual road improvement programs to be carried out by PWD. PWD would
establish a special unit which would be supervised by two technicians to
be employed under the project, and also will ensure adequate coordination
with SONACO.  The project would provide some supplemental equipment,
especially two tankers for fuel delivery, two pick-ups as well as some
accessories and tools to be used by PWD solely for the project..

Economic Justification
6.        The project area has a network of about 1,000 km of 1tcotton
roads"i, of which the 611 km listed in Table 1 are the most used. It is
estimated that under the project cotton production in the project area would
increase from about 34,500 tons in 1971 to about 55,000 tons by 1974/75.
7.        The feeder road program would permit lower cotton transport costs.
In the near future, as at present, 5.5-ton trucks plus trailers would be
operating on feeder roads, but with minor improvements and a reasonable
degree of maintenance, unit savings would be about CFAF 8.35 per ton-km.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
8.        Benefits of improving feeder roads would be derived not only
from the cotton tonnage to be hauled, but also from transport cost savings
on other products, such as farm inputs and commodities as well as passenger
traffic. These savings are estimated at 2.4 times the savings on cotton
traffic.
9.        The economic life of the feeder roads is assumed to be ten years.
Under the above assumption and assuming an annual maintenance cost of CFAF
11.2 million, the economic rate of return for the feeder road program would
be about 11.5Z (see Table 3).

ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
Research Institutes and Proposed Subjects for Research
General
1.        Research on the main crops of the project area has been and would
continue to be the responsibility of Institut de Recherches du Coton et des
Textiles Exotiques (IRCT) - for cotton, and Institut de Recherches Agronomi-
ques Tropicales et de Cultures Vivrieres (IRAT) - for food crops, such as rice
and groundnuts and ox-drawn cultivation. A description of these institutes
is given below.  In Dahomey agricultural research has been hampered by lack
of funds, and generally the application of results has been poor due to
inadequate extension services, although cotton extension has been an exception.
A. Institut de Recherches du Coton et des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT)
Organization and Staff
2.        IRCT was established in 1946 as a non-profit French association.
Its objective is to develop production of cotton and other fiber crops. Its
Board of Directors consists of 40 representatives of the French Government,
private organizations and enterprises, and of the countries where it operates.
Eleven elected directors form a Consultative Committee. IRCT's staff comprise
100 French research workers and technicians and 180 local staff stationed in
17 research stations. While IRCT has been operating in Dahomey since 1961
it does not have its own research station and depends for fundamental research
on the IRCT stations in Togo and Ivory Coast. Applied cotton research in
Dahomey is carried out at twelve permanent experimental centers, four in the
Borgou, four in the Zou and four in the South. Operations are directed by
a French director in Cotonou who heads a staff of three professional research
workers.
Operations
3.        IRCT operates in all ex-French territories in Africa that produce
cotton or other fibers and, in addition, in twelve other countries throughout
the world. IRCT introduced the Hirsutum cotton variety into the Borgou in
1962, and into the Zou in 1965 to replace the traditional Barbadense variety.
Fertilizer, insecticide and crop rotation experiments are conducted at the
twelve centers, while variety trials are carried out on test plots throughout
the cotton areas. In addition, IRCT provides cotton seeds for multiplication,



ANNEX 9
Page 2
and controls the first two stages of such multiplication (see Annex 12).
'RCT is also concerned with kenaf research in Dahomey.
Financial Arrangements
4.        In Dahomey, unlike most ex-French territories, IRCT has no general
agreement under which Government and France share research station costs.
fRCT's Dahomean activities are linked with specific projects; their costs are
:Lncluded in project costs and for each project a specific research agreement
iLs concluded with Goverrment. In addition to such agreements for the FAC-
financed Zou and Borgou cotton programs, IRCT is under contract with the
Government for cotton research in the Atakora, financed by FED and the
national budget, and in the South financed by FAC; and for kenaf research
f'inanced by the national budget. The amounts of these funds available
f'or IRCT operations in 1970 are summarized below:

Organization and Staff
5.        IRAT was established in 1960 as a non-profit French association.
Ii:s objective is to undertake and develop applied research in the fields of
general agronomy and food crops in tropical countries. Its Board of
D:Lrectors consists of 14 representatives of French ministries and public
organizations, 14 representatives of countries where it operates and 12
representatives of French scientific organizations. Its staff comprises 140
research workers and 75 technicians or research assistants. In Dahomey IRAT
has research stations at Niaouli and Ina, and three regional experimental
centers (Borgou, Zou and South). It has four permanent test plots for rice
irn the Borgou, and six for crop rotations: two in the Borgou and four in
the Zou. Operations are directed by a French director in Cotonou who controls
five professional research workers.
Operations
6.        IRAT operates in 13 African countries and in four overseas depart-
ments of France in the Indian Ocean and the Carribbean area. In addition,



ALN4EX 9
Page 3
it provides advisory services to some 14 countries in Central and South
America, the Middle East and Asia. In Dahomey IRAT concentrates on applied
research especially the rotation of cash crops with food crops, on rice
trials, and on experiments with ox-drawn implements. IRAT's crop intensi-
fication research includes experiments on fertilizer and insecticide use
and the testing of new varieties and cultivation techniques. In groundnut
research IRAT is assisted by Institut de Recherches pour les Huiles et
Oleagineux (IRHO).
Financial Arrangements
7.        In Dahomey IRAT operates under a general agreement with Government
which shares costs with France on a fifty-fifty basis. In addition, IRAT
has concluded special agreements for research work related to particular
development schemes, especially those financed by FAC, as shown in the
following table:

C. Proposed Subjects for Research
8.        Under the project the following subjects would be the basis of
IRCT and IRAT applied research programs:
(i) Cotton: determination of optimum nutrient application,
including potassium; and replacement of DDT and Endrin by
other less "hard" insecticides.
(ii)  Rice:  introduction and selection of high yielding varieties;
fertilizer tr_ais on swamp rice in the Borgou, and on upland
rice in the Zou.
(iii)  Groundnuts:  înzroduction of high yielding and rosette
resistant varietîes; determination of nutrient requirements
of these variet.es.
(iv)  Maize and sorghun:  introduction of new h.1ybrid varieties and
determinatiorn of their fertilizer requirements.

Cotton Seed Production
1.        In Dahomey as in many other French speaking countries the Institut
de Recherches du Coton et des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT) is responsible for
the introduction and first stage multiplication of improved cotton varieties.
Presently the varieties propagated are A 333 1/ in the South and BJA 592 2/
in the North. As shown below it takes about three years to multiply
foundation seed to an amount sufficient to supply all cotton producers.

reduce transportation costs.
2.        To guarantee the purity of seed IRCT, together with CFDT, super-
vises the selected farmers. There is no problem in obtaining an adequate
number of selected farmers while they receive no additional payment for seed
growing.

ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT)
Organization
1.        CFDT was established in 1949 to provide technical assistance to
France's overseas territories (and subsequentiy otlier c`ountries) for the
development of fiber crops, ltn particular, cotton. CFDT is a non-profit
oriented statutory body (Societe d'Economie Mixte), mainly financed by the
French Gov- -nèL.   I-t-s Board of Directors consists of representatives of the
French ministries concerned with financial and technical assistance, private
commercial and industrial aroups, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE) and Institut de Recherches du Coton et des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT).
Headquarters are at Paris and comprise four main divisions: Agriculture;
Industry and Equipment; Commerce; and Finance and Accountancy.
2.        CFDT has a regional office in Bobo-Dioulasso (Upper Volta), which
supervises CFDT's activities in Ivory Coast, Mali, Upper Volta and Niger.
Paris headquarters are responsible for supervising Dahomey operations.
3.        The advantages of CFDT's central organization are appreciable to
recipient countries. The quality of services provided are far greater than
any single recipient country could afford on the basis of its own cotton
production. There are further advantages in CFDT's headquarters being in
Paris: CFDT is able to obtain favorable prices for the supply of production
requisites and equipment by bulking the orders of the producing countries
that it assists as well as favorable insurance and transport rates for the
whole of CFDT's activities; and centralizing final sales from its Paris
headquarters facilitates the timely delivery to cotton buyers of supplies in
the quantities and qualities desired.
Provision of Technical Assistance
4.        Technical assistance provided takes usually the following forms,
or a combination of them:
(i) Crop production - CFDT organizes extension services to
teach farmers to use improved cotton cualtivation methods.
Frequently these methods are based on research results
obtained by the Institut des Recherches du Coton et des
Textiles Exotiques (IRCT);
(ii) Ginning and marketing - In countries which have no ginneries
and lack marketing experience, CFDT constructs its own
x   ginneries and organizes the marketing, export and final
sale of cotton;



ANNEX 13
Page 2
(iii)  Management - In countries which have national ginneries but
lack competent technical staff, CFDT enters into agreements
for the management of such ginneries;
(iv) Consultancy - CFDT carries out feasibility studies, and
prepares cotton development plans and programs.
5.        CFDT operates in a number of countries, for example:
(i)  Crop production - 14 countries in Africa, 2 in the
Mediterranean area and 6 in Asia;
(ii) Ginning and marketing - 9 countries in Africa; and
(iii)  Management - 4 countries in Africa.
Financial Arrangements for Technical Assistance Services
6.        For the four forms of technical assistance (para 4) CFDT is
remunerated as follows:
(i)  Crop production - The costs charged by CFDT for providing
extension services in African countries are generally similar.
The Government agrees to reimburse CFDT for costs of expatriate
and local personnel employed directly by CFDT, and costs of
CFDT's operation. In addition, CFDT receives annually 15% of
total personnel costs to cover overheads of Paris headquarters
and regional offices.
The following table shows the method of reimbursement in some
West African countries:

Operational costs        -          -          7           10
(ii)  Ginning and marketing (where CFDT owns and operates the ginneries)
a)   Lint
In most countries CFDT charges CFAF 18,000 per ton of lint
ginned, and additionally receives some CFAF 3,000 per ton
of lint produced, and is reimbursed for expenses incurred



ANNEX 13
Page 3
in purchasing and marketing. However, a new system will be
introduced for Dahomey whereby, as explained in Annex 16,
all purchasing, ginning and marketing costs will be charged
to the Association in Participation, while CFDT will receive
a total remuneration of 2% of the CIF value; and 20% of net
profits of which 75% will be reinvested la n.lahomey.
b)   Cotton seed
In some countries CFDT receives a lump sum of some CFAF 2,000
to 3,000 per ton of cotton seed exported. The new proposal
for Dahomey is a commission of CFAF 2,000 per ton produced
and 20% participation in the profits made by the Participation
on exports.
(iii) Management
In countries where part of the ginneries belong to the Government
and part to CFDT, CFDT manages all factories and is remunerated
in the way explained above. The only case in which CFDT manages
a national company is the Central African Republic. Actual
personnel costs are reimbursed by the Government. Moreover,
CFDT receives 1% of the sales value of lint and seed, of which
CFDT has to pass on 0.5% commission to the importers in France.
<iv) Consultancy
The arrangements for studies, usually engineering studies for
ginneries, vary from case to case.
7.        Details on the existing and proposed system of remuneration for
Upper Volta are given in Annex 16.

Societe D'Aide Technique et de Cooperation (SATEC)
Organization
1.        SATEC was established in 1956 to provide technical assistance both
in France and overseas, for the development of production, in particular, by
small scale agriculture, fisheries and industries; it mainly provides support
to extension service organizations and agricultural production and marketing
cooperatives. In addition SATEC is equipped to conduct social and economic
studies. It is a non-profit Government corporation with a capital of FF 12
million (US$2.2 million), and responsible to the French Ministries of Finance,
and Overseas Departments and Territories. SATEC's Board of Directors comprise
22 members, representing the various Ministries and organizations concerned
with home and overseas development. Most of the duties of the Board have
been delegated to two executive committees of nine members each, one respon-
sible for activities within France, and the other for activities overseas.
Operations
2.        In the field of agriculture SATEC has two projects in France, four
in territories outside Africa, and nine in African countries including
Dahomey. Projects include rural land reform, improvement of samallholder
crops, and a number of agricultural studies. In the industrial field it is
working in six overseas countries.  Its European staff is about 350, of which
about three-fifths are stationed overseas. Staff working overseas number
over 2,600, of which about one-sixth are expatriates. Total expenditure by
SATEC in 1970 was FF 44 million (US$8 million), of which about one-third
was spent in French territories, and two-thirds in foreign countries.

ZOU-BORGOU COTTON PROJECT
Arrangements Between Government and Compagnie Francaise
Pour Le Developpement Des Fibres Textiles (CFDT)
Background
1.        CFDT owns four cotton ginneries in Dahomey and is responsible for
the m4naRgent of one Government-owned ginnery.  Societe Nationale pour le
Developpement Rural du Dahomey (SONADER) operates a second Government-owned
ginnery in the Mono area. Under an agreement with the Governnent CFDT
purchases seed cotton from producers outside the Mono, gins it and exports
resulting lint as vell as SONADER's lint production to world markets. Prior
to 1969 CFDT also exported all cotton seed, but in 1969 OCAD took over this
profitable activity. P esent arrangements are governed by an agreement
signed in January 1967, which expires in 1977. Government and CFDT are
negotiàtingïa a:rtnership agreement of "Association en-Participation",
which would apply for five years subject to amendrents as may be agreed from
time to time with IDA. Th .tFrticip&tion would be responsible to the
M.inister of Rural Development and would be managed by CFDT under a `'Mandat
de Gestion."
Arrangements under the Existing 1967-1977 Agreement
2.        Under this CFDT is responsible for the development of cotton
production through organizing extension services in those regions where it
is engaged as a development agency, and for rendering advisory services to
other areas, e.g. where SATEC acts as development agency. CFDT is nationally
responsible for cotton seed production and distribution in collaboration
with IRCT.
3.        Prior to each cotton season CFDT assists Government in preparing
a production program. Under the agreement it is mandatory for CFDT to buy
all Hirsutum seed cotton produced by farmers, except in the Mono, but to
buy Barbadense cotton only in areas indicated annually by Government. CFDT
assisted in designing and constructing the Government-owned ginnery at
Parakou, and is responsible for its management for another 17 years until
Government, through CFDT, has repaid the CFAF 100 million loan which CCCE
made for this plant.
4.        The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Planning sets annual
producer prices for seed cotton on the basis of anticipated FOB prices for
lint. If the FOB price obtained for cotton lint is lower than was antici-
pated, CFDT is reimbursed for its losses by FAS (see Annex 4). Conversely,
if FOB prices are higher than estimated, CFDT makes an appropriate payment



ANNEX 15
Page 2
to FAS. The existing agreement covers both CFDT's extension activities and
processing and marketing obligations, but for the project three new agree-
ments have been concluded: an "Association en Participation" and a
"Mandat de Gestion" agreement between Government and CFDT; and a service
contract between SONACO and CFDT for the management of extension services
in the Borgou area and for technical assistance in setting up SONACO's
financial organization.
"Mandat de Gestion" Agreement
5.        This agreement which, in contrast to the "Association en
Participation" agreement, will be officially published, provides CFDT
with ail powers required for managing all existing and new Government
owned ginneries. In addition, CFDT is responsible for training African
staff pirEferably Dahomean. The agreement is for five years. A condition
of its effectiveness is that the agreement concluded in 1967 between the
Government, CCCE and CFDT for constructing and managing Government's
ginnery at Parakou (see para 3) be a covenant to the new agreement.
1971 "Association en Participation" Agreement between Government ad CFDT
6.        The provisions of the proposed 1971 agreement are suxmmarized below:

(a)  All CFDT's recurrent costs incurred in
purchasing, ginning and marketing, excluding
investments in gins and storage;
(b)  Interest and bank commissions on short-,
medium- and long-term loans to meet operating
and investment costs;
(c)  Interest on the monthly balance of the two
parties' investment accounts at the rate of
5.5% per annum, and on current accrunts at
the going rate for sea,.nal loans;
(d)  Amortization of buildings and installations,
based on a life of 20 years for buildings,
10 years for factory equipment, 7 years for
motors, electrical and other equipment, 5
years for heavy vehicles and light material,
and 3 years for light vehicles;
(e)  Provision for replacements of fixed assets
on the basis of the above mentioned lffe
assumptions for the difference between initial
and replacement values; and
(f)  CFDT remuneration amounting to:
-    2% of CIF value of lint; and
-    CFAF 2,000/ton cotton seed.
XIII.   Sharing Profits and Losses
Article 18.    Profits will be shared as follows:  80% to
Government and 20% to CFDT.



ANNEX 15
Page 7
Article 19.    Losses vwîl  be shared in the same proportion,
but losses caused through Government setting
too high a "statistical" price (see Article 20)
for seed cotton and lînt will be borne by Govern-
ment and losses due to CFDT's negligence will
be entireiy for CFDT's account. At any time,
CFDT's liability will not exceed the cumulative
amount of previous profit shares by more than
CFAF 5 million; any remaining unpaid balance
will be deducted from future profits
accruing to CFDT.
Article 20.    The "statistical" price for seed cotton or lint
will be the price which would balance the forecast
profit and loss account; this price, by definition,
would be the maximum price which CFDT would have
proposed on sound commercial grounds if it were
responsible for price setting.
Article 21.    CFDT will reinvest that part of its profit share
which is required for improving its industrial
assets; it could use such assets to liquidate
its debts derived from sharing in the Participation's
losses.
XIV.   Training
Article 22.    CFDT vill train Dahomean personnel to replace
expatriates.
XV.   Taxation
Article 23.    The Participation will be exempted from levies and
taxes and Government wili extend to CFDT personnel
the same fiscal facilities which apply to French
technical assistance personnel.
XVI.   Arbitration
Article 24.    Disputes vill be submitted to the International
Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.
XVII.   Effective Date and Duration
Article 25.    Provided the May 11, 1967, agreement between
Government, CCCE and CFDT governing management
and loan repayment obligations for the Parakou
ginnery is amended the present agreement will be
effective as of October 1, 1971.



ANNEX 15
Page 8
Article 26.    The agreement vill replace that of January 17,
1967, but CFDT and FAS will close their 1970/71
accounts on the basis of the 1970/71 price
schedule.
Article 27.    This agreement vill be for five years as of
the date of its effectiveness.
XVIII.   Mandate
Article 28.    Under a separate "mandat" which is related to the
Participation agreement, CFDT is authorized to
act on behalf of the Government in all matters
.-~ = concerning the activities under the Participation
agreement.
Article 29.    This article contains the text of the "Mandat" as
summarized in para 5.

Cotton Market Prospects
1.        Cotton is produced ln varying quantities in more than 80 countries.
Roughly one-third of the world crop is produced for export in raw (fiber)
form, and significant quantities are exported by producing countries as
textiles. The United States, the U.S.S.R. and Mainland China are the world's
largest producers, the three countries together accounting for about half
of the world output. The bulk of the remainder is produced by a large
number of low-income countries.
2.        Though its share in vorld trade has been declining historically,
the U.S. remains the world's largest exporter of raw cotton, with 20-25
percent of the market in recent years. Another 15 percent of world exports
is accounted for by centrally planned countries, and most of the remainder,
55-60 percent, by developing countries. (See Table 1.)
3.        The role played by cotton as a cash and export crop in the
economies of developlng countries is illustrated best by African producers.
Though Africa as a whole accounts for only 10 percent of the world cotton
output, the plant is cultivated commercially by over 25 countries in the
continent, many of them with very low per capita income and few production
alternatives. Of these, four countries depend on cotton for over 20 percent
of their total export earnings, four for 10-20 percent, and another five for
5-10 percent. Conversely, sllghtly over half of the cotton producing
countries in the world which derive 5 percent or more of their export
earnings from cotton are ln "developing Africa".
4.        Although cotton is by far the most important fiber consumed in
the world (ln terms of welght) and whlle, despite its declining share, it
is llkely to remain so in the foreseeable future, its demand outlook is
not bright compared to its history of growth, producing low-lncome countries'
needs, or their expectations. This is reflected ln the price outlook.
5.        World cotton prices are expected to decline by 10-15 percent
from recent levels by the mid-seventies.  In terms of Mexican Strict Middling
1-1/16" cotton, a representative grade of so-called medium-long cotton
which normally accounts for more than 60 percent of world cotton output,
the price level is projected to decline from an average of 29.5 U.S. cents
per pound, c.i.f. Liverpool, in calendar years 1969 and 1970 to 26 cents,
in 1970 dollar terme, 1/ by about 1975.
1/   For purposes of this paper, prices converted to U. S. dollar equivalents
were deflated by using the U. S. Wholesale Price Index, 1970 - 100.



ANNEX 16
Page 2
6.        The expected downward trend in prices over the medium-term
reflects a number of assumptions: (a) that the current high prices are
temporary and simply reflect supply-demand adjustment lags at the end of
a (declining) stock cycle; (b) continued competition among some 60
exporting countries, many of them heavily dependent on cotton exports, in
what is basically a very slow-growing market; (c) absence, in future U.S.
support and export price policies, of the elements that made that country
a residual supplier in the world market on the one hand and, on the other
hand, led to recurring stock accumulation there; and (d) continued pres-
sure of competing fibers on cotton, which has become a major consideration
in U.S. price policy.
7.        Cotton prices in the international market, at least half the
time in the postwar period, have not been determined primarily by market
forces. Especially in years when world production exceeded world con-
sumption, i.e., in 11 of the 22 seasons between 1948/49 and 1969/70, the
effective U.S. export price, as shaped by the loan rate and adjustments
for interest, transport cost, export subsidies (no longer in existence),
etc., acted as a floor for the world price of cotton. This resulted from
a policy of the United States, the vorld's largest consumer, producer
and exporter of cotton, under existing laws, to withhold export sales below
a given price and to accumulate stocks at this price - a price which in
most years stood above the hypothetical equilibrium, or market-clearing
level. 1/ World prices did decline through most of this period (by about
one-third, in real terms, between 1953 and 1967) but in stages paralleling
successive, but delayed, adjustments in the U.S. export price. These,
in turn, were instrumental in inducing stock cycles of 6 to 8 years'
duration.
8.        The world cotton situation today is quite different in several
respects from what it was throughout most of the past and especially four
or five years ago. Perhaps the most striking difference is in the stock
position. At the beginning of the 1966 season (August), world cotton
stocks were at a peak of 30.8 million bales (one bale contains 478 lbs
of cotton), equivalent to 7.2 months of world consumption, and a highly
disproportionate amount of these, 56.4 percent of the total, vas held
by the U.S. alone. Cotton is no longer in surplus: in August 1970 (the
end of the 1969/70 season) world stocks stood at 21.6 million bales,
equivalent to 4.8 months of vorld consumption - a level considered as
"minimum, or too low", particularly by consuming countries. The distribution
of stocks also changed considerably: the United States held in August 1970
27 percent of world stocks (compared to 55 percent in August 1966), centrally
planned countries 14 percent (11.4 percent in 1966) and the rest of the world
1/   For a detailed discussion of the mechanics of the links between world
cotton prices and U.S. domestic and export price policies, see
background paper on "Cotton: Past Trends and Outlook", May 12, 1969,
pp. 16-17, and also "Recent Developments Affecting Cotton", Commodity
Note No. 55, November 17, pp. 4-5.



ANNEX 16
Page 3
59 percent (33.6 percent in 1966). Reflecting these changes in the demand-
supply balance, the Liverpool price of Mexican Strict Middling 1-1/6" cotton
- a representative grade of so-called medium-long cotton - which was 28.1
cents per pound in August 1966 rose to 31.0 cents per pound in August 1970
and averaged around 33.8 cents during the first six months of 1971.
9.        The rapid liquidation of surplus stocks (those above normal
manufacturing and trade inventories) and the improvement in prices,
however, were brought about not by improved demand conditions but rather
by sharp reductions in production, particularly in 1966/67 and 1967/68.
Mbreover, the strengthening trend in cotton prices coincided with steep
autonomous reductions in synthetic fiber prices. As a result of these
and other factors, 8uch a boom in polyester/cotton blends, world cotton
consumption has been rising by only 0.7 percent per annum since 1966/67,
compared to an annual growth rate of about 2 percent registered in the
preceding 10 years; its share of world textile fiber consumption, in
cotton equivalents, 1/ shrank from 53.8 percent in calendar 1967 to 47.1
percent in calendar 1969, accelerating the long-established and uninter-
rupted trend of market loss to man-made fibers.
10.       While there is evidence that the recent sluggishness in world
demand for cotton has been due, in part, to transitory or uncommon factors
(such as textile recessions, now over, in several developed countries,
depressed economic conditions in the U.S., the dissipation of some of the
gains in demand associated with the war in Vietnam, and the timing of
opposite changes in cotton and synthetic fiber prices), there are, too,
strong indications that the recurring tendency of production to outpace
consumption in the absence of downward adjustments in prices will persist.
The shortfalls in world production experienced in the last few years were
brought about largely if not entirely by sharp, intentional cutbacks in
U.S. acreage and assisted by low yields in several major producing
countries, including the U.S., particularly in 1967/68 and 1969/70. 2/ The
cotton provisions embodied in the new U.S. farm legislation covering
1971/72 to 1973/74 are expected to raise U.S. output to more normal levels
while at the same time improving the competitiveness of U.S. cotton in
order both to combat substitution by synthetics and to prevent excessive
accumulation of stocks. To this end, for example, the loan rate is to be
set each year at 90 percent of the average world price in the preceding
two seasons. Consequently, world prices in the years ahead will increasingly
reflect market forces, and the supply situation will tend to be considerably
more comfortable which, from the point of view of the substitution problem,
can be considered a healthy development.
1/   As a given volume of man-made fibers tends to displace a larger
volume of cotton, due to the lighter weight and lower waste factors
of the former, it is necessary to convert fiber consumption figures
into "cotton equivalents" in order to get a true picture of the loss
suffered by cotton.
2/   For a more detailed discussion of events in this period and their
implications, see, "Cotton: Current Situation, Major Issues and Recent
International Discussions", Economics Department Working Paper No. 48,
September 5, 1969.



ANNEX 16

11.       The price projections cited earlier incorporate the above
assessment of the current situation and are based, more specifically, on
the following assumptions and empirical considerations.
12.       World demand for textile fibers (comprising cotton, wool and
man-made fibers) is projected to grow at a rate of 3.5 percent per annum
over the next 5-6 years, or at about the same rate as in the last 15
years, implying a growth in per capita consumption of about 1.8 percent
annually. This is predicated on the assumption, based on empirical
evidence, that a growth of 10 percent in the index of world manufacturing
output will be associated, on the average, with a growth of nearly 7 percent
in demand for textile fibers. Demand for cotton cannot be projected as
precisely or with the same degree of confidence as aggregate demand for
textile fibers for several reasons including, inter alia, the inadequacy
of data on consumption and substitution by end uses. Nevertheless, it
is assumed that cotton consumption will expand at a much slower rate, by
1-1.6 percent per annum. Projections made using a variety of approaches
(obtaining cotton consumption as a residual after estimating the growth
potential of the other components of the textile-fiber group, using
income elasticities of demand, extrapolating different trends, attempts
at estimating elasticities of substitution, aggregating independently-made
national forecasts, etc.), all converge within this range. Demand for
cotton could possibly grow at best at a rate approximating that in world
population growth but then only if prices fell substantially and/or
research and promotional efforts proved to be highly successful. In any
case, there will be little room for export growth in this demand climate,
but exporting countries are likely to share differently in the moderate
groath that may take place, as their output expansion prospects and
possibilities are not uniform.
13.       While several cotton-producing countries have shown considerable
restraint in expanding their cotton output in recent years, available
information on government plans or intention indicates nevertheless that
in the absence of a fall in prices, world supply could exceed demand by
as much as 6-8 percent by the mid-seventies. 1/ In a relatively freer,
competitive market such as that predicated for the future, however, and
in an annual crop such as cotton, it is unlikely that producing countries
will produce "for stock"; it is more likely that demand, production and
prices will move rather rapidly toward long-term equilibrium levels.
14.       The price elasticity of demand for cotton is in the order of
only -0.2 to -0.4 (lower for downward changes in price than for upward
changes); this by itself would imply the necessity of a sharp decline in
1/ For more on this point, see Working Paper No. 48, pp. 13-16.

prices to clear the market. There is growing evidence, however, that the
supply elasticity in many countries is greater and getting bigger,
approaching one which indicates that supply growth will be restrained
significantly by weaker prices in the future. In addition, it is possible
that, in spite of the absence of a commitment on its part to support the
world price, the U.S. may administer its cotton policy during the projec-
tion period (which runs beyond the life of the new legislation) in such
a way as to avoid a too-precipitous fall in prices.
15.       According to staff computations and judgments, at projected
equilibrium levels of demand, supply and price for the mid-seventies,
world raw cotton exports would experience a growth rate of roughly
one percent per annum between 1965-67 and 1975, although exports from
developing countries may grow at a rate twice as high. This allows for
U.S. exports at a level 5-6 percent below that of the base period, but
over 30 percent higher than the low of 1968/69. Furthermore, while the
beneficiaries of the sharp fall in U.S. exports in 1968/69 were 2-3 large
producing countries alone, it is assumed that export growth over the long-
term will be shared more evenly by other countries.
16.       The exporta growth experience of individual developing countries
will nevertheless continue to vary depending on, inter alia, availability
of land, trends in yields, quality and marketability of cotton grown,
domestic consumption, and their cotton textile trade balances. Small
African countries with few production alternatives are likely to push and
succeed in expanding their small shares. These and other minor structural
changes in the market structure, however, cannot be judged with uniform
criteria.  Countries differ not only with respect to the factors enumerated
above but also in terms of alternative crops and the market forces affecting
them. It is thus difficult to find or expect uniform expansion strategies
in cotton producing countries.
17.       It has been assumed in arriving a  the above picture of cotton's
outlook that there will be no international cotton agreement and no major
breakthroughs in cotton agronomy of man-made fiber technology, but that
cotton will benefit to some extent from currently planned, vastly expanded
programs in research and promotion by the International Institute for Cotton
and by cotton interests in the U.S. 1/ While the expenditures planned do
not match the current expenditures of man-made fiber interests for the
same purpose, the programs represent a significant departure from the
generally passive attitude of cotton producing countries and are likely
to have some positive impact on demand.
1/   For arguments supporting some of these assumptions see Working Paper
No. 48.

4.        Surplus on Ginning, Marketïng and Export of Inremental Output-
(a)  Ginnery Costs:  Ginning and Export Costs are shown in Table 3.
(b)  Export Prices:  Export prices for lint are based on projections
by the Bank's Economics Department. The projections are in
constant 1971 prices and take account of an expected increase
in staple length that will take place under the project.
The projected CIF price Europe is 30 USA/lb in 1971/72,
28.0 USé in 1972/73, 27 USi in 1973/74, and 26 USJ there-
after (see Table 4). For cotton seed a constant price of
US$108 per ton CIF Japan has been assumed.
Costs
5.        Costs are from the cost estimates shown in Annex 5 which themselves
are based on CFDT's breakdown of costs for the 1970/71 season. Costs in-
clude physical contingencies as described in para 5.01 of the main report but
exclude price contingencies and identifiable taxes.
6.        Cost of Agricultural Extension  -  The extension cost is shown
în Annex 5, Table 6. All extension costs incurred on cotton in the project

area are charged in full in the rate of return calculation. Direct taxes
on expenditures (21% -construction, 16Z - furniture and office equipment,
5% - vehicle purchases, rent and utilities, 15% - vehicle running costs)
have been deducted.
7.        Cost of Farm Inputs  -  The full unsubsidized cost of farm inputs
and implements is shown in Annex 5, Table 5. Only the part attributable
to the incremental production is charged in the rate of return calculation.
8.        Cost of Construction of New Ginneries  -  The full cost of the
two ginneries at Glazoue and Banikoara has been charged. Details are
given in Annex 5, Table 7. The costs of extending ginneries in Savalou
and Kandi which are not financed under the project but will be undertaken
by CFDT have been estimated at CFAF 70 million and CFAF 200 million
respectively and included as a project cost.
9.        Cost of Feeder Road Improvement  -  Details are given in Annex 5,
Table 8, and Annex 8.
10.       Research Expenditures  -  These expenditures include all salaries
and operating costs incurred through the activities of IRCT, IRAT and IRHO
under the project (see Annex 5, Table 9).
11.       Labor Costs  - No economic cost is attributed to farm labor in
view of the high level of underemployment in Dahomey and the absence of
other employment opportunities; and the fact that the labor requirements
would be met by family labor, and no hired labor will be required.
Project Life
12.       The life of the project is assumed to be 10 years which is about
half the estimated value of the principal capital investment, the new
ginneries.
Economic Rate of Return
13.       The economic rate of return for a 10-year project life is 34%;
With 10% lover benefits arising from a decline in yields and/or prices the
rate of return vould be 19%.
l sinmary table of the economic rate of return using alternative costs and
benefits is shown below:
