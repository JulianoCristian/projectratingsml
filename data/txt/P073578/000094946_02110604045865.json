in April 2002 to alleviate the impact\n            of rising unemployment due to the worsening economic crisis.\n            A stipend of 150 Argentine pesos per month is provided to an\n            unemployed head of household in exchange for participation\n            in 4 hours of work in a workfare subproject. There are four\n            project components. Component 1 comprises workfare\n            subprojects in community services, minor construction,\n            repair, expansion, maintenance or remodeling of schools,\n            health facilities, basic sanitation facilities, small roads\n            and bridges, culverts and canals, community kitchens and\n            centers, tourist centers, low-cost housing, and on a pilt\n            basis, some productive activities. There are two types of\n            subprojects: in the first, the program finances a share of\n            the cost of materials as well as benficiary payments; and\n            the second finances onlt the payment to the benficiaries.\n            Component 2 finances project administration. Component 3\n            funds supervision of the project's implementation at\n            the local level, including the supporting documentation for\n            beneficiary registration and the activities in which\n            beneficiaries are engaged.
