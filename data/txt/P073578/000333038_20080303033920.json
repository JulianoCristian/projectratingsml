the Argentina Jefes de\n            Hogar Program Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            satisfactory, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: (1) The Program, building on previously available\n            foundations, was effective to confront poverty in an\n            emergency situation. Despite the implementation issues it\n            faced, the Program did prevent beneficiaries from falling\n            into extreme poverty and successfully reached the poor. Its\n            dynamic targeting approach, through self-selection, was\n            probably more efficient to reach the poor during the crisis\n            than a static measure such as a proxy-means test. (2) During\n            times of crisis, a trade-off between orderly expansion of a\n            safety net and rapid coverage of the poor might arise. It is\n            unclear whether the decision to strengthen cash programs,\n            can result in a better crisis response that an integrated\n            strategy that relies on investments in social service\n            delivery. On the other hand, the reform of the latter may\n            take time to produce results and may thus not be a viable\n            strategy during the crisis. (2) Maintaining the nominal\n            level of the transfer is difficult politically but effective\n            to promote the transition to employment. As the economy\n            recovered and employment opportunities improved, the\n            transfer lost value and the widening gap between its level\n            and wages was an incentive for households to find other\n            income-generating activities, especially in the formal labor market."}, "docdt": "2007-09-27T00:00:00Z"}
