The four\n            project components include the financing of workfare\n            subprojects in community services, minor construction,\n            repair, expansion, maintenance or remodeling of schools,\n            health facilities, basic sanitation facilities, small roads\n            and bridges, culverts and canals, community kitchens and\n            centers, tourist centers, and low-cost housing. This report\n            focuses on the likely negative environmental impacts from\n            these subprojects and proposes measures to mitigate them.\n            Expected impacts to land and water include soil saturation\n            and salinization, water-borne diseases, an altering of the\n            lifestyle of affected people, surface and groundwater\n            contamination and the reduction of water quality because of\n            industrial and farm chemical use, the proliferation of algae\n            and undergrowth due to canal and waterway blockage, change\n            in the water table due to overuse, disturbance of aquatic\n            life, and erosion and sedimentation. Impacts caused by\n            constructing secondary roads in areas that receive a lot of\n            rain include flooding and erosion because of stripped\n            vegetation and inadequate drainage, and sedimentation in\n            surface waters. Road construction sites should be carefully\n            selected to avoid affecting critical forest areas and animal\n            habitats. The report recommends monitoring the nutrient\n            level of water, water discharge level, water salinity, water\n            use management, the conditions of canals and the drainage\n            system, flood controls, the presence of disease vectors,\n            erosion control, waste disposal, contaminant treatment,\n            measures to protect workers from hazardous substances,\n            waterway protections, demographic change in alluvial plains,\n            socioeconomic impacts, and institutional and technical\n            capacity of the agencies having oversight."}, "docdt": "2004-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
