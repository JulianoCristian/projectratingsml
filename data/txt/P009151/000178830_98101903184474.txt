INTERN1TTIONAL BAIK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOP1vENT
REPORT AND RECO10MENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTITVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOANT TO THE
SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
FOR A FIFTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $35.0 million to the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for a fifth highway project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.    The Bank has made 16 loans to Yugoslavia totaling $475 million.  Lend-
ing for highways has played an important part, and the proposed loan would
be the fifth for this sector. The highway sections included in the proposed
project constitute the third and last tranche of the highway construction
program submitted by the Government to the Bank in 1968. The first two
tranches are being financed by Bank loans of US $30 million (Loan 608-YU)
and US $40 million (Loan 678-YU). With this loan, Bank lending for highways
would rise to a total of US $150 million. The project was appraised in
September/October 1970. Negotiations were held in Washington in April 1971.
The Yugoslav delegation headed by Mr. Gavra Popovic, Assistant Federal Secre-
tary for Finance, included representatives from the Federal Government, the
Socialist Republics of Slovenia and Macedonia, the Socialist Autonomous
Province Kosovo and the Yugoslav Investment Bank.
3.    The following is a summary statement of Bank loans to Yugoslavia as
at April 30, 1971:                                      (US $ million)
Total (less cancellations)                           475.5
of which has been repaid to Bank and others       60.8
Total now outstanding                               414.7
Amount sold                     6.2
of which has been repaid   4.o                     2.2
Total now held by Bank                              412.5
Total undisbursed                                   162.9
A more detailed statement of loans to Yugoslavia, comments on the execution
of previous projects and reference to other current Bank operations and IFC
activities in Yugoslavia are given in my Report and Recommendation on a
proposed loan to Yugoslavia for the Ibar Multipurpose Water Project (P-94h4)
dated May 18, which is being distributed simultaneously.

PART III - THE PROJECT
5.    A report entitled "Appraisal of a Fifth Highway Project - Yugoslavia"
(PTR-73a) dated May-19, 1971, is attached. (No. 1)
6.    The fast rising demand for road transport in Yugoslavia, as a con-
sequence of the rapidly growing economy and particularly the increasing flow
of foreign tourists, has made the development of a modern and adequate road
system urgent. Until recently, the improvement of the road network lagged
seriously behind requirements mainly because road investment and maintenance
wiere given relatively low priority. Also, the decentralization of the high-
way administration after 1965 initially created problems in highway planning
and project preparation and in the coordination of the activities of the
various highway organizations to whom most responsibility of the Federal
administration had been transferred. Recently considerable progress has
been made in this respect and the project would help to meet current needs



in two ways: (i) by assisting in the construction of five priority highway
sections, and (ii) by directly helping the Road Funds and Councils of all
Republics and Provinces to improve their highway planning, administration,
project preparation and overall coordination.
7.    The construction part of the project would comprise five highway sections
in Macedonia, Slovenia and Kosovo totaling about 153 km.  In Macedonia, con-
struction of two-lane sections between Skopje and Tetovo (36 km) and between
Kicevo and St. Razmo (54 km) would complete to modern paved standards four
sections of the 255 km-long "Western Road"' from Skopje to the Albanian and
Greek border, which has in part already been financed under the Third Highway
Project. The inadequate condition of these road sections has hindered the
development of the agricultural, forest, mining and tourism potential of
this area. The two project sections in Slovenia, a four-lane divided ex-
pressway between Postojna and Razdrto (9 km) and the first twfo lanes of a
four-lane divided expressway from Hoce to Levec (49 km) are part of European
Highway E93 which affords access to Austria and to Italy. These sections are
part of the phased replacement of the inadequate existing road over the
next 10 to 15 years with a four-lane divided expressway, operated as a toll
road. The 5 km long project section between Kosovo Polje and Pristina would
fill the only gap in a new two-lane paved road between Pec and Pristina in
the Province Kosovo, which the Bank is helping to finance under the Fourth
Highway Project. The existing road section is often flooded and has neither
shoulders nor adequate foundation.
8.   Total construction costs, including supervision and contingencies, are
estimated at $84.4 million.  This amount does not include expenditures for
the construction or improvement of access and connecting roads, estimated at
$1.2 million, which will be completed at the same time as the project.
9.    The proposed loan would be the Bank's first highway loan to Yugoslavia
to include the financing of non-construction items, i.e. engineering equip-
ment, consulting services not related to construction supervision and staff
training abroad. The equipment would be used to improve the collection of
traffic data, control of motor vehicle weights and methods of project prepara-
tion. The principal purposes of the consultants services would be to estab-
lish uniform guideli nes for the preparation of pre-feasibility and feasibility
studies and to assist the Republics and Provinces in reviewing the status
of preparation of a selected group of major highway projects, including a
preliminary evaluation of their economic priority, and in supervising or
carrying out the preparation of feasibility studies for those projects. The
training abroad of staff members of the Road Funds and Councils and of other
institutions should help improve the work of these institutions in traffic
and maintenance engineering and transportation economics
and accounting. The total cost of the equipment purchases, consulting services
and staff training (including contingencies) is estimated at $3.7 million.
10.   Since the Third and Fourth Higlhway Loans the Bank has emphasized the
need to improve highway planning, administration and project preparation and
to establish an efficient instrument for coordinating these activities on a
country-wide basis. Inclusion of the three non-construction parts in the



project marks a major step forward in this direction. For the purpose of
carrying out these parts of the project, the Republics and Provinces would
designate one qualified institution which would act on their behalf. Further-
more, an important outcome of recent meetings between the Road Funds and
Councils has been a tentative agreement on establishing a Council of the
Republican and Provincial Road Organizations to review mutual problems and
coordinate the work of its members. Formal approval of this agreement is
now being considered by all Republics and Provinces.
11.   Of the proposed loan of $35 million, $2.9 million would cover the
foreign expenditures for imported equipment, consulting services and staff
training and the estimated foreign exchange component (40 percent) of equip-
ment which may be procured locally. The remaining $32.1 million would repre-
sent about 38 percent of the construction cost of the project (including
supervision and contingencies), the balance, including any cost overruns,
being provided from various internal sources. In the estimate of the most
probable foreign exchange component of the construction cost it has been
assumed that following full international competitive bidding, all con-
struction contracts would be won by Yugoslav firms, wqhich has been the ex-
perience under the previous highway loans to Yugoslavia. This would result
in a foreign exchange component of 34 percent or $28.6 million. The proposed
loan is therefore expected to finance also $3.5 million of local currency
expenditures. Highway development has high priority in Yugoslavia. Due to
the competitiveness of Yugoslav manufacturing and construction enterprises,
highway and other infrastructure projects have relatively low foreign ex-
change components. Were the Bank to confine its lending to the foreign ex-
change costs of projects, the desirable level of Bank investment in Yugoslavia
would only be achieved either by financing projects of lesser priority or by
spreading the lending over a large number of projects. The Bank's contri-
bution of 38 percent to the financing of the construction costs compares with
a contribution of 40 percent and 41 percent respectively under the Third and
Fourth Highway Loans.
12.   The proposed loan would be made to the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia which would relend that portion allocated to construction to the
Socialist Republics of Macedonia and Slovenia and to the Socialist Autonomous
Province Kosovo through Subsidiary Loan Agreements on substantially the same
terms as the Bank loan. The Federation would conclude a single Relending
Agreement with all Republics and Provinces concerning that portion of the
loan allocated to the non-construction parts of the project.
13.   Consultants would be selected and staff training carried out according
to procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for equipment estimated to
cost $10,000 or more and most construction contracts would be awarded after
international competitive bidding. About $2.3 million of preparatory construc-
tion works for the Hoce-Levec section in Slovenia would be carried out by
prequalified local contractors because these works involve numerous small
relocations of drainage and irrigation structures and would not be attractive
to foreign firms. An additional advantage of this procedure is that it would
permit completion of these works at an early date and so reserve the full
construction season of next year for the main works.



.14.   Traffic on each of the five Droject sections is expected to grow
by 1D to 15 percent per annum in the next few years. This forecast is
based on past traffic trends, recent origin-and-destination studies, and
projections of production, tourism and per capita income in the zones of
influence of the project. It is estimated that the individual project
sections would yield rates of return varying from 15-20 percent. These
rates take into account only savings in road maintenance and in vehicle
operating costs.
PART IV - THE ECONQI4Y
15.   A report entitled "Ourrent Economic Position and Prospects of
Yugoslavia" (EvIA-33a), dated May 14, 1971, is being distributed separately
to the Executive Directors. A discussion of Yugoslavia's economic prob-
lems and prospects and of th-e Bank s role in assisting development in Yugos-
lavia is contained in my Report and Recorxiendation on t^he Ibar lAiatipurpose
W.!ater Project (P-944)1, da.ted Nay 18, 1971, which is being distributed simul-
taneously. A basic data sheet is annexed.
PART V - LBGAL INSTRTIJTTS AND AUTHORITY
16.   The draft Lcan Agreement between the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section V(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed separately to the
Er.ecutive Directors. The draft Loan Agreement contains the Borrower's
obligation to enter into (i) Subsidiary Loan Agreements with the Socialist
Republics of Nacedonia and Slovenia and the Socialist Autonomous Province
Kosovo providing for the relending of the proceeds of the loan allocated
to construction and (ii) a Relending Agreement with all iRepublics and Pro-
vinces providing for the relending of the proceeds of the loan allocated to
the other parts of the project. The substantive undertakings of each Sub-
sidiary Borrower (to be included in the respective Subsidiary Loan Agree-
ments) and of all Republics and Provinces (to be included in the Relending
Agreement) are set forth in detail in Articles IV and V of the draft Loan
Agreement.  The execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements and of the Re-
lending Agreement and the passing of a Decision on Financing by each Sub-
sidiary Borrower regarding the construction works will be conditions of
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement.
17.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan wiould comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMbENDATION
18.    I reccmmend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
