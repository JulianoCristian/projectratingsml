INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECCMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO FIJI FOR A FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Fiji for the equivalent of U.S. $11.8 million to assist in financing highway
construction and related consultant services. The loan would be for a term of
24h-years including 4h-years of grace, with interest at 7½ percent per annum.
PART I - BANK GROUP RELATIONS
2.        In 1967, the Government of the United Kingdom requested the Bank to
send a general economic mission to Fiji. In addition to reviewing the overall
economic prospects of the country, the mission identified several possible
future projects for Bank financing, including the Suva-Nadi highway project
which was in an early stage of preparation. A second Bank mission visited
Fiji in August 1970 to review Fiji's Five-Year Development Program (1971-75)
and to assess the country's prospects for development as an independent
nation.   The mission concluded that the country would be creditworthy for
borrowing on Bank terms. Shortly after attaining independence in October
1970, Fiji applied for membership in the Bank and IDA and on May 28, 1971
officially became the 116th member of the Bank. Fiji expects to become a
member of IDA soon and is considering joining IFC.
3.        The proposed loan would be the Bankts first operation in Fiji.   No
other loans are expected to be presented to the Executive Directors in the
near future, but a Bank loan for a small telecommunications project is under
consideration for presentation in the latter part of FY 1972.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
4.        Fiji attained independence on October 10, 1970 as a Dominion within
the British Commonwealth, after nearly 100 years of colonial status. The new
constitution established a parliamentary system of government and an electoral
system designed to protect the interest of the various ethnic groups within
the populationi (Indian 50%; Fijian 42%; and others, mainly Chinese and
European, 8%). In the pre-independence election the Alliance Party, based
essentially on Fijian, Chinese and European support, gained political power
which it has exercised with caution and moderation. The first post-independence
elections are due to take place in March 1972. The transfer of political power
has been accompanied by a program of local recruitment at all levels of govern-
ment which has helped to ensure the effective administration of the country after
independence.
5.        A report, "The Economic Prospects of Fiji" (EAP-18a), was circulated
to the Executive Directors on November 3, 1970. A Country Data sheet isat Annex I.
The economic structure of Fiji is much more complex than its small population
of about one-half million might suggest. Onto the typical South Pacific
copra economr has been grafted an efficient smallholder sugar industry
established with indentured labor in the 19th century. There is also a wide
range of other crops, a number of medium and small-scale industries compatible
with market size, some mineral development and a developed services sector



- 2-
within which tourism now has a leading role. Average income levels are
relatively high (per capita GNP $410), but there are wide differences
among regions and ethnic groups.
6.        GNP has been growing at an average annual rate of 5 percent over
the last five years, while per capita income has grown by 2.3 percent, as the
result of a decline in population growth from 3.0 percent in 1965 to 2.4 percent
in 1970 following the introduction of an effective family planning program.
A large part of the increase in national production has gone into increased
savings and investment, gross investment in real terms growing by 13 percent
per annum to an estimated 28 percent of GNP in 1970. A burgeoning tourist
industry and some agricultural diversification has tended to reduce the
economry's depeindence on sugar. Tourism revenue increased from U.S. $9.8
million in 1966 to U.S. $28 million in 1970, compared to 1970 earnings from
sugar exports of about U.S. $36 million.   Foreign exchange earnings from
tourism and sugar represent about 12 and 17 percent of GNP, respectively.
The Government's fiscal performance has been generally satisfactory. Due
to inci-eased collection of customs duties and income taxes, Government revenue
as a share of GDP has risen from 19 to 22 percent during the last four years.
There has been a moderate increase in prices from an annual average of 1.7
percent during 1965-68 to 5 percent in 1969 and 6 percent in 1970. The
Government is concerned about this trend and is taking steps to curb
inflationary pressures.
7.        Fiji is highly dependent on foreign trade, as is indicated by the
high ratios of exports and imports to GNP which are about 25 and 38 percent,
respectively. With the expansion of investment and rising incomes, imports, rising
by nearly a third in the last three years, have grown faster than exports with
a consequent widening of the trade deficit. This has been largely financed,
however, by increased tourist receipts and private capital inflows, reflecting
active foreign interest in private investments in Fiji. Despite the current
deficits, reserves increased in 1969 and dropped only slightly in 1970. This
pattern of trade deficits, largely covered by receipts from tourism and other
services and by private capital, seems likely to continue for the next several
years, although public investment (see para. 10 below) will require some
external financing.    Public foreign borrowing hitherto has been minimal and
the debt service ratio is expected to be about 3 percent in 1975.
8.        The agricultural sector has until recently been able to absorb most
workers unable to find wage employment. However, recorded unemployment rose
from 4.2 percent in 1966 to over 6 percent in 1970 due mainly to the rapid
growth in the working population. At the same time, there is a serious
shortage of technical skills. The Government has established a Manpower
Resource Council to study the employment question and is also taking steps to
expand opportunities for technical and on-the-job training. Particular
attention will have to be given in the future to the needs of the Fijian people
who have in thew past depended on a subsistence agriculture, but will in growing
numbers be seeking employment in other sectors as pressure on the land increases
and economic expectations continue to rise. The Government has instituted a
rural development program under a Commission for Rural Development, which is
designed to coordinate various Government and local rural development efforts.
The Government has also recognized that the longer run solution to the
employment problems depends on an active family planning program and, largely
as a result of an effective campaign begun in 1963, birth rates have declined



-3-
from 34.9 in 1966 to 29.0 per thousand in 1969.
9.        Shortly after independence, a major economic issue confronted the
Government when the Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) decided to divest itself
of its 98 percent ownership in South Pacific Sugar Mills (SPSM), the sole
sugar milling company in Fiji. This decision was brought about by an
arbitral award in connection with a dispute between SPSM and the sugar
growers in Fiji which the company felt would make it difficult to maintain
profitable operations. After protracted negotiations, the Government has
reached a settlement with SPSM under which the Government will take over
the company's assets in 1973 for US$15.7 million, more than half of which
will be financed by a loan from the company repayable over 15 years. CSR will
continue to supply the necessary management and marketing assistance. This
agreement will allow for continuity of sugar processing and marketing in
Fiji and the financial terms should not impose a serious burden on the
balance of payments.
10.       The Government's strategy for economic development is formulated
in the Si Ah Development Plan, l971-75. As in earlier plans, the core
of the Plan will be the Government investment program, which is projected to be
in the order of US$86.2 million over a five-year period. The Plan forecasts
a substantial expansion in public infrastructure facilities, the need for
which has been created by the steady growth of the economr in recent years,
and public infrastructure investment is projected at U.S.$34.5 million, or more
than double the level of the previous five years. Within the framework of a
projected 6.7 percent annual growth in the domestic product, tourist-related
services are postulated as the leading sector with a growth rate of 20 percent
per annum.  On the demand side, growth of private consumption is expected to
lag behind income growth while investment is projected to grow by about 10
percent per annum, exceeding 30 percent of GNP in 1975.
11.       The Plan is broadly in line with economic priorities but somewhat
ambitious in its overall growth projections. The best development prospects
are undoubtedly in tourism, but the average growth in tourism may be somewhat
slower than the rate projected in the Plan, which would imply a very substantial
increase in hotel accommodations. Sugar production is likely to remain at about
present levels as no major changes in Fiji's International Quota Agreements are
expected. While copra production should increase rapidly as a result of
replanting programs, development of other lines of production is hindered by
Fiji's small size and comparatively high labor costs. Since tourism and
related services may expand somewhat less rapidly than forecast in the Plan,
growth during the Plan period will probably continue at about the 5 percent rate
maintained over the last several years. This rate of growth would imply
government investment for the Plan period of about US$69 million, while total
investment would be about 26 percent of GNP compared with the 30 percent
projected. The need for external financing for the public sector from 1971
to 1975 is estimated to be about US$40 million.
12.       Official aid flows have in the past come largely from the United
Kingdom in the form of Commonwealth and Development Welfare grants, which
amounted on a disbursement basis to about US$2.0 million per annum. It
is expected that the United Kingdom will continue to provide about the same
level of assistance at least for the next few years in the form of concessional
loans. The Asian Development Bank has made a technical assistance grant for



- 4
consulting services for the Fiji Development Bank and is considering
providing assistance to the agricultural, education and power sectors.
Australia is providing a small amount of grant assistance under its South
Pacific assistance program and Fiji may also be able to raise loans on the
Australian market as it has in the past. The Bank has agreed to serve as
Executing Age,ncy for a UNDP-financed tourism survey which will provide a
master plan f'or the long-term development of tourism in Fiji in accordance
with the overall economic and social interests of the country. The master
plan can be expected to provide the basis for tourism projects suitable for
Bank Group consideration. Transportation and telecommunications, as noted
in para. 3, are also sectors in which Bank lending would be appropriate.
PART III - THE PROJECT
Sectoral Background
13.       Fiji's strategic location on the main sea and air routes which
link Australia and New Zealand with North America have ensured good external
communications. As Fiji is composed of a large number of islands, internal
communications are less satisfactory; many of the islands have rugged
mountainous terrain of volcanic origin and as a result land transport has
been limited mainly to coastal roads.   Fiji's highway network totals about
1,650 miles, of which only 105 miles of main road and 18 miles of secondary
road are paved. About 1,000 miles of this network are on the main island
of Viti Levu; the principal element is the main road around this island
which includes the link from Suva, the capital and main seaport, and Nadi,
the site of the international airport (see map). This link is currently
served by a narrow, winding gravel road of low standard.
14.       Between 1960 and 1969, Fiii's motor fleet grew at about 9 percent
per annum from about 6,600 to 14,500 vehicles.   About half the vehicles are
registered in Suva and its suburbs and about three-quarters of all registered
vehicles are in the area of the road to be reconstructed under this project.
Despite the st;eady growth in traffic, total annual road expenditures have
remained pract;ically stationary at a level of about US$3.5 million during the
last five years. Annual income from taxes on the import of vehicles and vehicle
supplies and f'rom vehicle license fees not only covered annual maintenance and
administrative costs but also contributed substantially to financing new road
investments. Additional funds were obtained from the United Kingdom in
the form of Development and Welfare grants. The Plan provides for a sharp
increase in highway investment for the period 1971-75 averaging about US$4.6
million per arnum, compared with annual investments of US$1.5 million during
the previous f'ive-year period.  This increase is due principally to the
expected improvement in the Suva-Nadi road and after its completion in 1976
or 1977 total road expenditures are expected to decline to nearer the current
level. As highway income is expected to increase only modestly during the
Plan period, the Governrment hopes to obtain additional financing from the
Bank and the United Kingdom.
Project Description
15.       A report entitled "tAppraisal of a First Highway Project: Fiji"
(PTR-714 has been circulated separately. A Loan and Project Summary is
at Annex II. The genesis of the project goes back to 1965 when the Government



5
of Fiji asked the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to finance a
comprehensive survey of its transportation system. The survey, which was
completed in 1968, recommended transportation investments of US$43 million
over a 10-year period, two-thirds of this amount to be allocated to the
construction of roads including the reconstruction of the Suva-Nadi highway.
A British consulting firm, Rendel, Palmer and Tritton (RPT), prepared the
feasibility study for the road and completed the detailed engineering in
December 1970. The Bank appraisal mission which visited Fiji in August 1970
recommended that the Bank help to finance the two end sections of the road,
the 41-mile link between Korotogo and Nadi, including the 1½J> mile Nadi bypass,
and the 26-mile link between Suva and Deuba, but that construction of the
63-mile central section be deferred until such time as traffic levels had
increased sufficiently to justify the investment. At Suva, additional
facilities for traffic distribution between the project road and the city
will be required by 1980. A Government-financed land use transportation
study of the Suva region is being undertaken by consultants and the
Government has agreed to take steps in consultation with the Bank to
provide facilities for the distribution of traffic from the project road
into Suva. The combined capacity of these facilities will be adequate
for the forecast traffic until after 1990.
16.       The 26-mile Suva-Deuba section of the project road passes through
high rainfall areas where cattle are raised and timber is produced. There
is high potential for tourism development in Deuba, where an expansion of
tourism facilities is already underway. The 41-mile section of the project
road between Nadi and Korotogo, traverses a major sugar cane producing area.
It will connect the Sigatoka Valley, which has good possibilities for
increased vegetable production, with Nadi and the northwest, and will also
link the international airport at Nadi with Natadola Harbor which is only
30 miles away and is considered to have the greatest potential for tourism
development in Viti Levu. The alignment of the two sections of the highway
has been designed to preserve as far as possible beach and scenic areas which
are particularly promising for future tourism development.
17.       The total cost of the project including consultants services for design
and supervision is estimated to be US$16.6 million, including a foreign exchange
component of about US$11.8 million, which represents about 70 percent of the tota
project cost and would be covered by the proposed loan. The Government would
provide the local currency costs of the project from funds earmarked for this
purpose in its development budget.    The cost estimates for road construction
were prepared by RPT on the basis of completed detailed engineering and include
suitable contingency allowances to cover variations in the physical quantities
of construction and price escalation.    A further 10 percent allowance has been
added in view of the fact that there is no history of major road contracts
in Fiji on which to base project cost estimates.    If the bid evaluations show
that this provision is unnecessary, the corresponding amount of the Bank loan
(US$800,000) would be cancelled. The proposed loan would provide US$600,000
for retroactive financing of the foreign exchange costs of detailed engineering
of the Suva-Nadi highway incurred between November 1969 and December 1970.



-6-
18.       The Ministry of Communications, Works and Tourism (MCWT), the
Government department which would administer this project, is responsible
for all public works, post and telecommunication   tourism, marine transport-
ation and aviation in Fiji. These functions are assigned to three Secretariats,
with the Secretary for Works being responsible for all public works including
public roads. Road planning, design, materials testing and general control
of equipment and construction operations are handled at the headquarters through
the Undersecretary for Engineering, while road maintenance is controlled by
three District Engineers who report to the Deputy Secretary for Works. Given
the small size of the country and the correspondingly low volume of public
works there is no need for the creation of a separate public works department.
MCWT is a fairly efficient organization and, with the assistance of supervision
consultants provided for under the project, would be able to administer the
project effectively. MCWT does require some assistance in transportation
planning and the techniques of project evaluation. At the request of the Govern-
ment, the Commonwealth Secretariat has agreed to provide grant assistance for
the services of a transportation economist who would advice MCWT on the methods
of determining the priority, size and timing of future investments in the
trrnisportation sector. The Government has undertaken to consult with the Bank
on the appointment to this position, which is expected to be made shortly.
19.       MCWT's record of maintaining the highway network has been good;
excellent central workshops located in Suva have full maintenarnce and overhaul
facilities for the MCWT fleet and district and subdistrict workshops are
adequately equipped and staffed for routine maintenance and repair works. The
maintenance performance is particularly creditable, when the difficult
conditions in Fiji are taken into account. These include a wide range of
rainfall patterns, scarcity of suitable gravels at many locations, mountain-
ous terrain where difficult soil conditions are encountered and relatively
high traffic volumes operating over gravel surfaces. Per mile expenditure
on maintenance is therefore high: about F$930 (US$670/km) in 1965 and
F$7h5 (US$540/km) in 1969. While part of the recent decline in per mile
maintenance expenditure is due to a growing proportion of sealed roads in
the network, the Government has become concerned about the downward trend
and has included increased funds for this pu:pose in the 1971-75 Plan and
given assurances that it would provide sufficient funds to ensure adequate
maintenance of its highway network.    MCWT has recently initiated efforts to
improve planning of future maintenance activities. Particular attention is
being given to improving methods for determining actual costs of different
maintenance operations and preparing a road inventory to which such costs could
be linked. The Government has given assurances that it would continue efforts
to improve road maintenance planning and employ consultants for specialized
assistance after consultation with the Bank should this prove necessary.
20.       The Government has provided assurances that timely action would
be taken to acquire the land required for project construction. The
Constitution (Statutory Amendments) Order 1970 provided new procedures for
Government acquisition of land required for public purposes.   The Government
initiated steps in January 1971 to acquire the land required for the project
and has made excellent progress during the last four months. As of May 1, 1971,
the Government; had secured the signature of consent agreements providing
assured title to 88 percent of the required land on the Nadi-Kototogo section
and 77 percent; on the Suva-Deuba section, with agreement in principle reached
for an additional 13 percent of the land required for this latter section.



- 7 -
While there remain one or two cases involving small amounts of land which may
have to be resolved in court, acquisition of the remaining land required for
the project is not expected to cause any delay in project construction.
21.       The two sections of the project road lend themselves to separate
construction contracts, which would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. It is expected that they would be won by foreign
contractors, since there are no local contractors capable of undertaking
work of this nature. Contracts for a 36-month period could be awarded during
the fourth quarter of calendar 1W71 and a further 12-month period should be
sufficient for final payments to be made and claims resolved.
22.       The project has high priority and would provide considerable direct
and indirect benefits to the economr. The main direct quantifiable benefits
would result from vehicle operating cost savings and on this basis the overall
economic rate of return of the project is estimated to be about 18 percent over
a 20-year period: 17 percent for the Suva-Deuba section and 19 percent for the
Nadi-Korotogo section. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the project remains
economically justified over any likely range of variations in construction
costs, traffic growth and vehicle operating costs. The indirect benefits of
the project to the tourism and agriculture sectors would also be considerable,
though these have not been quantified. The construction of the project road is
expected to encourage a substantial increase in hotel investment which has
in the past been constrained by the lack of good road connections. The
construction of the project road would also contribute to increased agricultural
production by providing farmers, particularly in the Sigatoka Valley, with
improved access to major market areas.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Fiji, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The covenants contained in
the draft Loan Agreement are those common to most highway projects.
2h.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
25.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
