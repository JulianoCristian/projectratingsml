Accountability of Social Sectors (PASS) in\n            the Dominican Republic (DR). This operation is being as the\n            second of a series of three sequential programmatic\n            operations. The strategic vision of the PASS is to improve\n            results in social sectors (mainly social protection,\n            education and health), preserving in the short term, and\n            enhancing in the medium term, the human capital of the\n            poorest citizens. Consistent with this vision, the PASS has\n            four inter-related objectives: 1) to enhance the performance\n            of social sectors to promote human capital (health,\n            nutrition, and education) for the poorest citizens, through\n            a fundamental redesign of the Government's Conditional\n            Cash Transfers (CCT) program, and its articulation with\n            critical actions in health and education; 2) to improve\n            budget management to support the joint performance of the\n            social sector within the CCT program; 3) to support the\n            gradual introduction of performance agreements in key social\n            sector agencies; and 4) to enhance transparency and\n            oversight in social sectors."}, "docdt": "2010-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
