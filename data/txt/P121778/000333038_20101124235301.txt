                      Accountability of Social Sectors (PASS)

                              SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION*

                             Meeting of the Executive Directors
                                    November 23, 2010

The Executive Directors approved a loan to the Dominican Republic for the Second
Development Policy Loan (DPL) on Performance and Accountability of Social Sectors (PASS)
in the amount of US$150 million on the payment terms and conditions set out in the President's
Memorandum (IBRD/ R2010-0262, dated October 27, 2010).

Executive Directors expressed broad support for the project, which would deepen the social
policy and public management reforms initiated by the Government in the context of the first
DPL. They welcomed the transformation of the Solidaridad program from a de facto
unconditional cash transfer program to an integrated conditional transfer program. The project
would continue to improve results in the social sectors, especially in education, health and
nutrition, enhance human capital of the poorest, while also strengthening accountability and
transparency of public expenditures. Finally, Directors encouraged staff to continue the close
coordination with donors, notably the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the European Union.
