         and Accountability of Social Sectors Development Policy\n            Loans for Dominican Republic had a satisfactory outcome with\n            the moderate risk to development outcome and satisfactory\n            performances by both the bank and borrower. The lessons\n            learned include: (1) the programmatic development policy\n            approach proved to be a suitable instrument for this\n            intervention. (2) The process for transforming a system of\n            subsidy transfers into a proper CCT is complex and it needs\n            careful design and planning. (3) Implementation of an\n            M&E system, covering a decentralized system of service\n            providers, is very complex, takes time, and needs a strong\n            managerial leadership. (4) Reducing the number of policy\n            actions agreed in each operation was useful to have a more\n            manageable program. (5) Having a multi-sectorial team was\n            critical to achieving synergies; working across sectors can\n            reinforce results. (6) A real programmatic approach that\n            builds on complementarities with other Bank simultaneous\n            interventions was highly helpful. (7) A combination of an\n            impending crisis, relevant analytical work, and political\n            leadership provided strong entry points to define an\n            ambitious reform agenda. (8) The extra effort demanded by\n            the implementation of a complex DPL program was more than\n            compensated by achieving a wide range of reforms in a short\n            period of time."}, "docdt": "2013-05-30T00:00:00Z"}
