Borrower                 Government of the Dominican Republic
Implementing Agency      MINISTRY OF FINANCE
Financing Data           IBRD Loan Amount: US$150 million
                         Terms: Commitment-linked Fixed-Spread Loan (FSL) with all the conversion
                         options, payable in 22 years, including a 7-year grace period, with a custom
                         repayment schedule with repayments on each March 15th and September 15th
                         respectively.
Operation Type           Second operation of a series of three proposed Programmatic Development Policy
                         Loans.
Main Policy Areas        1. Social Protection
                         2. Health (Primary Healthcare) and Education Policy
                         3. Quality and Efficiency of Public Spending
Key Outcome Indicators   1. Enhanced performance of social sectors to promote human capital for the poor
                         (*) By end of 2012, at least 90 percent of CCT Solidaridad transfers are paid
                         based on the timely verification of compliance with co-responsibilities.
                         (*) Increased share of CCT beneficiary households who invest in human capital
                         formation, as measured by:
                              (*) An increase in CCT Solidaridad beneficiary households who comply with
                              health and nutrition co-responsibilities.
                              (*) An increase in the share of students from Solidaridad beneficiary
                              households who are enrolled in and attending pre-primary, basic and
                              secondary education.
                         2. Improved budget management for enhanced performance of the social sectors
                         linked to the CCT Solidaridad. Specifically:
                         (*) The difference between the allocated budget and the actual budget to cover the
                         supply gaps in health, nutrition, and education services within Solidaridad will be
                         less than or equal to the difference between the approved overall national budget
                         and the actual budget in relative terms.
                         (*) The difference between the quarterly agreed disbursement schedule
                         (Scheduled Quota) to cover the supply gaps in health, education and nutrition, and
                         the actual funds that are received by the social sectors on a quarterly basis will be
                         reduced.
                         3. Gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in social sectors
                         (*) Increase in the number of priority programs in health, nutrition, and education
                         related to Solidaridad         that have successfully developed the log-frame
                         methodology, which implies the development of objectives, baselines, goals and
                         indicators at different levels.
                         4. Enhanced transparency and civil society oversight
                         (*) An increase in the number of registered users (At least 60 by end of 2012) and
                         annual hits to the online information search program for the national budget,
                         Consulta Amigable (At least 1,500 by end of 2012).

                                                   1
Program Development         The PASS has four inter-related objectives: (i) to enhance the performance of
Objective(s) and            social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition, and education) for the
Contribution to CAS         poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government's Conditional
                            Cash Transfers (CCT) program, Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical
                            actions in health and education; (ii) to improve budget management to support the
                            performance of these social sectors within the CCT program; (iii) to support the
                            gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in social sectors; and (iv) to
                            enhance transparency and accountability to users by strengthening the enabling
                            environment for a better informed demand for improved public sector
                            performance in the social domain.

                            The PASS is consistent with the central pillar of the CPS which calls for
                            "reducing vulnerability while producing results for all." Specifically, it helps
                            preserve and enhance the human assets of the poor (health and education) by
                            supporting a meaningful shift in social policy from social assistance to the
                            protection and promotion of human capital. It also enhances accountability both
                            within government agencies, and between government agencies and the public.
Risks and Risk Mitigation   Economic risk: Actual recovery remains largely dependent on improvements
                            in the volatile external environment (including the notable risk of a
                            potentially widespread global debt crisis). Crisis recoveries in the DR have
                            historically been swift, but highly regressive, with lasting negative impacts on
                            the poor. If the global economic recovery were to be shorter or weaker than
                            expected, the DR could still face a deterioration of growth performance.
                            Mitigation: While current economic risks remain substantial, mitigating factors
                            include strong, resilient economic growth with positive developments in certain
                            sectors. The Government has also strengthened its macro-management policies,
                            including growth in the size and sophistication of the domestic debt market and
                            improved financial and bank supervision.

                            Risk that in an effort to meet fiscal targets, the Government might cut
                            expenditures in the social areas, which would threaten the timely
                            implementation of critical reforms linked to this PASS DPL series.

                            Mitigation: The World Bank team continues to monitor this risk closely. Some of
                            the policy actions supported by the PASS Program aim at protecting social
                            expenditures targeted to the poor (See Pillar II for example).

                            Risks linked to the Haiti earthquake of January 2010: the contraction of
                            demand from Haiti, the second largest destination market of Dominican exports,
                            as well as unexpected expenses to help Haiti could produce some negative
                            consequences.

                            Mitigation: The Government does not expect major pressures on education
                            services but pressures on the demand for health services have been observed with
                            fiscal consequences, though no figures are currently available. If well-managed,
                            in the medium-term reconstruction efforts could generate additional demand for
                            Dominican goods and services.




                                                     2
               A higher than expected deficit in the electricity sector could potentially affect
               Government solvency and contribute to a fiscal financing gap.
               Mitigation: Significant negative consequences are not expected from this risk,
               unless the deficit increases enough to affect the overall deficit. The Government is
               currently implementing administrative measures to raise revenues and reduce
               expenditures, with active IMF support and monitoring in this area.

               The risk of a possible shift in institutional priorities over time, exacerbated by
               intersectoral coordination challenges within the Government.
               Mitigation: The reforms supported by the PASS programs have benefitted from
               strong Government ownership at high levels. Regarding the CCT reform, inherent
               difficulties linked to intersectoral coordination did occur but they have been
               mitigated, as anticipated, by: (i) the institutionalization of the major committees
               that now oversee the implementation of the redesigned CCT program, including
               the CCT Intersectoral and Interagency Committees; (ii) incentives for social
               agencies to jointly deliver results for the CCT program, through the budget
               management reform supported by the PASS; and (iii) active donor coordination
               efforts (especially WB-IADB).

               Institutional and administrative capacity and financial constraints to
               implement the targeted reforms.
               Mitigation: This risk is being mitigated by the activities and resources of the
               Programmatic NLTAs on Social Sectors and Quality of Public Expenditures, the
               Social Protection Investment Loan (SPIL) Project, IADB multi-phase investment
               loan, and GPF grant financing.

               Vulnerability to multiple natural disaster risks--particularly floods and
               hurricanes.
               Mitigation: Damages to the major private sector enterprises are partly covered
               by their own insurance. World Bank assistance covers natural disaster risk
               mitigation under the US$80 million Emergency Recovery and Disaster
               Management Loan. The strengthening of the CCT Solidaridad, Program through
               this loan can also help to mitigate the impact of disasters on the poorest.

              PROPOSED SECOND DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
        ON PERFORMANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF SOCIAL SECTORS
                      TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC


                                      I.    INTRODUCTION


1.      This document describes the proposed program for a Second Development Policy
Loan (DPL2) aimed at improving Performance and Accountability of Social Sectors
(PASS) in the Dominican Republic (DR). This operation is being proposed as the second of a
series of three sequential programmatic operations. The strategic vision of the PASS is to
improve results in social sectors (mainly social protection, education and health), preserving in
the short term, and enhancing in the medium term, the human capital of the poorest citizens.
Consistent with this vision, the PASS has four inter-related objectives: (i) to enhance the
performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition, and education) for the
poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government's Conditional Cash
Transfers (CCT) program, Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions in health and
education; (ii) to improve budget management to support the joint performance of the social
sector within the CCT program; (iii) to support the gradual introduction of Performance
Agreements in key social sector agencies; and (iv) to enhance transparency and oversight in
social sectors.

                                II.        COUNTRY CONTEXT


II.1 RECENT MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

2.      The political context in the Dominican Republic remains relatively stable given the
re-election of President Fernandez of the Dominican Liberation Party (Partido de la
Liberación Dominicana, PLD) in May 2008 and the expansion of support for the
administration with the PLD gains in the May 2010 Congressional elections. The Fernandez
Administration (which served from 1996-2000 and consecutively now since August 2004) has
maintained a Congressional majority that has supported its policy reforms and initiatives,
including a significant commitment to social cohesion and poverty reduction.

3.       The Dominican Republic has shown positive macroeconomic signs in mitigating the
effects of the international financial crisis, though a few critical areas of weakness remain.
In 2008, the early impact of the crisis reduced economic growth to 5.3 percent, down from 8.5
percent in 2007, though still above the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) regional average of
4.6 percent for 2008. Economic growth further declined in 2009, to 3.5 percent, with the lowest
point occurring in the first quarter of 2009, at 1.0 percent. The second half of 2009 showed mild
economic recovery, with quarterly average growth of five percent. Preliminary estimates for the
first half of 2010 showed accelerated growth of seven percent (see Figure 1).

4.       Recent growth has been driven by positive developments in some sectors, though
other key sectors face longer-term structural problems that will continue to impact growth
beyond the crisis. While GDP growth slowed to 3.5 percent in 2009, construction expanded by
19.4 percent, commerce by 15.7 percent, farming by 9.6 percent, energy and water by 9.5
percent, and manufacturing by 9.3 percent. Conversely, structural factors linked to the decline of
the mining sector and the end of the Multi-Fiber agreement in 2005 led to significant decreases
in employment, particularly in the export processing zones (See Section II.2 on employment
issues).
5.      A number of improving domestic and external factors have supported economic
growth in the DR. An accommodative monetary policy stance led to a significant reduction in
commercial bank lending rates. This, in turn, led to an increase of private sector credit. The
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF, together with additional budget support from the
World Bank and the IADB, facilitated the implementation of a counter-cyclical fiscal policy.
This policy­consisting especially of an expansion of the public investment spending­started at
the end of 2009 and continued through the first half of 2010. Early global recovery, with its
positive effects on remittances, tourism, trade and financial conditions, supported growth in the
DR (see Figure 2 and Figure 3).

6.      Following the acceleration of international prices of commodities in late 2007,
inflation increased more rapidly in the DR than in the region on average, from an inflation
rate of 6.1 percent in 2007 to 10.6 percent in 2008. However, as a result of decreasing oil and
food prices, no noticeable price pressures were observed in 2009 and headline inflation ended the
year at 5.7 percent (year-on-year), which falls below the Central Bank target range of 6-7
percent. Core inflation (excluding food and fuel prices) reached 3.2 percent (see Figure 4).

7.      Due to the country's dependence on imported energy and its inefficient electricity
sector, the fiscal situation deteriorated during the spike in energy prices in 2008. The
primary deficit reached 1.5 percent of GDP and the overall deficit stood at 3.2 percent of GDP.
In 2009, lower import prices were counterbalanced by reduced levels of activity, so the overall
deficit was stable at 3.1 percent of GDP. Tax revenues declined rapidly in 2009 due to the
deteriorating economic environment. The energy sector, notwithstanding lower oil prices and a


                                                                           6
12 percent increase in the average electricity tariff, still recorded a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP
in 2009.
8.     The Government contained the fiscal deficit early in 2009 by reducing investment
expenditures. Large, coordinated financing from the WB, IADB, and IMF in the last quarter of
2009 allowed the Government to increase investment expenditures, thus stimulating aggregate
demand.
9.       A sharp decline in imports helped to reduce the current account deficit to 6.2
percent of GDP in 2009. While the high dependence of DR on imported oil and volatile
international prices are key determinants of the volatility of the current account balance the
persistent current account deficit is due to structural factors affecting the country's export
performance and competitiveness. Since 2000, the increase in exports has slowed relative to
GDP, making the DR the only country in the Central America and Caribbean sub-region that has
reduced its degree of economic openness in the last decade. A proximate cause for the DR's
declining competitiveness is the high cost of electricity (on average twice that of other countries
in the region), though institutional weaknesses in the implementation of trade policy as well as a
still inadequate investment climate have constrained export growth.
10.     These structural current account deficits have been financed in recent years by
considerable inflows of foreign capital especially in the form of FDI. Year-on-year FDI
inflows decreased in 2009, but remained the major component of the capital account (80
percent), and have contributed to cover 92 percent of the current account deficit. FDI has been
concentrated in tourism activities, communications, commerce, and real estate sectors. Strong
remittance flows (estimated at around 10 percent of GDP in recent years) have also been an
important source of foreign exchange, though they contracted in 2008 and 2009. FDI and other
capital inflows were sufficient to fund the current account deficit, and foreign exchange reserve
levels did not suffer (see Figure 5).

11.      The public debt to GDP ratio peaked in 2003 at 49.3 percent during the domestic
banking crisis with a steady decline to 33.4 in 2007. This improvement is in part due to the 2005
restructuring of sovereign external debt, high GDP growth and favorable external conditions
(i.e., declining real interest rates and appreciating real effective exchange rate). However, in
2009 the public debt to GDP ratio rose to 39 percent, as a result of the economic slowdown and
counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus.1

II.2 MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS

12.      The economic growth outlook for the DR has improved, though it remains
contingent on adequate macro-management and the external environment. The output gap
is still projected to be negative and to close gradually by the end of 2012. Given the strong
performance of the economy in the first quarter of 2010 and preliminary estimates for the second
quarter indicating a similar expansion, initial projections for GDP growth have been revised
upwards. Original growth estimates stood at 3.5 percent in 2010, 6 percent in 2011, and 7-8
percent for 2012-2015. Anticipating the potential stimulus effect of the injection of sovereign
bonds funds of US$750 million (issued in early May 2010), and the potential increase in demand
related to reconstruction in Haiti, the Central Bank has made significant revisions to 2010 growth
estimates, which now stand at 8 percent. The current (September 2010) Bank and IMF staff
estimates for the 2010 growth are slightly lower and in the range of 5 to 6 percent, and growth
for 2011 and outer years is projected at around 6 percent.

13.     For 2010, inflation is expected to remain relatively stable within targeted increases.
During the first half of 2010, energy price increases pushed headline inflation upwards, but core
inflation remained subdued. The latest available figures (August 2010) show a yearly headline
inflation of 5.0 percent and a core inflation of 3.5 percent, within authorities' targets. Due to the
gradual closing of the output gap, a carefully managed monetary policy and tamed international
price pressures, the inflation projections are rather benign.

14.    Preliminary figures show that the reconstruction effort underway in Haiti after the
earthquake may have some positive effects on the DR economy through increased exports.
Local export sales in the border regions with Haiti grew by 61 percent in February (compared to
the same period last year). Food products have experienced the highest increase in demand. In
the coming months, the reconstruction activity will likely materialize in increased sales of
construction materials and related manufacturing.

15.    Fiscal Policy Outlook. The National Budget Law 2010, approved at the end of 2009,
provides for a continued counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus initiated in the last quarter of 2009. The
stimulus is designed to derive from increased expenditures in investment projects coupled with
constraints on the growth of public wages and transfers. In particular, transfers to the electricity
sector are limited to US$380 million (the Government has also agreed with the IMF that no



1
  Note that in this paragraph (and in paragraph 25 and in Annex 4) statistics consider public debt as gross debt, i.e.,
they do not net out bonds owned by agencies within the Government. According to the Government, the net debt to
GDP ratio for 2009 was 36.6.

                                                          9
arrears should be accumulated on generator payments).2 In its letter of intent to the IMF, the
Government also agreed that a plan of fiscal consolidation should start in the second part of 2010
and continue in 2011 and further years. The fiscal consolidation aims at reaching a sustainable
overall fiscal deficit of about 1.6 percent of GDP by 2011 and reducing it further in later years.
In the government medium term macroeconomic framework, this fiscal consolidation stands on
two pillars: (i) raising fiscal revenues through a reduction of exemptions and more efficient
administration (not through increases in tax rates), and (ii) containing expenditures with specific
emphasis on reducing the energy sector deficit.

16.     Tax revenues. The dramatic reduction in tax revenues in 2009 has exacerbated the
preexisting structural problem of the narrow tax base. Tax revenues in 2009 stood at some 13.6
percent of GDP. After considering the "rigid" components of expenditures (interest payments
and the recapitalization of the Central Bank: 2.0 percent of GDP; wages and salaries: 4.2 percent;
electricity transfers: 1.3 percent), very little fiscal space remains for social policies. As part of the
fiscal adjustment under the IMF program, the government aims to increase tax revenues by about
0.5 percent per year to achieve a ratio of 14.7 percent of GDP by 2011 and higher percentages in
the outer years. Moderate efficiency gains can be achieved through improved tax administration,
but more can be achieved from the elimination of exemptions. Authorities estimate that tax
exemptions may amount to up to almost six percent of GDP. A core policy action supported by
the recent WB Public Finance and Social Sector (PFSS) DPL was the publication of an estimate
of the foregone revenue from tax exemptions in an Annex of the National Budget Law. Initial
data for 2010 shows that revenues are not increasing at the pace of initial projections, especially
revenues from direct taxes levied on the low 2009 incomes. However, the Government has also
been delayed in its implementation of these structural reforms.

17.     Electricity sector. In December 2009, authorities presented a detailed plan for the reform
of the electricity sector, consistent with the medium-term budget balances agreed in the IMF
program. The main objectives of the electricity sector reforms are to: (i) provide reliable service
to all clients; (ii) eliminate untargeted subsidies; (iii) differentiate generation inputs away from
its current high dependence on fossil fuels; and (iv) achieve a long term viable energy sector.
Specifically, the main reform commitments include: (i) further reform of the tariff mechanism to
eliminate the gap between the current (applied) and "indexed" (generation costs included) tariffs
through increased flexibility;3 (ii) continued increases in the Cost Recovery Index (CRI) which
includes improvements in invoicing, collection and reduction of operational costs (for
distribution and holding companies); (iii) completed transition from a geographically inefficient
subsidy scheme to a targeted subsidy scheme, Bonoluz4; and (iv) increased investment efforts to


2
  The main assumptions underlying the 2010 budget were a real GDP growth of 2.5 percent, an inflation rate of 7
percent, an exchange rate of 37.9 pesos per USD, and an average yearly oil price of US$72.4 per barrel. These
assumptions are subject to revisions as the year progresses to provide more accurate projections.
3
   In the longer term, a technical tariff, covering the costs of generation, transmission and distribution, should be
applied.
4
  By May 2010, Bonoluz reached 106,000 clients in former Programa de Reducción de Apagones (PRA) areas and
by July 2010 Bonoluz is expected to fully dismantle the former geography-based subsidy scheme PRA, totaling an
estimated 196,000 poor families receiving the subsidy equivalent to 100 kWh/month through the Solidaridad card.
In the case of the non-poor households beneficiaries of the former PRA areas, improved targeting on the poor will
translate into some 600,000 new regular non-poor clients for Electrical Distribution Companies (EDEs), which

                                                        10
expand and differentiate energy generation and to improve the distribution and transmission
systems.

18.      In 2010, reforms have not yet resulted in a significantly lower deficit because of
increases in fuel prices. Since the presentation of the plan, the new electricity authorities5 have
made efforts to eliminate excessive operative costs in CDEEE, cutting payroll at the holding unit
of CDEEE and modifying the contracts for power purchase with the hydropower company which
reduced the average energy price paid by CDEEE. However, the increase in fuel prices (by 26
percent in the case of fuel oil during the first semester of 2010) has more than compensated these
initial savings, widening the deficit of the sector to a projected level of some US$700 million for
the end of the current year. In the case of Bonoluz, a total of 196 thousand poor families of
former PRA areas are now receiving a targeted cash transfer, while about 300 thousand new
regular (i.e., non poor) clients were absorbed by distribution companies. The remaining 800
thousand poor families identified by SIUBEN are yet to be registered in Bonoluz, a process that
should be completed within the next 18 months.

19.     Continued structural reforms should help close the electricity sector deficit in the
near future. New managerial teams of the distribution companies (EDEs) are currently being
hired as part of the reforms. The main objective of these new managerial teams consists of
reconstructing the commercial and control capabilities of the utilities in order to reduce non-
technical losses and increase cash recovery. It is expected that the new teams will be able to
increase billing and collection significantly, in particular from large customers that will be
subject to tele-metering. Projections of the financial gap of the electricity sector for year 2011
indicate that it would be cut by half to about US$350 million.

20.     The World Bank has continued an active dialogue in the energy sector which has
helped advance important structural reforms. Past performance in this sector has been
disappointing and some of the sector critical vulnerabilities ­ such as strong dependency on fuels
in its energy matrix ­ have not yet been removed. However, with the implementation of three
key reform elements: (i) a new reforming head in CDEEE; (ii) a new professional management
in EDEs, and (iii) efficient cost-recovery tariffs to be implemented from 2011 onwards, a
US$350 million financial gap of the electricity sector for year 2011, driven mostly by sharp
reductions in non-technical losses (electricity theft), seems achievable.

21.    The Government's financing needs of 6.4 percent of GDP are considerable, but are
planned to be covered by domestic and external sources. Domestic sources include an
increased domestic debt of about two percentage points of GDP. External sources include
primarily debt financing of 4.4 percentage points of GDP. The multilateral financing of US$575
million ­ equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP ­ is the sum of the support of the IADB (US$245
million), World Bank (US$150 million), IMF (US$150 million), and CAF (US$30 million).




would increase the potential to increase billings and collection in the next future. The rest of non-PRA poor families
that are yet to be registered in Bonoluz total some 806,000 household for inclusion by July 2011.
5
  A new Chairman of CDEEE and a new President of the National Energy Commission were appointed in August
2009.

                                                         11
22.     The immediate emergency response by the DR to the Haitian earthquake has
increased pressure on its already scarce budgetary resources. A preliminary assessment by
UNDP (2010) estimates that the Government spent US$15 million (or three percent of fiscal
revenues for January) for an emergency response. Initial expenditures were mainly health
related: vaccines and equipment for the hospitals located along the border region to assist
earthquake victims. However, the education system has also been under pressure given the
temporary accommodations that were provided to Haitian students in Dominican schools. In
light of the very low level of social service expenditures in the Dominican Republic, these strains
can easily impact the quality of these key public services.

23.     At the latest assessment (mid 2010), there are no signs of stress in the banking
system. Non-performing loans (NPLs) have remained low. Many banks are reporting a rebound
in their profitability and the banking system remains well capitalized. Moreover, there is still
plenty of liquidity in the system due to the banks' previous cautiousness in credit extension. The
cut in reserve requirements translated to a reduction in actual reserves, but banks continue to
maintain large liquidity buffers at the central bank.

24.     Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that the DR's public debt appears to be
on a sustainable path.6 At the end of 2008, the public debt to GDP ratio was about 35.5 percent,
which was not high by regional standards. Nonetheless, the Government aims to bring debt back
to pre-2003 crisis levels in the medium-term. The DSA assumes that the public debt to GDP ratio
will not have declined in 2009 and 2010, years during which the fiscal stance has been
counterbalancing the global slowdown in a measured manner. After 2011, however, when global
external conditions are projected to improve, the Government would continue reducing the debt
ratio by generating primary surpluses of 1.5 to 2.2 percent of GDP (See Annex 4 for more details
on the DSA).

25.     The DR faces improved prospects for economic recovery, though actual recovery
remains largely dependent on improvements in the external environment. If the global
economic recovery were to be shorter or weaker than expected, the DR could still face a
deterioration of growth performance. In the short-term, the potential contraction of demand from
Haiti, the second largest destination market of Dominican exports, will most likely produce some
negative consequences, though medium-term reconstruction efforts could generate additional
demand for Dominican goods and services. Although international financial markets appear
more liquid and investors have partially reduced their risk aversion, the DR is still exposed to the
risk of worsening international financial conditions (including the notable risk of a potentially
widespread global debt crisis).

26.     These risks are mitigated by the government's continued commitment to sound
macroeconomic management and through the support of the IMF. Following substantive
discussions in late August 2010, a "staff-level agreement" has been reached with the Fund on
policies and measures for the remainder of 2010 and 2011. A press release from the IMF
concisely describes the agreement as follows: "Further efforts to strengthen government
revenues, contain electricity subsidies and moderate other expenditures will be implemented to
reach the gradual fiscal consolidation envisioned in the program, and to maintain domestic

    The DSA is based on the definition of gross debt: please consider footnote 1 for more details.

                                                           12
demand growth on a sustainable path." A new letter of intent is expected and the official review
of the program should be discussed at the IMF Board in late October 2010.

27.     These risks notwithstanding, the macroeconomic policy framework is considered
adequate for the purposes of the proposed DPL. Even though the fiscal consolidation will
require some sharper adjustments than initially envisaged and there are significant risks to the
short-term outlook associated with the difficult global environment, the macroeconomic policy
framework is adequate for Bank development policy lending to support the implementation of
the government program ­ provided that this program is effectively implemented.


       III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY
               PROCESSES

28.     As explained in detail in the Program Document (PD) of PASS1, the Government's
reform program to enhance human capital for the poorest citizens centers on enhancing the
performance and accountability of key public sector agencies and improving investments in
health, nutrition and education by poor families, while ensuring that public resources are more
effectively, efficiently, and transparently managed to provide for these entitlements. The strategy
includes actions in three broad policy areas that are supported by the PASS series: (i) a shift from
the current social assistance model of the safety net program Solidaridad to a full-fledged CCT
program focused on the promotion of human capital; (ii) the enhancement of the quality,
accountability and efficiency of overall public spending, specifically through enhanced budget
management and planning for the redesigned, multi-sectoral CCT and the piloting of
performance-based social sector budgeting and management; and (iii) the enhancement of
transparency and oversight by creating a better informed demand for improved public sector
performance in the social domain.

29.     This section first provides an update of key facts and issues linked to poverty, social
spending and human capital, especially in light of past crises' impacts. The remaining sections
discuss the development of the Government's reform program in the three areas outlined above
over the past eight months, commenting on the advances achieved and the pending constraints
and explaining, when applicable, the changes made to adjust or strengthen the strategy. The final
section summarizes the participatory processes that inform the Government's reforms.

III.1 POVERTY, SOCIAL SPENDING AND HUMAN CAPITAL: EVOLUTION SINCE 2009
30.     At the time of the PASS DPL1 preparation (May-June 2009), serious concerns arose
that the food, fuel and international financial crises would dramatically increase poverty
and unemployment and severely diminish social spending for safety nets, education and
health. The 2003 domestic banking crisis pushed 1.3 million people into poverty in the DR,
resulting in increased poverty levels of 15 percentage points. Unemployment also increased
significantly by four percentage points (Figure 7). In terms of social spending, the real growth
rate of health spending declined by 36 percent following the 2003 domestic banking crisis, while
education spending fell 34 percent compared to 2002 spending (Figure 6). Given the major food
and oil price shocks in 2007-2008, the GoDR feared the crisis impacts would disproportionately


                                                13
impact the poor, including household decisions to invest in human capital. The structural risks of
exacerbating the very low levels of social spending in education and health were high.

31.     Public spending on education and health as a share of total public spending has
remained steady during the current crisis, but remains low as per regional and historical
standards. As indicated in a 2008 ECLAC report, public expenditure on education in the DR, as
a share of GDP, was the lowest in the region from 2004 to 2006, while health expenditure was
among the lowest of those countries studied. As shown in Figure 6, in 2008, the real growth rate
of health spending fell slightly, by 4.6 percent, while education spending grew by 3.1 percent.
Expenditures grew for both education and health in 2009, by 5.8 percent and 2.5 percent,
respectively. According to the Government and Bank observations, the growth of public
spending on education and health in 2009 was the direct result of the counter-cyclical budget
measures taken by Government, and the coordinated actions between the Ministry of Finance
and Social Agencies to reduce supply-gaps in health and education. The international economic
crisis has not translated into a major contraction of social spending in the DR, as with the 2003
crisis, although social sector spending remains below 2002 levels as a share of total public
spending.
               Figure 6: Public Spending on Health and Education: 2000-2009

        Note: * Preliminary 2009 figures.
32.     Positive trends can be observed for poverty levels in the DR, especially for extreme
poverty. Contrary to initial concerns a year ago, official Government figures indicate a slight
overall decrease in moderate and extreme poverty over 2008-2009 (See Figure 7), due in part,
according to MEPyD, to the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program Solidaridad. Between
October 2007 and October 2008, moderate poverty increased by two percentage points (from
35.8 to 37.8 percent), due in part to food and fuel price inflation. The latest April 2010 data
however shows a poverty rate of 33.2 percent, which falls below the 2007 poverty levels but
remains above pre-2003 levels. In contrast, extreme poverty has not increased since October
2007, and stands in April 2010 at 9.6 percent. According to MEPyD, extreme poverty, which is
now back to pre-2003 levels, has not risen during the past series of shocks due in part to

                                                  14
increases in the food allotment of Solidaridad transfers and the number of beneficiaries (See
Figure 8 below).7 These CCT trends, in turn, are attributed to the buffer effects of international
donor lending. In 2009, fiscal support from the IFIs, including the Bank through the PASS DPL1
and Public Finance DPL, has helped maintain the level of investment in the Solidaridad
transfers, which continues to play a pivotal income support function for the poorest in the DR.

  The current coverage of Solidaridad (530,000 heads of household) corresponds to approximately 25 percent of the
total population benefitting from the flagship social assistance program ­ relatively broad coverage as per
international standards and prevailing poverty levels. However, as supported under this operation, the accuracy of
the targeting needs to be improved.

                 Note: Figures are from December of each year.

33.     The decline of the creation of formal employment remains a challenge exacerbated
by the international financial crisis, with no mitigating structures in place. Structural factors
linked to the decline of the mining sector and the end of the Multi-fiber agreement in 2005 have
led to significant decreases in employment, particularly in the free-trade textile zones near
Santiago. The decline became even more severe since the economic crisis hit the DR in 2008.
The growth rate in the number of social security contributors, a proxy for formal employment,
has been declining dramatically since mid-2008. Since the CCT Solidaridad is mainly targeted
to the extremely poor, the economic crisis has manifested a void in the social protection system
in the inexistence of contingent instruments to respond to the employment challenges of a large
covariate shock. This void is not addressed at present by the PASS DPL series, but, at the
Government's request, the Bank is currently supporting the broadening of the social protection
base beyond social transfers, through a restructuring of the Youth Employment project to pilot a
temporary employment program for the transitory poor. The Bank will also be working with the
Government to analyze policy options to improve the country's resiliency to current and external
shocks in the context of the Social Sectors NLTA (Section IV.6).

34.    While poverty and social spending trends in education and health demonstrate a
strong Governmental response to the crisis, structural issues linked to access to and quality
of education and health services, especially for the poorest, remain. As described in the PD
of PASS1, these issues hinder the Government's objective of promoting, and not just preserving,
human capital for the poorest of its citizens.

35.     The performance of the education sector is a serious concern. Despite progress in
coverage in basic education, access to pre-school and secondary school is low, and among the
lowest in Latin America (See Figure 9). The DR's enrollment performance reflects sustained
improvements since the 1990s. Minimal differences exist in net enrollment related to gender or
rural-urban disparities, but differences in enrollment by socio-economic conditions still persist.
Major inefficiencies in the education system are also reflected by substantial disparities in
education attainment despite the high enrollment rates, related to high repetition and drop-out
rates. For example, by age 12, a three year gap in attainment exists between the lowest quarter of

                                                 16
students' attainment and the highest quarter (Figure 10). Students attend on average 3.9 days of
school a week with lower attendance in 8th grade and secondary education (Figure 11). Finally,
education quality falls below regional and international standards in nearly all measures.
According to UNESCO's Latin American Laboratory for Evaluation of the Quality in the
regional 2008 UNESCO Latin America/OREALC assessment, students in the Dominican
Republic scored the lowest of seventeen participating LAC countries. At the same time, the
Government's program has suffered from major knowledge gaps to uncover the driving factors
behind this low performance and has requested the Bank to assist in filling these gaps as part of
the Social Sectors NLTA (see III.2 and V.6). Early findings from the latter point to basic
deficiencies in flows of resources, information-sharing and decision-making (Box 1).

   Box 1: Institutional Analysis of Flows the Education Sector in the Dominican Republic
The simultaneous operation of the public education system in the DR demands the coordinated
intervention of a wide set of actors. The institutional set-up of the Ministry of Education (MINERD) must
therefore be designed to ensure a smooth flow of resources and information to guarantee the full
functioning of the education sector up to its potential. Flaws in the institutional design can reduce the
speed of these flows, or create unplanned, inefficient hindrances. As a result of inefficient flows, students
can be without textbooks for several months at the beginning of the school year or teachers may receive
training unrelated to their particular development needs.
Initial activities undertaken by the Social Sectors NLTA have found inefficiencies in several aspects of
the education sector in the DR. For example, the team has identified a high level of informality in the
process to provide school supplies. The official procedure mandates that as needs are identified by school
principals, a request (not standardized) should be created. The request needs to then be approved by the
district and regional director, before it reaches the ministry officials. No formal procedure exists for
follow-up on requests. Principals commonly will travel to central MINERD offices to ascertain the status
of their request. At the same time, some principals take shortcuts by submitting request directly to
MINERD. Once the request becomes available, no formal mechanism exists to inform all involved parties
of the final delivery; rather, MINERD can send it directly to the school or to district or regional
directorates.
The NLTA activities have identified, through an analysis of the Constitution, the Organic Law of the
Education Sector, and associated legal documents, the de jure structure of the main resources and
information in the education sector. On the other hand, through interviews with parents, teachers,
principals, district and regional directors, and ministry officials, the team has identified the de facto
structure of those flows (as the one described above). Based on the collected information, the team has
identified critical deviations between planning and execution. The NLTA will provide policy
recommendations to MINERD on how to revise and streamline their processes. A strong potential for
efficiency gains exists in the education sector from improvements in process design.

36.     The coverage and quality of healthcare delivery need to be strengthened with an
emphasis on the first level of care. Health data show no significant barriers exist in accessing
basic health services; however, access to services at the first level of care, as envisioned by the
primary health care model that the Government aspires to develop as part of the health sector
reform, shows important coverage gaps. The last Demographic and Health Survey carried out in
2007 shows 97.8 percent of pregnant women from the poorest quintile had prenatal controls
provided by a physician and roughly half with a obstetrician/gynecologist; 94.2 percent had more
than four prenatal controls, and 95 percent of children were delivered by physicians. On the other
hand, only 44.1 percent of children from poorest quintile households receive all of their
vaccinations according to national protocols and for 55.5 percent of children living in rural areas.
The first level of care (health centers) of Regional Health Services (public provider networks)
shows important weaknesses for providing key basic health services with adequate levels of
quality. The public network of healthcare providers is going through a transitional
decentralization process that the Government aims to accelerate in the next two years as part of
the plan to improve the overall quality of services, particularly at the first level of care.

III.2 HUMAN CAPITAL PROMOTION FOR THE POOREST

37.      Compared to the 2003-2004 domestic banking crisis, the Government's current
safety net program has been more effective at mitigating the effects of the recent wave of
crises, particularly in the protection of the income of the poorest. The launch of the
Solidaridad program in 2005, along with the development of a new targeting system, Sistema
Único de Beneficiarios (Single Beneficiary Selection System or SIUBEN), in 2004, has
facilitated the Government's ability to respond to the recent wave of crises through a strong
social safety net. Previously, social policy in the DR relied on a traditional, clientelistic model of
assistance. The institutionalization of SIUBEN therefore represented a marked change in the
selection of program beneficiaries based on geographic and household variables to specifically
identify and include the extreme poor. The Government is currently undertaking another
significant shift in social assistance from using the Solidaridad program as a traditional income
protection mechanism, to providing a full-fledged CCT program focusing on the promotion of
human capital. This sub-section discusses advances and pending critical steps in the
Government's efforts to promote investments in health, nutrition and education by the poorest
families through the overhaul of the CCT program Solidaridad and its improved alignment with
supply-side responses in health and education.

III.2.1 Toward a Full-Fledged CCT: Overhauling the Solidaridad program

38.     Despite the recent redesign of Solidaridad as a CCT program, the Government
decided to create and improve well-recognized institutional features and systems consistent
with best practice from "mature" CCT programs, such as Mexico and Jamaica. As a CCT,
Solidaridad is a young program. While launched in September 2005 as a conditional cash
transfer program, in practice, it has operated as an unconditional cash transfer program, with
serious gaps in the definition, verification of compliance with and enforcement of co-
responsibilities, i.e., households' investments in health, nutrition and education. To achieve
human capital promotion goals for the poorest citizens, the Government seized the momentum of
the 2009 international crisis to modernize social assistance and initiate the overhaul of the


                                                 19
program. It is within this context that reform progress must be analyzed and understood. While
reform implementation has unsurprisingly taken considerable time and effort, the Government
has taken some bold steps to make progress on the set-up and improvement of the major
necessary key features of a CCT program: a strong institutional framework; eligibility and
enrollment mechanisms; the payment mechanism and the overall quality of service to
beneficiaries; a strong monitoring and evaluation system; and the institutional means to monitor
compliance with co-responsibilities and coordinate actions among the several institutions
involved in operating the program.8 Progress and pending steps since Board Approval of PASS1
in November 2009 are summarized below.

39.     The Government has created an entirely new institutional framework for the CCT
Solidaridad Program leading to collaborative, inter-agency and inter-sectoral decision-
making, which marks a point of departure from the fragmentation of previous DR social
policy. In 2009, operating rules of the redesigned CCT program were approved along with the
formal creation of two important committees: the Interagency CCT Committee, which brings
together the Social Cabinet agencies in charge of targeting (SIUBEN), operations (Solidaridad
Program), and payment of transfers (Administrator of Social Subsidies, ADESS); and the
Intersectoral CCT Committee, which brings together the Solidaridad program with Health and
Education Ministries, as well as Planning and Finance Ministries when planning and budgeting
issues are discussed. As a result, the redesigned CCT Solidaridad is becoming a truly
collaborative effort and concrete coordination outcomes can be seen. For example, the
Intersectoral Committee has advanced with the programming, budgeting, and bidding of the
actions necessary to close the supply gaps in education and health in order to guarantee an
effective supply of services for Solidaridad households (See Section III.3 below and Section V
on Pillar 2 of the Matrix). The Intersectoral Committee also took the necessary decisions for the
training of regional and/or district directors of the Ministries of Education and Health and the
Solidaridad program with regard to the new operations manual for the program. The main
pending challenge is the need for sustained intersectoral coordination. Based on the new
experience of collaborative interactions and decision-making, the Government has developed a
process to design and approve regulations governing the Interagency and Intersectoral
Committees, which will further clarify roles and responsibilities, and rules of interaction.9

40.     The Government has also taken the bold decision to reorganize the structure of the
Solidaridad program itself. Initially focused on the regional deconcentration agenda as the first
priority, the Government determined through practice that the structure and the staff profiles of
the Solidaridad Program must first be aligned with the new goals and operating rules of the
redesigned CCT. The organizational structure of the program still reflects previous roles for
Solidaridad as a platform responsible for both conditional and unconditional transfers such as
targeted subsidies (Bonogas, Bonoluz), whereas the redesigned CCT management and staff
should dedicate themselves exclusively to human capital promotion. With support from the
Bank, the Government has hired a consultant to support the design and implementation of the

8
  See Section III.2 and Annex 3 of PASS 1 PD for a detailed description of the CCT evolution and planned overhaul.
9
  Regarding the deconcentration of the program, the Government postponed the formalization of the Regional
Intersectoral Committees until 2011 in order to first consolidate the functional rules of the two national committees
and to continue to learn from the day-to-day interactions of the pilot Regional Intersectoral Committees that are
being created.

                                                        20
organizational revamp, and recommendations have been welcomed by the Vice-President, who is
responsible for the coordination of social policy and programs.

41.     The new socio-economic census needed to update the CCT beneficiary database
through the targeting instrument SIUBEN has been delayed, although targeting and
eligibility rules have significantly improved. The approval of new inter-agency rules between
Solidaridad, SIUBEN and ADESS has improved the process for determining eligibility.
SIUBEN is now the only responsible agency for maintaining and updating the registry of CCT
beneficiaries. Previous rules placed both SIUBEN and Solidaridad in charge of maintaining the
database without clear delegation of responsibilities. Furthermore, the Government is working on
the development of an integral information system to be shared between SIUBEN, ADESS and
Solidaridad, which aims to generate a single registry of beneficiaries for non-conditional
(subsidies) and conditional transfers. Delays in the implementation of the census risk affecting
the quality of the registry of eligible beneficiaries (the last SIUBEN census took place in 2005
with on-demand household surveys since then). The delay has been due to delays in the
Congressional ratification and subsequent effectiveness of the Additional Financing (AF) for the
World Bank Social Protection Investment Loan (SPIL), which includes a significant proportion
of the financing for the new SIUBEN census. The AF is now ratified. All the while, however,
the Government had begun census preparation10 and expects that the full-fledged census will be
launched by March 2011, with plans to include 1.8 million households.

42.     The redesigned Solidaridad program is building a system to effectively and
efficiently monitor compliance with co-responsibilities (and enforcing sanctions). Breaking
with past practice and following the lessons learned from countries with "mature" CCT
programs, the Government decided to avoid entrusting the process of verification of co-
responsibilities11 to the CCT program staff, instead holding the health and education service
providers responsible for data collection related to school attendance and health visits. This
ambitious policy direction avoids diverting attention of program staff away from quality control
and allows for the reduction of operating costs in the medium-term. In the short-term, this policy
choice requires the development and/or adjustment of extensive, rapid information flows among
numerous actors, along with the development of processes to produce a routine exchange of
large volumes of data.12 In this context, the verification process has been constrained by, among
other factors, the initial challenges of developing the new education management information
system (Section III.2) and adjusting the health information system. Faced with this situation, the
Government decided to continue working on the alignment of health and education information
systems, while the CCT Intersectoral Committee designed and started the implementation of an
emergency set of measures (Operativo de Emergencia) that should allow for the development of
a database of compliance with program co-responsibilities by the end of 2010 (See Section V).


10
   Bidding for the purchasing of handheld devices and digitalization of mapping, creation of operations and training
manuals, and a census pilot have all been completed.
11
   By the last quarter of 2010, the starting point for the verification of co-responsibilities will be as follows: in
education, a registry of Solidaridad students (becarios) will have been generated; in health, Solidaridad
beneficiaries will be registered to a health center (UNAP).

43.     The Government continues to show its commitment to the development of a
comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation system for the redesigned CCT, even though
the complexity of information system management and linkages related to the verification
of compliance with co-responsibilities admittedly takes time to develop. The Intersectoral
CCT Committee designed and agreed on a shared results framework in the Operations Manual of
the redesigned CCT program. Given delays in the process of monitoring compliance with co-
responsibilities, some baseline data have not been collected and therefore some impact indicators
may not be fully available until the end of 2010 (See Section V). However, the Government's
commitment to results remains firm. Despite the various implementation hurdles, Solidaridad
started data collection of the baseline study for the quantitative impact evaluation of the
redesigned CCT and results for the latter, with subsequent baselines for key indicators, are
expected to be available by November 2010.

44.     Despite political economy issues and legal constraints, the Government is taking
critical steps to improve the quality of service to CCT beneficiaries by enhancing the
transfer payment mechanism. As explained in the PASS1 PD, unlike other CCTs, Solidaridad
operates with a near-cash payment mechanism: Solidaridad debit cards for use at participating
corner grocery stores, or colmados. The Government explains this policy decision as being based
on the need to reduce the risks of misuse of cash by beneficiaries and the intention to stimulate
the local economy and social capital in remote areas. According to technical experts, the
mechanism can also prevent an optimal service for beneficiaries in terms of price, quality and
transparency.13 The Government is not willing to immediately move to a cash payment
mechanism but is showing commitment to mitigate the downsides of the payment mechanism
within the political economy constraints of its contract with commercial banks. First, the agency
in charge of payments, ADESS, is complying with the 2009 policy decision to amplify the
number of affiliated colmados in the Red de Abasto Social (RAS) for the use of Solidaridad
program payments. RAS currently has 2,335 affiliated institutions, which represents an increase
of 347 institutions, or 18 percent over the past year. The Government is also implementing a
pilot to map out the supply of colmados to be compared to the disaggregated demand from
beneficiary households as part of a larger analysis of the RAS system to improve program
coverage and the quality of services. Second, ADESS has prepared an action plan to improve
beneficiaries' access to information on their entitlements, specifically on transactions made with
the Solidaridad debit card and the remaining balance on their account. Among other benefits,
this plan will allow beneficiaries to be informed about the total amount of transfers received and
the monthly balance on their cards via telephone before the end of this year. Currently,
beneficiaries do not have access to this critical information. The Government is also working
with financial institution paying partners to develop new contracts and systems that allow users
to have real time access to account balances.

III.2.2 Ensuring Alignment and Synergies with Health and Education Sectors

45.    The shift of the social assistance model towards human capital promotion for the
poor has raised implications for priorities of the health and education sectors. Despite
inherent difficulties with intersectoral coordination, these two sectors continue to rise to the

of Transparency International, Santo Domingo.

                                                     22
challenge of playing a major role in ensuring that a growing demand for education and health
services spurred by the redesigned CCT can be met.

46.     Health. The new transformation in social assistance holds important implications for the
health sector. The Government program aims to strengthen the first level of care (health centers)
to ensure that the poor households have timely access to preventive and essential health care
services of adequate quality to ensure that the human capital impact of complying with
Solidaridad co-responsibilities achieve their full effect. The Ministry of Health (MoH) has
started to bridge the supply gaps to meet the new demands of the beneficiaries of the redesigned
Solidaridad program that includes specific health co-responsibilities such as regular visits to
health centers (first level of care). As discussed in Section III.3.2, new management agreements
between the MoH and the Regional Health Service Networks have also introduced a new
mechanism of results-adjusted financing for the first level of care (See Box 3, Section III3.2).

47.     The MoH has additionally launched an investment program in infrastructure,
equipment and human resources at the first level of care within the framework of a
primary healthcare approach, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Part of the primary healthcare strategy includes the introduction of improved protocols for the
promotion of good health practices and preventive and healthcare services known to improve
mother and child health outcomes. In this context, there is a strong need to strengthen
coordination among public agencies to exploit synergies and enhance the results of poverty
reduction interventions by prioritizing the poorest groups. In an effort to enhance prevention and
promote best practices in maternal and child care, the Government has developed custom-
tailored tools for the first level of care including new manuals and training materials that allow
for the assignment of beneficiaries to the closest health centers based on corresponding
catchment areas.

48.     Existing administrative data collection instruments have also been redesigned to
accommodate the specific health information needs for the verification of the new health
co-responsibilities of Solidaridad beneficiaries at the first level of care. These efforts in the
health sector are meant to complement the redesigned Solidaridad Program, which now includes
co-responsibilities related to the use of prevention methods and care services by mothers and
children. The Government carried out a consultative process to overhaul the most critical
healthcare protocols for the first level of care, particularly for improved mother and child care.
This process emphasized building a broad consensus among stakeholders, including medical
boards and nationwide health program leadership. Key health sector organizations including the
Ministry of Health and SENASA agree that an important challenge to strengthen the supply-side
is for health care providers to be adequately trained in the new tools and manuals focusing on
mother and child health services at the first level of care. This training can contribute to leapfrog
the new primary health care approach to deliver basic services at the first level of care and meet
the increased demand that the new Solidaridad program will generate.

49.     Education. As discussed in the PASS1 PD, specific education actions to enhance
synergies with a redesigned CCT are in-line with the country's 2007 10-year strategic plan (Plan
Decenal de la Educación). The Plan outlines ten policy areas addressing equity in access,
quality, and the reorganization of the education system, all of which require a sustainable


                                                 23
increase in the level and efficiency of public expenditures on primary and secondary education.
Since PASS1 Board approval, the Government has advanced efforts to address the four main
challenge areas for integrated action between the education sector and the redesigned CCT
Solidaridad.

           First, the Ministry of Education (MINERD) has developed its school-based management
           information system (Sistema de Gestión de Centro Escolar, SGCE) which aims to
           enhance its capacity to collect, monitor and update student, teacher and school data at the
           school-level.14 MINERD and the Solidaridad program have used this opportunity to
           allow for the systematic monitoring of beneficiary compliance with program co-
           responsibilities and education outcomes. System developers have progressed on the
           interconnectivity between MINERD's system, and those of SIUBEN and Solidaridad, to
           track the administrative, socioeconomic and education performance data of Solidaridad
           beneficiaries in the education system. However, as discussed above, this type of process
           takes time. As it is now, the SGCE is able to produce reports about enrollment, repetition,
           and attendance, among other topics. This is a notable first step for the systematization of
           information in the sector. However, both MINERD and the Social Cabinet have
           recognized the difficulties in merging the database with those of Solidaridad and
           SENASA due to differences in the designs of personal identification codes. Another issue
           has been the non-institutionalized means of reporting data (use of cyber cafes for data
           reporting) which has affected the overall quality of information in some cases. A recent
           IADB-financed system audit has helped to identify deficiencies, which are currently
           being corrected. School directors have been entrusted with confirming student
           beneficiaries of Solidaridad, along with their program code in order to verify enrollment
           and attendance. MINERD has also started delivering laptop computers to each school
           director along with securing internet connections to ensure a permanent, timely transfer
           of information.
           Second, MINERD has worked with the CCT Intersectoral Committee to calculate supply
           gaps linked to the CCT in education services and has started to progressively reduce
           these gaps through a targeted approach (including the provision of teaching materials,
           school rehabilitation, classroom construction and/or conversion). This represents
           significant progress given that MINERD data show that 70 percent of the student
           population is clustered in 30 percent of the existing public schools. Thanks to the
           agreements reached with the Ministry of Finance (see Section III.3), MINERD has been
           able to start reducing these supply constraints in 2010 through a targeted, step-by-step
           approach. Three areas of intervention, with significant gains for disadvantaged groups,
           have been pursued: (i) increasing pre-school access amongst the poorest segments of the
           population; (ii) increasing access to the second cycle of basic education (5th to 8th grades)
           especially in rural areas; and (iii) expanding access to secondary education, particularly
           9th and 10th grades. Infrastructure investments have also been prioritized for schools
           located in regions with high poverty rates and high concentrations of Solidaridad
           households, where under-provision and crowding are most prevalent.
           Third, the Government continues to advance its plan to conduct a pilot test for the new
           transfer structure, which is now planned for the 2010-2011 school year. This effort

14
     For a full discussion of the School Management System, see p. 27 and box 1 of the PD of PASS1.

                                                         24
       addresses the need to differentiate responses to attendance problems for different grades,
       as opportunity costs of school attendance increase with age (see the discussion in Section
       III.1 above). Based on pilot results and evaluation of the institutional feasibility of a
       differentiated scheme, policy decisions should be taken in the second half of 2011.
       Finally, the Government has been on track in its commitment to monitor student learning
       outcomes through the validation of education standards and the implementation of
       national exams (See Section V and Annex 1 for specific status progress). MINERD and
       the National Education Council have continued to make progress in establishing basic
       competency standards in elementary, secondary and, most recently, pre-primary
       education (PASS1). These standards will serve as the basis for the development of a
       national student evaluation system to measure student learning outcomes in elementary
       (at 4th and 8th grades) and secondary (at 10th and 12th grades) education levels. Test
       results at grades 4, 8 and 10 will help monitor student performance before they finish
       compulsory education. This systematic collection of data on student learning outcomes
       will serve both the need to confront quality issues in the DR and help prepare the
       redesigned CCT to overcome its next phase of challenges. As a first-generation CCT,
       Solidaridad focuses on increasing access to education, but will have to confront more
       complex quality issues (as the CCT Oportunidades in Mexico is currently addressing) in
       the future.
 
50.    A possible broadening of the Government strategy that was not described in the
PASS1 PD would be the development of specific efforts to improve not only the level but
also the efficiency of education expenditures. Based on the forthcoming NLTA results
described in Box 1 above (Section III.1), MINERD will have access to solid analysis to make a
more informed decision on how to overcome basic inefficiencies in resource and information
flows to enhance overall performance. The dialogue for reform would fit well with the current
Government discussion on the reorganization of the education system through an enhanced
deconcentration process.

III.3 IMPROVING EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT FOR ENHANCED SOCIAL SECTOR
PERFORMANCE

51.      Following a discussion of social policy reform, this section turns to advances and
pending challenges for the second area of reform targeted by the PASS program: the
enhancement of the quality, accountability and efficiency of public spending, specifically
through: (i) short-term improvements in the budget process to protect and support desired
improvements in the CCT program and the related supply of education and health services; and
(ii) the gradual introduction of more medium-term instruments to enhance and institutionalize the
performance orientation of social sectors, with the piloting of performance agreements in social
sectors--specifically health and education.

III.3.1 IMPROVED BUDGET MANAGEMENT TO SUPPORT THE JOINT PERFORMANCE OF SOCIAL
SECTOR AGENCIES WITHIN THE REDESIGNED CCT PROGRAM

52.    As explained in the PD of PASS1, past harmful reductions in social sector spending
in crisis contexts have partly resulted from the Government's failure to adequately

                                               25
prioritize and plan social sector spending, due to weak budgetary processes (including lack
of planning systems) and the lack of a clear focus (and accountability) on results. The CCT
Solidaridad provides a particular case in point. The Government had neither developed an
integrated framework for performance targets in health and education nor ensured that proper
budget arrangements are in place to prioritize budget allocations in health and education in order
to ensure the timely disbursements of those funds to cover supply-side gaps linked to the CCT.

53.     With the redesign of the CCT as an integrated program covering health and
education related services, and the risk of further cuts in social sectors linked to the crisis,
the Government has made significant progress in improving planning and budget
management for the CCT and its associated provision of health, nutrition and education
services. In accordance with the policy actions targeted by PASS1, the CCT Intersectoral
Committee presented an assessment to the Ministry of Finance quantifying the estimated costs of
covering supply-gaps linked to the redesigned Solidaridad program (education services and
related inputs--didactic materials; primary health care services, including access to essential
medicines; and micronutrients prioritizing pregnant women and children under two years-old).
The assessment also included a proposed three-year chronogram to progressively reduce supply-
gaps according to select criteria: number of students in primary school, poverty level, expected
increases in Solidaridad households, etc. As per the PASS DPL2 trigger commitment, the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) took the necessary measures to ensure that sufficient funds were
included in the 2010 Budget Law to cover the supply-gaps linked to the redesign of the CCT
Solidaridad Program, as planned for the first year of the chronogram. These new budgeting
processes represent significant progress in the coordination and planning of policy actions.15

54.    An important challenge for the Government is now to ensure the institutionalization
and sustainability of these developments. To this effect, the Social Sector agencies have been
working closely with the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Development (MEPyD) to reflect
CCT projections of entitlements, supply-gaps, and required medium-term budget envelopes into
the Multi-Annual National Plan for the Public Sector 2010-2013. The Multi-Annual National
Plan for the Public Sector 2010-2013 is the first multi-year budget planning exercise in the DR.
The development of the Plan has been led by the Ministry of Economy, Planning and
Development with close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and sector ministries to
develop projections of budget envelopes, entitlements, including protected programs, and
financing sources by sector, through 2013. The Plan represents a significant advance by the
Government to increase predictability, transparency, and rationalization of the budget, as the first
step to developing a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework with clear linkages to budget
appropriations. Box 2 provides more specifics on these enhanced budget management processes,
including measurement issues.

55.     Looking ahead, the Government will also need to pay close attention to the actual
execution of the budgeted allocations dedicated to the bridging of supply-gaps. Given the
anticipation of a highly complicated appropriations process for budget funds to cover supply
gaps last year in developing PASS1, GoDR strategy mainly focused on the process of ensuring

15
  The Government refers to the new process as "unlocking the budgetary gridlock" through direct incorporation into
the National Budget appropriations, as well as a specific article in the National Budget Law to prevent the
modification of funds or their use for other purposes, as approved by the National Congress.

                                                       26
   the funds' allocation, while underestimating the need for monitoring processes for the actual
   execution of these funds in the case of a smooth allocation process, as experienced. While the
   execution of nutrition and health allocations shows reasonable progress, education's actions are
   taking more time to materialize (see Box 2). According to recent Government analysis,
   bottlenecks in education are largely due to difficulties with land acquisition for the building of
   new schools (especially for secondary education) and lengthy bidding processes due to
   cumbersome procurement processes. In this context, the Government recently decided to monitor
   the execution of the funds dedicated to the progressive closing of supply-gaps on a quarterly
   basis; agree on realistic execution targets, identifying bottlenecks behind delays; and agree on
   corrective actions. These discussions will take place during the meetings of the Intersectoral
   Committee for the CCT program.

       Box 2: Improved Budget Management to Address Supply-Gaps Linked to Solidaridad
Given the new verification of co-responsibilities in health, education, and nutrition (including regular health
visits and school attendance) under the organizational restructuring of Solidaridad, the GoDR has made three
major advances to improve budget management to estimate and progressively reduce supply gaps. By covering
these supply gaps, the GoDR is complying with its co-responsibility to ensure Solidaridad beneficiaries have
access to the services required under beneficiary co-responsibilities.
The first concerted advance in improved budget management has been the estimation of the supply gaps through
an iterative process led by the Social Cabinet on behalf of the CCT Intersectoral Committee. The estimates
include existing supply gaps and anticipated supply constraints related to the increased demand for services by
program beneficiaries. The methodology used reflects a significant advance for its detailed geographical
planning of Solidaridad program growth and associated costs of social sector services. Table B2.1 summarizes
the results of this multi-year planning exercise, which is planned to be replicated across the years and with other
GoDR programs. In education, GoDR estimates of existing and potential demand for education services reveal
serious supply constraints in the system, as 70 percent of the student population is clustered in 30 percent of the
existing public schools.

        Source: Social Cabinet, as of April 2010.
The second advance has been the integration of these estimates into planning instruments to progressively reduce
supply gaps. MINERD developed estimates for the construction of new classrooms, rehabilitation of existing
classrooms, and purchase of classroom furniture and teaching materials, through a step-by-step approach
targeting three priority areas: (i) increasing pre-school access among the poorest segments of the population; (ii)
increasing access to the second cycle of basic education (5th to 8th grades) especially in rural areas; and (iii)
expanding access to secondary education (particularly 9th and 10th grades). MSP developed similar estimates for
the infrastructure, human resources, and equipment at the first level of care necessary to cover the population of
their respective catchment area, prioritizing the areas where the largest concentrations of the poorest households
are found.
As part of a tripartite effort between Social Cabinet and the Ministries of Finance and Economy, the necessary
funds to cover these supply gaps were thereby designated for that exclusive purpose in the 2010 National Budget

                                                         27
Law. Following resources allocation, the CCT Intersectoral Committee has also been instrumental to facilitate
communication across ministries to closely monitor the timely quarterly disbursement of the funds. These
monitoring mechanisms are also being used to ensure the social sectors execute the funds. As analyzed in Table
B2.2, budget allocations for 2010 in health and nutrition actually exceed the estimated costs to cover supply
gaps. As of August 2010, all of the nutrition funds had been executed compared to 67 percent for health and 37
percent for education. All of the funds have been committed and are progressing through lengthy public bidding
processes, after completing the complex task of identifying locally the schools and health centers in need of
construction, repair, and/or equipment, acquiring the necessary land, etc.

Finally, the sustainability of these planning mechanisms has been further enhanced by the inclusion of supply
gaps funds in the multi-year planning instrument, Multi-Annual National Plan for the Public Sector 2010-2013.
The Plan provides inter alia medium-term guidelines for results-based investment in a series of protected and
priority programs, mainly in education, health and social protection. The projected costs of covering supply gaps
linked to Solidaridad have been included in the Plan, as presented to the President for approval.

   III.3.2 SUPPORTING THE GRADUAL INTRODUCTION OF PERFORMANCE AGREEMENTS IN
   SOCIAL SECTORS

   56.     The Government has achieved significant advances in the development of
   Performance Agreements to encourage a performance orientation in budget management
   and accountability.16 In compliance with commitments, the results agreements, which present
   strategic plans and objectives, and identify performance measures and targets, were agreed to
   among four priority ministries in 2009. In addition, the Education and Health sectors have
   continued to collaborate to complete the diagnostic of basic conditions for the implementation of
   Performance Agreements, as well as the institutional strengthening plans. Since the quality of
   these diagnostics has been relatively weak, especially for education, the Government is
   committed to accompany the forthcoming institutional strengthening plans with enhanced
   diagnostics. These strengthened diagnostics were presented together with the institutional
   strengthening plans in late August and included specific prioritized actions/projects focused on

   16
     These Performance Agreements ("Contratos por Resultados y Desempeño") are intended to provide a flexible
   managerial link between the budget resources provided and the desired improvements in the sector's performance.
   The process for their development and implementation is described in detail in section III.3 of the PD of PASS1.

                                                          28
the planning units in the health and education ministries. Given the technical challenges
involved, the Government has benefited from extensive financial resources from the IADB
PRODEV program to advance the reform efforts in this regard and from just-in-time assistance
from the Bank17 to MEPyD to advance in this area. The Bank is particularly focused on helping
avoid the mechanistic approaches associated with performance-based budgeting through close
follow-up to customize plans to the DR reality. Another encouraging sign includes the creation
of a dedicated coordination unit in MEPyD as opposed to the start-up approach or "incubator
unit" used over the past months as financed by the PRODEV funds from the IADB. The only
adjustment in the Government's strategy has been the delaying of the incorporation of the
Solidaridad Program for the creation of diagnostics evaluating basic conditions for Performance
Agreements. This is due to the Government's decision to develop a comprehensive
organizational restructuring of the Solidaridad program, as discussed above (III.2).

57.     Progress in the generation of a results-based culture is also noteworthy in the health
sector, where the Government has fulfilled its commitment to introduce results-based
management agreements between the MoH and all Regional Health Services (RHSs) (see
Box 3). The management agreements seek to foster incentives for health care providers to
improve timeliness and quality at the first level of care focusing on mother and child care and
other key prevention methods and care services needed to address the bulk of the burden of
illness and disease on the poor. At the time of the PASS1 preparation, only two of these
agreements had been signed. At present, agreements have been signed with all RHSs.

58.     The reform on the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements fits within a
broader Government strategy to move away from a current budget management focus on
financial and human inputs to prioritize programs based on outputs and outcomes,
particularly for critical social programs. The Government has made substantial progress in
passing important reforms that redefine the role of the institutions involved in the planning and
budgeting process, and public financial management (PFM).18 In February 2010, important
reforms were endorsed at the highest level of Government and approved in line with precepts of
the new Constitution. MEPyD has published a strategic plan to gradually introduce performance-
informed budgeting techniques.19 This includes the introduction of the national public investment
system (Sistema Nacional de Inversión Pública, SNIP), which is designed to enforce more
rigorous program planning, monitoring, and evaluation standards.20 The Government has also
recently completed the draft National Development Strategy and the first Multi-Annual National

policy actions, projected performance indicators, and required budget envelopes.

               Box 3: Results-Based Regional Health Management Agreements
The GoDR, nearly a decade ago, embarked on an ambitious health sector reform program aimed at
improving health system responsiveness. The reforms envisioned financial and organizational
arrangement changes, including the separation of functions and decentralization, to foster efficiency and
accountability in the provision of public healthcare services, while enhancing financial protection for the
poor. The regional management agreements between the MoH and the eight Regional Health Services
(RHSs) introduce a results-based mechanism for financing the first level of care at the regional level,
while also establishing new instruments to align incentives and monitor compliance with performance
targets. The management agreements establish, in a formal and explicit way, specific indicators and
targets for health outputs/intermediary outcomes linked to the delivery of the mandatory package of
health services. The review of the achievement of targets is also linked to budgetary allocation processes.
The management agreements seek to create a culture whereby explicit mechanisms to enhance
accountability, monitor results and more efficiently allocate resources provide the necessary incentives to
improve health outcomes. Action plans have been developed to introduce new information management
systems to monitor results, and a new National Monitoring Unit has been established to coordinate the
implementation of the integrated information system that also facilitates cross-referencing with the CCT
Solidaridad Program. The gradual advancement of these regional management agreements envisions a
full roll-out nationwide of the results-adjusted capitation system, whereby resources are allocated for the
delivery of care on a per-capita basis adjusted for the achievement of performance indicators for priority
services. In addition, plans are currently in development to introduce the same results-based mechanisms
and targets for the National Health Insurance, SENASA, with WB support under the PARSS2 program.
Currently, the RHSs in El Valle (RHS IV) and Cibao Central (RHS VIII) have established advanced
management agreements to include the additional allocation of financial resources on a per-capita basis,
while half of all capitation transfers remain based on results. This results-based capitation system has
been recently introduced in several countries across the region, including Argentina and Panama, to align
providers' incentives for improving coverage and quality of primary health care services.

59.     Many challenges remain, however, particularly at the institutional level. These
complex reforms require, by definition, time, leadership and coordination. Leadership is present,
but requires strengthening in the coordination between MEPyD and the Ministry of Finance, with
positive signs of progress made recently. Also, other critical actors like the Ministry of Public
Administration and the sector Ministries need to be actively involved throughout the process.
The Government has asked the Bank to continue scaling up its roles as neutral convener of actors
and provider of technical inputs and best practices from similar experiences in other countries.
This support has crystallized in the Programmatic NLTA21 to improve the quality of public
expenditures (Section IV Analytical Underpinnings).

III.4 ENHANCING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN SOCIAL SECTORS THROUGH
ENHANCED CIVIL SOCIETY OVERSIGHT

60.    The Government has taken landmark steps to address critical constraints hindering a
more informed demand for improved public sector performance in social sectors. As discussed in


21
   "Improving the Quality of Public Expenditure in the Dominican Republic", Programmatic Non-Lending
Technical Assistance (NLTA), (P119206) FY11-12.

                                                    30
the PD of PASS1, the PASS-supported reforms focus on two levels, the national budget, and the
redesigned CCT combining the provision of health, nutrition and education services.

61.     The Government has progressed in the development of the Consulta Amigable
(Friendly Consult, CA), a web-based, user-friendly tool that will provide public access to
budget information fed by the Financial Management Information System (SIGEF). Users of the
Consulta Amigable tool are expected to include Civil Society Organizations, Non-Governmental
Organizations, private firms, media, professors, researchers, and members of the general public.
Technical assistance will also be provided to these users to train them in using the online tool to
better allow them to obtain the information they desire from the tool. Based on a fruitful
knowledge exchange with the Peruvian Ministry of Finance, the DR MoF prepared a proposal on
the resources needed and timeframe for the definition, development, testing and full
implementation of the CA webpage. This proposal was harmonized within the broader public
resources management modernization program (Programa de Modernización de la
Administración de los Recursos Públicos) led by the MoF and funded by IADB, which envisages
a range of reforms to improve SIGEF, including its accessibility via the internet. In the
meantime, the MoF will publish online budget execution reports to demonstrate its commitment
to enhanced budget transparency. The MoF and MEPyD have also signed an administrative
agreement for collaborating on the inclusion of a module within the CA that will enable users to
link budget expenditures to performance indicators.

62.      The success and credibility of the CA as a truly open, comprehensive and reliable
tool for budget analysis and monitoring will be dependent on the Government's
commitment to ensuring that coverage applies to all centralized agencies using SIGEF, and
that it gradually expands to other decentralized agencies. Critical steps in this direction will be:
(i) piloting CA's web application and portal in 2­3 sectors possibly health, education and
Solidaridad; (ii) expanding coverage to all centralized agencies using SIGEF; (iii) Gradual
inclusion of new decentralized agencies and municipal governments as they are incorporated into
SIGEF; and (iv) piloting CA's results module by including performance indicators as defined in
the Performance Agreements signed by health, education and Solidaridad.

63.      At the CCT program level, significant progress has also been made in terms of
transparency, civic participation and oversight. Regarding transparency, the Government
pursued its commitment to publish information on the supply gaps in health and education linked
to the redesigned CCT on the Solidaridad's website, as well as the list of beneficiaries. In fact,
Solidaridad's compliance with the Access to Information law has been recognized by civil
society organizations as a good practice in the agile and understandable proactive provision of
public information.22 In terms of civic participation, Solidaridad has continued to stimulate the
participation and involvement of beneficiary families by supporting their organization in nuclei,
as successfully done in Mexico and Colombia. Significant progress has also been made towards
strengthening the CCT community's oversight and performance accountability at the service
provider level, through the preparation of a pilot community scorecard (CSC) process, scheduled
to initiate implementation by October 1st, 2010 (See Section V, Policy Action IV which includes
this operation).

III.5 PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

64.     PASS-supported reforms continue to address the main concerns expressed by civil
society organizations, as demonstrated in continued Government and Bank-led
consultations, as summarized below. As described in Section V, the PASS devotes an entire
pillar to promoting reforms to improve transparency, citizen participation and community
oversight of social programs.

Government-led participatory processes

65.    Between January and July 2010, the Government held nationwide consultations
with civil society, entrepreneur associations, the media, international development
organizations, youth and academia on the draft National Development Strategy (NDS)
2010-2030. The revised draft of the NDS will thus be presented to the new Congress before the
end of the year. According to informal talks with civil society and academia attendees, the
consultations reiterated the need to enhance the distributive effects of growth and to increase the
human capital of the country by means of better social protection policies and improved
Government accountability.

66.     The first phase of the Government-Private Sector-Civil Society Anti-Corruption
Initiative (IPAC) sponsored by ten international development agencies between December
2009-July 2010, has concluded with concrete recommendations to the Presidency to
improve transparency and accountability of key sectors, such as health, education, access
to information, and water, among others. Recommendations included many PASS-related
areas, such as improved budget oversight by Civil Society. Among other results, the Government
has planned for the development of the information needs assessment for the Consulta Amigable
budget transparency tool, to be developed as part of the PASS reforms, with civil society groups.
The recommendations will be publicly discussed in October 2010 and concrete actions are
expected to be taken. This multi-stakeholder initiative has witnessed the participation of key
high-ranking government officials and is therefore expected to have a high degree of
Government ownership.

Bank-managed participatory processes

67.    To minimize political and social risks, during the identification and preparation of
the second DPL, consultations have been undertaken with Civil Society on the rationale
and strategies to be supported by the Operation. During the identification mission, the PASS
team had important consultations with the Civil Society Consultative Council (Consejo
Consultivo de la Sociedad Civil, CCSC), a consortium of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)
that monitors social policies.23 CCSC representatives underscored the urgent need to strengthen

23
  The GCPS is permanently advised by the Civil Society Consultative Council (CCSC), created by presidential
decree, as an advisory and consultation body with the objective of collaborating in the definition, formulation,
execution, and monitoring of social programs in the DR. The Council is made up of 32 CSOs, including networks
and umbrella organizations that represent diverse sectors (religious, academic, NGOs, health, etc.) The seven-
member Executive Committee meets every two weeks, and participates in the meetings organized by the GCPS, as
well as by the Director of Solidaridad.

                                                      32
the Council's technical capacities for an effective civic monitoring of social policies. They also
expressed their interest in benefiting from the technical assistance and knowledge-generation
activities that are being produced under the Social Sectors NLTA. The Council underlined the
importance of having a nationwide system to monitor the achievement of the indicators of social
protection policies.

68.      The PASS team has also initiated informal technical discussions with experts from
CSOs, academia, citizens, and beneficiaries during all stages of implementation of the first
phase. These discussions reiterated the need to protect and increase critical social spending, even
if the worst period of the crisis may be over. Critical to the success of large policy-based lending,
they argued, is an enabling environment to support both the supply and the demand for easy-to-
understand budgetary information. In coordination with the PASS-supported budget transparency
reform through the financial management system's "Consulta Amigable" tool, two ongoing
initiatives target improvements in civil society's budget analysis and monitoring capacities
(through Centro Juan Montalvo Public Budget Observatory) and Congress' budget oversight
functions (IDF for the Budget Planning Office).

69.     The DR CPS (2010-2013) includes a Strategic Objective specifically aiming at
building constituencies for reform. As such, PASS participatory consultations have been
mainstreamed into the PASS series. Meetings with more than 300 community-based
organizations, universities, and think-tanks have been held in four provinces (April­June, 2010)
to present the CPS and discuss ways for improvement and increased alliances. With regard to the
social protection sector, the following plan was advanced:
     In all provinces, organizations demanded improvements in the targeting of the social
        protection programs such as Solidaridad;
     In all provinces, organizations discussed the need to improve the quality of health and
        education services by increasing the decentralization of services to better respond to the
        actual needs of the specific localities;
     Organizations also demanded an increase in the transparency of public spending in
        general, while demanding resources for strengthening the capacity of local associations,
        CBOs, NGOs, in social auditing and budget oversight.

70.     Finally, and as a result of the increased demand by civil society for support, the
Bank framed a new civil society NLTA to mainstream available funding through several
initiatives to focus on strengthening civil society's capacities for monitoring governance and
accountability across the overall portfolio.

             IV.    BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


IV.1 LINK TO THE CPS

71.     As discussed in the PD for PASS1, the PASS program--including this second
proposed operation is consistent with the CPS, which calls for "reducing vulnerability
while producing results for all." The PASS helps to preserve and enhance the human assets of
the poor through a major shift from social assistance to the protection and promotion of human
capital in social policy. Accountability also forms a central pillar of the PASS, both within
government agencies, and between government agencies and the public. Specifically, the reforms
targeted by the PASS specifically align with the following CPS pillars: (a) the reform of the
safety net framework is in line with the pillar on Social Cohesion and Services, which calls for
producing better results in education, health and social protection; (b) the pillar on the Quality of
Public Expenditures and Institutional Development benefits from the contributions of the PASS
through: (i) measures to improve budget management to support the joint performance of social
sectors in delivering the CCT performance targets; and (ii) its overall approach to performance
orientation; and (c) the pillar on Capacity-building of Non-traditional Actors (including civil
society) benefits from a better informed demand for improved public budget performance as
well as from a strengthened demand regarding social service delivery.

IV.2 COLLABORATION WITH IMF

72.    A new 28-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved by the IMF Board in
November 2009 in an amount equivalent to SDR 1,095 million or 500 percent of quota
(about US$1,700 million). The main objective of the program is to "boost economic recovery in
an environment of macroeconomic stability and strengthen the country's growth prospects by
conducting a counter-cyclical policy in the short-run, while achieving sustainability over the
medium-term."

73.     A forthcoming review of the program was originally planned for August 2010, but
after some delays a staff-level agreement on this review has been reached at the beginning
of September 2010 and the IMF Board is expected in late October (see Annex 6).


IV.3 COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DONORS

74.     The PASS has been well aligned with donor coordination efforts that are taking
place in the Dominican Republic. The Bank has maintained continuous dialogue with the
IADB on the reform of the CCT program, Solidaridad. Coordination with the IADB has been
intersectoral, including education actions, as the IADB provides technical assistance to the
Ministries of Economy, Education, and Finance, to support, among other issues, the
Government's performance agenda. The IADB second investment loan to Solidaridad, to be
submitted to the IADB Board this year, will also complement the Bank Health project PARSS2
(Section IV.4 below) by supporting the strengthening of primary healthcare services. As
explained further above, IADB has also agreed to collaborate with the Bank in advancing


                                                 34
funding planned under the Programa de Modernizacion de la Administración de los Recursos
Públicos (PAFI II) for upgrading the SIGEF into a web-based, publicly accessible tool.

75.     The Bank has continued communication with the European Union (EU) and the
International Development Agency of Spain (AECI) to align budget support with some of
the policy actions and/or outcomes identified in the matrix. UNICEF has also been an
important partner in its efforts to complement the performance and accountability approach by
strengthening the legislative function of the congressional budget oversight office.

IV.4 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

76.      The PASS program's contribution to the revamp of the new CCT Solidaridad
program complements the activities undertaken by the Social Protection Investment Loan
(SPIL) (under implementation) and its corresponding Additional Financing (AF, approved by
the Board in September 2009 and ratified in May 2010). The SPIL assists poor, undocumented
Dominicans in obtaining national identity documents as an essential first step to integration into
the social protection programs such as Solidaridad. The SPIL and its AF also help finance
institutional strengthening of the targeting organization to develop a new socioeconomic census
that will improve the coverage and effectiveness of the CCT program, Solidaridad. The SPIL
and AF also develop the managerial and staff capacity of the Solidaridad program to adapt to
their new roles and responsibilities given the redesign of the operational rules of the CCT and
support the development of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system, in coordination
with the IADB. Neither the SPIL nor the AF finances the payment of transfers to households.

77.     The PASS program also plays an important role in complementing the second phase
of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) for the support to the Health Sector Reform
(PARSS2). Specifically, PASS provides a framework for exploiting synergies regarding better
intersectoral coordination for human capital investment and advancing the improved
accountability framework for the social sector. PARSS2 focuses on improving the delivery of
health services at the first level of care by introducing results-adjusted financing mechanisms
(capitations) for the first level of care and improvements in the quality of spending in the health
sector. The health-related co-responsibilities of the Solidaridad program rely on the supply of
health services at the first level of care.

78.    The PASS programs' education actions complement the implementation of the
Dominican Republic Early Childhood Education Project (7144­DO), which increases access
to Early Childhood Education, and the Dominican Republic Youth Development Project,
which provides poor and vulnerable youth with a second chance to complete their secondary
education.

IV.5 LESSONS LEARNED

79.    The results of the 2003 DR Crisis Response Adjustment Loan (SCRAL) hold
important lessons for the PASS. In particular, the SCRAL Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) states that "Bank lending can effectively achieve short-term crisis alleviation along with
modest advances on medium-term policy actions." In following the major ICR
recommendations, the PASS program has given careful attention to the selection of policy

                                                35
action, the consensus reached with Government on these actions, and inter-sectoral and donor
coordination.

80.    The Programmatic DPL Series on social sectors (REACT) in Peru also offers
important insights relevant to the PASS. The REACT series highlights the need to fully
involve social sector ministries in the gradual implementation of performance-informed
budgeting, while supporting an enabling environment for a better informed demand for enhanced
performance of social sectors. The REACT series also underscores the importance of focusing on
a few critical policy reforms and related results, while leveraging synergies with other Bank
operations in social sectors.

IV.6 ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

81.     As described in detail in the PD of PASS1, the PASS program builds on a series of
analytical and advisory reports from within and outside the Bank. Furthermore, the
Programmatic Social Sectors NLTA provides pivotal support to the PASS program to
build knowledge and capacity to enact the reforms targeted by the PASS program. The
NLTA supports the assessment and monitoring of the social impacts of the PASS-supported
reforms. In addition, the NLTA addresses knowledge and advisory gaps beyond the reforms
targeted by the PASS DPL to help strengthen the performance and quality of social services--
specifically education--and build resiliency to the effects of the economic crisis through
unveiling issues and options for a broadened social protection base, including active labor market
policies, and an integrated social protection system.

82.     The PASS program is also receiving important support from a second NLTA
product that aims at improving the quality of public expenditure.24 The NLTA on public
expenditure is the result of a concerted effort from the GoDR to improve the overall performance
of the public sector, particularly the quality of public expenditure. The NLTA is supporting
major government-led initiatives under the reform program for the strengthening of financial
management and procurement mechanisms, and the introduction and institutionalization of
performance information by key actors in the budget cycle as well as the implementation of the
performance contracts between actors. The NLTA is contributing to government efforts in
addressing challenges posed by new (and renewed) planning instruments, information systems,
and other initiatives. The reforms have set out to explicitly address, among several problems, a
weak strategic orientation of resource allocation processes, the lack of integration and
harmonization between budgeting and planning exercises, and the absence of capacities and tools
to measure and report on both financial and physical results. In that regard, there are several new
(and renewed) planning instruments, information systems, and other initiatives, including the
National Development Strategy, the Multi-Annual National Public Sector Plans (and regional
plans), the Medium-Term Sector and Institutional Strategic Plans, the Multi-Annual Public
Investment Plans, the Project Portfolio Monitoring System, performance contracts, and the
integrated financial management system (SIGEF).

                                V.       THE PROPOSED OPERATION


83.      The proposed PASS DPL2 operation is the second of a programmatic series of three
DPLs, envisaged to span over three years, to improve results in social sectors (mainly social
protection, education and health), preserving in the short-term and enhancing in the
medium-term the human capital of the poorest citizens. The PASS program's four inter-
related objectives remain consistent in the proposed second operation: (i) to enhance the
performance of social sectors to promote human capital (health, nutrition, and education) for the
poorest citizens, through a fundamental redesign of the Government's CCT) program,
Solidaridad, and its articulation with critical actions in health and education (Pillar I); (ii) to
improve budget management to support the joint performance of social sector agencies within
the CCT program, as part of the interim measures to protect critical aspects of social spending
and support the required improvements in the supply of health, nutrition and education services
(Pillar II); (iii) to support the gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in the key social
sector agencies (Pillar III); and (iv) to enhance transparency and oversight in social sectors
(Pillar IV).

84.     Expected Results. The social and public sector policy reforms supported by the PASS
are harmonious with the Government's long-term goal of improving major human development
indicators in education and health, especially for the poorest citizens.25 The PD of DPL1
presented specific results expected by the end of the PASS series (around the end of 2012),
selected monitoring indicators, baselines (when available) and targets. Annex 3 presents an
update of this results framework, which is divided in two parts: the overall expected results/final
outcomes of the PASS series package (the four policy pillars combined), and specific expected
results for each of the policy pillars. As a whole, the PASS is expected to increase the share of
CCT beneficiary households who invest in their human capital development, as measured by: (i)
an increase in the share of CCT beneficiary households who comply with health and nutrition co-
responsibilities (e.g., increased share of pregnant women in the Solidaridad program receiving
prenatal checks); and (ii) an increase in the share of students from CCT beneficiary families who
are enrolled in, attending and completing basic education, and who are enrolled in and attending
secondary school. Specific expected results for each of the pillars is described below with
specifics included in Annex 3.

85.     The Government has made progress on collecting and defining previously missing
baselines and subsequent target indicators linked to the reforms targeted by the PASS
program, despite significant obstacles. As explained in Section III.2, the development of an
integral monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for the Solidaridad Program only started
recently. When the initial indicators and targets for the M&E system were determined, the
Government estimated that each sectors' respective information system was designed to be able
to easily register the co-responsibilities of Solidaridad beneficiaries (e.g., school attendance and
daily health consult registries). In attempting to actually cross-check the Ministry of Education

25
   Specific long-term results expected in education include increased educational attainment of extremely poor
children, particularly in Early Childhood Development (ECD) (children 4-6 years old) enrollment, basic education
completion, and secondary school enrollment. In health, key long-term results include better Government
performance in the delivery of critical nutrition, child and prenatal health care services for the poorest citizens.

                                                        37
and Solidaridad databases for student enrollment, however, serious problems were discovered in
the incompatibility of the unique identifying variables across databases. The Government
launched a special emergency operation to produce the necessary adjustments. Measures taken
under this operation include orientation for the 528,000 Solidaridad heads of households on the
means of registering at their designated health center (UNAP) and the validation of a uniform
variable to monitor Solidaridad student attendance integrated into the Ministry of Education
registry system (SGCE). As a result of this special operation, the necessary baselines have now
all been calculated, along with targets for future years, with the exception of school attendance
due to inability to monitor data over the summer recess (to be completed in November 2010, see
Annex 3). The baseline study for the quantitative impact evaluation of the redesigned CCT has
also begun information collection, with results expected by November 2010 that will further
strengthen baseline estimates and indicator targets. With regard to indicators on Solidaridad
beneficiary satisfaction, the related baseline survey has faced delays in financing related to the
delayed Congressional ratification of the Additional Financing (AF) of the Social Protection
Investment Loan (SPIL); the AF finances key components of the integral M&E system,
including the process evaluation, qualitative evaluation and beneficiary surveys. Despite having
faced several obstacles in operationalizing the systems and surveys necessary to develop the
baselines and indicator targets, the Government has demonstrated consistent commitment to
advancing with a full M&E system for the Solidaridad program.

86.    Reforms supported by the first PASS operation, combined with other instruments,
were able to preserve the human capital of the poor in the short-term, mitigating the
historically negative impact of crises on the human capital of the poor and vulnerable. The
redesign of the safety net framework, especially the Solidaridad program, has been combined
with improved targeting of the fiscal resources dedicated to social transfers for extremely poor
families and the progressive coverage of supply-gaps in education, health and nutrition. Critical
steps have also been taken to initiate major reforms in social protection and quality of public
expenditure. Consistent with the Government's national priorities and the PASS program vision,
PASS2 aims to further institutionalize these gains to ensure the sustainability of progress and
move beyond preservation of human capital during the crisis to enhance the human capital assets
of the poorest citizens. To do this, PASS2 advances deeper into new processes and areas of
reform that had received less attention in PASS1.

87.    The first operation was approved in November 2009; this second operation is slated
for a Board date of November 2010, and the subsequent operation would proceed when the
GoDR has completed the agreed policy benchmarks (provisionally late 2011).

88.     Policy Areas. Consistent with the policy context analyzed in Section III, this section
describes the selected prior actions for PASS2 under the four policy areas that correspond to the
four objectives of the Program. Annex 1 provides a detailed comparison of these prior actions
with the initial formulation of triggers as provided in the PD of PASS1, an explanation the
rationale for changes when applicable, and an assessment of the status of each action. Annex 2
provides an updated version of the operation's policy matrix of prior actions and triggers for the
whole PASS program.




                                               38
89.    There have been only minor changes in the formulation and presentation of the
prior actions for this proposed PASS2. These prior actions remain consistent and on track
with the original program as presented in the PD of PASS1:
     Of the 18 original triggers for the second operation, only two reform aspects have
       suffered delays: (i) under Policy Area I on the CCT reform, the sub-component on
       developing the baselines for the verification of compliance with co-responsibilities has
       been delayed due to complexities of developing full-fledged nationwide information
       systems that are able to be cross-referenced across regions and sectoral programs on a
       regular basis (see above); and (ii) under Policy Area IV, the development of the Consulta
       Amigable tool, which is now scheduled to be completed by June 2011. Delays are mainly
       attributable to difficulties in funding the development of the web-based tool for budget
       transparency, which has now been resolved. As a sign of its commitment to increase
       budget transparency, however, the GoDR agreed to publish online budget execution
       reports in the interim.
     Out of concern for selectivity, the Bank-client team decided to reduce the number
       of policy actions that are criteria for disbursement (10 prior actions instead of the
       original 18 triggers), focusing on critical measures that are needed for reaching the
       full potential of the PASS series objectives at this stage of the reform process. In this
       context, although some original policy actions have already been implemented, they are
       no longer considered as criteria for disbursement. For example, under Policy Area I.4
       Quality of Service to CCT Beneficiaries, the GoDR fulfilled its commitment to enhance
       competition of neighborhood shops by expanding the number of affiliated colmados by
       18 percent, which will be considered by the PASS3 trigger calling for an even greater
       expansion. In consolidating actions, the prior action in this area, therefore, focuses on the
       more difficult transparency issues regarding access to account balance information for the
       Solidaridad debit card as the criterion for disbursement. Along the same lines, the
       education management information system (Policy Area 1.3) is up and running, but has
       been regrouped under a newly formulated trigger on the verification of co-
       responsibilities, which requires the use of the system.
     Finally, certain policy actions were reformulated to reflect achievements beyond
       expectations for PASS2 prior actions. Under Policy Area 1.1, for example, the prior
       action reflects the bold decision made by the Government to undertake a process of
       updating Solidaridad's organizational structure and personnel roles to better meet the
       needs of the redesigned program, a reform item that had not been initially considered.
       Another example is the Government's concerted effort to go beyond developing an
       independent "Policy Paper" (initial formulation) on projections on medium-term budget
       envelopes for supply-gaps related to the CCT to both develop these projections and
       ensure their timely incorporation into a new Government planning instrument, the Multi-
       Annual National Plan for the Public Sector 2010-2013 (originally a DPL3 trigger).

V.1 POLICY AREA I. ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE                 OF   SOCIAL SECTOR AGENCIES         TO
PROMOTE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HUMAN CAPITAL

90.    As explained in the PD for PASS1, the first area of policy reform involves a
fundamental shift in the current social assistance model of the Solidaridad program to
develop a full-fledged CCT program focused on the human capital promotion of the

                                                39
poorest citizens. This policy area therefore involves the institutional and operational redesign of
the Solidaridad program and its articulation with critical actions in health and education. The
overall service quality and targeting issues related to the Solidaridad program are also addressed
under the pillar in order to improve the accuracy of beneficiary selection, while enhancing the
competition and transparency of the use of the payment mechanism, the Solidaridad card.
Expected results include improvements in governance and operative rules of the redesigned CCT
such that, for example, verification of compliance with health co-responsibilities by CCT
beneficiary households would reach 90 percent by the end of the PASS series (December 2012)
and 80 percent by the end of this second operation (November 2011).

91.    Policy Area I.1: Conceptual, Institutional and Operative Revamp of the CCT
Solidaridad. The reforms of the Solidaridad program target the conceptual, institutional, and
operative revamp of the Solidaridad program to be exclusively dedicated to providing transfers
to poor families conditional on investments in health, nutrition, and education. Specifically, and
consistent with the Government's program and context described in Section III, PASS 2 will:
     Institutionalize gains in intersectoral and interagency coordination by supporting the
       approval of the regulations governing the day-to-day functioning of the CCT Interagency
       Committee (composed of ADESS, SIUBEN, and Solidaridad) and CCT Intersectoral
       Committee (Solidaridad, Health and Education).
     Ensure the alignment of Solidaridad's institutional structure and personnel roles with the
       CCT reform by supporting the implementation of the organizational development plan for
       Solidaridad.
     Promote a sustainable agreement within the CCT Intersectoral Committee on the
       procedures and timeline for the systematic verification of co-responsibilities starting in
       January 2011, based on the results and lessons learned from the Special Operation that is
       currently being undertaken for this purpose. This agreement will include planned and
       existing actions being taken to continually improve and enhance the compatibility of the
       education and health sector information systems with the Solidaridad information
       system.

92.     Policy Area I.2: Additional Health Actions. The PASS Program--including this
proposed second operation--supports important reforms related to the articulation of the CCT
reform with the health sector. However, these health actions are difficult to isolate in a single
sub-set of actions. For example, improvements in the articulation with the health sector are
reflected in Policy Area I.1 on the verification of co-responsibilities (Prior Action 2). Other areas
of reform include: (i) improved budget management to bridge supply-gaps (which benefits both
health and education, see Policy Area II); and (ii) improved quality of strategic planning through
the reform supporting the introduction of performance-informed budgeting (Policy Area III) ­
including the signing of management agreements between regional health services and the
Ministry of Public Health. The latter will make a significant contribution to strengthen the
provision of primary health care services required under the new Solidaridad co-responsibilities.
These co-responsibilities aim to address the low quality of mother and child health care services
at the first level of care (See Section III.2). Looking ahead, PASS3 will improve the knowledge
and practices of health staff on maternal-infant care, according to new national protocol by
promoting the mandatory training of health staff on the new protocol of the Government's action
plan for maternal-infant care. As highlighted in Section III.2, this training is a necessary

                                                 40
condition for launching the new approach to improve the quality of maternal and child care
delivery. PASS3 could also support the development of a national evaluation system to evaluate
health staff adherence to this training and the enhancement of record keeping and monitoring of
primary health care activities, through the development of an informational tool for the daily
registry of primary level care activities (PASS3).

93.     Policy Area I.3: Additional Education Actions. The additional education actions are
not meant to support broader education reforms linked to quality enhancement, but to enhance
the articulation between the revamped CCT program Solidaridad and the supply of education
services. In this context, this line of action will continue to address three main issues: (i) the lack
of an information system owned by the Ministry of Education to verify the compliance of co-
responsibilities--while the information system is up and running, the initial trigger for this issue
has been absorbed under the prior action above (Policy Area I.1) on the verification of co-
responsibilities; (ii) the lack of differentiated financial incentives in education programs to offset
the opportunity costs of schooling (mainly addressed in PASS3); and (iii) the inability of the
Ministry of Education to monitor student learning outcomes, including students from CCT
families. Specifically, PASS2 will:

       Continue to improve monitoring of student outcomes to allow for the development of a
       second-generation CCT Program, specifically supporting: (i) the administration of
       student learning outcome tests for the first cycle of Basic Education (4th grade) and the
       validation of student evaluation standards for the second cycle of Basic Education.
       PASS3 would support the administration of the adjusted student learning outcome tests
       for the second cycle of Basic Education (8th grade) and the validation of student
       evaluation standards for secondary education.

94.     As discussed in Sections III.1 and III.2, PASS3 could address new areas of reform in
education linked to improvements in resource and information flows, which would in turn
improve the efficiency of the newly assigned resources for education to close supply-gaps
for CCT-related services. These new elements of the PASS program would take place subject
to the interest and buy-in of the Government in the results and recommendations of the Bank-
sponsored analytical and advisory activities that are currently under way.

95.     Policy Area I.4: Enhanced Quality of Service to CCT Beneficiaries. The quality of
the Solidaridad payment mechanism has been a crosscutting issue recognized as having room for
improvement (See Section III.2). PASS2 will launch efforts to address the lack of beneficiary
access to basic account information. Specifically, PASS2 supports the implementation of actions
allowing beneficiaries to be informed of the total amount of the transfers and the available
account balance on their cards through the use of a free telephone line starting December 1st,
2010. PASS3 would deepen the reform by allowing beneficiaries to conveniently access real-
time account information free of charge, among other advances. As discussed in section III.2, the
Government has also started to expand the number of affiliated neighborhood shops as agreed in
the context of the PASS program. PASS3 should see the completion of this vast expansion that
should help enhance competition among providers, and therefore price and quality.




                                                  41
96.    Policy Area I.5: Improved Targeting Performance. This line of action addresses the
need to reduce targeting errors of inclusion and exclusion in the list of eligible CCT
beneficiaries. Major problems include: (i) an outdated database, as the last SIUBEN census was
carried out in 2004-2005; and (ii) the lack of clear oversight over the list of eligible CCT
beneficiaries, as both SIUBEN and Solidaridad maintain the list of eligible beneficiaries for the
Solidaridad program (SIUBEN for household heads, and the CCT Solidaridad for all household
members). The latter issue was addressed by the revision of operative rules for the CCT
Interagency Committee (PASS2 prior action for Policy Area I.1). SIUBEN has now been given
the unique institutional responsibility as the only agency accountable for maintaining and
updating the registry of Solidaridad beneficiaries. PASS3 would support the implementation of a
new SIUBEN census and subsequent updating of its database as a means of improving targeting
accuracy and expanding coverage into new geographic areas.


V.2 POLICY AREA II. IMPROVING BUDGET MANAGEMENT                      TO   SUPPORT   THE   JOINT
PERFORMANCE OF THE CCT PROGRAM

97.     This program's area of reform addresses the need to both increase budget
allocations to meet the entitlements envisioned under the redesigned CCT Solidaridad
program and related health and education programs, and ensure that the budget for the
integrated CCT (combining transfers and supply-side services) is programmed and
executed. Expected (measurable) results focus on a better management of budget projections for
social sectors, with a reduction in the difference between the proposed appropriations and their
actual allocation in order to cover the supply-gaps linked to the Solidaridad program (Annex 3,
Policy Area II).

98.     As discussed in Section III.1 and III.3, this area has been critical to protect social
spending levels in the short-term in light of the financial crisis and support improvements
in the redesigned Solidaridad program execution and the related supply of education and
health services. The challenge for this area is now to move from temporary protection of budget
entitlements to develop medium-term policy instruments to increase the predictability and
efficiency of the financial management and budget processes across sectors as they relate to the
execution of the Solidaridad program. Specifically, PASS2 will:
     Include sufficient resources in the 2010 National Budget Law to meet the output targets
        of the Solidaridad program, along with strengthened procedures to ensure the execution
        of these resources (PASS2). These monitoring procedures include developing quarterly
        reviews of the progress in executing the allocated funds.
     Enhance the sustainability of planning and budgeting for the Solidaridad program and
        associated supply-side gaps by reflecting, in the Multi-Annual National Plan for the
        Public Sector 2010-2013 (multi-year planning instrument), the medium-term guidelines
        for social protection policy with projections as to the coverage, estimated budget, and
        financing bases, including the quantification of the service coverage gaps in education
        and health linked to the Solidaridad program. For PASS2, the 2011 Budget Project will
        include these cost projections in its formal presentation to the Dominican Congress.
        Originally a PASS3 trigger, the inclusion of these projections in the multi-year Plan
        represents a significant advance in improving intersectoral planning, predictability, and

                                               42
       sustainability for the CCT. PASS3 would also ensure that the annual budget is firmly
       linked to the rolling multi-year CCT projections.

V.3 POLICY AREA III. SUPPORTING           THE   GRADUAL INTRODUCTION        OF   PERFORMANCE
AGREEMENTS IN THE SOCIAL SECTORS

99.    This area of policy reform supports the Government strategy to shift away from its
current budget management focus on financial and human inputs to prioritize flexible,
performance-informed budgeting allocation (See Section III.4). Expected measurable results
would include the development of strategic plans for priority programs in health, nutrition, and
education related to the Solidaridad program that include multi-year objectives and projections
of expenditures, budget structures, goals, and monitoring indicators (See Annex 3). As planned,
PASS2 will:
     Continue to promote the gradual introduction of performance agreements in social
       sectors by supporting the current critical stages of the Government's reform in the
       delivery of the institutional strengthening plans that assess the preparedness, capacity
       building, and training needs for the introduction of Performance Agreements in the
       education and health sectors. Under PASS3, Performance Agreements would be signed
       with the Ministries of Health and Education that establish strategic plans, objectives,
       performance indicators and budgets, covering at least the priority programs in the social
       sectors, and will be included as an annex to the Budget. As discussed in Section III, the
       Social Cabinet could also consider institutional diagnostics and strengthening plans for
       Solidaridad under PASS3 subject to the completion of the organizational redesign of the
       Solidaridad program.
     Consolidate internal regional management agreements in the health sector for results-
       based budgeting by promoting the signing of internal management agreements between
       the Ministry of Health and all Regional Health Services (PASS2). This prior action has
       considerable synergies with the policy actions supported in Policy Area I and expected
       results are reflected in Annex 3 under Policy Area I.

V.4 POLICY AREA IV. IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT

100. As discussed in the PD of PASS1, this last area of the PASS program addresses two
critical challenges hindering a more informed demand for improved public sector
performance in social sectors: (i) at the level of the Government budget, the Financial
Management Information System (SIGEF) is only accessible by authorized users,
hindering public access to timely and comprehensive budget information; and (ii)
Solidaridad does not have an effective social auditing scheme with verifiable and
quantifiable feedback loops and complaints to Solidaridad about related health and
education inputs are not shared with the respective sectors. Specifically, PASS 2 will:

       Promote full disclosure of Government budget information to improve public access and
       understanding of the budget by supporting the development of a user-friendly, easy-to-
       understand, web-based tool, "Consulta Amigable" (CA), developed as an interface of




                                                43
        SIGEF26 (with launching by PASS3), and the regular publication online of budget
        execution reports in the interim. PASS2--related reforms also include the development
        of a module within the CA to allow users (civil society groups, NGOs, media,
        researchers, the public, etc.) to link budget expenditures to performance indicators in
        health, education, and social protection. As an interim measure, budget execution reports
        will be published online to allow greater budget transparency and accountability starting
        September 2010. As part of the Anti-Corruption Participatory Initiative, the information
        needs assessment for the CA tool will be conducted with civil society groups by PASS3.
        In terms of expected results, by the end of PASS3 (December 2012), at least 60
        independent users would be registered to use the Consulta Amigable tool.
        Support the implementation of a community scorecards pilot during the period of
        October 2010 to May 2011, with a view to expand it to the CCT as a whole for DPL3,
        subject to pilot results. Previously, the Solidaridad program did not include an effective
        social auditing scheme with verifiable and quantifiable feedback or adequate feedback
        loop. The Intersectoral CCT Committee defined a list of elements to be included for
        evaluation in the scorecard. A draft operative process for the sequencing of the CSC
        process was already approved by the CCT Intersectoral Committee. Given the absence of
        prior experience in implementing community scorecards in the DR, the Bank has
        provided substantial technical assistance­-with guidance on good practices in other
        countries and regions--to the Social Cabinet and Solidaridad for advancing this process.
        In the short-term, community scorecards will mainly focus on aspects of CCT service
        quality (e.g., payments made on time, and training delivered) and the presence of inputs
        that are necessary for the compliance with the newly defined co-responsibilities: for
        example, teachers present at school and the availability of micronutrients. The
        community scorecards will be accompanied by the rolling-out of an improved
        accountability chain involving direct service providers and users, at district, regional and
        national management levels. Looking ahead, PASS3 should further publish the results of
        the pilot, while also supporting the enhancement of the Solidaridad complaint system to
        include complaints associated with the provision of education and health services.


                            VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION


VI.1 POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

101. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) has been undertaken as a client-
driven analytical and policy base to examine and monitor the expected impacts and
potential risks of priority policy actions supported by the PASS DPLs series. This approach
also helps formulate recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.

102. As underpinned in the PASS DPL1 PD, early findings taken from literature and key
stakeholders` interviews pointed to the potential for positive impacts from the newly

26
  This automated interface will be linked to performance indicators. An administrative agreement has been signed
between MOF and MEPYD to develop a pilot to define performance indicators in health, education, and social
protection that will be linked to budget information (see Annex 1 for detailed formulation of prior actions).

                                                      44
conditional cash transfer program to promote human capital accumulation among the
poor, while producing positive externalities beyond the program on improved targeting,
results-based financing, greater transparency, and complementary health and education
efforts. Conversely, the findings also highlighted the barriers to compliance with health and
education co-responsibilities by poor families, including lack of access to national identity
documentation and the penalization of households for non-compliance due to remaining supply
gaps.

103. Additional analysis confirms the substantial expected positive human capital
impacts of the CCT overhaul. In their efforts to restructure Solidaridad, the Government
and particularly the Social Cabinet emphasized the need for greater evidence on
anticipated impacts on education and health for the poor. Since the actual impact evaluation
is scheduled for 2012, an ex-ante micro simulation model was used to estimate the following
expected impacts27:
    a. First, an anticipated increase in enrollment by 6 percentage points among poor children.
       Solidaridad (through its targeted and differentiated benefits Comer es Primero, Incentivo
       a la Asistencia Escolar and Bonogas) should increase enrollment among poor children in
       rural areas by 6 percentage points (from 71.0 percent to 76.9 percent) compared to 1.5
       percentage points for all children.28 This highlights not only the actual effect on lifting
       financial barriers to education for the most vulnerable families but stresses the
       concentrated social impacts (and rationalized expenditures) expected from sustained
       efforts to support comprehensive targeting accuracy. Furthermore, 9.2 percent of working
       children could potentially start attending school and drop out of the labor market in order
       to receive the transfer. Hence, introducing education conditionalities as part of the
       Solidaridad program is estimated to hold unanticipated, but significant effects on
       reducing child labor in the Dominican Republic.29
    b. For the health sector, attendance of children under­5 by a Healthcare Professional should
       double. Solidaridad (through Comer es Primero only in this case) is expected to double
       attendance to health centers among poor children in rural areas from 32.3 percent to 66.0
       percent, compared to an increase by 9.1 percentage points for all children. Increased
       attendance of young children by medical professionals represents a major positive step
       towards ensuring positive cognitive development for poor children. Additional ongoing
       efforts to improve the quality of health services at the first level of care, shows
       encouraging results, tripling attendance by children in poor rural areas (from 32.3 percent
       to 93.2 percent) by focusing on the first level of care. These results emphasize the need to
       continue a two-pronged (supply and demand) approach when revamping the social
       assistance envelope to ensure human capital accumulation.




27
   The full report `Simulation of the Impact of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs on Education and Health in the
Dominican Republic' (Reboul, Leite and Subran, 2010) is being finalized. Consultations with the Government will
be held in November 2010.
28
   Note that different scenarios and sensitivity analyses were run. On poverty, the anticipated impact points to a
decrease ranging from 8 to 10 percentage points. Take-up rate is expected to be between 80 percent (compliance to
be expected for education co-responsibilities and 100 percent). Costs are constrained under 0.1 percent of GDP.
29
   The ENIGH, 2007 database did not allow any simulation on attendance.

                                                       45
     c. The quality of services remains a major factor behind immunization rates and prenatal
        controls. Increased multi-sectoral actions have been initiated to ensure positive change.30
        Through interviews with key informants, a literature review31 and regression models,
        emerging findings point to the risk that increasing real incomes by itself does not
        necessarily translate into improved health outcomes. Simple regressions confirm that the
        mother's education level, and the mother's age are positively correlated with child
        vaccination rates and attendance by a specialist for prenatal check-ups, whereas the size
        of the family shows a negative correlation with both practices (marginal effects range
        from 1 to 5 percentage points). Despite high levels of prenatal care, maternal mortality
        remains disproportionately high; the lack of trust and confidence in the first level of care
        seems to foster a lack of continuity in attendance, even in rural areas. Mitigation
        measures initiated by the Government include enhanced training of health personnel (as
        part of the newly-formulated PASS2 prior actions), mandatory training workshops for
        Solidaridad households (as per the operational manual of the program), and the
        introduction of results-based financing in health. With the support of various partners,
        the Government has begun exploring synergies in delivering more and better care,
        especially in maternal-infant care.

104. As part of the WB Social Protection Investment Loan (SPIL), the Government has
taken significant steps to ensure the poor are documented in order to participate in the
Social Protection System. As of June 1st, 2010, the Central Electoral Council, through the
National Registry, has issued national identity documents to 67,273 poor, previously
undocumented Dominicans through demand-based processes established by the SPIL project.
Once a major risk to the certification of beneficiaries, as identified in Project Document of PASS
DPL1, the Government has initiated additional grassroots processes to provide undocumented
Dominicans with legal counsel to obtain their IDs. The process is expected to be completed in
2011 with continued increases in documentation in the country, particularly among the poor.

105. Though the risk of a lack of health and education service availability is decreasing
with the rollout of the program to close Solidaridad-related supply-gaps in education,
health and nutrition (see Box 2, Section III.2), several options are being analyzed by the
Government to ensure a robust transition towards a full-fledged CCT. The Government has
undertaken a substantial paradigm shift by prioritizing supply-side interventions in health,
education and nutrition. These gaps were calculated based on additional inputs and infrastructure
needed for the effective delivery of the co-responsibilities in health and education to Solidaridad
beneficiaries, and were estimated at US$322.2 million for three years (i.e., US$107.4 million per
year) with 88 percent of funds for education gaps, 11.7 percent for health and 0.3 percent for
nutrition. Given the operationalization of information systems to verify co-responsibilities,
additional emphasis has now been placed on the actual execution of these funds to close supply-
gaps to ensure Solidaridad beneficiaries are able to comply with co-responsibilities. In parallel,
various scenarios are being discussed on the how to temporarily prevent penalization of non-

30
   Limited data is available on the relationship between immunization and prenatal control practices (DHS 2007)
and income. Initial recommendations for the baseline of the impact evaluation and an increased emphasis on health
indicators in national surveys (including out-of-pocket payments) have been formulated.

internacional al crecimiento para todos, Notas de Política. Banco Mundial.

complying families due to the lack of service supply in a given area. The team will be informed
of the final decisions by the GoDR before negotiations.

106. As outlined in the PASS1 PD, the PASS-related reforms are expected to help
increase, improve and better target social expenditures. From programming to the execution
of regular budget lines in education and health, and specific complementary supply investments,
the incidence of social expenditures on the most vulnerable is an important dimension for
analysis. Among the risks identified, the volatility and vulnerability of these expenditures to
macroeconomic conditions, and the actual pro-poor prioritization of specific investments are at
stake.

107. Between 2005 and 2009, public expenditures on social sectors increased from 6 to 8
percent of GDP. This is an important step forward given that the Dominican Republic remains
one of the countries with the lowest share of GDP spent on education and health. Expenditures
in real terms for education and health increased by 130 percent and 83 percent, respectively.
Early analysis from the Ministry of Economy shows a buffer effect from the DPL lending to help
protect some of the critical health and education inputs that had previously suffered severe
budget cuts in times of crisis in the DR.

108. Initial results suggest semi-progressive spending in education, to be potentially
offset by the specific investments to close the supply gaps. Using a Benefit Incidence
Analysis (BIA) methodology32 across education levels, results indicate mixed evidence on
how pro-poor education expenditures are. For initial education, for instance, enrollment rates
are unsurprisingly at the lowest levels, 31 percent on average, with the highest levels of variance
by regions and income levels, though incidence analysis shows that per capita expenditures are
pro-poor. The poorest third of the population is receiving 41 percent of the total envelope.
However, when refining the analysis for the target population (3-5 years), the evidence points to
a different phenomenon: children below the extreme poverty line receive 3.2 percentage points
less in per capita expenditures terms (moderate poor 2.5 percentage points less) whereas non-
poor receive 5.6 percentage points more. This variation is in part explained by high repetition
rates and low attendance among poor children. This analysis provides important analytical
underpinnings for the major coordinated investments in closing supply gaps in education in areas
with major concentration of Solidaridad beneficiaries (approximately US$284 million supported
by development partners and increased public financing). Estimates of the actual catch-up effect
in the incidence of total education spending will be calculated by the end of 2010 when
information on execution is more robust. Results for basic education point to pro-poor spending,
whereas middle school education tends to be regressive. These weaknesses are certainly
exacerbated by institutional and planning bottlenecks as emphasized in a recent report.33
Discussions to address these particular issues are being discussed for the formulation of policy
triggers in PASS DPL3.

109. The resources dedicated to the closing of supply gaps in health are shown to be very
progressive. Even though actual execution of coverage of the pending supply-gaps is slightly

32
   The draft report `Análisis de incidencia del gasto público orientado a cerrar las brechas de oferta en salud y
educación en la Republica Dominicana' (Yepes and Subran, 2010) is in progress.

   See World Bank. 2010. Analisis Organizacional del Sector Educativo. Draft.

                                                       47
behind schedule, the analysis suggests significant potential for the funds to be dedicated to
delivering more and better care for the poorest in the country. The difference between poverty
incidence and health spending incidence for the specific investments is less than five percentage
points. When disaggregating between rehabilitated and new first-level of care units, this finding
prevails, though rehabilitation appears more cost-effective in increasing coverage amongst the
poor.

110. The CCT Intersectoral Committee will continue to closely monitor and take
corrective actions for the pro-poor execution of specific investments in closing the supply-
gaps. The Government is consolidating the gains made by allocating these new supply funds by
increasing the oversight of the CCT Intersectoral Committee on the execution of social sectors
specific investments. Regular monitoring of the incidence of such investments on the poor is a
major step forward to ensure maximum impacts in the reform process contemplated under the
PASS DPL Series.34

111. In terms of the options for preparing PASS DPL3, strong emphasis will be placed on
building the capacity of Government agencies on methodology used for enhancing the
monitoring of policy reforms (micro-simulation and incidence of social spending). A
workshop on disseminating emerging findings and identifying analytical gaps for a third phase in
preparation for PASS DPL3 will be conducted in November 2010.


VI.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

112. As concluded in the preparation of PASS DPL1, the actions supported by the PASS
series are not likely to generate significant positive or negative effects on the environment,
forests, and other natural resources. PASS DPL2 activities do not diverge significantly from
the original, planned activities. One minor change, removing the trigger on the design of an
action plan to improve vaccination rates for children under five at the first level of care, has
eliminated the only activity estimated to have a (moderate) environmental effect (i.e., generation
of medical waste). Nevertheless, new health co-responsibilities under the redesigned CCT
Solidaridad program, along with the action plan on maternal-infant still hold minor
environmental implications, whose mitigation is discussed below. Overall, minor environmental
effects could result from policy areas supported by the DPL, though no significant effects are
expected.

113. The potential positive and negative effects are noted below, with proposed measures
under the DPL to fill potential gaps in the country system to mitigate those effects:

         Policy Area I: The institutional revamp of the CCT Solidaridad program and new co-
         responsibilities of program beneficiaries in health, nutrition, and education are expected

34
   For instance, initial results point to regional differences in the allocation of education expenditures (main budget)
and additional expenditures in health in line with the incidence of poverty, pointing to a bias towards population
density rather than the concentration of poverty. Such analyses, once finalized could be presented to the CCT
Intersectoral Committee and discussed with regional authorities to take action on re-prioritization.


                                                          48
         to create an increased demand for services. This could potentially generate environmental
         effects in terms of biomedical waste management (BMWM). The Bank has been engaged
         with the health sector for several years on this issue even before the current series of
         Adaptable Programmatic Loans (APL) in support of the Health Sector Reform. The
         implementation of the Health Sector Reform Project (PARSS1) built on the activities
         conducted by the previous Provincial Health Services Project and provided resources to
         assess needs and support the strengthening of infrastructure and training in healthcare
         facilities to start a process of continuous BMWM improvement. In 2007, the Government
         developed new BMWM regulations with support from PARSS1 to develop the
         operational guidelines for the implementation of new regulations that were adopted by
         Executive Decree in 2009 (Decree 126-09). The second phase of the APL (PARSS2) will
         contribute to the development of tools for monitoring the implementation and
         enforcement of the new regulation to develop measurable goals and targets to ensure that
         the country is indeed moving in the direction of an enhanced capacity to mitigate these
         risks. The PASS DPL trigger on the obligatory training for health staff on the new
         maternal-infant care protocol will include key considerations for waste management.
         During the new CPS period, within the framework of the PASS series, and exploiting
         synergies with PARSS2, the Bank will continue to explore opportunities to support
         capacity building to implement these new procedures, train personnel, and establish
         stronger coordination with the Ministry of the Environment for waste and occupational
         safety issues.
         Policy Area II: The Multi-Annual National Plan for the Public Sector 2010-2013 on
         medium-term projections of social protection coverage, budget envelopes and revenue
         sources would include coverage of identified gaps in the performance targets for CCT
         programs, including in education, primary health care, and nutrition, including
         micronutrients. This may imply expansion or new constructions of schools and health
         care facilities. These implications on the rehabilitation/construction of schools, health
         clinics and/or stores would be mitigated through the framework of construction
         guidelines already in place through the existing WB projects in health and education.

114. Policy Areas III and IV, focused on performance agreements and increased transparency,
are still not expected to generate significant environmental effects.

VI.3 IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

115. The implementation and monitoring of PASS DPL2 will continue to rely on the close
coordination of the Bank team with the respective institutions responsible for the PASS
reforms, namely the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, the Social Cabinet, the
Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Education, all of which will provide the requisite
baseline data, when available, from which to measure outcomes by the end of the
program.35 (See Annex 3, Select Monitoring Indicators). The Social Cabinet, through the CCT
Intersectoral Committee, will continue to assist in the coordination of information reporting on

35
   Data is available for most of the indicators described in the matrix. The main exception relates to the current lack
of beneficiary's assessment for the CCT. The latter will be financed by an additional financing to the Bank's social
investment project, which is currently under preparation.

                                                         49
the program's monitoring indicators related to Policy Area 1 on the shift toward human capital
promotion and to some extent on Policy Area 4 on transparency and civic oversight for the CCT
program. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy and Planning, will report
progress monitoring indicators for Policy Areas 2 and 3.

VI.4 FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

116. The fiduciary risk related to the Public Financial Management (PFM) environment
in the Dominican Republic is considered moderately high. This rating is confirmed through a
review of a number of analytical PFM assessments undertaken in recent years. These include the
2005 Country Fiduciary Assessment (including the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment and Country Portfolio Performance Review), the Public Expenditure Review, the
2007 Public Expenditures and Financial Accountability (PEFA), the 2009 Update Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on Accounting & Auditing, and the Policy Note
"Hacia un sistema de rendición de cuentas y desempeño en la República Dominicana." There is
also an ongoing 2010 independent Repeat PEFA assessment, with preliminary results issued in a
revised draft version in September 2010.

117. In the last few years the Dominican Republic has engaged in reviewing,
strengthening and reforming the way its public finances are planned and managed. The
country has made good progress in passing important reforms that targeted the FM legal
framework and redefined the role of the institutions involved in public financial management.
Developing the reforms has involved not only senior officials, particularly those within the
relatively new Ministries of Finance, Economy, Planning and Development, and Public
Administration, but congressional members and other oversight entities concerned with quality
and efficiency of budget execution and control. Indeed, the World Bank has noted a renewed
commitment by government officials in the institutions that are responsible for the
implementation of these PFM reforms.

118. A number of advances have been registered. Budget execution and monitoring are
relatively less problematic, and significant progress were made in the last few years with
multiple budget related initiatives being implemented simultaneously. Both the 2007 PEFA
report and preliminary results of the draft Repeat PEFA 2010 have noted as a positive
development the alignment of budget classifiers with international standards as documented in
the Government Finance Statistics Manual issued by the IMF in 2001. This process has already
been completed for central government entities.

119. During the last few years the government has deployed and is steadily implementing
a countrywide Integrated Financial Management Information System: the SIGEF system
now covers almost half of the municipalities and its subsystem of implementing units with
external resources, UEPEX, is already being utilized in most projects financed by major
development partners. However, the integration of this system with the new (and renewed)
planning instruments, and other initiatives recently introduced including the Development
Strategy, the Multi-Annual National Plan for the Public Sector 2010-2013, the Regional Plans,
the Medium-Term Sector and Institutional Strategic Plans, and performance contracts, among
others, remain a challenge. Once existing management challenges are addressed and the


                                             50
integrated information system is fully deployed to all public entities, including decentralized
entities to cover the whole spectrum, improvements are expected in enhanced transparency,
strengthened internal controls, improved recording of accounting transactions and greater access
to quality, timely, and digestible public financial data.

120. On the other hand, there still exist some significant challenges in the PFM domain.
Although the on-going efforts by Government to reform public financial management are widely
recognized and most major laws have now been revised, their implementation has been slow and
is a recurrent theme in the analytical assessments that have been undertaken. Such
implementation requires significant capacity building and sensitization of public officials on the
changed practices introduced by the laws, and these efforts are still ongoing. Both assessments
highlight serious limitations in the breadth, the content and the method of presenting the
financial information. Among deficiencies, they point out the pending challenge to present
consolidated information at non-financial public sector level, and the absence of full treatment of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements. Also, current national standards do not permit
the presentation of information on various stages of the expenditure cycle other than the payment
stage. Such information, for instance on commitments, would permit a more effective monitoring
of budget implementation and the utilization of funds. Recognizing this challenge, The General
Directorate of Governmental Accounting (DIGECOG) has expressed Government's interest in
bringing the accounting standards in line with the International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS). As a first step, the Government recently initiated an assessment of the gaps
that exist between national and international standards, a process that will be supported under the
IADB-financed Project for Integral Financial Management (PAFI II).

121. The main PFM oversight entities, the Contraloría General de la República
(Comptroller General, CGR) and the Cámara de Cuentas (Chamber of Accounts, CdC), are
both members of the LAC Organization for Supreme Audit Institutes (OLACEFs ­
Organización Latinoamericana de Entidades Fiscalizadoras Superiores). Both are responsible
for the internal and external audit functions of the public sector, although CdC has a broader
scope, since the CGR is limited to entities of the Central Government. Both entities are
implementing concrete measures to improve governmental performance accountability by
enhancing their capacity and staff skills in accordance with their new legal framework. With
very limited resources, largely financed by external resources, both entities have been
implementing activities to improve compliance with their legal auditing mandate. The CGR has
kept its internal control role as prior reviewer, which had been removed by the Internal Control
Law but was reinstated by the new Constitution, despite its incompatible function with that of
auditor. To be able to comply with this role, the CGR would require a substantial increase in its
workforce, which translates into greater resource allocation.             The CdC, following
recommendations of a self assessment of its institutional arrangements performed in 2008, is
compelled to enhance its effectiveness and strengthen its capability as Supreme Audit Institution
(SAI) while addressing the low public trust in the organization. Along these lines, the Chamber
has signed agreements with the European Commission, the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), among other donors.                 Through an Institutional
Development Facility Grant for Public Management and Financial Accountability, the WB
approved a grant expected to begin implementation shortly. Both oversight entities have also
signed inter-institutional agreements, along with agreements with other governmental oversight

bodies, such as the Dirección de Prevención de la Corrupción Administrativa (DPCA); however,
beyond formulation, the actual implementation of those agreements is uncertain. With multi-
year and multi-sectoral non-lending technical assistance, the WB will support these oversight
entities, among others, recognizing the role civil society organizations play on the demand side
to balance governmental efforts for increased accountability and transparency in the management
of public funds.

122. Procurement. The latest Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for the
Dominican Republic was published in April 2005. Since then the country passed Law 340-06 for
Public Procurement of Goods, Works, Services and Concessions, approved in August 2006 and
later modified by Law 449-06. This law is the first to comprehensively include all aspects of
procurement of goods, works, services, the selection of consultants and concessions in the
country, while also attempting to increase competition and transparency by allowing direct
contracting only for limited circumstances specifically detailed in the law. As the country entered
into the DR-CAFTA negotiations, the Public Procurement Law has been validated as fully
consistent with the procurement provisions of said agreement. Another important milestone in
the procurement reform was the passing of Decree No. 490-07 that provided the enabling
regulations for the new procurement law and the launching the portal "comprasdominicana".

123. Nevertheless, despite these achievements in the past four years, the country still
faces important challenges in public procurement reform. Law 340-06 is not being fully
implemented and there is the need for more transparency and efficiency in the system. The
Bank is providing support to the national procurement body, Dirección General de
Contrataciones Públicas (DGCP), in their National Procurement Strategic Plan and in the
application of the OECD Procurement Indicators. The National Procurement Strategic Plan
under preparation includes activities that are to be implemented in the short, medium and long
term to ensure significant improvements in the procurement system. The support from the
Government to this Plan is crucial for procurement reform.

124. Flow of Funds. In the last five years the flow of funds within the DR portfolio from
Designated Accounts denominated in US Dollars to the Operating Account in RD pesos, has
dramatically improved, and most of the issues that persist are procurement related. Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) reported the cycle continues to be from five to seven days,
according to discussions during the Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) in 2009 with
a stable pace for the 2010 CPPR. A more efficient release of allocated funds via the Treasury,
following the cycle indicated in the new legal framework, which included eliminating the need to
involve entities which added no value to the process, in addition to the use of modern
administrative tools, such as e-banking for electronic wire transfers, show a less cumbersome
and effective flow. However, the implementation of a Single Treasury Account, as mandated in
the current legislation, remains a challenge.

125. Central Bank of the Dominican Republic. The last IMF Safeguards Assessment of the
Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) was carried out in 2003. The 2003 report
noted that an independent external auditor had been engaged for the first time in 2000 and that
there had been progress toward the implementation of International Accounting Standards.
According to the report, one weakness of the BCRD was the framework for institutional

oversight of the external and internal audit functions at the level of the Board. A detailed Action
Plan was agreed to between the IMF and the Government to address these issues, including the
establishment of an oversight body to supervise the newly redefined internal audit function and
to ensure follow-up of external audit recommendations. The last audited financial statements
(2004-2009) contain unqualified audit opinions on the BCRD's financial statements with a note
of emphasis with respect to accounting policies. The financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting practices for Central Banks and are
supplemented by International Financial Reporting Standards. The notes on financial statements
detail where and how the accounting policies differ from International Financial Reporting
Standards.

VI.5 DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

126. The administration of this loan will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.
The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
loans/credits. The untied balance of payments/budget support will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the development policy program, including compliance with
tranche release conditions and the maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic policy
framework, and not tied to any specific purchases. Furthermore, no procurement requirements
will be needed. Once the loan is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the borrower may
submit a withdrawal application requesting the Bank deposit the proceeds of the loan into a
dedicated account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the World Bank at the Central
Bank of Dominican Republic at the request of the Borrower. The Borrower shall ensure that
upon deposit of the Loan into the account, an equivalent amount shall be credited in the
Borrower's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will
report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited to the
budget management system. If the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as
defined in the Development Policy Loan Agreement, IBRD will require the Borrower to
promptly, upon notice from IBRD, refund an amount equal to the amount of the payment to
IBRD. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The Bank will retain
the option to request an audit of the dedicated account.

        ANNEX 3: UPDATED RESULTS FRAMEWORK FOR THE PASS PROGRAM

Introductory Note: The table below provides a selection of key monitoring indicators, baselines
and targets for the three-loan PASS series, as elaborated and discussed extensively with the
Government. In this Second PASS DPL we have updated and simplified the presentation. The
Bank and the Government agreed on a shorter version of the table of results compared to the
version that was presented in the PD of PASS1 to focus the table on key indicators that are more
definitively attributable to the prior actions which constitute the PASS series. The Government
will continue to monitor indicators used in the presentation in the PD of PASS1 because these
indicators remain important for the Government's broader program beyond reforms specifically
supported by the PASS series. Also, some targets were revised to better reflect the evolution of
the policy actions targeted by the PASS Program, as for example in the Transparency Pillar on
budget transparency (Consulta Amigable web-based tool). The table also provides an update on
the status of data collection.

As presented in the table, the reforms supported by the PASS Program are expected to generate
improvements at four main levels:

   i)      Institutional and policy improvements (changes in institutional rules and behaviors)
           mainly related to: (a) the reform of the governance and operative system of
           Solidaridad to be a full-fledged Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program, including
           improved verification of co-responsibilities and a better articulation with health and
           education actions (Policy Area 1); and (b) the gradual introduction of performance-
           informed budgeting (including a gradual move towards performance agreements in
           social sectors) and a stronger emphasis on results (Internal Management Agreements
           between the Secretariat of Health and Regional Health Services, focused on improved
           results at the first level of care) (Policy Area 3).
   ii)     Improved budget management and execution with a view to progressively reduce
           supply-gaps in health, nutrition, and education services linked to the newly defined
           co-responsibilities of the redesigned CCT Program (Policy Area 2).
   iii)    Improvements in transparency and accountability to users, with respect to the national
           budget and the redesigned CCT Program (Policy Area 4).
   iv)     Improvements in human development outcomes, focusing on the share of CCT
           beneficiaries who actually comply with the newly defined co-responsibilities and
           thereby invest in education, nutrition and health (Overall PASS Program's result).

    I. POLICY AREA 1: ENHANCED PERFORMANCE OF SOCIAL SECTORS TO PROMOTE HUMAN CAPITAL FOR THE POOR
Improvements in governance and operative rules of the CCT program so that: the payments of transfers are effectively made conditional to compliance with co-
responsibilities; and intersectoral coordination functions at national and local levels, with sound articulation of the CCTs with health and education actions.

  II. POLICY AREA 2: IMPROVED BUDGET MANAGEMENT FOR ENHANCED PERFORMANCE OF SOCIAL SECTORS
Better management of budget projections of social sectors, as a direct result of the implementation of the procedure proposed by the Ministry of Finance. Better
management will reduce the differences between the proposed appropriations and their actual execution in order to cover the supply gaps in health, nutrition and
education of the Solidaridad program.

The difference between the allocated budget (Bbs) and the actual budget (Bas) to cover the supply
gaps in health, nutrition, and education services within the Solidaridad program will be less than
or equal to the difference between the approved overall national budget (Bb) and the actual
budget (Ba) in relative terms.

0.85.

Since there are four quotas or disbursements per year, this could also be framed as follows:
The goal for the end of DPL1 in November 2010 is a simple average of the indicators for the
four quotas of 0.50 by the end of DPL2 in November 2011, an average of 0.65 and for the end of
DPL3 in November 2012 an average of 0.85.

        ANNEX 4. DOMINICAN REPUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

1.       This annex presents a public debt sustainability analysis for Dominican Republic using
both a deterministic model and stochastic simulations.38 Public debt is measured as gross debt,
i.e. the bonds owned by agencies within the government are not netted out from the total value of
debt. The baseline public debt to GDP ratio projections are built on the macroeconomic
assumptions that are consistent with the medium term macroeconomic framework envisaged in
the IMF Staff Report dated March 2010.

2.      The public debt to GDP ratio fell from about 47.4 percent in 2004 to 35.5 percent in 2008
in part as a consequence of benign global economic environment. Nevertheless, the public debt
ratio increased to 39 percent in 2009 in the wake of the global financial turmoil. Dominican
Republic's public debt is projected to decline steadily in the medium term under the baseline
scenario which is characterized by: (i) Figure A4.1: Public Debt to GDP Ratio (Baseline Scenario)
sustained growth averaging 6.9 percent of
GDP in the period 2010-2015, (ii) an              50
average primary surplus of 1.5 percentage         45
points of GDP; and (iii) an average annual        40

nominal depreciation of 3.6 percent. The          35

projections also indicate that the speed of       30

fall in the ratio of public debt to GDP is        25

likely to decrease in the medium-term             20

compared to its trend in 2004-2008 (Figure        15

5.     In the case of a combined shock of two standard deviations to primary balance, real GDP
growth and real interest rates in 2010 and 2011, the public debt ratio would increase to about 47
percent by 2011, declining slightly thereafter (see Figure A4.3). This result implies that the
public debt sustainability in Dominican Republic requires continued fiscal discipline and a
favorable macroeconomic environment.

Ref.:   Letter of Development Policy ­ Performance and Accountability of Social Sectors
        Programmatic Loan

Dear Mr. Zoellick

On behalf of the Dominican Republic, we are pleased to inform you of the Dominican
Republic's interest in and commitment to maintaining the priority accorded to public sector
reforms, taking advantage of opportunities to improve quality in the execution of social policies,
in particular those aimed at strengthening the human capital of the poorest, and continuing the
process started in 2006 to implement the most sweeping public finance administration reform in
50 years. We are cognizant of the importance of disbursements related to the above-mentioned
operation, which will be contingent on the execution of performance and accountability of social
sector development policies, in support of the implementation of key aspects of these priorities.

In October 2009, the Dominican Government prepared a countercyclical macroeconomic
program, agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund, aimed at restoring the growth
potential of the Dominican economy, which was negatively impacted by the global economic
crisis.

The positive effects of the program were evident during the first six-month period of 2010, when
real GDP growth was restored, with this growth being estimated at 7.5 percent (year-on-year
basis), while inflation was a mere 5.44 percent, below the Central Bank's target of between 6 and
7 percent. Core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, stood at 3.5 percent (year-on-year
basis). In addition, preliminary social expenditure data reflect the efforts of the Dominican
Government to promote social development in the context of the global economic crisis.

                                               94
In recent years, the Dominican Republic has strengthened its work agenda with specific plans to
take advantage of the opportunities identified to improve the effectiveness and quality of public
services, reduce the vulnerability of persons at the bottom of the social pyramid, and prioritize
and accelerate public sector reforms. To this end, the Government has received assistance from
multilateral organizations while securing adequate fiscal space to protect social programs in the
wake of the international crisis and, at the same time, to accord priority to investment programs
aimed at the continued development of our economy and a reduction in poverty indicators. The
World Bank Group's Strategic Alliance with the Dominican Republic for 2010-2013 provides a
sound framework for collaborative work with the World Bank to achieve these objectives. This
Strategy places special emphasis on protecting the poor while boosting competitiveness and
strengthening national public institutions in the area of accountability, using a managing for
development results approach.

In the process of consolidating the draft National Development Strategy for 2010-2030,
opportunities were identified for improvement during the process in order to achieve the
objectives and goals of the National Development Strategy. They include (i) improving the
quality of State management; (ii) enhancing the quality of education; and (iii) reducing
deficiencies in the provision of health services. The Dominican Government therefore has an
implementation strategy, which includes goals and indicators established and gaps that have been
detected in the process. Closing these gaps is a key component of the objectives to be developed
through the operations set forth in this Letter of Development Policy (LDP).


   I.      The Government's Vision

The Dominican Government is executing the most sweeping institutional reform agenda in 50
years. These processes were amply reflected through a process involving the highest law of the
land, namely, a constitutional amendment, which was recently promulgated and lays the
foundation for true political and administrative management change in the country, which will
have to be synchronized with the long-term vision for the country's development.

The Dominican Republic already has a strong National Development Strategy (NDS) proposal,
which articulates a vision, strategic thrusts, general and specific objectives, and lines of action
that will strengthen work aimed at achieving the development objectives. Furthermore, the
proposal covers and makes provisions for a monitoring and evaluation system with a view to
tracking implementation of the strategy. The proposed NDS, which already includes the
contributions and views of broad swaths of the society, political parties, non-governmental
organizations, and multilateral assistance agencies, is currently in the final consensus phase, and
is expected to be submitted to the National Congress in early 2011. It is important to note that
since the time of submission by the Government of its Letter of Development Policy for the first
programmatic loan, the proposed NDS has been substantially enhanced through a broad-based
consultative process in the country.

In line with the strategic thrusts of the NDS, namely institutional development, social cohesion,
productive development, and environmental sustainability, the Government has moved forward


                                                95
with the design of a medium-term planning instrument to enhance organization, efficiency, and
quality in the expenditure process. This instrument makes clear the priority accorded to public
output of the goods and services that public sector institutions are required to deliver to society.
The Dominican Republic therefore has a National Multi-Year Public Sector Plan for the 2010-
2013 period, which was approved during the second week of September by the Council of
Ministers. The plan is oriented toward fulfillment of the Government's commitment to (i)
enhancing efficiency in public expenditure by strengthening reform of government institutions
and public planning and focusing on expenditure aimed at reducing poverty and boosting
development; (ii) maintaining fiscal sustainability by mitigating, over time, the impact of the
global crisis on public finance and reducing the latter's vulnerability to future shocks; and (iii)
improving the investment climate in order to promote mainly private sector-led growth and job
creation, thus ensuring the stability of the financial sector and strengthening international
competitiveness.

   II.     Macroeconomic Developments

Over the past two decades, the Dominican Republic has been one of the most dynamic
economies in Latin America, with an average growth rate of 5.9 percent during the 1991-2009
period. During the first half of this period, growth was led by activities in the tradable goods
sector, in particular tourism and free zone activity. However, in recent years, those activities
have fallen off, partly as a result of the global economic crisis. At the same time, economic
growth generally took place against a backdrop of relatively stable prices and single-digit
inflation, except during three years of the period analyzed, two of which were during the
financial crisis.

This high growth trend was broken by the 2003-2004 financial crisis, which was triggered by the
bankruptcy of three banks, one of which was the second largest bank in the country. This event
created a period of economic uncertainty and instability, leading to significant capital flight and a
sharp depreciation in the national currency, which exceeded 300 percent during the peak period,
and to higher inflation, which climbed to 42.7 percent in 2003.

The adoption of a robust economic adjustment program backed by the International Monetary
Fund and supported financially by the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank,
which also required restructuring of foreign public debt owed to the Paris Club and London
Club, led to the restoration of macroeconomic stability and the reversal, in the short term, of the
0.3 percent economic contraction posted in 2003. Under this program, significant reforms were
implemented in the areas of government management and financial oversight as well as in the
banking sector, the findings of which were provided in the favorable assessment of these entities,
based on the results of implementation of the Financial Sector Adjustment Program (FSAP).

As a result of three fiscal reform programs conducted between 2004 and 2007 and an austere
spending policy, the country made significant strides in the consolidation of its fiscal accounts.
The consolidated public sector deficit measured as a percentage of GDP fell from approximately
9 percent at end-2003 to 1.7 percent in 2007. Consolidated public sector debt declined from over
55 percent in 2003 to 33.7 percent in 2008, and the Central Bank's quasi-fiscal deficit dropped
from 4 percent in 2004 to 1.3 percent in 2008.


                                                 96
The sharp depreciation in the peso in 2003 reversed the current account balance of payments
deficit. In 2003 and 2004, the country posted a 5.3 percent and 2.8 percent current account
surplus, respectively. As the economic recovery continued, the country returned to its pre-crisis
current account balance of payments deficit. Stabilization of the economy and the performance
of the external sector allowed the Central Bank to increase international reserves, which rose
from US$279 million at end-2003 to US$2,165 million at end-2008.

During the final quarter of 2007, the Dominican economy started to be impacted by price
increases in such commodities as wheat, corn, and soy, and international oil prices, of which the
Dominican Republic is an importing country, in absolute terms. In 2008, the current account
balance of payments deficit stood at 9.8 percent of GDP, largely as a result of oil prices. This
shortfall was met through record levels of foreign direct investment, bilateral disbursements, and
use of international reserves. In 2009, the effects of the international financial crisis were felt in
the external sector as a result of lower growth in the tourism sector and the decline in exports and
foreign remittances. Nonetheless, the current account balance of payments situation improved,
offset by an even greater decline in oil prices. The effects of the external shock led to a downturn
in economic growth in 2009, particularly during the first two quarters of the year. In 2009, the
economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, one of the highest in Latin America. The fall
off in economic activity had a negative impact on fiscal revenue, as reflected in a 1.3 percent
decline in GDP relative to the projections in the Revenue Budget and Public Expenditure Law
[Presupuesto de Ingresos y Ley de Gastos Públicos] for 2009. From a policy standpoint, this led
to a reduction in primary expenditures, largely in investment, while safeguarding priority social
programs. The non-financial public sector deficit stood at 3.1 percent of GDP, and the primary
balance, at 1.2 percent.

   III.    The Government's Macroeconomic Program

Under the structured agreement with the IMF, a countercyclical fiscal policy was drafted and
implemented in the last quarter of 2009. It was continued into the first six-month period of 2010,
with the aim of mitigating the impact of the external shock in the economic and social areas and
eventually facilitating the return of the economy to growth levels consistent with its potential.
The objectives of this part of the program have been met. During the first six-month period of
2010, the economy grew at a rate of 7.5 percent, while unemployment rose slightly in 2009 and
has thus far been trending downward in 2010. In addition, inflationary expectations, included in
the Central Bank's monetary program, remain in the range of the inflation target of 5 percent to 6
percent for this year.

During the second half of the year, the agreement provides for the start of fiscal consolidation,
the main component of which is the reduction of the non-financial public sector deficit, which is
projected to fall to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2010; a 0.8 percent decline relative to 2009. Along
with this result, an improvement in the primary balance is expected ­ from -1.4 percent of GDP
to -0.2 percent at end-2010. Projections are that in 2011, the non-financial public sector deficit
and the primary balance will improve by approximately 0.7 percent and 1.0 percent of GDP,
respectively.




                                                 97
Included in the plan to strengthen public investment in the context of the agreement with the IMF
is a commitment made by the Government to continue to step up the measures adopted with a
view to the recovery of the electricity sector. Recently, the directors of the three power
companies were replaced with foreign professionals with experience in managing enterprises of
this nature. It is hoped that the appointment of these experts will lend impetus to the
administrative streamlining process taking place in the sector through, inter alia, the addition of
new customers, the installation of meters, and effective efforts to combat theft, with the aim of
improving the medium-term prospects for the sector.

Medium-term fiscal policy will focus on maintaining current fiscal sustainability consistent with
a consolidated public debt-to-GDP ratio of roughly 30 percent.

   IV.     IV. Government Program for the Social Sectors: Reforms for the Programmatic
           Loan

The Dominican Republic is now better equipped to protect its poorest citizens from the effects of
the crisis. The Government has been developing and institutionalizing a targeted social
protection system that protects low-income populations, strengthens policy guidelines pertaining
to education, health, and nutrition, and focuses on energy subsidy policies. This model involves
three entities that operate under the Office of Social Policy Coordination [Gabinete de
Coordinación Política Social GCPS]. The Vice President of the Dominican Republic serves as
the Coordinator of the GCPS, which is charged with the following specific and interrelated tasks:

(i)     The Sistema Único de Beneficiarios (Single Beneficiary Selection System, SIUBEN).
Implemented in 2004, SIUBEN is a mechanism that promotes transparent and objective targeting
of social programs through the identification and socioeconomic assessment of potential
beneficiaries. As of September 2010, SIUBEN's database contained information on 1,658,000
households (approximately 64 percent of Dominican households). Of this figure in the database,
46 percent are categorized as moderately and extremely poor households. With financial support
from the World Bank, SIUBEN's management has made a strong commitment to continue its
strengthening plan with a view to conducting another census, commencing in late 2010.

(ii)    The Solidaridad Program. Established in late 2005, this program marked a shift in focus
for social assistance, by explicitly providing the Comer es Primero (Eating Comes First) and
Incentivo a Asistencia Escolar (Incentives for School Attendance ILAE) transfers for human
capital investment for the beneficiaries. It seeks to help break the intergenerational transmission
of the causes that generate and allow poverty to take root, by boosting the investment that poor
households can make in education, health, and nutrition, thereby increasing the human capital
accumulation of their children. The program essentially has two components. First, the Health
component, with four basic lines of action: (a) Prevention: the provision, free of charge, of
services outlined in the Basic Health Care Plan for (i) pregnant women between the ages of 15
and 49 years; (ii) boys and girls between the ages of 0 and 5 years; and (iii) adolescents between
the ages of 10 and 15 years; (b) Support for Adults of Majority Age, providing a monthly cash
transfer of DR$400.00 (US$11.14) and preventive medicine programs; (c) Food Support,
through the Comer es Primero transfer for the provision of staple foods equivalent to DR$700.00
(US$19.50) per month and the distribution of micronutrients; and (d) Health Promotion. The


                                                98
second component is the Education Component. Looking ahead to the 2010-2011 school year,
the Program provides for the redesign of the education component to ensure that, in addition to
the current coverage for six to sixteen-year-olds, five-year-olds receive one year of preschool
education, and to expand access to the first cycle of secondary education, and contribute to the
reduction of the number of overage students, with a monthly per beneficiary transfer of
DR$150.00 (US$4.20).

(iii) The Administradora de Subsidios Sociales (Administrator of Social Subsidies
ADESS). With a view to separating the payment function from the one for beneficiary
identification and selection, this entity was established to manage the payment transfer
mechanism--the Solidaridad card. This debit card, which is valid in the national financial
system platform, is used by establishments belonging to the Red de Abasto Social (RAS)--the
network of establishments affiliated with the Solidaridad program--comprised primarily of
corner grocery stores known as colmados.

However, owing to the turbulent international economic climate, in which the poorest tend to
disinvest in their human capital and, in so doing, reduce their chances of overcoming poverty
using their own resources, the Government anticipated an increase in demand for actions to
protect the well-being of the population. As a result, the prevailing economic context heightens
the need to allocate expenditure on social protection in a more effective and efficient manner.
Therefore, the Government's policy priority with respect to social protection is to protect the
vulnerable populations and improve the role of institutions and transparency in the allocation and
use of resources earmarked for the social sectors. Major developments with regard to the
implementation of the Government Program, which are intrinsically linked to the objectives of
the Programmatic Loan, are as follows: (i) improved results in the social sectors to enhance the
human capital of the poorest; (ii) improved budget management to support the joint performance
of the social sectors under the redesigned Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) program; (iii) the
gradual introduction of Performance Agreements in the social sectors; and (iv) enhanced
transparency in the execution of the national budget, with special emphasis on social programs
such as Solidaridad, and enhanced civil society oversight in the social sectors.

(i)    Improved results in the social sectors to enhance the human capital of the poorest

An important component of this first pillar is the use of public resources to provide a more
equitable distribution of opportunities. The Dominican Republic has been improving and
continues to improve its social networks, with a view to insulating the poor against the effects of
the recent exogenous shocks, including the food and oil crises of mid-2008 and the financial and
economic crisis that is still gripping the world.

With objectives similar to those found in other programs in the region, Solidaridad promotes
investment in health, nutrition, and education (in human capital) for the poorest through a
monthly cash incentive. Achievements in this area have been outstanding and are as follows:
(i) the Government moved away from its traditional clientelist model for social policy execution,
developing and institutionalizing the SIUBEN as a mechanism for targeting eligible citizens; (ii)
the authorities allocated social transfers and subsidies in a more efficient manner; (iii) this new
social assistance system enhanced transparency in the allocation and use of public resources,


                                                99
with the clear identification of the beneficiaries and the amounts earmarked for each transfer or
subsidy for each eligible household; (iv) the Government strengthened its capacity to respond in
a timely manner to natural disasters or economic crises such as the oil and food price spikes; and
(v) this mechanism has resulted in substantial tax savings such as in the case of targeting of the
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidy, as well as expected savings with the elimination of the
geography-based subsidy system (PRA) and implementation of the Bonoluz demand subsidy
program through the Solidaridad card and program.

The foregoing notwithstanding and as indicated in Decree No. 118-09, the Government
redesigned and strengthened the social protection system and the participating entities to enhance
its efficiency, transparency, and coordination. In order to carry out this mandate, the Office for
the Coordination of Social Policy established the Interinstitutional Technical Committee as a
coordination forum for the three entities--Solidaridad, SIUBEN, and ADESS--which facilitated
the development of the manual on cross-cutting processes for the Conditional Cash Transfers
(CCT) Program.

In February 2009, the Government initiated a process to strengthen the Solidaridad Conditional
Cash Transfers Program, with a view to building its capacity to promote human capital and
enhance its efficiency, cognizant of the fact that the co-responsibilities system could not be
implemented owing to shortcomings in the provision of social services or intersectoral
coordination. For this reason, the Office for the Coordination of Social Policy established the
Intersectoral Technical Committee for the Solidaridad program with a view to increasing its
operational coordination with the social sectors (education, health) and with those responsible for
allocating resources (Ministry of Finance), and avoiding duplication of efforts and systems in a
way that facilitates strengthening of the comprehensive and systematic verification process
designed to ensure compliance by the target beneficiary population with the co-responsibilities
required by this program. The institutional coordination and organizational development of the
Solidaridad Program for implementation of the redesigned CCT program is under way to
approve (i) regulations governing the functioning of the CCT Interinstitutional Committee
(which brings together the ADESS, SIUBEN, and Solidaridad programs) and the CCT
Intersectoral Committee (education, health, Solidaridad).

The foregoing helped shift the transfers system to co-responsibilities, improve training to
beneficiaries on the redesigned Solidaridad CCT Program; align health and education services
provided to beneficiaries of the Solidaridad program with sectoral priorities, programs, and
standards, all of which are set forth in the operational manual for the Solidaridad CCT Program.
In this way, with respect to health, the program is aligned with the application of the Basic
Health Plan's promotion and prevention component for the poor, the majority of whom are
enrolled in the health subsidy program. In the case of education, preschool education and the first
cycle of secondary education are included in the redesigned Solidaridad program, both of which
are targets in the plans for the education sector.

Similarly, and with a view to ensuring transparency in the Solidaridad CCT Program, the
Government implemented a plan to expand the network of RAS-affiliated establishments, at
which beneficiaries, through purchases made, use the social transfers. This plan seeks to (i)
promote competition among member businesses; (ii) expand the supply of products available at


                                               100
the establishments; and (iii) reduce transaction time and costs for beneficiaries. The Government
is committed to assessing the impact of this plan and implementing the recommendations
stemming from this assessment.

Other objectives of the restructuring of the Solidaridad CCT Program include (i) the
deconcentration and automation of its operational cycle, and the strengthening of the community
organizational structure, in order to lower costs and better serve beneficiaries; (ii) the
introduction of a monitoring and evaluation system to strengthen management and
accountability, which began with the conduct of the Social Protection Evaluation Survey (EEPS)
in late August 2010. In both cases, the Government is receiving financial support from the World
Bank, through additional financing of the SPIL, and from the Inter-American Development
Bank, through the Support for the Social Protection Program (First Phase) (DR-L1039).

Ensuring alignment and synergies with education and health policies

Education: Among the objectives of the Ten-Year Education Plan for 2008-2018, which are in
line with human capital promotion of the poor, are (i) the mobilization of public and private will
in order to ensure that five-year-olds receive one year of preschool education followed by eight
years of inclusive and quality basic education; (ii) the strengthening, expansion, and
diversification of the secondary education level and form of quality education for adults, with a
view to instilling civic responsibility and paving the way to the job market and/or higher
education; (iii) the establishment of clear quality standards and an evaluation system that makes
it possible to monitor the performance of the education system, promotes the mobilization of
schools, families, and communities for an improved education system and ensures that, for the
benefit of the country, the certificates and degrees awarded are reflective of the training
provided; and (iv) the promotion of equal access to education, with support for students from the
most vulnerable social sectors.

       In this regard, and as a way to ensure that, beginning at age five, the population receives a
       minimum of nine years of preschool and basic education, and to assess the quality of the
       knowledge acquired, the Ministry of Education validated the definition of the student
       assessment criteria for the preschool and first cycle of basic education levels.

The actions, which are in line with the objectives of the redesigned Solidaridad CCT Program to
strengthen interinstitutional capacity and intersectoral collaboration between the Ministry of
Education and the Solidaridad program in order to verify and monitor compliance by
beneficiaries with the program's co-responsibilities and results in the education sector, are
evident in the recent development of a Sistema de Gestión de Centro Escolar (School
Management System SGCE) by the Ministry of Education.

Health: The key objective in this sector is to strengthen the first level of care in order to increase
access by the poor to better quality basic health services. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP)
has been working on a plan aimed at strengthening infrastructure, equipment, human resources,
and other inputs at the primary and secondary health care levels. One aspect of this effort is the
introduction of a new system for monitoring compliance tools and protocols.



                                                 101
(ii) Improved budget management to support the joint performance of the social sectors under
the redesigned Conditional Cash Transfers Program


The reform process for the policies in this first pillar, which was initiated in 2006, is based on
previous measures that served to strengthen public sector institutions involved in planning,
budget, and public financial management. Apart from the aforementioned medium-term planning
instrument, another innovation introduced by the reform is the public sector's multi-year budget,
which stipulates the financial conditions for public spending in general, and the public
investment plan in particular.

In coordinating with the sectoral institutions, and in order to bridge the supply gaps that
prevented the Solidaridad program from fully developing, the Government has identified these
gaps with a view to meeting the additional demand created by the newly designed transfer
system. As a result, the investment needs for the next three years, required for the alignment of
the supply of services with demand, have been estimated jointly with the sectoral institutions.

In order to make the use and allocation of public funds transparent, the same Intersectoral
Technical Committee, of which the Ministry of Finance is a member through the Directorate
General of Budget, established a mechanism, by consensus. Through this mechanism, the
resources allocated in the 2010-2012 budget to cover supply gaps cannot be used for any
purposes other than those established in the three-year estimate and implementation schedule
presented by the Coordinator of the Social Policy Office to the Ministry of Finance for the
gradual closing of the gaps. Likewise, at the operational level, it has been proposed that the
Financial Management Information System (SIGEF) could generate warning reports to facilitate
follow-up and monitoring by the Intersectoral Committee, which will supervise budget execution
on a quarterly basis.

(iii) Gradual introduction of performance agreements between governing bodies and the social
sectors

The efforts made to create favorable conditions for the implementation of performance
agreements and the signing of results-based contracts in public administration in the Dominican
Republic must be highlighted. It is anticipated that this approach and the mechanisms for its
implementation will constitute a flexible managerial link between the budget sources provided
and the desired improvements in the performance of the social sector. This will entail
commitments regarding (i) compliance by senior officials of the relevant agencies and ministries
with policies, goals, and objectives that are verifiable by performance indicators, in accordance
with the Memorandums of Agreement entered into by the governing bodies and the five pilot
institutions; (ii) greater managerial flexibility--for the implementing agency--in the
enforcement of regulations governing execution, human resources, and inputs; and (iii) budget
incentives for agencies and/or cash incentives for officials and employees during the life of the
agreement. To this end, an agreement was signed to draft terms and conditions for results-based
and performance contracts between the public management governing bodies, namely, the
Ministries of Finance; Economy, Planning and Development; and Public Administration; and the
Ministries of Public Education and Public Health.

This three-year programmatic loan focuses on the development of policies to improve the
performance and accountability of the social sectors, and falls under the World Bank's new
strategic alliance with the Dominican Republic to protect the poor while at the same time
strengthening institutions and accountability in the performance of the country's public sector,
and improving transparency in the allocation and use of public funds. This second operation will
support several of this alliance's strategic objectives, namely (i) to strengthen social cohesion,
and improve access to and the quality of social services; (ii) improve the quality of public
expenditure and institutional development; and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity and create
alliances to promote reforms.

In this regard, the Ministry of Public Administration conducted an institutional analysis that
allowed for a preliminary assessment of the level of preparedness and the training required for
the introduction of performance agreements in the health and education sectors. The
aforementioned preliminary report will be reviewed by the governing bodies along with the
respective ministries in order to prepare a final report on the Assessment of Each Condition, to
be signed with the governing bodies. As part of this process, the Ministry of Economy is
currently implementing a technical assistance program with the Ministries of Education and
Health, in order to conduct a pilot exercise for the signing of contracts and, in turn, establish a
technical assistance and assessment agreement for institutional strengthening over the next three
years, with a view to gradually introducing results-based and performance contracts.


Internal Health Management Agreements. In addition, in the case of health, two management
agreements have been concluded between the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) and the regional
health offices in Cibao Central and El Valle, in which the Ministry promotes, as part of its
management role, the deconcentration and decentralization of public health services. The
commitments and objectives are set forth in these agreements, and will serve as a guide for
actions regarding the provision of care to persons in the populations identified as priority
populations, based on the stipulations in the legal framework governing the separation of
functions and the establishment of health services networks.

The Office of Social Policy Coordination and the governing bodies (the Ministries of Economy,
Planning and Development; Finance; and Public Administration) have signed a Memorandum of
Agreement whereby they have committed to (i) initiating a preparatory process for the gradual
introduction of the Results-Based and Performance Contracts system; (ii) conducting an
assessment of basic conditions in order to determine the level of institutional capacity
development within the Social Policy Office, which would be needed in order to undertake
commitments in the context of a results-based management model; (iii) concluding a Technical
Assistance Framework Agreement for Institutional Capacity Development for Results-Based
Management, or a Results-Based and Performance Contract, as the case may be; and (iv)
implementing policy and institutional strengthening actions to improve the performance and
accountability of the Solidaridad Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) Program.

(iv) Enhanced transparency in the execution of the national budget and civil society oversight in
the social sectors

The Government remains committed to enforcing the existing Access to Information Law. In
relation to this Programmatic Loan, the Government is committed to improving access to
information on the national budget. In particular, the Ministry of Finance intends to develop and
implement a systems project called Consulta Amigable, which relies on the adequate and timely
provision of information by SIGEF.

In this regard, during 2010, the Ministry of Finance will approve the plan for the
operationalization of the Consulta Amigable (CA) tool as a public access interface. This plan will
be developed based on the analysis for the functional design of the CA, conducted in the context
of the computerized and functional assessment of SIGEF, and financed by the Integrated
Financial Management Program (PAFI II). Through an Administrative Agreement with the
MEPD (Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Development), it will promote the implementation
of results-based management through a pilot that includes the selection of at least two sectors
that have made progress in identifying performance indicators, and which, with their consent,
will agree to collaborate on the publication of information in the Consulta Amigable module.

In addition, in order to make the actions of the Social Policy Office transparent, the entities
belonging to the Social Protection System have published the list of eligible beneficiaries, as
well as the amounts of the transfers determined by the Solidaridad Conditional Cash Transfers
Program, which may be consulted on the websites of any of these entities. More recently, and to
enhance transparency in the execution of public expenditure, the value of the supply gaps for the
health, nutrition, and education services has been published, which, for the three-year period
(2010-2012), is projected to total US$323.7 million. There has also been a commitment from the
Government that civil society will not only have access to information, but will be able to
participate in the assessment of the programs implemented by the social sectors. In this context,
the Government will be working to strengthen the community participation and social oversight
system of the Conditional Cash Transfers Program.

A commitment has therefore been made by the Intersectoral CCT Committee to collectively
approve the community participation and social oversight system for the redesigned CCT,
including the use of community bulletins to monitor the availability of health and education
inputs and the management of CCT services, associated with the fulfillment of co-
responsibilities by beneficiary families. In the context of this second phase of the Program, a
pilot will be launched for community bulletins with a view to having a full roll out nationwide,
based on the results of this pilot.

In light of these actions in the Government's program, this second three-year programmatic loan
from the World Bank, valued at one hundred and fifty million United States dollars (US$150
million), for Performance and Accountability of the Social Sectors is of special importance, and
falls under the country's new joint strategy with this financial institution.
