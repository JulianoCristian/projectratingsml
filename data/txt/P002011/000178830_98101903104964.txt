INTERNATIOGNL BANK FCR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPENT
REPORT AND RECO'M4INATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
NIGERIAN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPUENT BANK
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $6.0 million to thle
Nigerian Industrial Development Bank (NIDB).
PART I - HISTCRICAL
2.        On the recommendation of the Bank and with the assistance of
IFC, NIDB was established in 1964 by the reconstruction of the Investment
Company of Nigeria (ICON).
3.        NIDB's issued and fully paid up share capital consists of
2,250,000 shares of N£1 par value, comprising 1,020,000 Class A ordinary
shares, restricted to Nigerians or international organizations of which
Nigeria is a member, 980,000 Class B ordinary shares and 250,000 non-
voting 5-0 cumuaative participating preference shares.    IFC holds
499,827 Class A shares, an investment of $1.1 million, and is represented
on the B-;ard.  The Class B shares are held by some 80 shareholders
comprising the original shareholders of ICON and 8 other foreign
institutional subscribers who came in at the time of reorganizaticn and
hold about half the B shares.
4.        Negotiations for a $6.0 million Bank loan were originally
conducted in early 1966 but as a result of uncertainties created by
the troubled situation in Nigeria, were brought to a conclusion only
in November 1968 following a review of conditions in Nigeria by an IFC
mission and a Bank mission. NIDB was represented in the final negotia-
tions by Mr. Daniyan, General Manager, and ,lr. Doshi, Assistant General
Manager.   Mx. Ehiezuelan, Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of
Finance, represented the Government of Nigeria.
5.        The proposed loan would be the Bank's first to NIDB and
eighth to Nigeria; two IDA credits have also been extended to Nigeria
6.        The following is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits to Nigeria as of December 31, 1968:

7.        In addition to its `l.)4 million shareholding in NIDB, IFC has
an investment in Arewa Textiles, Ltd., of $1,321,500, of which approxi-
mately $581,000 is still held by the Corporation, all except $74,000 in
the form of equity.
3.        Power was supplied to Lagos from Kainji Dam on December 22,
1968 and withdrawal of the balance of Loan 383 UNI is expected to be
completed by the closing date, March 31, 1969.   Withdrawals under Credit
73 UNI for education so far represent only consultants and architects'
fees.   Design work was considerably delayed by jurisdictional problems
relating to the reorganization of the country into twelve States.    Some
contracts for construction are now being awarded; consequently an
accelerated rate of withdrawal can be expected.    The $2.3 million
allocated to school construction in Eastern Nigeria, the area of the
prcscnt hostilities, has blln frozen by action of the Federal Govern-
mcnt.

PART III - THE PROJECT
9.        A report on the project entitled "Nigeria - Appraisal of the
Nigerian Industrial Development Bank" (DB-h2a) is attached.
10.       In its initial two years of operation, NIDB's business grew
rapidly,reflecting the generally favorable investment climate in Nigeria
at that time. After the onset of the political disturbances in January
1966, NIDB's management, which became Nigerian in April 1966, was
beset with difficulties including decline in business, deterioration of
portfolio and loss of staff from the East.    However, total net approvals



- 4 -
of loans and investments, which were almost NEM million in 1965 and less
than NZ0.3 million in 1966, exceeded N£1 million in 1967 notwithstanding
the civil war.   In 1968 they were approximately N£0.7 million.
11.       Assuming that hostilities will be contained in a small area,
or cease in 1969, NIDB expects to commit N£2.6 million (07.2 million)
in 1969-70 of which about N£2.0 million ($5.6 million) would be for
import financing.    Included in this total are projects totalling N£1.5
million ($h.2 million) under consideration at Deceinber 31, 1968.
12.       About one-third of NIDB's portfolio consists of equity invest-
ments, one of the highest ratios of any Development Finance Company
(DFC) with which the Bank Group is associated;    however, this does
result in a higher level of risk and lower income and profits in the
short run.
13.       In 1965, MIDB's net profit represented 5.4% of year-end
capital.   In 1966 this increased to 5.8,s.   A single large write-off
in 1967 changed a return of 6.8% for that year into a loss of 2.2% on
share capital.   Profits for 1968 are expected to show an improvement
over those for 1967.
14.       Dividends have been maintained on the 51p4f preferred shares
but none have been paid on ordinary shares.    Projections indicate a
steady increase in profits through 1970 when they are expected to reach
8.8% of share capital which might permit a modest dividend on ordinary
shares.
15.       Some 23/ of NIDB!s investments are in the East in areas
recently or currently affected by the war.    Some of these are in parts
of the East now under Federal control.    So far it has not been possible
to visit many of these projects to assess possible damage or losses.
A few other projects ffected by the general economic slow-down and loss
of markets in the East are in arrears.    It is conservatively estimated
that any possible loss in the Eastern area would be more than covered
by NIDB's reserves and would not impair share capital.
16.       At June 30, 1968 NTDB had total resources of N£5.56 million
($15.57 million) consisting of paid-in capital of N£2.25 million ($6.3
million), Government loans N£3.0 million ($8.4 million) and N£0.311
million ($0.87 million) reserves and retained earnings. In addition,
the second N£1 million ($2.8 million) tranche of the second Government
loan is scheduled to be made available to NIDB in May 1969.
17.       The continued growth of NIDB during the next few years will
depend largely on its ability to make commitments in foreign exchange.
Since all its resources are in Nigerian currency, NIDB is seeking a
Bank loan of about $6.0 million to provide it with the foreign exchange
likely to be required to complement its local currency resources in
its operations through the end of 1970.
18.       In order to deal effectively with the expected increase in
business, NIDB is taking steps to strenghen its organization. It has



recently engaged an experienced banker who will serve for the next two
years as adviser to management.   Additional recruiting is also underway.
The Bank Group is ready to help strengthen the organization through staff
training.
19.       NIDB can be considered a suitable borrower for a Bank loan of
$6.0 million and capable of servicing it and its other borrowings. How--
ever, in view of the uncertainties and problems still facing NIDB and
the need for a specially experienced and effective management to cope
with them, it would be prudent to permit only half of the proposed loan
to be credited to the Loan Account by the end of 1969.    The commitment
of the remainder would be subject to a review of NIDB's operations towards
the end of the year.
20.       Because NIDB's growth is being affected by conditions beyond
its control and its volume of business has not yet reached the level which
might have been expected, I believe that the commitment charge on the
proposed loan should be applied only to amounts actually credited to
the Loan Account from time to time.     I also consider that individual
projects requiring the use of more than $100,000 of loan funds should
be subject to prior approval by the Bank.    It is likely that over 80%
of the proposed loan would thus be subject to the Bank's review and
approval.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUPTENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the NIDB, and
the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
22.       Except for the limits in the draft Loan Agreement referred to
in paragraph (19) above, on crediting amounts to the Loan Account (Section
2.03) the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements follow substantially the
pattern of other agreements for loans to Development Finance Companies.
PART V - THE ECONOT4Y
23.       An economic memorandum on the civil disturbances in Nigeria
(AF-8ha) was circulated to the Executive Directors on October 23, 1968.
It concluded that the disturbances which erupted in January 1966 and
resulted in the current civil war have affected Nigeria's economy less
seriously than might have been expected.    An economic mission that
visited the country during November/December 1968, and is now preparirg
its report, has confirmed this conclusion.    In the major part of the
country outside the war zone, production continued uninterrupted and



- 6 -
actually scored gains in several instances.   Agriculture has supplied
the country (outside tBiafratt) with almost all its food requirements
and has continued to be the principal source of exports, while manu-
facturing has expanded to replace some imports now subject to controls.
Off-shore petroleum production in the Mid-!.rest, although small, has
continued undisturbed. The larger scale petroleum operations in the
Fast were interrupted, but are now being resumed in the areas which are
back under Federal control.   A rapid increase in output and exports
is technically7 feasible and, so long as the oilfields remain secure,
virtually certain to materialize.   The transport sector successfully
overcame major disruptions caused by the sudden departure of perhaps one-
and-a-half million Ibos to the East, and, later, by the attempted secession
of the East involving the diversion of a major part of Nigeria's exports
previously shipped out of Port Harcourt to the port of lagos.   Domestic
and external finances have been managed well in the circumstances, and
Federal deficit financing has not yet resulted in inflationary consequences.
Government savings, which were sizeable before the outbreak of hostilities,
disappeared and productive investment in both the public and private sectors
declined.   However, with the resumption of oil production, Government
revenues are expected to increase during and after 1969.
24.       Net foreign exchange reserves at June 30, 1968 were N£33 million
($92 million) equivalent to about two months' imports.   Service on
Federal public external debt outstanding on June 30, 1968 will peak at
just under US,55 million per annum in 1970, falling to US$40 million in
1973.   US$55 million corresponds to 5.8% of Nigeria's total export earn-
ings in 1966, the last year during which exports were practically un-
affected by the civil disturbances; export earnings in 1970 may be
expected to be at least as high. Nigeria has maintained service on the
external debt and the Government has assured Bank officials that, despite
current difficulties, it has not resorted to borrowing abroad for defense
purposes.   However, since early 1968 a backlog of payments for commercial
imports has developed. The government seems determined to keep this back-
log within reasonable limits and suppliers have not yet shown misgivings.
25.       Once the civil war is over, Nigeria will be faced with major
problems: political reconciliation within the country and especially
with the East, human rehabilitation and reconstruction of productive
facilities in the war affected areas, and considerable reconstruction and
repair of infrastructure throughout the country (due partly as far as
roads are concerned to catastrophic rains in mid-1968), all of which
imply a need for additional resources for some time to come. Crucial
factors will be the duration of the civil war and the solution, by a
Constitutional Review Assembly to be convened later, of the political
and administrative problems associated with the reorganization of the
country into 12 States decreed in 1967.    Associated issues are a
possible review of present State boundaries, as well as the precise
delineation of economic responsibilities and the allocation of fiscal
revenues between the Center and the States.   However, as soon as it is
widely believed, inside and outside the country, that a political settle-
ment is in sight, the Nigerian economy could quickly resume expai;sion
without waiting for full reconstruction of physical facilities. Nigeria's



- 7 -
basic growth potential still seems great, especially in view of the
prospects for petroleum, and it is considered creditworthy for the
proposed loan.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOTAENDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
RESOLUTION NO.
App-oval of Loan to Nigerian Industrial Development
Bank Ltd. in an amount equivalent to U.S. $6,000,000
to be guaranteed by the Federal Republic of Nigeria
RESOLVED:
THAT the Bank shall grant a loan to the Nigerian
Industrial Development Bank Limited, to be guaranteed
by the Federal Republic of Nigeria, in an amount in
various currencies equivalent to six million United
States dollars (US$6,000,000), to mature on and prior to
the date or dates to be determined as set forth in the
fonr of Loan Agreement (Nigerian Industrial Development
Bank Project) between the Bank and the Nigerian Industrial
Development Bank Limited which has been presented to this
meeting, to bear interest at the rate of six and one-half
per cent (6½V§) per annum, and to be upon such other terms
and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth therein and in
the form of Guarantee Agreement (Nigerian Industrial
Development Bank Project) between the Federal Republic of
