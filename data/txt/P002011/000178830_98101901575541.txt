APPRAISAL OF THE NIGERIAN INDUSTRIAL DEELOPENT BANI( LI     }ED
SU!UHvJAP,
The Bank Group took the key role in the reconstruction o-f the
Investment Corporation of Nigeria into the Nigerian Industrial Development

Nigeria, MIDB has revived its request for its first Bank loan to meet its

Nea ,i thUe onset of political iffic"ulLies early Ln 1966, NILBL s
portfolio deteriorated and staff from the East was lost.  Despite its

uJ.1±u±,1-ties  NIDB nas survivea with it capital unimpaired Zlu WiLth a
wealth of experience which adversity forced on it; and since 1967, it has
begun to recover its earlier momentum. The company is beginning to make
a significant contribution not only to investment but also to standards of
project preparation and is seeking a more effective role as a stimulator
of Nigerian enterprise and investment. NIDB has also managed to deal
effectively with the pressures from Government and from the Dusiness
community.
iii.      I'IDB's financial resources on June 30, 1968, totalled .N 5.56
million ($lS.6 million), consisting of 1N 2.25 million of share capital,
bN 0.31 million of reserves and unappropriated earnings, and ;N 3 million
of Government loans, 6N 2 million of which wJas interest free- and subordilated.
NIDB's industrial portfolio, on the same date, amounted to WN 2.65 million,
consisting of iN 0.87 million in equity investments and bN 178 million
in loans and debentures in 34 companies.  As of September 30, 1968, NIDB
had about IN 0.36 million ($1.0 million) of resources readily available
for commitment, all in local currency.
iv.       The combination of relative inexperience and the present
political and economic difficulties of Nigeria has affected NIDB's financial
position. Roughly 23% of the portfolio represents investments in the East.
and its concition is at best uncertain. These and other potential losses :
should, even at worst, leave NIDB's capital at its original value. Profit-
ability has been rising, but low, except in 1967 when a single large write-
off changed a retiirn of 6.8io into a loss of 2.2%9 on share canital* NTfilA
stockdealingr subsidiary, ICONSEC, which contributes a substantial part
of NIDB's income by way of management fees and interest on advances also
suffered losses in 1967. NIDB's profitability has been kept low, by substantial
equity activity, designed to promote Nigerian ownership and bv large
administrative costs.
v.        NITDB can look towrards a rising level of business in the next
several years.  Sunnorting this nrosoect are indications that hostilities
are likely to be contained in a small area in Eastern Nigeria or possiblyr
come to an end in 1969.. allowing for the start-.in of sipnifi;mnt post-war
reconstruction work. Furthermore,the continued interest of private enter-



- ii -
pr_se in investine in the countrv. Dartlv spurred by the oil companies'
investments, points to good prospects for industrial development in the
near future.. NIDB's chances for qrodnq operations will depend to a
significant extent on its ability to make commitments in foreign exchange,
which iq nowv in short 5rnnvly and likelv to rwmqi.n sn for som.e time..
NIDB now expects to commit a total of WN 2.6 million in the period
1969-70, incldiAng nearlyr LH 9 mnll4nin 4i foreign exchange.  If th s
growth takes place and is sustained in subsequent years, NIDB's financial
outlook ijll be Pmch brighter; a m.odest diviAden-  sheul be possible on
1970 profits.

balnr-er as a gereral advilser for a-L peri.0d o.f tL y'jear  l- l L beaon
the job in Miarch. Recruitment to replace lost staff is unc&:> - way.
vii.      On the basis of its operational prospects and with the forth-
coming str:engthening of E4wb ls management, iI]B would be a suitable and
creditw,orth,y borrow-er for an IBRD loan of U-:,6 million, which .would
cover the demand for loans for imported goods and services for about two
years.  Ho;ever, in vie- of the uncertainties and problems still facing
;.DB, it :.:ould be prudent to allow. only half the proposed loan to be
committed in the first year and until the Bank makes a new review of
1IDB's operations.
Viii.     In loan negotiations, the terms agreedc were generally those
applied to loans to development finance companies,except for the following:
(E}) Unless the Bank agrees otherwise after another review of
NIDB's operations, no credit shall be made in excess of
US`3 million or after December 31, 1969.
(b) The proposed loan could be suspended if the second half
of the Government's LN 2 million loan of September 3, 1966,
has not been disbursed by June 30, 1969.
(c) The commitment charge is limited to amounts actually
credited to the loan Account because NIDB's growth has
been substantially affected by conditions beyond its
control and the size of its business has thus not reached
an adequate level.
ix.       The limit above which prior Bank approval of individual projects
wqould be required has been set at $100,000. As a result about a half of
NIDB's projects and over 80% of the proposed loan amount would need the
Bank's review and approval.



APPRAISAL OF
THE NIGERIAN INDUSTRIUL DEVELOPIET BANK LIIIaTED
1.        The Nigerian Industrial Development Bank Limited (NIDB) is seeking
an IBRD loan. The loan, if granted, would be the first IERD loan to NIDB.
IFC took the lead in promoting the establishment of NIDB in January 1964, as
a result of the reconstruction of the Investment Company of Nigeria (ICON),
and has subscribed nearly IN 0.5 million (US,1.14 million) or one-fourth of
NIDBts ordinary share capital.   The background is given in IFC/R63-21 of
August 29, 1963.
2.        A 15$6 million loan was negotiated early in 1966, but it was not
put to the Executive Directors because of the troubled political situation.
3.        In May 1968, a mission reviewed the general situation in Nigeria
and, based on its recommendations, the IBRD decided to reconsider lending
to NIDB.  The followine renort is based on the findines of a mission which
visited NIDB in April/May 1968 and on subsequent information derived from
close and continuing contact with the comnany=

sector (exclusive- ouAf mig) grew by 8o per aInUM. Data for 1966 anl 196O
are scanty, but preliminary indications are that, mainly due to the ihosti-
lities in Nigeria, the overalL rate Of growth In GuD  (at 1962 prices) fell
from an average of about 5% in 1962-65 to about 3% in 1966.   1967 mEay have
been even less.
5.        Recent data on gross fixed capital formation are also approximate.
Overall capital formation in 1966 amounted to iN 208 million (at 1957
prices) and plant, machinery and equipment took up 29% of this amount. The
private sector was responsible for 63% of total gross fixed capital formation.
On available indications, private Nigerian capital apparently financed not
more than 10' of total industrial investment.   The 0ovoeiinint has helped spur
industrial investment.   Its initiative often took the fo'm of direct parti-
cipation since private Nigerian investment was small, or of favorable policies



- 2 -
such as tariff and tax concessions, protective measures, the sponsorship
of industrial estates, the provision of electricity and water, and a very
liberal foreign exchange regime.
6.        The situation changed drasticaluy in 1y66 and 1967 with the events
leading to the secession of the former Eastern Region and its declaration
of independence as the Republic of Biafra.   The subsequent civil war furtiler
worsened the economic situation and, hastened by falling oil exports in the
second half of 1967, Nigeria's foreign exchange reserves dwindled rapidly,
from iN 84.4 million in December 1966 to LN 33 million (net) by the end of
June 1968. As a result of the Federal Government's war effort, additiona:L
taxation wvas introduced in 1967 and in the budget for 1968-69. Imports of
various consiuamer goods have been drastically curtailed, and foreign exchange
transfers for the purchase of foreign capital goods and raw materials,
though not needing licenses, have been difficult or time-consuming in
practice.  In the uncertain circumstances in the country, many business
enterprises operating in Nigeria have been marking time and investments hauve
been mainly :Limited to replacements and repairs.
7.        Considering its recent set-backs and the almost total stoppage of
oil exports for some time, Nigeria's economy has so far suffered relatively
little from supply shortages. In the FederalLy controlled areas, food
supplies are amp]ly available; except for palm products from the East, exports
of agriculture products continue, though sometimes hampered by inland trans-
port difficulties. Despite lesser availabilities of imported common consumer
goods and reliance of the Federal Government on deficit financing, prices
have risen only slowly.  The banking system and many foreign trading companies
are liquid because during the past two years, they have been doing less
business. Quite a few companies, among them the large foreign trading firms,
have been able to offset sales losses in the East by increased sales efforts
elsewhere in Nigeria. Production of consumer goods, formerly imported and

8.        Since NIDB's establishment in 1964, its relations with Government
and business c-ircles in Nigeria have been delicat.   Tli s factor bears on

10.       NI B is particularly sensitive to criticism voiced by the author-
ities that it should have done more to help new Nigerian entrepreneurs, andl
to support projects in areas which the Government wished to develop.   The



-3-
NigueriLan Dutuineu cormmun±i.y-, ai* T-IimeS naba joined J11 ii UUs  itL-1..bments.
NIDB has tried to meet this criticism by helping Nigerian entrepreneurs
to put together their proJects arid by being patiernt, without being lax,
with clients wrho take time to fulfill disbursement conditions.  Also, NIIB
ads de'l berately tried to buy equity investments in Ioreign-coubvrou1ed
enterprises, or at least tried to obtain conversion rights on its loans to
them, in order to introduce  or to increase Nigerian participation.  Its
goal is eventual resale of such securities to Nigerian investors. Moreover,
NIDB has formulated a scheme to aid small Nigerian businessmen, under wnich
NIDB would administer funds provided by the Government and other sources for
lending on concessional terms to small-scale entrepreneurs. This scheme
was presented to the Government in September 1967 and it is still under
consideration.  NIDB needs to, and will, continue its efforts to create an
appropriate image for itself in the Nigerian business community.
11.       NIDB tries to work together with other financial institutions.  It
has financed, eight projects together with other institutions which provide
for industry in Nigeria, including three with institutions sponsored by the
Commonwjealth Development Corporation (CDC). These and other Nigerian insti-
tutions have had reasonably harmonious, though not necessarily close,
relations with NIDB.
12.       Except for one industrial investment institution in the North
(Northern Nigerian Investments Limited, which is half owned by CDC), there
is considerable uncertainty about the future of the regional Nigerian
investment institutions. This uncertainty stems not only from the effects
of the continuing hostilities in the East, but also from the new political
divisions created out of the former four "regions". The successor state
governments are still considering whether the regional institutions should
be split to conform to the new political structure. Some progress has
recently been made in modifying the Northern Nigerian Development Corporation
to serve the needs of the six Northern states. In Nigeria as a whole. the
set-up of the eAisting financing institutions will probably take some time
to be resolved.
13.       Several foreign financial institutions. some of them onerating in
Nigeria, are among NIDB's shareholders and some of them are represented on
NIDB's Board- NTID  lonks to these institiitionns for arhHene in mTatters

Organization and Procedures
16.       In the past three years two significant events have affected
NThz Bs organizatilon; one was tne advent Of Nigerian -anagi±iitillu twu yeacrs aguo
on the departure of Mr. Raj; the other was the civil war in Nigeria, which
affected NMB's business and upset its organization and staff.
i7.       Board mO Directors.  The Board comprises i2 Directors equally
representing the Class A (Nigerian, including IFC) and Class B (foreign)
shareholders.  The Chairman, Mallam Anmadu Coomassie, until recently an
Executive Director of the Nigerian Tobacco Company, Limited, has been
Chairman since February 1966. The Central Bank, wnich holds a quarter of
the shares, is represented by its General Manager. The Government is repre-
sented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry. At the
present time, senior officials of Barclay's Bank, CDC, Royal Exchange Assu-
rance Co., Commerzbank, Bank of America and Chase International represent
the foreign shareholders. An Executive Committee of four Directors resident
in Lagos has the power to approve NIDB investment up to EN 100,000. (Further
details on NIDB's shareholders and Board are given in Annexes A-2 and A-3.)
18.       Management. Mr. Silas B. Daniyan, who succeeded Mr. Raj as
General Manager in April 1966, has been with NIDB since August 1964 and has
gained considerable experience in managing NIDB. In the absence of sufficient
well-qualified staff, Mr. Daniyan is heavily involved personally in all
aspects of NIDB's operations. His involvement was aggravated by,the delparture
first of MEr. Mathew in June 1967, who was Mr. Daniyan's Advisor for a year,
and then of 1Mr. 0. Akinrele in June 1968, the Deputy General Manager. To
help relieve the General Manager in this very difficult situation, the
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India seconded one of its
senior staff members, Mr. P. K. Doshi, to NIDB. Since April 1968 he has had
the rank of NIDB's Assistant General Manager (Administration) but in fract
plays a more important role as the General Manager's only experienced Esupport.

done better than some other functions. This is especially true of the
technical and financiai aspects oI appraisai; as in many young developmentu
finance companies market analysis,to which clients in most instances con-
tribute practically notning , is relatively weak. Follow-up is unsystematic
and reporting requirements have yet to be agreed upon with many of NIDP''s
clients. Only very recently were staff assigned to improve N'1VB' S follow-up
work, but the cure for shortcomings will still need more effort.
Operations
21.       Policies.  NIDB's operational policies are set out in its policy
statement shown in Annex A-5. It includes the usual provisions regarding
diversification of portfolio, maximum assistance to any single enterprise,
scope of activities and qualifications for finance. Special features to
accommodate! the Nigerian situaation are that enterprises with up to 40%
government ownership are within NIDB's definition of private ownership and
eligible for finance. Furthermore, although NIDB's equity investment is
limited to 25% of the share capital of any client enterprise, such partici-
pation may in special cases important to Nigeria's development go up to
49%. These provisions are designed to encourage Nigerian ownership and to
introduce a private Nigerian element in foreign or government-controlledL
enterprises. NIDB's operations have generally been within the confines of
its policy statement.
22.       Volume of Operations. NIDB took over from ICON a portfolio of
8 loans and debentures and 7 equity investments in 10 companies, totalling
EN 632,000.  In its first two years, 1964 and 1965, NIDB approved (net of
cancellations and withdrawals) EN 772,000 and LN 965,ooo of investments
(both loans and equity), respectively. The pace dropped considerably. to
;N 264,000o, in 1966 when the military coups slowed down all activity. I:n
1967, desVite the civil war, NIDB slightly exceeded the 1965 mark with
;N 1,016,0()0 in approvals. Gross approvals in 1968, to November 5, the
date of NIDB's last 1968 Board Meeting, amounted to iN 722.000.   The cutwmla-
tive total of net approvals at that date was EN 4,399,000 in 50 projects.



This is net of substantial cancellations in 1966, 1967 and the early part
of 1968. Tne prflnc14Jd1fl obeworbfly Bc be0  ] (c 0± V4±JJD  o perdatin
follow. (Additional details are given in Annex A-6).
23.       EuLuit Investments. As of November 5, 1968, about one-quarter of
NIDB approva.Ls kner, or cancellations) represent equity purchases totall-ing
EN 767,000, of which EN 646,000 has been paid-in. The ratio of NIDB's
equity investments to Its total portfolio is one of the highest among
development finance companies with which the Bank Group is associated.  Thae
motives for this exposure in equity, stated in paragraph 10 are evident; but
a consequence is an unusual level of risk and, in the short-run, reduced
income and profit.
24.       Debentures.  NIM 's portfolio of debentures derives primarily from
purchases of fresh capital issues in which IC0tJSE  was involved as an und,er-
writer. These and other debenture purchases accounted on June 30, 1960, for
39% of NIDB's industrial portfolio. Where these purchases did not involve an
IIIDB equity investment, they usually did not receiVe NIDB's normal full ap-
praisal.  The interest rates on these debentures are in line with t'hose
charged on NIDBIs loans, 8-8 1/2% per annum.
25.       Inport Financing. Roughly 70% of NIDB's term loan disbursements
have been to finance imports. Until mid-1967, NIDB funds, disbursed entirely
in local currency, could be used freely for imports. Since then such free
use has no longer been possible in view of Nigeria's balance of payments
difficulties; clients have had to wait their turn, sometimes with considerable
delay, to effect transfers abroad for machinery imports for which they had
obtained NIDB financing.
26.       Geographical and Industrial Pattern. NIDB's investment decisions
reflect the industrial pattern and development in Nigeria. Since the begin-
ning of NIDB's operations, 76% of the amount of approvals have related to
the financing of new factories, the balance being for expansion. Most of
the factory establishments are centered around Lagos and minor concentrations
of enterprises can be found in the East around Port Harcourt. Investments
in the Lagos area account for 46% of NIDB's portfolio as of June 30, 1968,
while investments in the East. where the recent war action has mostly been
concentrated, account for 23% of the portfolio. As in NIDEB's earlier years,
the textile industrv is still in the lead with 32% of the portfolio, followed
by food and 'beverages, metal products, rubber products, wood and paper
products, building materials, chemicals and electrical goods.
27.       Overruns.  At least eieht NIDB-assisted Droiects have experienced
significant cost overruns, with the highest being i50%.  Of these eight,
NTIDB has helped in five cases (for a total of MN 205.000  of which EN 95,000
disbursed) to finance the overruns.  About 75% of NIDB clients have experienced

delays principally due to difficulties in obtaining property title deeds,
slow construction, or problems in. receiving imported machineryon time.    these
cost and time overruns are largely the result of the present political arnd
eConoaraic uncer-+kinty in 114ige ra .ando  UA46  ---4.Lngex pl erience of- YMB's

28.       Reconstructions.   During the past three years, considerable time
aru.d ef.LLU'r VIo PLJ s SuniLur offfcers L'±ve also been d-vot.ed toU L. const.Vt
companies in difficulty. These efforts at reconstruction have helped deepen
sheL exper-ience of r,<liagelmen'u andu stUaff.'
2y.       ICONSEC. ICON Securities Limited (ICONSEC    iS a wholly-owned ub'-
sidiary, which NBDB inherited from ICON.   ICON had set up ICONSEC in June
1962 to handle its underwriting, stock-broKing and stock-jobbing activities.
ICON was one of the founders of the Lagos Stock Exchange which was buoyant,
mainly with new issues, until mid-1966.   The market for industrial securities
has been extremely sluggish since then, and the four members of the Exchange,
including IUONiSEU, have been strongly afrected. At present it is difficult
to forecast when the market will recover.
30.       Fbr all practical purposes, ICONSEC has functioned as a department
of NIDB, with a Director-in-charge and one staff member. Until he left, in
mid-1968, NIDB's Deputy General Manager, ran the company; since then
Mr. Daniyan has been directly responsible.   The change has so far been of no
significance because IC0-NSEC has had little work to do, thanks to stock market
dold.ums. HoIioever, ICONSEC till need more experienced, and full-time attention
if it is to cope effectively 'with the substantial volume of business which
should be expected urhen conditions improve in Nigeria. However, ICONSEC's role
needs reas;essment:   Should it be spun off. a department of NIDBn or a
subsidiary as at present? 'There are pros and cons for each of the alternative
31.       ICONSEC has been active in arranging new issues and underwriting
since 1962 and has, so far, arranged 6N 7,W5,000 worth of new issues on
the Lagos Stock Ecchange and underwritten 31% or EN 2,640,000 of this amount
(not including IN 400,000 directly taken up by NIDB). ICONSEC itself took
up RI l33,500 or 5.5% of its underwriting commitment. The last issue under-
written was in April 1966 and since then no new industrial issues have been
placed on the Lagos capital market. ICONSEC's stock-broking and stock-jobbinf
activities were drastically reduced during 1966 and 1967. In 1968, ICONSEC
acted as the Government broker (a rotating assignment shared on a yearly
basis with the other three members of the Lagos Stock Exchange). Trading in
Government securities was high, even during most of the political uncertain-
ties but has levelled off substantially in recent months.
32.       Contribution to the Economy. Though there are difficulties in mea-
suring TIDB's impact on the economy, its contribution has been notable. NIDB
has narticinated in the develoDmnent of industries new to Nigeria. and
especially those developed in the sixties (see paragraphs 4 and 26). It has
been estirmated that. NTnDE-assisted proT .ta hnve invon1vAri total 4nvettm.nta of

Industrial ventures, about 11.5 iLmes its own and AIDT's direct financiai con-

twelve new industrial issues sold through the Stock Exchange. NILBBs intan-

Nigerian entrepreneurs to shape their projects into bankable propositions.

34.       Short-term investments as of June 30, 1968, amounted to 1N 1.9
million and account for nearly 35% of NIDB's assets.    (This proportion was
maintained in the following quarter.) The majority of the short-term
investments are in Government bonds, bank acceptances and deposits, whose
average yield is 5.5% or better; this is the bestobtainable in the institu-
tional money market in Nigeria. Only about 7% of the short-term investments
yield less than 4.5%, the rest yielding from 5.5% to 8.5%.
35.       Reflecting the general slow-down of business, NIDB's industrial
portfolio grew only moderately, i.e. by 13, in 1966 and 295P in 1967
versus 32%-' and 117S in 1964 and 1965, respectively.  Equity investments

in client companies. NIDB's long-term debt/equity ratio amounted on June :30,
1968; to l.2 and its currrent. ratio s+.nod at 79.  The balance sheet as of
June 30, 1968, shows no important changes from the end-1967 figures and

37.       As noted already, NIDB has a high percentage (33%) of equity in
its total portfolio. A majority of the equity holdings are not yet in
seasoned or producing companies and, therefore, have a depressing effect on
income.  However, equity income in 1967 is substantially larger than it was
in 1965 and 1966, reflecting the growing profitability of NIDB3s equity

38.       Portfolio.  NIDB's industrial portfolio of LN 2,648,000 as of
June 30, 179, is affected by the uncertainty relating its investments in
the East. They accounted for 23% (or ;N 660,800) of NIDB's total portfolio.
Although some borrowers have reported damage to buildings, only an on-the--
sDot insDection bv NIDB's staff (which has not vet been possible) would
indicate whether any write-downs would be needed.
39.       In other parts of the country, there were at the same date seven
borrowers; mainly small-scale cnnsumer-gnoois manufacturers. with varving
degrees of trouble arising principally from loss of markets in the East and
poor management. These repnresnteR ahont 2Cf of NTDB's total portfolio.
NIDB's position, however, does not at present seem in serious danger.   In
addition , thereisaproblem with one short-ter.m advance of _1! 1     ,
which is, however, guaranteed by the National Bank of Nigeria.

that amount. A small but real hard core of trouble cases might, bn a
conservative though crude estimate, result in portfolio losses of so)_-
what less than ;N 200,000 including 1' 75,000:in respect of projects in
the East. If losses of this order were to occur, the reserves as of
June 30, 1968, would provide 8ufficient cover and leave NIDB's share capital
unimpaired.
42.       NIDB3's lReserves and Share Values. At the end of 1967, after the
write-off of the Nigerian Lead-Zinc investment and a consequent reserve
reduction by TN 157,300, NlDB's reserves stood at 1N 209,074 or 8.7% of
NIDB's portfoliLo. The end-1967 book value of NIDB's shares wqas 109.1J.' of
par. Hlowever, taking into account the hard-core trouble cases referred to
above, NIDB's net worth may be less, but at worst not less than the par
value of its shares. Those shares have recently been quoted on the Lagos
Stock Exchange at or slightly over par, but no transaction occurred between
August 1966 and1 October 29, 1968, when only fifty ordinary shares were sold
at par.
43.       ICONSEC. The financial statements of ICONSEC for the years
1965-67 are siown in Annexes A-10 and A-ll. ICONSEC contributed about
RI 49,000 (RN 35.,000 management fee and EN 14,000 interest on line of credit)
or 16' of NIIDB's 1967 gross income of ;N 315.000. In the same vear. ICONSE(

NIDB should itself make such consolidation in future, so as to get a clearer
picture of its overa'l position.
ove vera±LL.L pict-ure Iitu eiiierges is that tnough several items in
NIDB's and ICONSEC's portfolios are weak and some are in serious trouble,
tihu impact of t-he powential losses is not beyond NIDBis capacity to witn-
stand. Despite the civil war and serious economic setbacks, a good pro-
pUrlUio  l ofte portfolio is in fair condition. N1v' s demonstrated abli-ty
to effect reconstruction of projects in trouble is a factor in its favor.
A cessation of the civil war, or its containment in a small area, and a
consequent upturn in the econony could result in a rapid improvement in the
position of several companies in trouble. The situation is, on the whole,
not one that should cause alarm, and is within NIDB's competence to handle.

TIT. THE OUTLOOK
The Setti ng
47.       The long-ru-n grnwi.h prospects of the NMiarian ennomv are favor-
able, Its large internal market offers a good base for further induLstrial.
growtu+h and econo.mies of senle in mnn.ufacturing operations. The politircal
turmoil of the past two years has slowed dolin development but a great
nu.-mber of e stablsShmeents in Nigeria ha1=ve been. able to snu.ive the loss of
markets in thie East and have expanded or opened up markets in other parts
of the country. By early 1968, thame b,,4yeSs c        . federallycon
trolled Nligeria had adjusted itself to the hostilities in the country,
nearly a''4' whiJch are row (arluary .LY0Y I u.r-r.g in. a ". XVe '   s.,"U
area about 60 miles north of Port Harcourt. The chances for a resumption
of' norral economic lfe are good and supported b-y he recent revival of'
Nigerian oil exports. They would obviously be further enhanced if hosti-
J-Ltles enuuded aeuar eaerly date. The U---A-ntl us rUCnb%I;rru(;1ULU1i 11VIVILIO -LL J11..-a-
structure ancl manufacturing facilities in Nigeria is not yet known. Neither
can arny judgment be made at present about the effort and time needed to
overcome the economic dislocations brought about by the war. It is clear,
however, tha; all these efforts vwill require sizeable investments.  In fact,
the oil companies operating in Nigeria are already carrying out substantiEal
investments whnich are expected to continue for some years.
NIEDB;'s Future Operations and Resource Requirements
48.       Against this background, NIMB expects a rising business over thet
next two years. In 1968, NIDB approved eight projects totalling IIN 722,000
and at the end of the year, four projects totalling IN 280,000 were ready
for presentation to its Board. Six more, projects for WN 640.,000 are expected
to be approved in 1969 and two others  are being considered for T!N 185,00(0
About 70% of NIDB's investments in these projects are estimated to require
import financing. An additional project already in sight may lead to a
substantial NIDB investment, about IN 300,000 - 400,000, in Afprint, a large
and successful textile company which is already an NIDB client; this
project is also being considered by IFC. The foregoing project and proposals
could lead to investment decisions by NIDB of about IN 1.2 - 1.5 million in
1969. It is reasonable to expect that some additional projects wil:L be
processed and approved in 1969, including reconstruction and textile pro-
jects. Given the pent-up demand for new investment, delayed by recent
troubles and induced partly by new shortages, it is not unreasonable to
expect the total to reach MN 1.6 million in each of 1969 and 1970, or to
average that amount over the two years.
49.       NIDB expects and is likely to become more deeply involved in the
Nigerian textile industry because of that sector's apparent good market
outlook. To lay a basis both for a large exposure in the sector and for
some unusually large investments, NIDB has informed the Bank that it plans
to make a thorough assessment of the textile industry. As IFC itself is
planning to imdertake a similar assessment in considerina the Afprint
project, IFC and NIDB will work together.

50.       Thus, assuming that civil strife remains localized in a few
pockets or ceases in 1969, that a reconstruction program begins in 1969,
and that NIDB has foreign exchange resources, NIDB's business forecasts
through 1970 (in ;N thousands) are as follows:

after payment of the second tranche of the Government's 1966 loan, to
finance dome;stic currency requirements. During negotiations, the BanK vra.s
informed by the Government that there would be no obstacle from administrative
procedures which might delay or otherwise result in difficulties for MIUM
clients in using the foreign exchange proceeds from the requested Bank loan.
52.       Borrowing foreign currency and assuming the foreign exchange risk
will be a new experience to some of NIDB's clients; and NIDB may e.;pect a
certain reluctance on their part to take such loans. However, the concept
is not very diifferent from the suppliers' credits arrangements with wnich
they are fairriliar. More important, Nigeria's balance of payments problems
and the very restricted availability of other sources of import financing,
may be expected to exercise the pressure needed to assure expeditious use
of the proposed loan.
Financial Prospects
53.       The forecasts of NIDB's financial performance to the end of 1970
and their underlying assumptions appear in Annex B. The projections rest
on the business forecasts made in paragraph 50 and on the availability of
foreign exchange resources.

income from equity investments will rise and will continue to form an
imnortant percentage of I'BI]s ineome.   However. as ecuitv investments,

excessive, given the risks and uncertainties in NIDB's and ICONSEC's
portfolios and the continuing uncertainties in the general Nigerian picture.
Depending on how the weak elements in the portfolios develop in the
coming year and on wjhether business develops along the lines expected,
paying of a modest dividend on ordinary share might be considered in 1970.
58.       ICOWSEC's contribution to NIDB's gross income is expected to
remain at the 1967 level (;N 49,000); it thus forms a decreasing percentage
of NIDB's income.  Neither is NIDB expected to raise its present line of
credit of !N 360,000. Separate forecasts of IGoNSECIs activities have not
been made because the industrial security business on the Lagos Stock
Exchange is not expected to rise significantly until the economy returns to
normal, probably in a few years.
IVo  CONCLUSIONS AND IZECOMMENDATIONS
59.       NIDB's momentum in the first two years of its life was lost in
the period after the January 1966 coup.      It suffered from the general
political and economic situation, and made some errors in-judgment. On
the other hand, it gained considerable experience in dealing with portfolio

problems. And, in the past year it has recovered some of its early momentum.

LDespite is difficulties, NIDB has made an important conrtibution
to Nigeria, both financially and through qualitative improvements, such
as better project preparation Dy its clie nts and the promotion of Nigerlian
ownership of industrial enterprise and securities. It has insisted on reason-
able financing pians. As a result Of tne data requested and the project
criteria emphasized by NIDB3, a measure of discipline has been spread among
several cLients wnicn nas already served as an exampie for other members
of the business commmmity. Its efforts to promote Nigerian entrepreneurship
and investment are still at an early stage, but not insubstantial. Despite
strains,   it has dealt with fair success wiith official and private
pressures in regard to financing proposals or staffing matters.  Tnis
subject was raised during the recent loan negotiations; it is hoped that,
as NIDBis business grows, such pressures will diminish.
61.       The combination of NIDBts relative inexperience and the recent
troubled timtes in the country has affected NIDB's financial position.
Twenty-three percent of its portfolio is in investments in the East, whose
position and prospects are clouded because the situation cannot yet be
assessed.  Furthermore, a loss of a single large investment, which could
possibly have been avoided by greater care, wiped out 43% of NIDB's
reserves in 1967. Nevertheless, and even allowing for other potential
losses, it is unlikely that the net worth of the company is less than par.
NIDB has shown a low profit since the begirning despite the absence of
financial expenses, largely because equity investments are too large and
too young to produce a substantial income and because administrative
expenses are high in relation to portfolio.
62.       Hostilities in Nigeria are likely to end soon or to decline.
This would allow significant reconstruction wvork to begin in various parts
of the country. This factor and the continued interest of private enter-
prise, partly spurred by investments of the oil companies point to good
prospects for industrial development in the near future. NIDB should,
therefore, be able to look towards a rising level of operations in the
next several. years.
63.       NIDB's Dresent resources are insuffinient to meet the exDected
demand of the next two years. IMoreover, its present resources are in
domestic currencvy  which rarinnt rPeaii 1 finam'e imm-rt.s in Vi.w of Nki ria1s

improves as expected and NIDB's management and staff are strengthenecd
as planned, i the comrUpaW1y-s longer range prospects are very very good.
Up.       Consiaering its prospects ana tne forthcoming strengthening
of its management, NIDEB would be a suitable and creditworthy borrower for an
IBRD loan of uS$6 million wifTch would cover its foreign exchange requirements
until about the end of 1970. This is the same size of loan negotiated in 1966,
in conjunction with the Government's :N- 2 million loan, the second nal-f
of which the Government has agreed to pay by the end of May 1969.
66.       In loan negotiations, the terms negotiated wlere those generally
applied to Bank loans to development finance companies. However:
(a) In view of NIDD's wzar-time situation, prudence suggests
that not more than half the loan be committed before a
newr review is made of NIDB's situation. Accordingly, unless
the Bank agrees othermise (after another review of NIDB's
operations), no credit would be made in excess of US$3
million or after December 31, 1969.
(b) The proposed loan could be suspended if the second EN 1.0
million tranche of the Government's loan of September 3,
1966, has not been disbursed by June 30, 1969.
(c) As NIDB is still a young company whose business growth
has been interrupted by circumstances beyond its control,
it should receive concessional treatment regarding
commitment charges. Accordingly, the normal commitment
fee nould not be charged until specific projects are
credited to the Loan Account.
67.       The Bank should require prior approval of each project using
$100,000 or more of the proceeds of the Droposed loan. On the basis of
past experience, over half the projects and over 8%b of the amount of
the loan would come to the 1Rank for rePv,ew

to determine the most suitable relationshin between the institntinn.
While ICONSEC remains a subsidiary of NIDB, the latter should prepare

Assumptions Used in the Forecasts for 1969 and 1970
New Approvals
1.        It is assumed that 25 of approvals will be in equity and the balance
in loans/debentures. The estimates of sanctions and commitments are as Iollows:
(4vn LMI thousandAS)
Loan or Equity              Of which
Approvals          Purchase Agreements        Foreign Excing

1969              1,600                   1,300                      950
1970              1,600                   1,300                      900
Disbursement
2.        Delay between approval and disbursement of equity investments is
assumed at seven months and that for loans, nine months.
Repayments
3.        It is assumed that future local currency loans will have a grace period
of two years after disbursement. Therefore, the repayments shown in the forecasts
relate only to presently approved loans. For the IBRD loan, no repaymenit is
assumed through 1l970.
ICONSEC
4.        It is assumed that ICONSEC will not draw upon the line of credit beyond
the present level.
Special Government Loan
5.        It is assumed that the seonnd tranehe of WN 10 million nut ofl the
2-3/14%o second Government loan of LN 2.0 million would be available by May 19651.
Jiorld Bank Loan
6.        It is assumed that early in 1969 an IBRD loan for US$6 million would. be
s.qvilMabls fotr coirmTitment. It is also assummed that this loa-n w-ill be UiQ9> to
finance a large part of loan approvals in 1969 and 1970.   Interest and commit--

been included. 1CONSEC's profits/losses as opposed to the management fee and
interest it pays NIDB, are not included in the forecasts, as they are retained
in ICONSEC.  Provision has been made for doubtful interest income, which main]y
relates to investments in the Eastern States, on the same basis as was done in
1967 annual statements.
Capital Expenditure
8.        Provision was made in 1968 for IN 150,000 for land for new office
building and in 1969 for EN 50,000 for senior staff quarters.
Taxation
9.        Until reserves total LN 2.0 million, tax is pavable only on distributed
profits plus certain "non-allowable" expenses, such as depreciation and legal
fees. less certain allowances.  These allowances are assimed to be are ter than
the taxable items; so no tax is included. All dividends, however, are paid net
of the hW tax.
Dividends
10n       T-. is asslmed that no divi dend on equrty shares *ill be pad for th
financial years 1968-1970. Payment of preference dividend is included.
