continued rapid growth in transport demand resulting\n            from sustained economic growth, and to address critical\n            issues associated with the transport-related environmental\n            pollution and traffic safety, the Fifth Highway Sector\n            Project aims specifically at: 1) furthering the\n            implementation of actions aimed at reducing environmental\n            degradation and vehicular accidents attributable to fast\n            growing motorization through the establishment of a\n            privately operated vehicle inspection system; 2) improving\n            the quality of service of the inter-urban road network\n            through increased road capacity and improved safety\n            standards of existing roads; and 3) providing a systematic\n            basis for the establishment of environmental assessment\n            criteria at the design stage as well as environmental\n            management during and after new road construction and\n            capacity increases. The project will finance the following\n            components over a period of about four years: 1) civil works\n            sub-projects for capacity increases involving the widening\n            to four lanes and rehabilitation of the existing two lanes\n            of selected sections of the country's major inter-urban\n            national highways; 2) consulting services for the design and\n            supervision of the Department of Highways' (DOH) road\n            widening program; 3) technical assistance and training to\n            the Land Transport Department, the Department of Pollution\n            Control, DOH and the Ministry of Transport and\n            Communications related to air quality, highway safety\n            improvements, and institutional development; and 4)\n            strengthening environmental assessment and mitigation\n            management capacities at DOH and the Office of Environmental\n            Policy and Planning."}, "docdt": "1995-11-28T00:00:00Z"}
