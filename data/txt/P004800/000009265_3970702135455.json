Project sets\n            out to: 1) improve Thailand's major inter-city raodways\n            by widening to 4-lane standards; 2) resurface and restore\n            existing roads to allow them to carry increasing traffic and\n            heavier vehicles; 3) provide technical assistance and\n            trainng; and 4) support the procurement of various related\n            types of equipment for the Ministry of Transport and\n            Communications and other agencies.  The major environmental\n            issues associated with the project are\n            transportation-related air pollution and noise, and the\n            potential for involuntary resettlement of people along or\n            within the existing inter-city roadway.   The sectoral\n            environmental assessment is primarily aimed at describing\n            the environmental documentation requirements, legal and\n            regulatory framework, and the institutional capabilities of\n            affected agencies.  Suggestions are made for warrented\n            project definition and screening procedural changes,\n            mitigation planning, training, and other institutional\n            aspects of the environmental assessment process."}, "docdt": "1994-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
