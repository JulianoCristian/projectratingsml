sustainability likely, and the institutional development\n            impact is substantial. Lessons reinforce that while\n            ownership, and commitment by the Borrower is crucial, it\n            remains difficult to ascertain these two factors, beyond the\n            needed funds. One way to maximize these two factors, could\n            be by minimizing staff changes, on both the Bank and\n            Borrower sides, but involving greater number of people on\n            the borrower's side in project preparation, through\n            workshops, and other means of information, to reduce\n            dependence on few key staff members, and gain support for\n            project objectives, regardless of the fact that project\n            preparation may become more time consuming, and expensive.\n            Moreover, coordination of action plans by a number of\n            agencies does become cumbersome; rather, commitments on a\n            few agreed-upon actions by a few agencies, instead of a\n            myriad, disconnected actions by many agencies, would be\n            simpler, and should make possible to match the\n            country's, and implementing agencies' objectives,\n            with the Bank's strategic objectives. Further lessons\n            suggest the need for an early agreement on procurement\n            procedures; to ensure implementation of a strong financial\n            management; to ensure that terms of reference reflect the\n            needs of the agency, and its management capability; and, to\n            ensure flexibility, and relevance in the design of capacity\n            building programs."}, "docdt": "2002-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
