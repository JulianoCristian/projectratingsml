     We refer to the Loan Agreement for the above-mentioned Project,
dated April 16, 1993, between Republic of Mauritius (the Borrower)
and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank).
We also refer to the Minister of Finance's letter, dated August 1,
1996, requesting an amendment to the Project to provide for the
construction of two additional state secondary schools and about 45
pre-primary units.
     This letter is to inform you of our agreement and to propose the
following amendments to the Agreement:
1.   The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement is amended
to read as in the Attachment to this letter.
2.   Schedule 2 to this Agreement is amended as follows:
     (a)  by the addition to Part A.1 of a new Part A.1 (c) to read:
          "(c) construction of about 45 pre-primary units at existing
          primary schools to meet the urgent demand for pre-primary
          education.".
     (b)  by deleting the word "five" and the figure "5000" in Part A.2
(b) and inserting therefor the word "about seven" and the figure "about
7000".
3.   Section I, Part C of Schedule 4 to the Agreement is amended by the
addition of a new paragraph 4 to read:
     "4. Works under Par A.1 (c) of the Project, estimated to cost the
     equivalent of $500,000 or less per contract, up to an aggregate
     amount equivalent to $1,800,000, may be procured on the basis of
     competitive bidding advertised locally, in accordance with pro-
     cedures satisfactory to the Bank.".
     All provisions of the Agreement, except as amended herein, shall
remain in full force and effect.
     Please confirm your agreement to the amendments by countersigning,
dating and returning to us the enclosed copy of this letter. This
Amendment shall become effective as of the date of this letter.
Sincerely,
