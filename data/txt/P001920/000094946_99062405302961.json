All three\n            projects stressed the importance of involving stakeholders\n            to build consensus around sector policies. Other lessons\n            learned from the Industrial and Vocational Training Project\n            are: Agents and procedures for project coordination can\n            accelerate procurement in slow disbursing projects.\n            Clearly-defined procedures are essential for appraising\n            sub-projects during implementation. Time-bound, monitorable\n            performance indicators are important to guiding\n            implementation and measuring achievement of objectives. Key\n            lessons from the Education Sector Development Project are:\n            Projects will fail if little attention is paid to\n            implementation. Frequent changes in personnel, including\n            roles and responsibilities, impede achievement of objectives\n            on higher levels. Improving learning achievements requires a\n            holistic and integrated approach, which goes beyond the\n            measurement of quantitative inputs. Lessons learned from the\n            Higher and Technical Education Project are: To keep\n            implementation on schedule, the Bank has to establish\n            ownership of the project at national and institutional\n            levels. The government and the Bank should first insist on\n            sound sectoral and sub-sectoral policies before investing in\n            such projects. Project objectives need to be scaled to take\n            account of the local implementation capacity. Procurement\n            procedures need to be harmonized. Statutes of the governing\n            councils and education boards need updating."}, "docdt": "1999-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
