Government of\n            Mauritius in implementing its education development program\n            for the period 1993-1998, as described in its Education\n            Sector Master Plan (ESMP).  The main objective of the ESMP\n            is to reinforce the international competitiveness of\n            Mauritius' labor force, and transform the country into\n            a technologically more sophisticated economy.  The ESMP\n            plans to increase access to and improve the quality of\n            secondary education, with the specific target of increasing\n            secondary enrollments by 15,000 students.  Other objectives\n            include improving the quality and efficiency of education at\n            all levels, expanding tertiary education, and strengthening\n            education sector planning and management.  To achieve these\n            objectives, the project supports ESMP policy measures.  The\n            project finances the following investments designed to:  (1)\n            increase access to and promote equity of education by:  (a)\n            providing for the rehabilitation of 25 dilapidated primary\n            schools and construction of 13 new primary schools in\n            underserved regions; (b) renovating 21 state secondary\n            schools and constructing 5 new secondary schools; (c)\n            providing financial support to upgrade schools and\n            enrollment capacity; and (d) expanding enrollment capacity\n            at the University of Mauritius; (2) improve the quality of\n            education by:  (a) funding the design and implementation of\n            a renewed national system to assess student achievement; (b)\n            supporting pre-service and in-service teacher training; and\n            (c) providing library materials and teaching aids; and (3)\n            strengthen education sector management by:  (a) assisting\n            the tertiary education commission to prepare institutional\n            development plans for higher education institutions; (b)\n            establishing an education management information system; (c)\n            supporting research to explore alternative approaches for\n            more effective, efficient and flexible delivery of\n            education; (d) developing a viable institutional framework\n            for a national schools inspectorate; and (e) establishing a\n            network of regional education centers to provide educational\n            support to schools at the regional level."}, "docdt": "1993-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
