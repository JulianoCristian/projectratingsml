Assessment Report (PPAR) on the First Programmatic, Second\n            Programmatic and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan Projects\n            in Ukraine. The ratings for the Financial Sector Adjustment\n            Loan (FSAL) Project for Ukraine were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was negligible\n            to low; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Major lessons from FSAL\n            are the importance of a sound legislative and regulatory\n            framework in the financial system, and the greater role of\n            the country's overall economic performance, as well as\n            market forces, than of formal technical assistance, in\n            achieving improvements in specific financial institutions.\n            In particular:, (i) establishing a sound legislative and\n            regulatory framework for the financial sector is a\n            necessary, but not sufficient, condition for financial\n            sector development; (ii) strengthening the supervisory and\n            enforcement capacity of the supervisory agency is essential\n            to achieve the benefits of a sound legal and regulatory\n            frame; (iii) technical assistance to strengthen poor\n            performing institutions has poor results without a strong\n            demand-pull, mainly from market forces; and (iv)\n            restructuring and improving the performance of state-owned\n            financial institutions is a slow and risky proposition in a\n            poor governance environment. The ratings for the First and\n            Second Programmatic Adjust Loan projects (PAL I and PAL II)\n            are as follows: outcome sustainability was satisfactory,\n            risk to development outcome was negligible to low, Bank\n            performance for PAL I was satisfactory while it was\n            moderately satisfactory for PAL II.  Three major categories\n            of lessons emerge from this assessment of the PAL program:\n            links and complementarity between the PAL program and\n            investment lending need reinforcing, politically difficult\n            issues are noticeable during the early stages of program\n            implementation and when crucial to the success of the\n            program should be addressed early and tranching was to fully\n            consistent with the PAL program approach (and brought no\n            obvious advantages)."}, "docdt": "2008-01-09T00:00:00Z"}
