The World Bank\n            is working to create a system of credit ratings, which is\n            widely developed in the entire financial world. This system\n            will facilitate enhancing enterprise transparency. Within\n            the framework of the World Bank Financial sector reform\n            project (1998-2001), the government developed and adopted a\n            law that has considerably extended the powers of the\n            National Bank of Ukraine, related to supervising the banking\n            system. One of the main requirements of the Bank for\n            allocating a United States (U.S.) 260 million dollars loan\n            for Ukraine, a greater part of which the government used for\n            social payments, was to establish a fund for guaranteeing\n            natural persons' deposits. The development of the new\n            law on banks and banking activities, with the participation\n            of the World Bank experts, and its adoption in 2001, made\n            the banks capitalization requirements more stringent, and\n            over the past four years the banking system capital has\n            almost doubled. In 1996, the World Bank extended to Ukraine\n            a loan for reforming the financial markets - the export\n            development project for the amount of U.S. 70 million\n            dollars. This project provided for assistance to support\n            exporters\u0092 production and promoted the development of the\n            state Export-Import Bank. The World Bank favors\n            strengthening the positions of the regulatory body and\n            supports increased financing of this body at the expense of\n            market participants. Within the framework of the rural\n            development project, the World Bank plans to involve\n            experienced and stable banks in crediting projects for rural areas."}, "docdt": "2004-04-19T00:00:00Z"}
