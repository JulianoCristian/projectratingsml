highly likely, with substantial institutional\n            development impacts. Nonetheless, lessons underline the need\n            for coordination among the various government entities, and\n            agencies. Despite The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU)\n            demonstrating its ability to take responsibility in\n            organizing, and managing most dimensions of a complex,\n            multi-component adjustment operation in the financial\n            sector, the project however, also revealed the poor quality\n            of coordination between NBU, and other key government\n            agencies. The absence of a unified vision on what financial\n            sector reform is meant to achieve, led to wasted, project\n            implementation efforts, where actions promoted by one part\n            of the Administration, hindered the intentions of other\n            government entities. Such results, and the obvious need for\n            an integrated government approach that ensures the benefits\n            of economic reforms, promoted the implementation of a new\n            inter-agency, the Financial Sector Policy Board, established\n            at the end of the year 2000."}, "docdt": "2002-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
