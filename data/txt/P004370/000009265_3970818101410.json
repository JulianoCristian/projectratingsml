is designed to increase\n            Papua New Guinea's export earnings from sales of palm\n            oil, palm kernel and coca, and to assist  in development of\n            Milne Bay, one of the least developed provinces in the\n            country.  Under the project, 3700 ha of oil palm plantation,\n            750 ha of cocoa plantation and 1000 ha of peripheral\n            smallholder oil palm blocks will be developed in the Milne\n            Bay Province.  The project will also provide for the\n            necessary processing facilities and infrastructural support,\n            including construction of an oil palm mill, a cocoa\n            fermentary, and improvements in project area roads and\n            bridges. It will also improve the quality of life for the\n            poorer inhabitants of the province by providing health,\n            education and housing facilities.  The project is expected\n            to increase PNG's annual exports of palm oil and kernel\n            by about US$13 million and cocoa by US$2 million.  The\n            project faces no special risks."}, "docdt": "1985-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
