The project finances the purchase\n            of equipment, local and overseas training, research\n            expenses, consultant services, information services,\n            publications, and monitoring and evaluation for an estimated\n            900 training and research programs in the areas currently\n            being supported under the Support Program for Scientific and\n            Technological Development I (PADCT) as well as in the two\n            areas of new materials and environmental science.  In\n            addition, the project supports a policy study which will\n            review issues related to the long term role of science and\n            technology in Brazil's economic development and a study\n            on the productivity and international competitiveness of\n            Brazilian industry."}, "docdt": "1990-10-19T00:00:00Z"}
