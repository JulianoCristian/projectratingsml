Some of the key lessons learned\n            include: a) It is important that intermediate products from\n            research be applied by the productive sector, which requires\n            a more demand-driven approach, in turn requiring a much\n            increased participation by the private sector. b)\n            Cooperation agreements between well established and emerging\n            groups, as well as among groups from more-advanced and\n            less-advanced regions should be encouraged. c) Collaborative\n            use of sophisticated equipment and cost recovery through\n            user and service charges should be encouraged to keep\n            technology support infrastructure from rapidly becoming\n            outdated, and training of high-level technicians and the\n            development of good career prospects for them should be\n            emphasized. d) Interchanges with foreign centers of\n            excellence should be increased and the use of international\n            peer reviewers encouraged. e) Performance indicators and an\n            efficient Management Information System should be developed.\n            f) Executing agencies should control the details of the way\n            funds are allocated. G) Bank procurement procedures should\n            respond to the special needs of scientific research\n            projects. H) The appointment of independent advisory groups\n            of prominent national and international professionals\n            provide a valuable contribution to strategy setting,\n            evaluation of results, and feedback to the Borrower and to\n            the Bank."}, "docdt": "1997-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
