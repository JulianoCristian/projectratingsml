                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PDO: Good Progress is being made towards achieving the PDO. Environmental conditions have improved in the participating cities/counties through completion of most of the water
                         supply,wastewater collection and treatment, and solid waste services investments, as well as river rehabilitation works. The volume of wastewater treated has reached 307 million
                         m3/year compared to the target of 226 million m3/year. COD prevented from reaching the recipient rivers has been raised from 9400 tons per year to 61,400 tons now, greatly
                         exceeding the target of 28,000 tons/year. Use of treated effluent has reached 18.3%, on track to meet the target of 21%. Solid waste collected and transfered to the sanitary landfills
                         has now reached 562,660 tons, exceeding the end of project target of 450,775 tons.
                         The success in the solid waste sector is attributed to the fact that the Heze solid facility is fully utilized following Heze government's decision not to divert solid waste to an incinerator.
                         The decision on adopting a charge for solid waste services in Heze and Rizhao is pending with the respective governments.
                         GEO: Although delayed by slow procurement of the necessary vehicles, septic tank emptying finally began in mid-2011, with septic tanks being emptied for the first time in about 15
                         years. Relevant results indicators should show much more progress in the next ISR. Ultimately the emptying program will contribute to reducing land-based pollution reaching the
                         river systems and Bohai sea.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         PDO: (1)The Weifang Municipal Government wishes to use loan savings of about $15 million accrued due to the scaling back of the wetlands (pretreatment facility)to be constructed.
                         Provincial Project Management Office should send a proposal for the utilization of loan savings for Bank review.
                         (2) Heze and Rizhao Municipal Governments should reach a decision on arrangements for cost recovery for solid wastes services.
                         GEO: The Yantai Municipal Government should announce the tariff and implementation date for septic tank emptying services.
