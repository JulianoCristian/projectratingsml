                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PDO: The PDO has been satisfactorily achieved. Environmental conditions in eight out of nine project cities/counties have improved following completion of investments for water
                         supply, wastewater collection and treatment, and solid waste disposal. The project constructed wastewater collection systems and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) which are
                         currently treating 402 million m3of wastewater annually, and serving almost 91% of the population, exceeding the target of 85%. The wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Qixia
                         has been completed, but is not operating because the Qixia Economic Development Zone (EDZ) does not generate adequate wastewater. A 18 km long pipeline is under
                         construction, with other funding, to transfer wastewater from Qixia city to this plant, which is expected to be fully operational by mid-2014. The sanitary landfills for both Rizhao and
                         Heze are completed and operating, and as a result, 100% of the city population identified at appraisal is covered by solid waste services, exceeding the target of 95%. Some 820,000
                         citizens (99%) in Gaomi now have access to improved water supplies. Regarding financial performance of the participating utilities, they are compliance with the financial covenants
                         except the Qixia WWTP as operation has not started yet.

                         GEO:       The GEO has been satisfactorily achieved. The septic tank emptying program financed by the GEF Grant is now fully operational. The service areas have expanded from
                         the pilot demonstration area to an adjacent area in Zhibu District. Since operations began in March 2013, 1,600 septic tanks in the service area have been emptied at least once, and
                         accumulated septage collected and treated in Xinanhe WWTP is 30,523.2 tons. BOD discharged to the Bohai Sea was reduced by an estimated 3554.48 tons. The “Yantai City
                         Urban Area Septic Tank Construction and Management Regulations” have been approved and issued, and they include a charge for septic tank emptying in the wastewater tariff.
