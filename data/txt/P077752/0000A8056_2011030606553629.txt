                         Implementation Status Overview
                         PDO: Good progress has been made towards improving environmental conditions in the project cities. For wastewater collection and treatment, works have been completed in
                         Weihai, Yantai, and Gaomi. Results achieved are: (i) percentage of population connected has increased from 58% to 78%; (ii) rate of treated effluent has increased from 0.2% to
                         10.3%; (iii) rate of compliance of connected industries with discharge standards has increased from 60% to 80.8%. Other ongoing works should allow the end-of-project targets to be
                         met. For solid waste treatment, landfills have been completed in Heze and Rizhao, raising the percentage of population with solid waste services from 84% to 89%. Assuming Heze
                         closes its incinerator as planned, the percentage of solid waste disposed of in sanitary landfills will meet the project target. Water supply improvements have been made in Gaomi
                         resulting in 90% of the population having access to safe water. For river rehabilitation, most works have been completed but a major change has been proposed for the Weifeng
                         Bailang River improvements, where the planned wetland area is proposed to be reduced following revisions to the city master plan; however there are technical and cost questions
                         about the new proposal.

                         GEO: Progress in reducing land-based pollution is limited because of delays in approving the action plan for budgets, staffing and operating regulations. The management information
                         system, the joint sewage-septage treatment plant and the necessary vehicles are now available, and full implementation is expected by March 2011, when pollution load reductions
                         should be measurable.
