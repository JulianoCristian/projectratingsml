PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Agricultural
and Industrial Innorts Project in Egypt, for which Credit 524-EGT in the
amount of US$35 million and  Loan  1062-EGT  in the amount of US$35 million
were approved on December 3, 1974. The creditlloan were closed on December
31, 1980 after being extended five times from December 31, 1976. The
credit was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on November 6,
1980. The loan was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on
December 11, 1980.
The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report;
the  Loan,  Guarantee,   and   Project   Agreements;  supervision  reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower on July 31, 1989, for comments by
September 18, 1989, but none were received.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.       In Egypt, the 1973 war  and  the  coincident rise in import prices
for  food  and  other  commodities  led   to  a  reduction  in  imports  of
intermediate inputs for both the agricultural and industrial sectors
resulting in sharply increased under-utilization of capacity. Increasing
capacity became the foremost objective of government policy and the
Government adopted a number of policy measures in support of this
objective, the foremost being the adoption of a parallel market exchange
rate and a greater recognition of the role of the private sector.
2.       The objective of the Bank loan/IDA  credit were to:  (i) finance a
portion of the foreign exchange required for imports of industrial raw
materials, intermediate goods, balancing equipment and other imports needed
by the agricultural and industrial sectors; (ii) equipment needed by the
Port of Alexandria to improve operations; and (iii) finance technical
assistance for selected industrial subsectors.
3.       The bulk of the loan/credit was disbursed in the first three years
although the loan/credit's closing date was extended five times to allow
disbursements for the technical assistance component. Capacity utilization
in the public enterprises assisted did improve sharply and industrial
growth during 1975-76 was  strong  (152  p.a.).   However, this performance
could not be sustained because of the lack of appropriate policy reforms in
the areas of prices, exchange rates, licensing controls, etc., which
inhibited  efficiency  improvements   in   industry,  particularly,  public
industry.

(CREDIT 524-EGT and LOAN 1062-EGT)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.       This report has been prepared as part of a Bank-wide effort to
prepare PCRs for a backlog of projects for which no PCR existed. The
Agricultural and Industrial Imports Project was closed over eight years ago;
project files are incomplete and no field trip was made. This report is a
desk study of material available in the files.
2.       An IDA credit aivd a Bank loan, each of US$3S million, to finance the
Agricultural and Industrial Imports Project, were signed on December 20, 1974,
and declared effective on March 19, 1979. The credit and loan were fully
disbursed and the credit/loan accounts were closed on December 31, 1980. This
was the Bank Group's eleventh lending operation in Egypt, bringing Bank and
IDA commitments to US$258.6 million.
H. BACKGROUND
3.       In Egypt, the 1973 war aud the coincidetnt vise ill import prices for
food and other commodities caused a reduction in import's (if ;nitermediate goods
and industrial raw materials. UnderutilizaLion of industrial capacity
increased sharply in 1974, due to insufficient availability of foreign
exchange to permit imports of raw materials and othet inputs, even though
official allocations of foreign exchange for meeting "maintenance" import,
remained unchanged.  The problem was intensified because of the continuree1 ri^.
in international prices of many necessary imports.  Also, since the foreigia
exchange allocations were only released in a quarterly basis to indivi.1ual
enterprises, purchases had to be made in the spot market, often at unfavorable
terms, and long-term commitments on more favorable terms could not be made iTI
the absence ot a guarantee of funds.
4.       Fared with these foreign exchange shortages, it was estimated that
allocations in the foreign exchange budget for the 18 month period starting
December 1974 for imports of raw materials, intermediate goods and spare parts
for the six subsectors of public industry and for agriculture (covering animal
feed, agricultural chemicals and spare parts but excluding fertilizer) were
deficient by about $570 million required for such imports to meet the
country's production targets. Thus, a considerable need existed for
assistance if these two key sectors were to achieve full production capacity.
5.       Increasing the rate of capacity utilization had received the highest
priority in Government policy. The Government had taken a number of steps
toward this end, and others were being contemplated. A comprehensive review
of unutilized capacities in the industrial sector was an important initial
step undertaken by the Government. Second, the institution of the parallel
exchange market in September 1973 (with a rate of exchange 50 percent above
the official rate) encouraged exports to convertible currency areas and use of
the proceeds for the recurrent imports and spares required. A third, and to
some extent related development, was a greater recognition of the private



sector's potential role itn Egyptian development; a new more liberal private
foreign investment law had encouraged optimism among private businessmen.
Fourth, there was general acce?tance that the structure of administrative
regulations and procedures needed to be simplified and overhauled.
i. OBJECTIVES
6.       The objective of the credit/loan was to help finance (i) a portion ot
the foreign exchange required for the import of raw materials, in.ermediate
goods, balancing equipmentt and other inputs to improve utilization of existing
productive capacities in the agricultural and industrial sectors; (ii) the
foreign exchange required for some urgently needed equipment and spare parts
to improve the efficiency of operations of the Port of Alexandria; and (iii)
provision of technical assistance in selected subsectors of industry.
7.       Components:  The loan/credit were earmarked to finance the following:
(a) US$33 million was allocated for the importation by public sector
enterprises of raw materials, intermediate goods, and spare parts in
order to utilize existing capacity more fully and to support
essential production.
(b) US$10 million was allocated for importing key items of equipment to
break bottlenecks in production lines and thus prevent further
deterioration in production capabilities. Funds were allocated to
public sector firms in food processing, textiles, chemicals,
engineet-ag, metallurgy, and building materials.
(c) US$4 million was allocated for the use of the private sector for both
raw material imports and equipment. Although the private sector had
been reasonably well served by access to the parallel market for
foreign exchange, the rapid growth of the sector and the prospects
for future expansion of exports required provision for additional
resources. Since the private sector was largely composed of
small-scale firms producing final goods, the allocation of US$4
million was considered sufficient to provide support for expansion of
activity in a variety of industries. Agreement was reached that
eight subsectors would be covered [food processing, textiles,
chemicals, engineering, metallurgy, building materials, leather
goods, wood products (including furniture)].
(d) US$19 million was allocated, as follows, for agriculture in order to
realize significant increases in agricultural output in the short
term: (i) maize for feeding livestock, (ii) pesticides for spraying
the cotton crop, and (iii) equipment and spare parts for tractors,
pumps, etc.
(e) US$3 million was allocated to finance urgently needed equipment and
spare parts required to improve the efficiency of operations of the
Port of Alexandria, which, since 1967, had been Egypt's only port,
handling all import and export traffic.



(f)  IIS$1 million was allocated for technical assistance (experienced
expatriate consultants) to support sector studies including the
initiation of sector and enterprise planning for longer-term
improvements in induistrial performance, systematic determination of
priority nc'eds and alternative uses of resources so as to lead to
longer-term improvements in the structure of industry. These studies
were to produce a systematic review of the current situation in the
industries, assess their competitiveness, and then prepare priority
investment projects and recommendations for policy changes, resulting
in a list of justifiable projects for a five-year plan and projects
that lenders could elect to support financially.
8.       The allocation of the proposed credit/loan within the industrial and
agricultural sectors and the corresponding estimates of foreign exchange needs
for the import requirements in the sectors were based on a forecast of import
needs over a period of 18 months, from December 1974 to May 1976. It was
estimated that the proceeds would cover some 12 percent of the total
unfinanced needs for imports in these sectors, thus allowing for productive
use of some of the present idle capacity in these areas.
IV. IMPLEMENTATION/ORGANIZATION
9.       The Ministry of Industry was responsible for allocating the proceeds
of the credit/loan to the enLerprises under its control in the public sector,
and the Industrial Control Board in the Ministry of Industry was to be
responsible for the allocation to the private sector. The Ministry of
Agriculture made the allocations of the three approved agricultural commodity
groups Lo the appropriate agencies under its control. The allocation of the
proceeds l.r the items to be procured by the Port of Alexandria Authority
(freight-haudling equipment) were also agreed upon with the Government and
specified in a side letter.
10.      The entire proceeds of the credit and the loan were expected to be
disbursed within about two years after the date of the Loan/Credit Agreements.
11.      In the public industrial sector, Bank/IDA funds were made available
to enterprises in food industries, textiles, chemicals, engineering,
metallurgy and building materials. During 1975-76, industrial growth was high
(over 152 per annum), resulting primarily from those Government policies
encouraging increased industrial production. This process was significantly
helped by the availability of foreign exchange. Typical individual items
procured were aircompressors, machinery for cement plants, metal forming and
casting machines, and textile equipment. In the private industrial sector,
significant imports included copper, lead for batteries, and containers for
food processing firms.
12.      In the agricultural sector, allocated funds for maize were used
quickly for the poultry program, and pesticides were used on fruits and
vegetables. Funds were also utilized for spare parts, including tractors and
pumps.
13.      Funds allocated to the Port of Alexandria were used for cranes and
fork lifts.



14.      The original six industrial subsector reports [para. 7  0f)I were
satisfactorily completed, although the Government was slow in getting this
program of studies underway since the Ceneral Organizations in each of the
industries were abolished in December 1975; the General Organization for
Industrialization (GOFI) had to undertake the responsibility for the direction
and cooraination of all the studies. As there %ere unutilized funds
remaining, two additional studies were carried out: a feasibility study for a
proposed pulp and paper project anid a brick master plan study.
i5.      The closing date of the credit/loan was extended five times, from
December 31, 1976 to December 31, 1980, when all disbursements were completed
and the credit and loan accounts were closed. A table comparing appraisal
estimate-s and actual disbursements is attached. Disbursements were slower
than anticipated, due to: unfamiliarity with Bank procedures on the part of
the beneficiaries, fluctuations in international prices of some commodities
such as lead and copper which caused the Borrower to delay withdrawals, and
substantial delays in delivery schedules of equipment. In addition, the
closing date was also extended to allow for the completion of the additional
subsector studies.
V. CONCLUSIONS
17.      As isidicated in the Presidenit's Report for the second Industrial
Imports Project, the credit/loani allowed the import of raw materials and spare
parts at a time of critical foreign exchange shortage. This helped improve
capacity utilization and provided a firmer basis for the long-term planning of
industrial development. Capital equipment imports, financed under the
credit/loan, helped to remove bottlenecks in the production lines, and to
maintain production capabilities.
18.      It also appears that the performance of the industrial sector in
Egypt was dependent on an integrated approach, including policy reform, since
the stop-gap measures did not prove to be fully effective in the long term.
