Social Protection\n            Adjustment Loan (SPAL) Project is rated as satisfactory,\n            sustainability as highly likely, institutional development\n            impact as substantial, bank performance as satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance as satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            from the project include: The accomplishment of the SPAL\n            objectives required long government commitment to the\n            reform. Sufficient management and implementation capacity\n            needed to be in place within the government and especially\n            within the implementing agency. Some flexibility of the\n            conditionalities and benchmarks is needed to reflect the\n            changing external conditions, the balance-of-payments and\n            fiscal situation, and as a result of re-thinking of reform\n            priorities and sequencing of reforms. In the second tranche\n            conditionality, the government and the Bank were bound to\n            precise conditions which may have needed refining as time\n            passed. Technical assistance and other donor financial\n            support helped in some of the design and implementation work\n            of the SPAL. Timely parallel operations prevented\n            overloading the SPAL and optimized the linkages among the\n            operations, but required coordination. Given the\n            complementary nature of the content of the SPAL and the\n            International Monetary Fundx program, coordination between\n            the Bank and the Fund was essential. The SPAL required on\n            the ground support due to the need for constant\n            communication between the government and the Bank in dealing\n            with implementation issues."}, "docdt": "2001-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
