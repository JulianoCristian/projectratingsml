Lessons\n            learned from the project are as follows: financial\n            institutions development project's (FIDP) ability to\n            fulfill its development objectives was greatly impacted by\n            external macroeconomic risks. Frequent changes in Government\n            personnel led to constant delays in project implementation\n            which was affected by lengthy bureaucratic processes. The\n            complementarities of the FIDP and enterprise support project\n            provided positive synergies. One of the major features of\n            the Project was the use of twining arrangements with\n            European banks for capacity building in the Russian banks.\n            Project performance depends to a large degree on the\n            flexibility of Project design and responsiveness of Project\n            stakeholders. The project success is also influenced to a\n            large extent by the quality of governance in the banking\n            sector, which was quite weak in Russia."}, "docdt": "2006-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
