MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RF.CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DE"JELOPMENT LOAN
TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
1.           I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Financial Institutions Development Loan to the Russian Federation in the amount of US$200 million
equivalent to finance a program to support the transformation of the banking sector. The loan would be
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace. Co-
financing would be provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (US$99
million equivalent), the European Union (US$36 million), and bilateral grants (US$37.4 million).
PART I. COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Recent Economic Performance
2.           The most recent Bank economic report for Russia (Russian Economic Reform: Crossing
the Threshold of Structural Change) was distributed to the Board in September, 1992. An updated
analysis of the economic situation (Structural Reform in the Russian Federation: Progress, Prospects,
and Priorities for External Support, April 20, 1993) was prepared for the Consultative Group meeting
for Russia held on June 8-9, 1993.
3.           The most recent discussion of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Russia took
place on June 17, 1993 in the context of the Oil Rehabilitation Loan. The 1993 CAS provided a
comprehensive discussion of the major issues facing Russia in its transformation to a market-based
economy. The current CAS is more selective, focusing on: (a) a brief update of recent economic events;
(b) a discussion of the critical problem of enterprise restructuring, including priorities for strengthening
social assistance programs; and (c) an expanded discussion of the Bank's lending strategy in the context
of continuing uncertainties about the outlook for the reform program. The draft CAS was reviewed with
senior Government officials during the week of March 21-25, 1994 and its recommendations were
broadly accepted.
Macroeconomic Performance During 1993 and Early 1994
4.           For most of 1993, Government policy wavered between the desire to bring inflation down
quickly through financial tightening, and concern about the drop in output in selected sector and regions.
As a result, macroeconomic policies were implemented largely on an ad hoc basis. There was a sharp
reduction in subsidized directed credits through the Central Bank as compared to 1992, but the deficit on
the general government budget rose from 2 percent of GDP during the first half of 1993 to about 10
percent in the second half. Higher budget deficits emerged, despite a decline in budgetary transfers to
enterprises and the accumulation of arrears, because of a dramatic fall-off in revenues. In support of a
tighter monetary stance during the second half of 1993, the Central Bank increased interest rates sharply
in both nominal and real terms, and by December, the Central Bank finance rate and commercial banks'
lending rates exceeded the rate of inflation.
5.           These developments contributed to significant fluctuations in money creation during 1993;
as a result, monthly inflation remained in the 15-25 percent range Juring the first 10 months of the year.



- 2 -
Due to the somewhat tighter monetary stance during the second half of 1993, inflation began to gradually
decline, hitting 10 percent in February 1994, and the real exchange rate appreciated by about 150 percent
as compared to the first half of 1993. Real GDP declined by about 12 percent during 1993, following
a drop of 19 percent in 1992, and early indications suggest a continuing decline in early 1994. However,
registered unemployment barely changed in 1993, staying at about 1.5 percent of the labor force, but the
Government has now officially recognized that open unemployment may have exceeded 5 percent of the
labor force.
6.           Reflecting the continuing debate about the direction of reforms, the 1994 budget was not
submitted to the State Duma until March 3. The proposed budget includes a deficit on the order of 10
percent of GDP; however, the Ministry of Finance stated that the Government intends to reduce inflation
further during the year. This was further emphasized on March 22 when the Government and the IMF
announced that they had reached agreement in principle on a macroeconomic program to be supported
by a second tranche STF arrangement. In order to ensure consistency between the budget deficit and the
end-1994 inflation target of about 7 percent, the Govurnment undertook to submit additional revenue
measures, on the order of 2.5 percent of GDP, to the Duma.
Structural Reforms
7.           Despite the political turmoil and macroeconomic instability during 1993, the Government
maintained progress on structural reforms, albeit with uneven success in implementation.  Most
encouragingly, the privatization program maintained momentum. The financial system, especially the
commercial banking system, has continued to develop rapidly. Substantial progress was made in the
pricing and trade regime. The challenge for the future will be to consolidate and accelerate progress in
structural reforms, while resisting mounting pressures for the reimposition of price controls and increases
in subsidies to state enterprises. The Government will also need to encourage restructuring for both
privatized and state-owned enterprises, and reshape existing social programs.
8.           The most significant progress has been in privatization. Recent estimates indicate that
about two-thirds of all small scale enterprises had been privatized by the end of 1993, and around 10,000
medium-sized and large enterprises had been privatized, mostly through voucher auctions. This success
was bolstered by the adoption of the new Constitution, which explicitly recognizes the right to private
ownership of land and other property. The Privatization Program adopted in January 1994 reaffirmed
the Government's conmnitment to continued privatization. The continued success of the privatization
program will depend on whether the Government can bring into the process those enterprises currently
excluded, especially after the expiration of the vouchers.
9.           The financial system, especially the commercial banking sector, continued to grow
rapidly. Among the vast number of new banks in Russia, there may be up to 100 leading commercial
banks that are evolving into real banking institutions. While their number and the volume of their
operations are still relatively small, they are growing at an unprecedented rate and are iwolved in
profitable and genuine banking activities. A worrisome feature of the emerging banks is that most are
owned by enterprises, which may perpetuate the practice of connected and insider lending. The
reluctance by the Government to allow foreign banks to participate in the domestic market represents a
further impediment to the development of the financial system and the transfer of know-how.
10.          The domestic market for oil was further liberalized during 1993; mandatory allocations
have ended, profit limits on price increases have been abolished, and prices are freely negotiated between
suppliers and buyers. As a result, domestic oil prices have increased in real terms to around 50 percent



- 3 -
of world levels. Further increases in oil prices will depend on the elimination of all remaining export
quotas (which the Government has targeted for end-1994), as well as the removal of physical export
constraints. Export quotas have been abolished for most non-energy products, and import subsidies were
essentially eliminated by the end of 1993. However, the recent increase in import tariffs by an average
of 5 percent, with large variations across different commodities, appears to represent a policy reversal,
although the Government has stated that it will not use import tariffs to close the domestic market.
11.          In agriculture, the Government has taken some initial steps in land reform, although
progress has been slow in putting in place the legal and technical infrastructure necessary for land sales,
leasing and mortgaging. A continuing flow of financial transfers to agriculture enterprises has hampered
progress in reforming the sector and continues to be one of major factors threatening macroeconomic
stabilization.
12.           Broad-based social protection programs protect only a minority of the poor due to
inadequate targeting and indexation. The Government recently introduced flat rate indexation of pensions,
without, however, ensuring that the minimum pension continued to remain above the minimum poverty
level. Child allowances were linked to the minimum wage at the end of 1993, but this is likely to be
unduly expensive for the budget, as they are provided to all families, regardless of need.  The
Government has been reluctant to introduce more fundamental reforms of social benefit programs because
of the political sensitivity of many of the required changes.
B. External Environment
Balance of Payments, 1993
13.           The drop in exports that accompanied the break-up of the FSU and CMEA trade system
appears to have bottomed out, although imports have continued to fall. In '993, exports grew by 5
percent while imports dropped by 11 percent, expanding the trade surplus to $1 1 billion. In line with
the introduction of positive real interest rates and stabilization of the exchange rate, legal capital flight
(primarily in the form of foreign exchange deposits tArough the banking system) declined in 1993, but
few indications suggest that illegal capital flight has declined. Foreign exchange reserves increased
significantly to about $6 billion. Trade with other FSU countries is undertaken almost exclusively as part
of barter arrangements, and such trade continued to decline in real terms in 1993.
14.           Debt service due in 1993 totalled $33 billion, including clearance of about $7 billion in
arrears. In April 1993, the Paris Club agreed to reschedule almost $15 billion due to official creditors.
This agreement was exceptional in several respects. Contrary to established practice, the Paris Club
agreed to the rescheduling although Russia did not have an agreement in place with the IMF at the time.
Also, the official creditors included part of the "post cut-off date" debt in the rescheduling agreement,
as well as some interest due during the consolidation period and a relatively large share of arrears. In
spite of prolonged negotiations, Russia did not reach an agreement with the commercial bank creditors,
and Russia did not make any payments to the banks during 1993, leading to an increase in arrears to
about $16 billion. Debt service paid in 1993 amounted to only $2.5 billion, primarily to official
creditors.
Balance of Payments Prospects for 1994
15.          Imports are now at an artificially low level, aad it is likely that they will grow
substantially in 1994, maybe by as much as 20 percent. Exports, o i the other hand, could fall to around



- 4 -
the 1992 level in nominal terms, largely on account of low international oil prices. As a result, the trade
surplus could be elimninated, leading to a current account deficit of about $12 billion. While it is still too
early to project the capital account, it appears that new money disbursements will remain low, maybe at
around the 1993 level of $5 bilhlon. But if stabilization is indeed successful, capital flight should level
off, thereby easing the pressure on the capital account. The agreement in principle with the IMF on the
second tranche of the STF may pave the way for a rescheduling arrangement to cover the rest of 1994.
The overall external financing picture is summarized in Table 1.

Prospects for the Medium Term
16.             Over the mediun. to longer term, Russia's prospects for achieving a viable external
financing position will require actions in a number of areas, most importantly: (i) integrating its economy
into world markets through domestic and external trade policy reforms; (ii) regularizing its external debt
situation; and (iii) establishing an attractive environment for foreign private investment.



- 5 -
17.            Foreign Trade. In the short to mediumii teim, Russia's prospects for export growth will
depend on developments in the oil sector. Oil production is expected to continiue to decline at least
through 1995 before efforts to stabilize output through rehabilitation investme .'s can achievc a leveling
off in production in the range of 340-350 million tons per year, roughly 60 pci,Lent of the peak level of
production achieved in the late-1980s. Further increases in production will require massive investments
over the next decade (on the order of $50 billion) for the development of new fields. In the medium
term, therefore, the outlook for oil exports depends on a reduction in domestic oil consumption, thus
freeing up oil for export. Significant gains can be found; in terms of consumiiption per unit of GDP,
Russia utilizes oil at a rate 4-5 times that of climatically similar western countries. Increases in domestic
energy prices to world levels are critical in order to encourage energy cons,ervation and to mobilize the
financial resources needed for longer term investments in the sector.
18.            In the medium term, Russia must start to rely on exports of manufactured goods.' The
collapse of CMEA trade primarily hit such exports, and it will take time for enterprises to adjust to
competition in the world market, both in terms of reliability and with regard to quality, delivery and
after-sales service. In addition, export of manufactured goods is constrained by a lack of foreign trade
financing. The international community can assist in Russia's entry into the world trade system, as there
are mutual benefits to be gained by having a country of Russia's size and potential take a more active role
in trade. This is best achieved by facilitating Russia's access to the GATT.
19.            Russia's policy with regard to its trading relations with other FSU countries will have
major implications for the economic prospects of those countries as well. Based on recent trading
patterns and volumes with other FSU countries, Russia would receive a substantial gain in its terms of
trade if trade were conducted at world prices, although trading volumes are changing rapidly as prices
have continued to adjust. Most other FSU countries have now decided to establish their own national
currencies. This will provide an opportunity to develop trading relations based on mutual comparative
advantage. Russia can facilitate this process by abolishing obligatory trading lists, which have been the
basis for interstate trade up to now, and encouraging trade on the basis of enterprise-to-enterprise
agreements utilizing currencies convertible at least on current account.
20.            External Debt.  Even under optimistic scenarios, external debt will continue to be a
constraint on growth unless substantial debt restructuring is provided during the coming years. The
problem is created more by the debt structure than by the size of the debt. Almost $85 billion will fall
due over the next 5 years, while accumulated interest over that period could amount to another $35
billion. It is not realistic to expect that the Russian economy can generate such amounts of foreign
exchange during the transition, nor is it realistic to assume that the federal budget can generate sufficient
amounts of local resources to service all debt according to the present schedule. To encourage existing
creditors to provide longer term rescheduling and new creditors to disburse fresh funds, Russia must
demonstrate that it is doing its part to increase domestic savings through macroeconomic and structural
reforms. It is also important for Russia to regularize relations with its creditors in terms of transparency
and predictability of payments.
21.            Foreign Investment.   Russia's long-term  financing requirements to restructure its
economy are massive, going well beyond anything that is likely to be available from domestic resources
and official international financing sources. It is therefore urgent for the Government to adopt an
aggressive approach to mobilizing foreign direct investment in support of its restructuring program. The

Bank has supported this effort by providing a waiver of its negative pledge policy, allowing Russia to
provide additional security over a two-year period (subject to renewal) for Livestors in activities which
generate foreign exchange. Until now, however, the Government has not been sufficiently clear about
its foreign investment policy and practices to attract significant amounts of investmiient. Many of the most
important measures needed to attract foreign investment :re those that are likely to generate increased
domestic investment as well, including a sound macroeconomic environment, stable and moderate
taxation, and a functioning legal system to protect property rights and enforce commilercial transactions.
C. Development Objectives and Policies
22.           It is difficult to make any realistic projection of the outlook for economic reforms over
the next few years. Although the tone of political debate has moderated from the intense confronitation
evident during 1993, there continue to be deep divisions regarding the direction that the country should
take. While public opinion polls show that a large majority of people support the transition to a market
economy, many people are confused and frustrated by the apparent chaos and deepening hardships of the
past few years. The situation is highly fragile and susceptible to large swings in political priorities. The
Government's response to this environment has focused largely on crisis management. Having started
on the patih to a market economy, Russia faces few realistic alternatives to a continuation of this effort,
although it is likely that progress will continue to be marked by frequent and erratic shifts in policies.
23.           The previous CAS contained a broad overview of structural and sectoral reform issues
in Russia, including macroeconomic stabilization, the incentive regime, privatization and private sector
development, enterprise reform and restructuring, financial sector reform, the social safety net, and trade
and payments arrangements, as well as sectoral priorities for energy, agriculture, environment,
transportation and telecomrnunications, housing and urban services, training, education, and health. This
discussion remains largely valid, and the current CAS focuses in more detail on a set of issues that is
likely to dominate the next stage of the reform process, namely the relationship between macroeconomic
stabilization, enterprise reform, and strengthening of social assistance programs. The treatment of
sectoral reform issues is confined to the discussion of the Bank's assistance strategy in Section D.
The Outlook for Macroecononic Stabilization
24.           High inflation represents an implicit tax on the holders of nominal money balances.2
This fact has been particularly relevant in Russia, where there are few financial assets available (other
than foreign currency deposits) that hold their value in real terms during periods of high inflation, while
inefficiencies in the payment system keep the demand for nominal money balances artificially high. In
1992, inflation represented a tax on households on the order of 12 percent of GDP (this estimate does
not include the anomalous month of January 1992, when inflation largely wiped out the monetary
overhang from the previous year). The Government benefitted from this transfer of resources on the
order of 4 percent of GDP, while the remainder was shared largely by the banks and by enterprises,
many of which maintain a close connection with banking institutions. Even within these aggregate
resource flows, the incidence of losses and gains has been highly uneven, with higher income households
and larger enterprises generally better able to protect themselves through access to foreign currency
holdings and loans with negative interest rates, while lower income households and those living in
outlying regions bear a larger burden of the resource transfer. Thus, in addition to the fall in incomes
attributable to the collapse in trade and production within the FSU, high inflation has been a major

contributing factor to the deterioration in living standards and the growth of income inequality over the
past two years.
25.            Despite the liberalization of prices during the past two years, subsidies and transfers to
state enterprises remain very large, even without taking into account the remaining large implicit subsidies
on energy consumption. Some subsidies compensate enterprises for the subsidies they grant to others.
There are explicit subsidies for consumption (e.g., on public utilities, medicines), to protect specific
sectors or regions (e.g., agriculture and agro-processing, the Northern Territories), and to benefit specific
enterprises. Nearly all enterprises provide subsidized services to their workers, and many enterprises
provide services to the local administration. In most cases, the current subsidy programs are highly
inefficient; in the coal sector, for example, government subsidies exceed the wage bill. In the absence
of a credible social safety net, however, other than that provided by enterprises, most workers prefer to
maintain their employment, despite low wages and worsening conditions, rather than take their chances
in an under-developed labor market.
26.            Continued reliance on the inflation tax to maintain subsidies to enterprises is inherently
unstable. Households and enterprises, as well as the financial system, are learning ways to reduce their
money demand and thereby avoid losses on their money holdings, with the result that inflation will
become progressively less effective at transferring resources. The Government still has a number of
policy instruments available to avoid the onset of hyperinflation, but the effectiveness of these tools will
become increasingly eroded as high inflation continues. This process is already evident in the reduction
of tax revenues during the latter of 1993, which appears to be due in part to increased tax evasion. Thus,
the current macroeconomic framework as agreed with the IMF is inherently unstable unless the
Government continues to reduce the budget deficit and maintains tight monetary control. In order to do
this, the Government will have to come to grips with the financial problems of the state enterprises.
Improving the Performance of State-Owned Enterprises
27.            Privatization remains the Government's most effective tool for ridding itself of claims by
enterprises under its control.3 As the scope of privatization expands, the core of remaining state
enterprises should gradually shrink to those that are: (i) extraordinarily large, so that market mechanisms
suited for privatized enterprises cannot handle them at present; (ii) particularly poor performers, so that
the prospects for privatization are dismal at best; and (iii) in strategic sectors, such as public utilities and
natural monopolies. Many of these enterprises are already recipients of large financial transfers from the
government on a non-market basis, and most of them are inefficient and will need to be restructured, if
only in the process of closing them down.
28.            Concerns about sharp declines in production have led some to stress the need for the
Government to support active restructuring of selected state enterprises, especially the largest ones.
However, this task is almost impossible when the ownership structure for the enterprises is ambiguous,
the incentives they face are wrong, relative prices are distorted, and the macroeconomic environment is
highly unstable. The Government's role should therefore be to establish a framework that will force the
enterprises to restructure voluntarily, even if they remain under state ownership for the foreseeable future.
Except for public utility-type enterprises, where the Government will need to develop a public investment
program, financing for new investments by state enterprises should be left to the private sector and the
financial system. The Government's intervention snould be limited to:

Enterprise Reform in Russia: Next Steps.

*      Extending, rot limiting, privatizationt. Restructuring of state enterprises will be critically
impaired if privatization is excluded from the instruments (and discipline) available to
promote improvemiienits in performanlce. The Government should consider bringing into
the privatization peocess many of the enterprises currently excluded from its program.
O      Reinforcing fintancial disciplinte. In the short term, priority should be placed on making
the government's finanicing of state enterprises transparent and on a declining basis, and
to ensure that state finance carries with it more systematic financial discipline and
restructuring obligations. Given the Government's limited capacity, the initial focus
should be on enterprises which currently receive the largest subsidies.
*      Dow,nsizing and passive restructurinig.  Witlh a framework for financial discipline in
place, the Governmlient can then move to deal directly with the most troubled enterprises.
Many of themii will have excess capacity and will be burdened by over-staffing and
extensive social programs. The first step should therefore be to shrink them to smaller,
potentially more viable core activities, through: (i) downsizing excess capacity and labor;
(ii) divesting social assets and commercializing and spinning off selected services; (iii)
spinning off and privatizing viable sub-units, including productive assets; (iv) closing
down the worst loss makers; and (v) providing social assistance and retraining for
displaced workers.
*      Natural moniopolies and public utilities. The attention of the Government should focus
on: (i) policy reforms, especially with regard to pricing and cost recovery; (ii) divesting
competitive businesses from public service enterprises, including subsidiary functions
such as construction and equipment supply; (iii) breaking up large national monopolies
into smaller competing units; and (iv) separating policy and regulatory activities from
actual management and operations, and beginning to impose managerial accountability.
29.            There are a number of technical issues that will need to be addressed in developing this
program, such as the design of agencies to manage the Government's role, establishing effective oversight
relationships that do not interfere with managerial accountability, corporate governance at the enterprise
level, and the development of alternative financing mechanisms to channel resources to enterprises for
restructuring purposes. Substantial technical assistance from the Bank and other international agencies
would be useful in developing this program if the Govermnent is interested in moving forward. The
Governmtent may need to look for international assistance in financinig some of  the indirect costs
attributable to enterprise restructuring, such as transferring social obligations from enterprises to local
authorities.  Assistance may also be needed in helping to mobilize foreign direct investment for
restructuring operations, especially given the substantial risks (excluding commercial considerations)
related to such activities, as well as funding from international sources for the Government's public
investment program in utility and infrastructure enterprises until such time as they can access international
capital markets on their own.
Restructuring Social Programs and Services
30.            Inadequate attention to maintaining social services and improving the quality of human
capital could undermine public support for market reforms and damage the foundations for future
growth.4 Expenditures for social programs have fallen sharply in real terms as compared to their
4/     See Russia: Social Protection During Transition and Beyond, World Bank Report No. 11 748-RU, February 2, 1994.



- 9 -
previous levels, and the decentralization of most social expenditures to local governments has contributed
to growing regional disparities in the delivery of social programs.  Broad-based social protection
programs, such as pensions, unemployment benefits and child allowances, have not been indexed
adequately for inflation and have fallen well below minimum subsistence levels. At the same time,
because of poor targeting, only a minority of the poor are protected, while many households that receive
benefits do not need them. As a result, health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy have
been declining further from levels that already lagged OECD and Eastern Europe. Despite generally high
literacy rates, the workforce is over-specialized and requires new market-oriented skills. Both the health
and education sectors require significant restructuring to offset excessive investment in personnel at the
expense of facilities and supplies, such as essential drugs and textbooks. The deterioration of badly
needed social infrastructure is accelerating. Over one-third of schools lack heat and running water, while
one in seven hospitals require basic renovation.
31.           The challenge for the Government is to restructure social programs to improve services
and coverage while containing expenditures within a tight fiscal envelope. Several factors will impede
quick solutions. The easiest, cost-saving reforms to the system of social protection, such as flat rate
indexation of pensions, have already been implemented. Further measures, such as raising the retirement
age or restricting child allowances to larger families, are politically difficult and can only be phased in
over time. The Government agrees that a cash benefit of last resort is needed to fill gaps in the safety
net, but is unwilling to assume what it regards as a local financial responsibility. In fact, while major
reforms are needed at the federal level to improve the targeting of cash benefits, the implementation of
the safety net is largely a local responsibility. The Ministry of Finance's proposed Equalization Fund will
reduce but not close gaps that are already appearing at the regional level. These will be accentuated when
economic restructuring accelerates, particularly in the Employment Fund, which has no mechanism to
shift resources from deficit to surplus regions.
32.           In addition to fiscal constraints, rehabilitation of social infrastructure has been hampered
by the weak capacity of regional and local governments, which have little experience in the management
of public investment. In this situation, two steps will be crucial. One is replicable demonstration projects
at the local level to improve the cost-effectiveness and delivery of social programs. More problematic
will be to define a federal leadership role. Minimum standards for health, education and welfare services
should be set at the federal level and backed by financial incentives, such as conditional matching grants,
to be effective. In the absence of such incentives, inefficient subsidization of consumer goods and
services by enterprises and local governments is likely to continue as the backbone of the social protection
system.
D. Country Assistance Strategy for Russia
Objectives for Bank Assistance
33.           The priority objectives for the Bank's country assistance strategy are to:
*      Support the development of a market-oriented economy based on private sector
initiatives.
*      Encourage the redirection of public sector involvement in the economy toward the
establishment of open and competitive markets and the provision of physical, social,
legal, and institutional infrastructure not normally provided through the private sector.



- 10 -
0      Establish the Bank as a trusted and reliable development partner through the financing
of high priority public sector investments and policy advice on key economic and sectoral
issues.
34.           Achievement of these objectives must be measured in the context of the highly uncertain
policy and institutional environment surrounding the Bank's involvement. Steady progress in advancing
a range of macroeconomic and structural reforms is likely to be critical to determining the success of the
transformation process. Thus, although macroeconomic stabilization may take somewhat longer to be
achieved, steady progress in privatization, enterprise reform and development of the energy sector will
be essential in laying the basis for its eventual success. Support for social programs is necessary to assist
in enterprise restructuring and to support the growing role of regional and local governments in
providing such services. During the transition period, high priority must be given to preventing further
collapse of the infrastructure base and expanding the legal and institutionalframework for private sector
activities.
Lessons from Past Operations
35.           The Bank's program  must be based on a clear understanding of the institutional
constraints surrounding its involvement. Experience from the Bank's first year of operations in Russia
has highlighted the following issues:
3      "Ownership" of the Bank's program. Rapid economic reform and high turnover among
key officials over the past two years has produced an atmosphere of crisis management,
in which few senior officials have focused on the role of the Bank and what it can
provide. The fragmentation of decision-making as a result of political and administrative
reforms has affected the Bank's program through difficultios in reaching agreement on
lending priorities and delays in resolving a variety of systemic implementation problems.
*     Expectations for rapid change. There have been high expectations, both within Russia
and from the international community, that Bank projects would show rapid results,
despite the fact many of the basic institutional structures and commercial practices needed
to prepare and implement projects are not yet available in Russia.
*     High resource costs. In order to build up the lending program quickly and develop an
understanding of the situation in Russia, the initial operations have demonstrated very
high unit resource costs, on the order of twice the Bank-wide average for project
preparation and roughly three times the Bank-wide average for supervision.
36.           Based on these lessons, the following principles have been developed to guide the
preparation of the Bank's country assistance strategy for Russia:
*     Importance of the long-term  relationship.  The Bank must be seen as a reliable
development partner that stays conmnitted over the long run and is capable of delivering
on its promises. Project quality and sound policy advice are paramount considerations.
Bank projects should be viewed as delivering useful results, efficiently implemented, and
appropriate to the conditions in Russia. Given the fragmentation of decision-making, the
Bank will need to be guided much more by its own sense of what is important in Russia
and what will survive in the longer term.



- 11 -
0     A critical size lending program. As in other large countries, the Bank's influence will
depend on the size and quality of the portfolio. Given Russia's immense needs and
critical importance to international stability, the Bank needs to deliver a minimum
program of 7 or more projects annually to have a credible voice in the reform process.
To help achieve this objective, the Bank will identify a core of projects that are largely
unaffected by macroeconomic instability and do not require difficult policy conditionality,
mostly in infrastructure and social services.
*     However, resource transfer is of secondary importance. Project size should be geared
to local implementation capacity, which will take some time to develop. Over the long
term, the bulk of resources for restructuring the Russian economy will have to come
from domestic and foreign private investment. The Bank's contribution to the reform
process will be felt much more by introducing sound approaches to project preparation,
project implementation, policy reform and domestic resource mobilization. Bank projects
will not begin to produce tangible physical results before a year or two at best, but the
demonstration effects of good project preparation and implementation can begin much
earlier.
*     Overall, the pace of delivery of the lending program  should be linked to the
Government's progress on sectoral policy reforms. The Bank should inform the
Government up-front what policy benchmarks will need to be met in order to make a
project viable, and be prepared to delay project preparation or revise the project design
if these benchmarks are not met.
*     Project complexity is an important factor in the cost of Bank operatons.. High unit
costs for the initial Bank operations will begin to decline as the institutional structure for
project preparation and implementation becomes better developed. However, the Bank
is being asked to take lead responsibility for a variety of very complex operations (e.g.,
financial sector reform, enterprise restructuring, community sen ices, environmental
management). Normal cost containment measures will not be sufficient to offset the
demands of a growing portfolio, and greater selectivity in the type and complexity of
Bank operations will be essential.
Lending Volumes and Policy Conditions
37.          The economic and political environment is likely to remain highly volatile, and the Bank
will need to monitor its lending program and level of exposure on a regular basis. In this situation, it
is important to have a clear statement of the performance indicators that will be monitored in order to
adjust the volume of lending. The 1993 CAS contained a detailed table of trigger conditions for the
High, Intermediate, and Low Case lending programs, an updated version of which is attached as
Table 2.
38.          The FY93 CAS recommended that the Bank should go forward on the basis of a High
Case lending program of up to $3.5 billion in new commitments to be delivered during FY94. This
program was consistent with the accelerated program of assistance to Russia that was announced at the
meeting of the G7 Foreign and Finance Ministers in April, 1993. It was recognized, however, that the
ability of the Bank to deliver the High Case lending program was critically dependent on the performance
of the Government in implementing an ambitious reform program as outlined by the trigger conditions
in Table 2. In particular, this would include sustained progress in implementing a macroeconomic

stabilization program  supported by an upper level IMF credit tranche arrangement. as well as
demonstrated success in resolving key institutional and structural/sectoral policy issues.
39.           In the event, the basis for the Highi Case lending program  was quickly eroded.
Confrontation between the executive and legislative branches led to civil unrest in early October, followed
by the adoption of a new constitution and elections for a restructured State Dumna in mid-December.
While progress was made in imposing fiscal discipline and reducing inflation, there was a virtual halt in
decision making on longer term issues needed to complete the preparation of Bank projects. As a result,
project processing faced continual slippages, and the lending program for FY94 currently consists of 6
projects totalling roughly $1.5 billion, some of which are considered to be risky for delivery in this fiscal
year.
40.           As outlined in Table 2, the trigger conditions for the Intermediate Case lending program
assume a sporadic and more gradual approach to stabilization. Thus, the current high rates of inflation
and budgetary deficits would be expected to fall to sustainable levels over time, although there may be
periodic slippages. This would be consistent with a situation of intermittent arrangements with the IMF,
and where external arrears continue to accumulate, despite repeated debt rescheduling agreements. At
the same time, the Intermediate Case assumes continued progress in implementing key structural reforms
such as privatization, trade policies, financial sector development and the energy sector, which would be
essential to lay the basis for successful stabilization at a later date. In effect, the Intermediate Case
recognizes that while the current situation may not be sustainable over the medium term, it is essential
to continue to support the reform program as a transitional step toward an eventual sound macroeconomic
framework. In the event that such progress on stabilization and structural reform does not materialize,
Bank lending would have to be scaled back.
41.           Based on the criteria provided in Table 2, the Bank would operate under an Intermediate
Case lending program for the coming fiscal year, aiming at the delivery of 7 or more projects in the
range of $1-1.5 billion (not including adjustment lending). This program will consist of three distinct
elements. First of all, to the extent possible, the Bank will identify projects that would be relatively
immune to short-term changes in economic policies, which would form the "core" of the lending
program. These projects are likely to consist mainly of infrastructure and social sector type projects,
such as the Highways Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project approved by the Board in February 1993.
However, it should be recognized that there are no "easy" Bank operations in Russia; in virtually all
sectors, the Bank is involved in preparing its first operation, and the policy framework and
implementation arrangements will need to be tested.
42.           Apart from the core investment operations, a second set of projects would go forward
only if the Government is able to deliver on key sectoral policy reforms and resolve implementation
arrangements necessary to ensure the viability of such projects.  For example, the Second Oil
Rehabilitation Loan would go forward only if there is substantial progress in addressing issues of pricing,
taxation and the legal framework for foreign investment that are critical for the future development of
the sector. Similarly, operations that establish financial credit lines or support public utilities would be
jeopardized if price controls are imposed or real interest rates turn significantly negative. Thus, even
within the Intermediate Case program, there would be implicit triggers on a project-by-project basis that
would be used to determine the final outcome of the lending program. Table 3 summarizes the projects
currently included in the lending program for FY93-97 under the Intermediate Case lending program,
as well as key policy reforms and implementation issues that would be addressed as part of these
operations.

43.           Finally, it agreement is completed on a transitional stabilization program supported by
an IMF second tranche S1'F arrangemilenit the Bank would be prepared to augment the Intermediate Case
program with a Second Rehabilitation Loan focusing on key price and trade reforms, as well as selected
aspects of enterprise restructuring policies. Additional quick-disbursing operations would depend on the
Goveriunment's progress in implemiieniting sound structural reforms, as well as a financial stabilization
program supported by an IMF upper credit tranchie arrangemenit.
44.           A Low Case lendinig program would he triggered by a broad-based retreat from market
reforms and a collapse of stabilization efforts, probably as a result of a major political realignment. In
this situation, the Bank's program would conlsist of no more than 2-4 projects for $500 million or less,
consistinig of a few core infrastructure and/or social sector operations.
Sectoral Priorities
45.           Infrastruicture.  Thle first Bank operation in infrastructure for Russia, the Highways
Rehabilitation  anid Maintentance Project, was approved by the Board on February  17, 1994.
Infrastructure provides good opportunities for Bank lending under an Intermediate Case scenario, as the
policy issues tend to be reasonably well-defined and rates of return for rehabilitation and mainitelianice-
type projects are high and less sensitive to macroeconiomic conditions. At the same time, there are a
number of difficult implemilenitationi issues that will need to be resolved. The domestic construction
industry is highly concentrated and inefficient. Inflation has imp6sed severe financial difficulties on most
agencies involved in provision and mainiteniance of basic infrastructure. With a few exceptions (e.g., the
federal highway system), most infrastructure is the responsibility of regional and local government
institutions, so new on-lending relationshiips between the federal and regional levels must be created to
allow many projects to proceed.
7Tranisportation. Priorities for Bank operations are based on the shift in traffic demand
from rail to road transport as a result of economic reform, the deterioration of urban
transport systems resulting from finanicial stress on municipal authorities, and possibly
the need to address improvements in ports as a result of the break-up of the FSU. Bank
projects will emphasize rehabilitation and mainitenance, with limited new investment.
*      hlousing anid Municipal Services. The Government hias made major reforms in housing
policy, including privatization of muchi of the existing housing stock and constitutional
guarantees for private property rights. New housinig construction has been slow to take
off, hlowever, due to supply (e.g., serviced land, building materials, and lack of a proper
legal and regulatory framework) and demanid (e.g., housing finance, affordability)
considerations.  Developmenit of a modern housing sector based on private sector
participation will take a long tine to accomplish, and would need to be supported by a
series of Bank projects. Priorities for improvements in municipal services include district
heating systems and water and sewerage rehabilitation, as well as institutional
improvemiienits in muniicipal finance and revenue administration.
u      L'nvironmenttal Management. The first priority is to expand the capacity of federal and
local level agencies in environimilenta! management and administration, which the Bank
is coordinatinig with the assistance of a number of bilateral donors. Except for the most
urgent problems (e.g., urban water supplies), most environmental clean-up will need to
be addressed in the course of enterprise restructuring or postponed until sufficient
resources are available.  However, there are many investments, primarily involving

energy conserva,.ion, that have very attractive financial and economic returns as well as
environmental benefits, and the Bank can support these activities through both general
and targeted credit programs.
46.           Energy. Russia has abundant energy resources, which are critical for both near and long-
term economic prospects. The Government has already achieved major increases in the relative prices
for energy products.  Further development of Russia's energy resources will require substantial
investment, much of which will have to come from foreign and domestic private sources. Bank
involvement in the energy sector at an early stage can be of assistance in establishing a suitable policy
framework for future development by: (i) providing highly focused policy advice on pricing, taxation,
petroleum legislation and institutional reform; and (ii) financing high priority projects that would not
otherwise attract foreign investment or where Bank participation can assist in mobilizing substantial
additional resources. As macroeconomic conditions stabilize and the policy framework becomes better
established, Bank assistance would be gradually shifted toward investments where there is a clear
justification for public sector involvement.
*      Oil. The Bank's first Oil Rehabilitation Loan (approved by the Board on June 17, 1993)
has been successful in focusing attention on quick return investments for rehabilitation
of wells in existing fields. With the planned Second Oil Rehabilitation Loan, as well
as similar projects financed by other donors and private investors, the scope for further
rehabilitation-type investments will be largely exhausted.  In the present climate in
Russia, many potential investors are reluctant to make major long-term commitments for
development of new fields. The Bank is reviewing opportunities where its participation
could be critical in mobilizing foreign investment in the form of joint ventures. Other
project possibilities include pipeline de-bottlenecking to increase export capacity.
*      Gas. The Bank's initial involvement will focus on rehabilitation of gas distribution
systems in four major cities, and support for energy efficiency investments by end-users
in the affected service areas. The expected benefits are considerable, in excess of 40
percent in economic terms, although the financial viability of the project could be
jeopardized if further price reforms are delayed. The Government has been reluctant up
to now to request Bank assistance in expanding the gas export system, although this may
be a possibility in the future.
*      Power.  The Bank participated with G7 donors and other international agencies in
examining the investment requirements for the power sector under various assumptions
about the future operation of nuclear power reactors in Russia. Up to now, there has not
been an agreement on investment priorities that would allow Bank projects to proceed.
If such an agreement is forthcoming, the Bank's initial project would likely focus on the
rehabilitation of combined heat and power plants in western Russia, as well as design and
implementation of an improved regulatory framework.
*      Coal. Subsidies to the coal industry currently amount to almost 2 percent of GDP, a
large part of which is needed to maintain production in a number of high-cost obsolete
mines. The Bank has been assisting the Government to prepare a restructuring plan for
the coal industry. There may be a role for Bank assistance in addressing the social
externalities associated with downsizing/closure, provided the Government is prepared
to move forward with a comprehensive program for restructuring the industry.

47.            Social lInfrastructure.  The receiet elections have increased attentioln on the nced to
strengthen social progranms as an integral part of enterprise ieformii and to prevent fiscal restraint from
leading to lonig-termii deteriorationi in essenitial social services. The Bank has made a major investment
in helping the Government to understand the linkages hetween economic reform and its impact on various
social programs, as well as developing  options and priorities for restructuring social programs. The
Bank's first operation, the Employmetnt Services antd Social Protectiont Project (approved by the Board
on November 24. 1992), has experieniced a numiiber ot' problems in getting started, and is in the process
of being restructured to fit current needs. The Government has not been receptive to Bank advice for
the reform  of national-level social benefit programiis due to concern  about increased financial
coimnitments. Ilowever, the Bank is currently involved in developing a program for communiity-level
social support in areas severely affected by enterprise reform, wilichi could provide the framework for
expanded assistance from institutionls and donors concerned witlh supporting social programs in Russia.
∞      Community services. This programii would provide support for strengtheniing local health
and education services, addressing critical local infrastructure needs, and managing the
divestiture of social assets in support of privatization and enterprise restructuring.
e      hlealth. The Bank is currently developing a project to improve the cost-effectiveness of
health services and quality enhanicement of medical education. The Bank is also prepared
to assist in the development of a national drug policy and improvements in clinical drug
procedures.
X      Educatio,z and traintinig. The Bank is currently completing the preparation of a project
to expand training programs in market-oriented skills (accounting, finance, management).
A study is being carried out in collaboration with the Government which would lay the
lasis for possible Bank participation in the reform of higher level and vocational and
technical education.
48.           Plrivate Enterprise Developmenit.  The Bank's strategy with respect to the support of
private enterprise includes the following elements: (i) continued support for the Government's program
of mass privatization for small and mediumii-size enterprises: (ii) development of the commercial banking
system to provide loan funds to privatized enterprises on the basis of sound financial criteria; (iii) working
with regional venture funds and regional technical assistance centers to assist privatized enterprises in
preparing business development plans and, in selected cases, obtaining equity financing to carry out
restructuring programs, (iv) advice to the Governmlent in strengthening corporate governance structures,
both for privatized enterprises and those that are likely to remain state-owned for the foreseeable future
(e.g., public utilities): and (v) restructuring of state enterprises through shedding of excess labor,
divestiture of social obligations as a prelude to eventual privatization and downsizing/closure if warranted.
*      Financial sector development.   Planned  Bank operations include the Financial
Institutions Developmenit Project (FIDP), Export Development and Finance Project, and
the Payments anid Settlement Project. Commercial banks which have been identified for
assistance under the FIDP, as well as other banks that meet the criteria establislhed under
this operation or whiichi may be subsequently added to the list, would form the core of
banks involved in channiieling loan funds to privatized enterprises, as well as other
operations aimed at strengtheniing the finanicial sector, such as the provision of pre-
shipmiient finanicinig to Russian exporters. The Bank has also been working with the
Central Bank and other donors to develop a computerized system for improving the
payments and settlement system, which is critical for the efficient operation of a market
economly.



- 19 -
*      Private enterprise developmenit. Thle Bank's first operatioin in this area, the Privatization
Implementation Assistance Project (approved by the Board on December 17, 1992)
becamiie effective in December 1993 and is being restructured to address the needs of
recently-privatized enterprises as well. The Private Enterprise Sujpport Project, which
is considered to be a companioni operation to the FIDP, is expected to be presented to
the Board before the end of FY94. Dependinig on the rate of disbursement for the loan
funds to be provided through this operation, the Bank would be prepared to go ahead
quickly with follow-up operations if needed.
*      Other possible operations. In the event that a limited amount of adjustment lending is
required to support a stabilization programii assisted by an IMF upper tranclhe
arrangement, the Bank would be prepared to develop an operation focusing on the
problems of state-owned enterprises. As presently conceived, this effort would help
create institutions and procedures to facilitate the shedding of social obligations from
enterprises that could ultimately be privatized, as well as downsizing/closure for
enterprises deemed bankrupt. A regulatory framework and public investment program
may be developed for those enterprises which would normally remain in the public sector
(e.g., public utilities).
49.           Agriculture. The current policy environment for agriculture would not justify major Bank
operations.  In this situation, Bank lending should be limited to a core program  in support of the
evolution of market-based institutions, particularly land reform and farm privatization and restructuring,
as well as assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture in developing market infrastructure, farmer
information services and a viable private sector seed industry. Consideration would also be given to
working with regional authorities that are supportive of agricultural reform and are willing to move
forward with privatization and restructuring of state and collective farms.
50.           Technical Assistance. Now that the initial phase of economic liberalization has been
largely completed, one of the most valuable forms of external assistance would be technical advice and
support to develop the institutions needed to operate a market economy. However, the Government has
been reluctant to borrow from the Bank for technical assistance except for activities clearly related to
project implementation, preferring to rely on grant financing from bilateral sources if possible. At the
same time, given the difficulties of operating in Russia, bilateral donors have relied increasingly on the
Bank to develop the overall framework for coordinating advice and technical assistance in particular areas
(e.g., enterprise restructuring, environmental management, health, community services). These are
important initiatives which the Bank will continue to support, despite the heavy demands on Bank
resources for preparation, supervision and donor coordination activities.  However, further Bank
involvement in technical assistance will be on a carefully selected basis where the Bank has a clear
comparative advantage in a coordinating role, such as public revenue and expenditure management reform
(including inter-governmental fiscal relations), legal reform, and project preparation and management.
Sectoral Composition of the Lending Program
51.            Figure I shows the sectoral composition of the Intermediate Case lending program for
the FY93-97 period.5 Due to greater absorptive capacity, the energy sector would account for 39 percent
of Bank lending to Russia during this period, followed by infrastructure with 23 percent. Due to their
importance, both social infrastructure and enterprise restructuring would play an important part in the
5/     Excluding adjustment lending (including Rehabilitation Loans) and free-standing technical assistance.



- 20-
Bank's lending program, accounting for 18 percent and 25 percent respectively by number of projects,
but accounting for only 29 percent of the total volume of lending because of their high risk and difficult
implementation requirements. Agriculture would account for 9 percent of Bank lending (15 percent by
number of projects) unless the policy environment in this sector improved significantly.

Economic and Sector Work
52.           The initial round of large sector studies financed under the Technical Cooperation
Program is over. These studies have provided a broad bu. rudimentary understanding of the economy.
More selective and in-depth work on institutional and policy issues is crucial to successful project
development and continued dialogue on reform issues.  In order to increase the effectiveness of our
advice for key policy-makers, greater emphasis will be placed on producing quick-response notes for
Government, particularly on issues relating to enterprise reform and its links to stabilization prospects.
Attention will also be given to addressing systemic issues encountered in our lending operations. Because
most Bank operations represent the first involvement in a particular sector, there is necessarily a large
component of ESW included in project preparation, although it is not recorded as such. There will be
continuing demands from a variety of sources (e.g., the Board, external donors) for short strategy notes
and updating memoranda, as well as occasional economic reports on the status of reforms and
institutionally-mandated topics (e.g., environment). In this context, most ESW will be expected to result
in informal notes and memoranda, rather than formal reports intended for broader circulation.
Portfolio Management Performance
53.           As of April 4, 1994, cumulative Bank disbursements to Russia totaled $500 million,
almost all from the Rehabilitation Loan ($600 million). Regarding other loans recently approved by the
Board, the Oil Rehabilitation Loan ($610 million) was declared effective on November 15, 1993, and
over $275 million in contracts are expected to be awarded by the end of FY94. The Privatization
Implementation Assistance Project ($90 million) was declared effective on December 7, 1993, while the
Employment Services and Social Protection Project ($70 million) and the Highways Rehabilitation and
Maintenance Project ($300 million) have not yet been declared effective.



- 21 -
54.           Systemic Implementation Issues. As the size of the Bank's portfoliol has ilcreased, a
number of systemic issues have been identified that affect implemenitationi perforimalnce:
*     Approval procedures for Batik loans. Governmenit approval procedures for Bank loans
have been time-consuming and cumbersome, as demonstrated by the extended delays In
effectiveness for the Privatization and Employmenit Services projects. With the approval
of the new constitution, it no longer appears that Banlk projects must be approved
individually by the Parliament, althouglh the Parliament must approve an overall limit on
foreign borrowing that could be a source of delays.
*      Coordinatioti arrangements witli thie Government. Coordinatioll arrangemzenits at the
working level in the Ministry of Finance and other agencies have improved as both sides
gained  experience  with  implementinig  Bank  projects.   However, coordination
arrangements are still largely ad-hoc, and the responsible units are seriously understaffed
relative to the responsibilities involved.  Coordination between central and sectoral
ministries, as well as information flows to senior governmient officials regarding Bank
projects, also need to be improved. The Bank has been broadening its contacts in order
to improve understanding of the Bank's program and its objectives.
*      Cost recovery for Bank operations.  The Ministry of Finanice has emphasized cost
recovery as a major consideration for Bank projects because of concerns about debt
servicing capacity at a later date. While this objective is appropriate for many projects,
it has raised questions about Bank lending for public sector activities, suchi as the social
sectors, where full cost recovery may not be feasible or desirable at the present time.
The Bank has emphasized the need to look at economic as well as financial returns in
evaluating projects, and this issue will continue to be addressed within the context of
project preparation on a case-by-case basis.
*      Regional on-lending arrangements. Many Bank projects, particularly in infrastructure,
social services, and agriculture, will rely on implementing agencies at the regional and
local levels. The Government has no arrangements for passing Bank funds to regional
and local authorities, including the terms and conditions on which this would be done.
The Bank recently completed a paper summarizing the Bank's experience with on-lending
arrangements in other countries and suggesting options as to how this matter can be
handled in Russia.
a      Status of Project Implementation Units. There has been considerable uncertainty about
procedures and legal arrangements for Project Implementation Units (PlUs) established
to implement Bank projects. The Bank has recently completed an analysis of the legal
requirements for PIUs, which is expected to be reviewed with the Russian authorities
shortly.
*      On-lending to the private sector. Russia does not have an apex system of financial
institutions that can be used to channel Bank funds to commercial lending institutions for
on-lending to the private sector. Under the Private Enterprise Support Project, this
function would be provided by a PIU established for this purpose, but this is recognized
to be a temporary solution that should be superseded by a more permanent apex
arrangement at a later date.



- 22 -
*      Debt reporting.  The Governmllenit lhas hiad problems in mleeting its debt reportilg
obligations to the 13ank. The Bank has agreed to moodify its requiremiienits on a temporary
basis (for example, informiiationi on suppliers' credits will not be required for the time
being) to allow time for the Governmllenlt to improve its debt reporting capacity. and an
IDF grant has been provided to assist in this process.
55.           Portfolio Management Objectives.   Given the impor tance of effective project
implementation, the Bank has set specific objectives for improvinig portfolio managemilenit over the coming
year:
*      Procurement. There is very little expericnce with com7petitive bidding procedures in
Russia. All PlUs responsible tor implemiienitinig Bank projects have been provided witl
foreign advisers to oversee the procurement process, generally in association with local
consulting firmis to disseminiate knowledge of Bank procurement practices. The Bank is
in the process of introducing standard bidding documents for all projects.  The
Governrment has requested Bank assistance in revising public procurement legislation and
familiarizing Russian suppliers with opportunities and procedures for bidding on Bank-
financed contracts in other countries. A Country Procurement Strategy note is being
prepared to provide a framework for strengthening training in procurement management
and procedures.
3      Accounting anid auditing. The Bank has recently carried out a review of the accounting
and auditing profession in Russia, whichi determined that local accounting standards and
practices are not suitable for Bank projects. However, there are a number of capable
Russian accounting firms emerging, and several have been pre-qualified by the Bank to
prepare project-level accounts and carry out project audits for relatively simple projects.
For more complex accounting and auditing tasks, such as preparation of entity-level
accounts, the Bank will rely on the services of international accounting firms resident in
Moscow.
z      Disbursements.  The Bank has hired a local staff member for the Moscow Resident
Mission to oversee disbursements. Guidelines have been prepared for Task Managers
regarding the selection of banks to manage Special Accounts, and a number of local
banks have been pre-qualified for this purpose.
*      Country Portfolio Performance Review  (CPPR).  The Bank has agreed with the
Government to hold the first CPPR in Moscow before the end of FY94.
*      Project launch and mid-term review. All projects are expected to have a Project Launch
workshop following Board approval, and a mid-term review during implementation to
make mid-course corrections in project design and implementation arrangements.
*      Information dissemination. The Bank has arranged for all standard documents relating
to project implementation (Disbursement Handbook, procurement guidelines, etc.) to be
translated into Russian and distributed during project preparation. The EDI is providing
training in project management and project appraisal, which will provide a reservoir of
project managers in the future.



- 23 -
Creditworthiness and IBRD Exposure
56.           Creditworthintess.  An important objective of the Bank's assistance strategy over the
longer term will be to help Russia regain access to international capital markets and facilitate inflows of
private foreign investmenlt. Restoring full creditworthiness will take some years, however. In the near
term, it is essential for Russia to address the root causes of continuing large-scale capital flight, which
will require sustained implemiientation of sound macroeconomic and structural reform policies. This
would also provide the basis for annual debt rescheduling agreements, that should, over the longer term,
lead to a more permanent solution for Russia's debt servicing difficulties. Emphasis must be placed on
the development of the energy sector, which provides the best opportunity for expanding export earnings
over the medium term. Sound macroeconiomiiic policies should also lead to more efficient use of imports,
although the overall level of import demand will need to increase over time. Given Russia's ample
endowment of natural resources and the quality of its labor force, successful implementation of sound
macroeconomic policies should restore some degree of creditworthiness for commercial borrowing in the
medium to longer term. Subject to risks to be discussed below, Russia is considered creditworthy for
Bank lending in the amounits expected over the next several years, although its continued creditworthiness
for Bank borrowing will be kept under regular review.
57.          IBRD Exposure. The Bank's current exposure to Russia represents roughly 0.5 percent
of the total portfolio, increasing to less than 2 percent of the portfolio by the end of FY95 and 4 percent
by the end of FY97 under the Intermediate Case lending program. This rate of increase in the Bank's
exposure will be justifiable only if the Government continues to make progress in stabilizing the
economy, even if on a more gradual trend. In the event that macroeconomic performance remains
erratic, as measured by a sustained period without an upper level IMF credit tranche in place, the Bank
would consider scaling back the lending program toward the lower end of the Intermediate Case range
or dropping to a Low Case lending program if macroeconomic deterioration becomes extreme. The Bank
will continue to monitor its exposure on a regular basis and review its conclusions with the Board as part
of the annual CAS process.
Cooperation with Other Bank Group and Multilateral Agencies
58.           Role of IFC. IFC has combined active support of Russia's privatization program with
the development of an investment pipeline and model systems of sale that could be replicated throughout
Russia. IFC assisted in designing and implementing Russia's first small-scale privatization program. The
first small business auction took place in April 1992 in Nizhny Novgorod. IFC has also assisted
Volgograd, Tomsk, and 26 other regions of Russia in implementing small-scale privatization, and
prepared and distributed manuals on small-scale privatization to city officials throughout Russia.
59.           IFC assisted the Federal Privatization Agency with organizing the "first wave" of voucher
auctions in the Russian oblasts of Volgograd. Nizhny Novgorod, Tomsk, Novosibirsk, and Yakut-Sakha.
To date, almost over 600 medium- and large-scale enterprises eligible for privatization have been
privatized in the regions where IFC has worked. In addition, lFC has been working on the development
of capital markets in Nizhny Novgorod and elsewhere. IFC also assisted in designing and implementing
a model de-monopolization and privatization of trucking transport, first implemented in the Nizhny
Novgorod oblast. IFC also assisted Tomsk and Vladimir oblasts in privatizing their trucking transport
sectors, and prepared and distributed manuals on trucking privatization to oblast officials throughout
Russia. As of December 1993, 70 percent of oblasts have implemented some or all aspects of the Nizhny
Novgorod trucking privatization plan.



- 24 -
60.           The most recent privatization project involves assisting the Nizhny Novgorod oblast in
designing and imiplementinig a collective farm privatization program. The first farm was privati7. d in
November 1993, and two other farms have been privatized since then. On March 10, 1994, Prime
Minister Chlerniomiyrdini publicly endorsed the Nizhny Novgorod system of land privatization as a model
for all of Russia. IFC is currently assisting the Russian Government in drafting regulations that would
frame the pilot schemiie as a nationial land privatization scheme.
61.           The initial IFC investments seek to support joint venture projects with a foreign
investment component. Given the uncertain political and economic environment in Russia, IFC views
strong local sponsor support as critical. In addition to foreign exchange generating projects (e.g., oil,
gas. minerals, hotels) IFC will also pursue infrastructure (e.g., telecommunications, ports) and
manufacturing investmenits, where the development impact is expected to be substantial. IFC has already
invested $94 millioni in four transactions, two in the oil and gas sector and two in the financial sector.
IFC is actively pursuing investment in small and medium businesses through participation in agency/credit
lines with local financial intermediaries. IFC will also support the growth of small businesses through
the creation of financial vehicles, such as capital funds and country funds, which will invest in the equity
of emerging businesses in the Russian private sector.
62.           Role of MIGA anid FIAS.  MIGA has concluded a standard agreement with the
Government to facilitate the approval of MIGA guarantees for Russia; however, the Government has not
yet concluded a use of Local Currency Agreement or a Legal Protection Agreement with MIGA, both
of which are crucial to making MIGA's guarantee program fully operational. MIGA issued its first
guarantee in Russia in June 1993, a $9.9 million guarantee agreement against war and civil disturbance.
A proposal to insure an investment in a communiuial property development project was sent to the Board
in March 1994.  In addition MIGA  is currently processing several projects in Russia in the
maniufacturinig, telecommunications, and oil and gas sectors.  A pipeline of over 80 preliminary
applications from investors was available as of February 28, 1993, representing potential investments of
over $2.5 billion. Given the high degree of political uncertainty, MIGA's political risk insurance can
play a catalytic role in promoting foreign investment in Russia.  MIGA is also exploring possible
cooperation witlh the private insurance market.
63.           FIAS has continued to work witlh the Russian Agency for International Cooperation and
Development (RAICD), assisting it in developing its role and functions as they relate to foreign direct
investmenit.  Based on the diagnostic study of the environment for foreign investment that it had
conducted the year before, FIAS helped RAICD identify policy and program priorities, and develop a
proposal for technical assistance to implemenit thenm. FIAS held a workshop for representatives of
RAICD  and the former Supreme Soviet to review  draft proposed amendments to the Foreign
Investment Law.
64.           Cooperation with thle IMF. The Bank has worked closely with the IMF on issues relating
to the role of structural reforms in the stabilization process, and in particular, on price and trade policies.
In additioni, there has been cooperation in the design of social net programs (where the IMF has been
particularly interested in the possible fiscal implications of various approaches) and assistance to the
Central Bank in improvinig the financial payments and settlement system. The Bank has offered to
finance projects to implement major parts of the institutional reform program developed with the IMF
such as the Financial Inistitutions Develcptnent Project, and it is exploring the design of a b.-;ader fiscal
management operation. including further work on tax administration and the budget process.



- 25 -
65.           Cooperation with Other Multilateral and Bilateral Institutions. The Bank has worked
closely with EBRD in a number of areas. EBRD has co-financed two of the Bank's first four operations
(the Oil Rehabilitation Loan and the Privatization Implementation Assistance Project) and is planning
to cofinance the Financial Institutions Development Project and the Private Enterprise Support Project.
Bank/EC collaboration has strengthened and expanded, including in enterprise restructuring and social
protection issues. The Bank is also collaborating closely with a number of bilateral agencies in providing
support in areas such as privatization, energy, financial sector development, housing, fiscal reform, and
environmental management. Several bilateral agencies, including USAID and the Japanese PHRD, are
making an important contribution to the Bank's project preparation activities in such areas as health,
housing, human resources, and fiiancial sector reform. Cooperation with export credit agencies has been
mainly in the context of their proposed role in the Private Enterprise Support Project, as well as the
Bank's recent waiver of its negative pledge provision.
E. Agenda for Board Consideration
66.           Risks. The Bank's involvement in Russia is subject to unusually high risks. Primary
among these are the political risks associated with a high degree of polarization about the direction of
reforms, deep-seated resentment and anxiety within the population about the apparent lack of political
direction, and dismay about the continued decay of fundamental institutions and social services. It is
difficult to predict what the outcome of this situation will be, and Russia is likely to endure many abrupt
changes and crises in its transition to a market economy. An additional factor is the strong international
interest in the outcome of the reform program, which both sustains a high level of support (as
demonstrated by the generous terms offered by the Paris Club) and generates an unusual degree of
attention on the Bank (and other institutions) to respond quickly and effectively to Russia's needs. It is
also important to keep in mind the truly massive scale of the transformation process ongoing in Russia,
and the limited capacity of Government institutions to manage this process and the lack of familiarity with
market institutions.
67.           The ability of the Government to maintain the stabilization process is subject to substantial
risks. Primary among these will be the likelihood of continuingfiscal stress, particularly due to falling
tax revenues as a result of tax evasion and the vulnerability of existing tax instruments (i.e., the profits
tax on enterprises) to lower inflation. Russia's ability to increase exports will be critically dependent in
the near term on reductions in domestic energy consumption, and the value received for increased exports
will be vulnerable to potential reductions in world oil prices. A continuation of large scale capitalflight
such as occurred in 1992 and 1993 can undermine the external financing of the adjustment process, as
demonstrated by the contraction of imports during 1993 due in part to a reduction in net external inflows.
In order to address these risks, Russia will have to maintain a strong stabilization program and continue
to implement structural reforms to liberalize the economy and address the problems of state enterprises.
As emphasized in the current CAS, the current macroeconomic framework represents only a transitional
step toward continued reforms, rather than providing a sustainable program in its own right.
68.           In this situation, the Bank's response must be sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing
conditions as they arise. While the country assistance strategy should be grounded in a clear appreciation
of Russia's long term structural needs, the execution of this strategy must be sufficiently robust to adapt
to frequent shifts in the macroeconomic environment and continuing problems in implementation. The
discussion in this CAS has focused on the Bank's program in the course of the coming fiscal year. This
emphasis on the short term response is appropriate in the current environment, and the Bank's strategy
will need to be updated annually and reviewed with the Board as conditions in Russia evolve.



- 26 -
69.           Agenda for Discussion. The members of the Board may wish to address the following
topics in the course of their discussion:
*      Are the trigger conditions described in Table 2 for the High, Intermediate, and Low
Case lending programs adequate to measure performance?
*      Is the Bank's focus on the Intermediate Case lending program appropriate in the light of
the current situation in Russia?
*      Does the Board agree with the Bank's strategy of developing a range of projects under
the Intermediate Case scenario, including a core of relatively straight-forward operations
in infrastructure and the social sectors, a further set of operations that would be
conditional on specific macroeconomiiic and sectoral policy reforms, and the possibility
of a feew quick-disbursing operations if a sound macroeconomic stabilization program is
in place?
In viev. of the difficult implementation conditions in Russia, is the Bank's strategy to
strengthen implementation capacity adequate?

PART 11. THE PROJECT
A. Sectoral Context and Bank Strategy
70.           Enterprise Sector. Russia has embarked on an extensive transformation of its economy.
Cenitral to the progress achieved to date is the privatization of Russian enterprises and the rapid building
up of a market-oriented banking sector. Already more than two thirds of all small-scale enterprises have
been privatized by the Russian Government. The pace of the Mass Privatization Program continues to
accelerate and as many as 10,000 medium and large enterprises, including a few of the largest enterprises
(10,000 employees or more), had been privatized by the end of 1993.
71.           Providing scarce financial resources for restructuring these medium and large enterprises
is one of the challenges faced by the Government. There is also a related but broader objective of
strengthening the capacity of the financial system to efficiently mobilize financial resources in Russia and
make sound loans to the productive sector for a variety of purposes. New banks have proliferated in
Russia and their number has grown from less than 100 in 1988 to almost 2,000 in 1993. Over the
short/medium-term, commercial banks are likely to remain the main channel for resource flows from
savers to net users and the main outside control on private enterprises. Corporate governance through
capital market institutions will probably continue to be weak until controlling stakes can be acquired by
outside investors. Until then the banks, many of which have significant equity holdings, will remain the
main external control over enterprise management.  Banks' credit decisions (including for working
capital) will crucially affect the speed and direction of restructuring of enterprises.
72.           Financial Sector Regulatory Infrastructure.  The legal framework of the former
centrally-planned economy, still partly in place, emphasized administrative rather than contractual
relationships, imposed constraints on ownership, and treated the banking system as a component of the
planned economy. The Law on Banks and Banking Activity and the Central Banking Act, promulgated
in 1990, are major steps forward, inasmuch as they create a basis for the development of a two-tier
banking system. As part of this reform, the Central Bank of Russia is vested with the responsibility of
bank supervision and regulation. The CBR is entitled to issue and revoke bank licenses, as well as rules
and regulations pertaining to the major prudential matters, namely capital adequacy, liquidity, risk
concentration, and exchange rate risks. The law provides for the CBR to define accounting procedures
and reporting standards; to exercise off-site supervision; and to apply sanctions when a bank fails to
comply with the regulations, or when its financial situation represents a threat to the interest of bank
depositors and creditors.
73.           Licensing of a bank is a fairly routine process and is, at the moment, actually easier than
establishing a branch of an existing bank. There are few limits on the scope of activities that banks can
undertake, and portfolio diversification requirements and limits on connected lending remain very liberal.
Minimum capital requirements have been quite low, largely a reflection of the high inflation and the lack
of indexation of capital requirements. Enforcement of the banking laws has been weak: in view of the
potential risk of insolvencies and fraud in the banking system, the CBR must embark on a full-fledged
program for developing its regulatory and supervisory capabilities.
74.           Accounting and Auditing. The first step towards the reform of accounting was the
adoption in December of 1991, of a new accounting chart for commercial enterprises. Little progress
has been made, however, since the adoption of this chart. A new impetus should be given to this reform,
under the auspices of the MoF, so as to elicit a prompt modernization of enterprise accounting, which
will be an essential element in monitoring enterprise performance and viability in a competitive
environment.



- 28 -
75.           Financial institutions require, however, accounting principles and systems, which, while
in line with the main orientations of a general accounting chart, also capture the particular aspects of their
activities. With Bank and EU's support, the CBR has been very active at introducing new accounting
principles for banks which are in line with international practices in terms of principles and of
presentation.
76.           Commercial Banks. Among the vast number of new banks in Russia, there may be up
to 100 leading commercial banks that are evolving into real banking institutions. They are working on
strengthening their balance sheets and their banking skills, and some of them are also trying to reduce
their single borrower and connected party exposure.  While their number and the volume of their
operations is still relatively small, they are growing fast and are involved in profitable and genuine
banking activities: lending to the emerging private sector, lending for foreign trade and raising foreign
currency deposits. Another issue in the development of commercial banks is the current restraint to
liberalizing the regime for foreign banking presence. It is clear that limiting this involvement is a serious
impediment to the overall development of the system, and, among other things, will slow down the rapid
transfer of banking know-how.
77.           While the banks have some of the best financial and business talent available in Russia,
they have still to grow into mature financial institutions through improvements in management and
organization and training of a large number of staff to acquire modern market-based banking skills. Most
banks also lack clearly articulated business plans and their technology is at an early stage of development.
The recommended strategy for commercial banks is a gradual approach to banking reform, whereby
banks will be encouraged to improve their standards and submit to stricter supervision by the CBR. This
strategy should lead to a continuous increase in the number of "better" banks, and in their market share.
There is also the need for supporting the further development of the CBR into a strong central bank
responsible for designing and implementing sound monetary policies and eliciting financial discipline and
sound practices in the banking sector.
B. Project Objectives and Description
78.           The ultimate objective of the project is to improve the quality of banking services,
promote banking stability and contribute to a more efficient allocation of bank credit. The immediate
goal is to build up the capacity of a core group of 30-40 private commercial banks which will: (i) set
higher banking standards and create a dynamic for improving the quality of banking activities in Russia;
(ii) provide the basis for a private clearing system operating at the federal level; and (iii) qualify as on-
lenders of Bank and other international lines of credit.
79.           The project consists of four components: (i) a commercial banking component, consisting
of institutional strengthening programs and systems modernization programs; (ii) a bank supervision
component, consisting of the development of on-site and off-site supervisory capabilities and legal
assistance for the CBR; (iii) a bank accounting component, which will focus on the modernization of
accounting and auditing standards and practices; and (iv) a PIU component which will contribute to the
establishment and early stages of operation of the PIU.
80.           The commercial banking component (95 percent of total project cost) is central to the
program, and involves the provision of technical assistance and equipment to private commercial banks
to strengthen their operations. The support provided could take a variety of forms, with a particular
emphasis on promoting tnvinning arrangements with reputable foreign banks. The component would
support a three-pronged program consisting of: (i) a program for strengthening bank operations; (ii) a



- 29 -
program for systems modernization; and (iii) measures aimed at enhancing the financial soundness of
banks. The program of institutional strengthening would focus oni the preparation of a strategy and
business plan for each participating bank (PB) witlh particular attention to credit and risk assessment, loan
portfolio management, budgeting and internal control. Systems modernization programs, consistent with
the objectives of banks' developmenit strategies and business plans, would include technical assistance,
hardware, software and related services. In order to qualify, PBs would be required to meet prudential
standards pertaining to their capitalization, lending and resource mobilization practices and financial
reporting. This would be complemented by yearly audits carried out according to internationial standards.
After initial screening of the 2,000 Russian banks, 45 were selected for diagnostic review and an initial
group of 20 are now being reviewed in detail by international auditing firms to determine their eligibility
to participate in the project. Others will be included as the project advances.
81.           The bank supervisiont component consists of technical assistance to be provided to the
CBR in the following areas:  (i) training of on-site bank inspectors; (ii) preparation of the major
documents relating to on-site inspection, including a bank inspection manual and a bank inspection report
form; and (iii) assistance in the development of off-site surveillance including in the design of an early
warning system to detect problem banks at an early stage, Provision for assistance in designing an off-
site surveillance system designed to detect problem banks at an early stage has also been made under the
project.
82.           The accounting and auditing componenit would provide support to the MoF and to the
CBR for continuing the on-going reform of accounting in Russia, with a view to bringing accounting and
auditing in Russia more in line with international practice. The subcomponent would include the
provision of technical assistance and training to: (i) MoF to support the reform of enterprise accounting;
(ii) the CBR to support the reform of bank accounting; and (iii) support the establishment of a working
group on auditing issues within the MoF and the development of the auditing profession. Assistance to
the reform of enterprise accounting will include the introduction of internationally accepted accounting
standards for enterprises, the development and introduction of a new chart of accounts and of reporting
formats for enterprises, and the provision of advisory services and training. The bank accounting
subcomponent includes the implementation of the Broadly Adapted Financial Statements (BAFS), and the
finalization and implementation of the new chart of accounts for banks. In addition, study tours and
secondments will be included in the proposed project. Support will also be provided to the existing
International Advisory Boards, which will continue to ensure the coordination and supervision of the
accounting and auditing reform.
83.           The PIU component would provide financing for the provision of technical assistance for
the operations of the PIU to support:  (i) the establishment, maintenance and updating of project
accounting, procurement, and reporting systems; (ii) the initial stages of its operations; and (iii) training
of staff.
84.           The total cost of the project of US $389 million would be co-financed with the EBRD,
which will provide a loan of US$99 million, and other donors. A portion of the EBRD loan proceeds
(US$95.0 million) will contribute to the financing of the commercial banking component. A European
Union (EU) grant in an amount of US$34.0 million ecquivalent will also finance this component.
Contributions from the Japanese Government (US$18.6 million) and a number of bilateral donors
(US$11.4 million) will complete the financing of this component. In addition, USAID will contribute
US$3.4 million to the financing of the bank supervision and regulation component, and the EU will
contribute US$2.0 million to the financing of the accounting and auditing component. Finally, a number
of bilateral donors will contribute US$4.0 million to the cost of project implementation while the EBRD,



- 3() -
the World Bank, andl the MoF will cover the balance. Detailed costs and financinig plan are shown in
Annex B]. Amounits and metlhods of procuremiienit and disbursements are shown in Annex B2. A
timetable of key project processing events is given in Annex B3.
85.          The Bank loan and EBRD loan will he made to the Government, whichl will on-lend them
to participating commilercial banks in US dollars at an interest rate equivalent to a base rate of the
weighted average of the six-monltlh UJS dollar LIBOR plus I percent (one-third) and the World Bank
Variable Lending Rate (VLR) (two-thirds) as adjusted semi-annually, plus 2.5 percent, rounded up to the
nearest 0.5 percent interval. The Governmllenit will bear the cross-currency risk and the default risk. The
subsidiary loans would hiave a repaymiient period of up to eight years including three years of grace for
institutional strengtlheninig programls and a repaymenit period of up to twelve years including up to four
years of grace for automationi programs.
C. Project Implementation
86.          The Govertunent of the Russian Federation has appointed the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
to serve as the Lead Authority for the management of the Loan and tne coordination of its
implementation. The MoF will be more directly responsible for the commercial banking comnponent and
for the reform of enterprise accounting; the CBR will be responsible, under an agreement signed with
the MoF, for the bank supervision component and the bank accounting component. The MoF and the
CBR will maintain close collaboration with respect to the introduction of banking stai,dards.
87.          Project implementation arrangements for the FIDP involve an oversight Task Force (TF)
operating under the terms of an agreement between the MoF and the CBR, a Project Implemnentation Unit
(PIU), and a Bank Review Unlit (BRU).  The TF will be responsible for overseeing the proper
implementation of the Project with support from the BRU. In this capacity, it will monitor progress
under the project components, with a particular focus on ensuring the continued performance of PBs and
accrediting new banks. The TF will request the management of non performing banks to take corrective
actions, as needed, and, in case of continued non performance, will suspend or cancel the accreditation
of the concerned bank.  The most important eligibility criteria for evaluating the participation of
commercial banks include: capital adequacy; profitability; liquidity; credit policies and procedures;
managerial capability and autonomy, and focus on the private sector. Reporting to the TF, the PIU will
be responsible for the day-to-day implementation in the project. This will consist of monitoring and
providing advice to PBs, including assistance in the preparation and procurement of twinning and systems
automation packages, the collection of bank returns and other progress reports from the PBs, the
monitoring of disbursements under the Loan, the monitoring and accounting of grant funds; and ensuring
the overall accounting and organizing the auditing of project accounts. The PIU's duties and activities
will be carried out through a consulting contract with the MoF, and under the authority of the Head of
the PIU, who has been appointed by the MoF and is a Govermnent employee. The BRU, reporting
directly to the TF, will consist of a separate body of senior bankers and information technology
specialists, who will advise and assist the TF on monitoring the performance of PBs. The BRU will be
in charge of analyzing the PBs' returns, and of visitinig PBs from time to time (it is expected that each
bank would be visited twice a year, in average). The BRU will report on the financial conditions of PBs,
assess progress of twinning and automation programs for commercial banks, develop corrective action
programs with the management of problem banks, and monitor performance under such programs.
88.          The Project will be jointly supervised by Bank, EBRD, and EC staff. Given the complex
nature of the Project, the number of PBs involved as well as the broad scope of and the need for
individual tailoring of development programs, Project supervision input by Bank staff is expected to be



- 31 -
substantial, particularly at the early stage of project implementation. The establishment of the TF, the
BRU, and the PIU will provide the institutionial base and professional capacity required to facilitate
smooth project implementation and supervision.  In order to ensure effective monitoring of Project
implementation, a Project supervision plan has been developed and reviewed with Russian officials. The
plan includes: (i) the schedule for Bank supervision inputs and the skills mix required; (ii) specialist staff
needs for the institutional and technology developmenit programs, and (iii) aspects of the Project that
require special Bank attention during supervision.
D. Project Sustainability
89.           The project is primarily concerned with the development of a viable and sustainable
financial system through the creation of a system for upgrading the capability of commercial banks,
strengthening the supervision capacity of the CBR and improving bank and enterprise accounting. The
commercial banking component will be primarily financed by loans, which will be repaid to the
Government, and the grants will be used to finance technical assistance and training which will contribute
to the development of sustainable financial institutions.
E. Lessons Learned from Past Experience
90.           The Bank's experiences in other countries with both financial sector loans and technical
assistance loans are relevant to the design and implementation of the proposed project. With respect to
financial sector reform, the first lesson to be drawn is that this is a process requiring a long-term time
horizon. For this reason, it is best to initiate the institution-building component of reform as early as
possible. Establishing a strong legal and accounting framework, developing management and lending
capability in financial institutions and restructuring of insolvent banks require years of on-going
assistance. Such programs should be supported by a series of successive loans spread over a number of
years. The second lesson of financial sector reform is that the sequencing of individual components is
critical to the overall success of adjustment. The infrastructure-building reform components should be
undertaken early on in order to provide a necessary foundation for a strong financial system. As
government direction over interest rates, credit allocation and capital flows is reduced, the existence of
a strong regulatory capacity becomes more important.
91.           Another lesson taken from experience is that supervision capacity will be limited during
the initial years of the transition and that this constraint elevates the importance of establishing priorities
and a strategy for bank supervision which is consistent with overall policy objectives. The project
explicitly addresses the problem of insufficient supervisory resources and confirms development of a core
group of "good" banks as a policy priority
92.           Experience of prior automation programs in Eastern Europe has indicated that at this early
stage in their development cycle, the commercial banks' management have not yet crystallized their
processing and reporting requirements, are not cognizant of the technological options available, have not
finalized their organizational structure, nor identified the products and services they would offer in the
long term. During this key initial period, the banks are also subject to intense marketing efforts by
various suppliers of technology. This often results in premature, expensive and incompatible solutions.
By requiring the PBs to adhere to standard Bank procurement procedures, this FIDP will enhance the
quality of purchase decisions made under the Project and in the future.
93.           Another lesson learned is that banks have a tendency to commit themselves to major
investments in technology based on sophisticated solutions which may or may not be the long term ideal.



- 32 -
A plhased and building block approach is therefore advocated. This would visualize a low cost and basic
standard solutioln which would provide an interim capability, as well as function as a training tool since
it would provide functioniality commensurate with requirements of banks in developed economies. Once
management finalizes its requirements, in conjunction with the institutional developmental exercise, it
would then embark on a more comprehensive effort to implement sophisticated Management Information
Systems. This staged approach is incorporated in the FIDP by restricting the automation subcomponent
to financing the PBs' "core" automation needs comprising limited hardware and packaged banking
application software. The eligibility of additional automation equipment needs for financing under the
proceeds of this Loan would be decided later and depend, itnter alia, upon the availability of funds.
94.           The Bank's experience with technical assistance projects across sectors and countries has
demonstrated that instilling a high degree of ownerslhip in the borrower is the foremost critical success
factor. The cornerstone of the commercial banking component is the development of direct twinning
arrangements between Russian banks and reputable foreign banks. Introduced in Poland for the first time
as a vehicle to deliver technical assistance across the banking sector, twinning has proved to be a
powerful and efficient mechanism ensuring an effective and rapid transfer of know-how, setting up the
stage for cross-border banking relationships, and contributing to a sustained and prompt enhancement of
banking standards.
F. Rationale for Bank Involvement
95.           As discussed in the CAS, the Bank is committed to strengthening the role of the emerging
private sector in Russia. One of the most important means for achieving this is the establishment of a
sound banking system that operates on the basis of commercial criteria. The Bank has taken the lead in
developing a framework that would channel assistance to privatized enterprises, and the Financial
Iinstitutions Developmtient Project, as well as the proposed Enterprise Restructuring Project to be presented
to the Board at a later date, are key elements of this approach. The project is fully consistent with the
Bank's lending strategy under the Intermediate Case program described in the CAS, and it supports the
Government's objective to expand the role of the private sector.
G. Agreed Actions
96.           During negotiations, agreements with the MoF and CBR were reached on the following:
(i) the Accreditation Criteria and Process for PBs; (ii) the establishment of the PIU, its staffing plan,
financing plan, and its activities, including the undertaking of bank audits, as well as procurement,
disbursement, accounting. financial reporting and auditing arrangements; (iii) the MoF and CBR will
provide staff and resources to maintain the TF, the PIU and BRU under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank; (iv) the MoF will enter into subsidiary loan agreements with the PBs for the on-lending of
the proceeds of the Bank and EBRD loans under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including
the submission of annual audit reports; (v) the MoF and CBR will make arrangements satisfactory to the
Bank for the implementation of the supervision and the accounting and auditing components; and (vi) as
a condition of disbursement, the CBR will sign an agreement for the bank supervision and the bank
accounting components. It was also agreed at Negotiations that the MoF and CBR will make available
counterpart funds necessary for the project. The issuance by the MoF of the invitation letter for the PIU
consulting contract is a condition of Board presentation. Conditions of effectiveness are: (i) subsidiary
loan agreements with at least three PBs have been signed; (ii) the agreement between the MoF and CBR
has been concluded, and the Task Force has been established; (iii) two senior bankers have been recruited
for the BRU; (iv) the consulting firm to carry out the PIU's activities has been selected and a contract
with this firn has been signed; and (v) the EBRD loan has become effective.



- 33 -
H. Environment
97.           None of the components is expected to have a significant impact on the environment and
the project has been rated Category C.
I. Project Benefits and Risks
98.           The build-up of the financial infrastructure and improved operations in the banking system
will lead to a more efficient mobilization of financial resources, and to an improved allocation of
resources to viable activities in the productive sector. The project will also promote the modernization
and standardization of banks' management and information systems and will enhance the operations of
the payments system. The reformed and strengthened legislative, regulatory and supervisory framework,
as well as the institutional development of banks, will help improve the efficiency and prudence of bank
operations and thereby instill greater financial discipline in the system. Improvements in accounting and
auditing will significantly help improve transparency and reliability of financial data. Assistance in the
development of a network of commercial banks operating according to common higher standards will
contribute to further institutional development, facilitate inter-enterprise payments, and broaden financial
markets. All of these improvements in the financial sector will enhance the restructuring of the real
economy, contribute to the resumption of growth in the productive sectors, and provide a basis for IBRD
and other IFIs' lending.
99.           Uncertainties in the macroeconomic situation and inexperienced management may
jeopardize the solvency of participating banks (PBs). The introduction of banking standards for the PBs
and improved bank supervision, as well as the stren2thened managerial, financial, and operational
capacities of PBs should contribute to reducing this risk. Another risk relates to the lack of familiarity
of the Russian counterpart with Bank's procedures, which may slow down project implementation.
Strong project implementation arrangements, including the early establishment of the PIU, as well as
training of counterpart staff, should address this risk. Multiple co-financiers, each having their own
procurement and disbursement policies, also could slow project implementation. The Bank, the EBRD,
and the EC will establish a uniform set of procedures and, to the extent possible, joint institutional
arrangements in these areas prior to negotiations. Every effort will be made to reach early agreements
with other cofinanciers.
J. Recommendation
100.         I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.
