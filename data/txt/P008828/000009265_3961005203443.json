The ultimate objectives of the program are to\n            increase the quantity and improve the quality of banking\n            services, promote banking stability, and contribute to a\n            more efficient mobilization of financial resources and\n            allocation of bank credit. The project consists of four\n            components: 1) a commercial banking component, consisting of\n            institutional strengthening programs and systems\n            modernization and automation programs for private commercial\n            banks; 2) a bank regulation and supervision component,\n            consisting primarily of the development of on-site\n            supervisory capabilities and the provision of legal\n            assistance for the Central Bank of Russia; 3) a bank\n            accounting component, which will support the modernization\n            of accounting standards and practices; and 4) a Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) component which will contibute to\n            the establishment and early stages of operation of the PIU."}, "docdt": "1994-04-06T00:00:00Z"}
