                         The project will assist Government of Karnataka (GOK) in: (i) increasing rural communities' access to improved and sustainable drinking water and sanitation services;
                         and (ii) institutionalizing decentralization of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) service delivery to Gram Panchayats (village governments) and user groups.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. Good progress has been made towards achieving targets on provision of access to improved water sources (0.83 million people against a target of 1.78 million) and improved
                         sanitation facilities (1.2 million people, against a target of 1.4 million people).
                         . About 20 % of the target of new piped water connections has already been provided and the target is expected to be achieved by the closing date. However, project benefits have
                         been delayed by a year.

                         3. Work is underway to ensure sustainability of rural water supply schemes financed under the project:
                         Operationalization of the new Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Policy has begun;. O&M of the Common Facility of most of the MVSs constructed under Jal Nirmal I has been out-
                         sourced to private operators.
