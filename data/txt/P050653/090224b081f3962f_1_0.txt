                         2.     Consequent to the physical achievements, good progress has been made towards achieving targets on provision of access to improved water sources (0.73 million people
                         against a target of 1.78 million) and improved sanitation facilities (1.2 million people, against a target of !.4 million people). The recent extension of the Credit closing date by one year
                         will enable remaining on-going works to be completed and the targets to be achieved. Number of people expected to be benefited from the project would be about 2.98 million--1.78
