1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and Sector Background:
1.      During the 1990s, Karnataka made significant progress in increasing access to water
supply and sanitation in rural areas. In 1991, Karnataka became one of the first Indian states to
provide at least one safe drinking water source in all 27,000 villages. This was done through
increasing investments in the sector and also by changing relevant policies. By 2001, Karnataka
had achieved significant success in creating infrastructure that enabled the provision of basic
drinking water supply (40 liters per capita per day, or 40 lpcd) to most of its rural population.
However, service delivery was quite poor. At the same time, demand for better service was
rising. The level of environmental sanitation in rural areas was also extremely low. Thus
Karnataka was faced with the challenge to not only make facilities deliver as expected, but also
to meet increasing demand and rising expectations.
2.      The key issue was that all programs and schemes were exclusively based on a supply
driven approach, with very little provision for local participation. Schemes were designed and
constructed by the state engineering agencies with no involvement of local communities;
however, Operation and Maintenance (O&M) responsibility rested with local self-governments -
Gram Panchayats (GPs). As a result, operational performance suffered from a lack of ownership
as well as inadequate capacity at the GP level. For ground water schemes, source dwindling and
drying was quite common, resulting in an increasing number of defunct/partially defunct
schemes.
3.      On the financial front, cost recovery was quite poor as water was considered a ‘free good’
and the State was providing substantial subsidies for O&M. Additionally, there was no
integration between sanitation and water supply programs. Public sector institutions were
unresponsive to user demands and private sector involvement was neither supported nor
encouraged. The Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project II (also called the Jal
Nirmal Project – JNP I) was designed to address these issues.2
4.      The Project followed the First Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(KRWSSP I), which was implemented from 1993 to 2000 and was beset with all the issues listed
above. Consequently, KRWSSP I suffered heavily from significant cost and time overruns, with
some water supply schemes remaining incomplete even after credit closure. Challenges faced
during the implementation of KRWSSP I led to a shift, from a top down, supply driven public-
sector led approach to a bottom-up, demand driven, community led model for JNP I. The focus
was on building the capacity of local institutions to allow them to participate in decision making
processes.
5.      This follow-on project aimed at covering 3,062 villages spread across 744 GPs in11
Districts of North Karnataka3. The decision to confine the Project to the northern districts was

 Main Credit (Cr 3590-IN) is referred to as Jal Nirmal I and the Additional Finance Project/ Credit (4768-IN) is Jal
Nirmal II.

 Towards the end of JNP-I, Gulbarga district was bifurcated into two, but the project continued with 11 District
Support Units only.

taken in the background of the growing disparity between the southern and northern parts of the
State, with the latter lagging behind substantially in development4. This was the first ever
development intervention in Karnataka aimed exclusively for the backward northern region.
6.      JNP I was consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy5 (CAS) objectives of (i)
strengthening the enabling environment for development and growth, and (ii) supporting
interventions that benefit the poor and disadvantaged. The Project implemented the CAS
strategic principles of selectivity by concentrating on Karnataka, a reforming state, while also
ensuring pro-poor development by locating interventions in the less developed northern parts of
the State. The project provided an opportunity to strengthen the Bank’s partnership with India,
Karnataka, and NGOs for improving RWSS services.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
7.       The objective of the project was to assist GoK in: (i) increasing rural communities'
access to improved and sustainable drinking water and sanitation services; and (ii)
institutionalizing decentralization of rural water supply and sanitation service delivery to GPs
and user groups.
Performance indicators selected to measure the achievement of the development objective were:
PDO 1
     Percentage of rural population, particularly vulnerable groups, having access to
       improved and sustainable drinking water and sanitation services.
PDO 2
     Number of GPs planning and constructing RWSS improvement schemes;
     Number of user groups managing operation and maintenance of RWSS facilities;
     Percentage of state and district investment funds devolved to GPs and user groups.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
8.      The PDO was not revised. The Key Indicators were enhanced at the time of the
Additional Financing to reflect the Bank’s shift to core sector indicators in July 2009 and to
respond to the lessons learned during the JNP I. At the time of additional financing, the PDO
level indicators were reduced from four to three. The intermediate indicators for JNP I (as
indicated in the PAD) were 17, and at the time of the additional financing, the number of
indicators increased to 23.
PDO 1
     Total number of people/households (and people/households from vulnerable
        communities) in project areas with access to improved water supply services (fully
        covered status).
PDO 2
     Improvements in decentralized planning and management of RWS services:
            o No. of GPs participating
            o Contribution to capital cost by GPs & Communities

             o Tariff collection efficiency in the project GPs

1.4 Main Beneficiaries.
9.       It was estimated at appraisal that the project would directly benefit approximately 4
million people across 700 GPs. In addition, the project would also benefit 200,000 indigenous
peoples in about 400 settlements. Other intended beneficiaries of capacity building programs
were identified as staff of various agencies: GPs participating in the project; Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Institutions under the Government of Karnataka; NGOs and consultants
affiliated with the Project.
1.5 Original Components
10.   JNP I had three key components that are discussed below. More details are included in
Annex 2.
11.      Component A: Community Development and Infrastructure Building (US$166.00
million): This was the largest investment component and had three parts: Community
Development Support focused on engaging Support Agencies that could work with GPs and
project communities. It included a sub-component on women’s development programs, which
included ensuring 33% membership in Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs) and
skill training. The Infrastructure Building sub-component supported the construction of 2,100
water supply schemes, 1,000 groundwater recharge schemes, 220,000 household latrines and
220,000 smokeless chullahs6. It also included Drainage and Lane Improvement schemes, and the
building of institutional latrines, pay-and-use type community latrines, and garbage and compost
pits. The Indigenous People’s Development Program sub-component financed civil works
contracts and consultancy contracts for community development and infrastructure building in
about 400 indigenous peoples settlements.
12.     Component B: Institution Building (US$21.30 million)
This component had four parts: Project Management supported operating costs of the state-level
Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (KRWSSA) and the District Support
Units (DSUs) in 11 Zila Panchayats (ZP). It supported (i) procurement of office equipment and
vehicles; and (ii) a range of consultancies for technical assistance, training, audit, and
construction quality monitoring. Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion supported consultancies for
strategy formulation and production of Information, Education and Communication (IEC)
materials, training, and dissemination workshops. The Capacity Building sub-component
supported 2,600 training programs under 36 specially designed training modules. The fourth sub-
component, GP Strengthening supported (i) small works and procurement of equipment to
improve office facilities at GPs (ii) small development works as desired by GPs under flexible
funding (US$2,200 per GP); (iii) consultancy to provide an accountant to work with the GP
secretary for 12 months, and (iv) data management on a pilot basis in 50 GPs through the
provision of computer systems.

13.      Component C: Sector Strengthening Programs (US$6.10 million)
The design of this component focused on strengthening the Government of Karnataka’s RWSS
sector policies and overall management. It had five sub-components: Creating enabling
environment financed the costs of conducting advocacy workshops, exposure visits, publications
and the consultancy costs for disseminating reforms through mass media campaigns. Sector
information management system financed consultant contracts for system design and pilot
implementation and the procurement of computers and other equipment for statewide scaling up.
Continuous learning financed a number of studies: (i) developing and piloting alternate
institutional models for multi village schemes; (ii) sustainability monitoring of schemes built
under KRWSSP I and learning from other similar projects (DANIDA, GOI sector reform pilots);
and (iii) other special studies supporting research and innovative activities. The Goods and
Equipment sub-component supported the procurement of a range of state-of-the-art equipment
for scientific water prospecting, including VLF and resistivity instruments, and hydro-fracturing
units and pump testing units. The fifth sub-component, Water Quality Monitoring supported
water testing of 200,000 samples over the life of the Project.

1.6 Revised Components
14.   The components remained unchanged.

1.7 Other significant changes
15.    The project involved the following changes:
 (i) Additional Financing: On June 15, 2010, an additional financing of US$150 million (JNP II)
was approved. During JNP I implementation, it was noted the demand for WSS services was
increasing, and as project villages received improved services, neighboring habitations also
began asking for similar schemes. Thus, Government of Karnataka requested addition financing.
From JNP I to JNP II, the scale of project interventions was also increased from benefiting only
certain sections of a community to covering entire villages and habitations. The key purpose of
JNP II was to do ‘more of the same’ schemes and saturate the Project districts with RWSS
coverage. JNP II also accorded greater attention to sustainability. It was expected that an
additional 2 million people would benefit from the Project. The key Project indicators were
enriched and refined to better measure the PDO. Under JNP II, the PDO level indicators were
reduced from four to three, and the number of intermediate indicators was increased from 17 to
23. The implementation period was three years, and the Project closing date was changed to June
30, 2013.
 (ii) Amendment of sanitation investments: In 2007 Karnataka adopted the Government of
India’s Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC). This program covered sanitation investments,
including latrine construction. As a result, JNP I did not include sanitation investments, but
supported activities related to hygiene promotion and related capacity building.
(ii) Time Extensions: The closing date of the Project was extended four times in all, from
December 31, 2007 as stated in the Credit Agreement, till the final closing date of June 30, 2014.
These extensions were due to the need for additional time to complete ongoing project activities,
including the MVS, process the Additional Financing proposal, and support the implementation
of the Government of Karnataka’s RWSS sustainability framework.



                                                 4
        November 2007. The Project closing date was extended by 1 year to ensure sustainability
         of interventions and to allow extra time for the completion of key activities – including
         900 water schemes, 16 MVS, and 400 lane and drain schemes. The delay in completion
         was because – (i) water schemes needed to be completed before lane and drain schemes
         were initiated, and this had not been taken into consideration; (ii) MVS were complex not
         only for mobilizing the community but also for procuring contracts; and, (iii) for the first
         time in India, GPs were managing complex activities and building their capacity took
         longer than anticipated.
        December 2008. The Project was contingent on voluntary land donations by the
         community. The GP required additional time to ensure land availability, which led to
         some delays, necessitating a 1-year extension. Some 400 schemes were completed during
         this extension period.
        May 2013. It was determined that the benefits of JNP II would only partially be achieved
         by the closing date and additional time would be required for the completion of 130 SVS
         and 18 MVS. It was also estimated that, after completion, six months were needed for
         commissioning, and an additional two months were needed to ensure that the schemes
         were fully operational. The closing date was extended to June 30, 2014.
 (iv) Credit cancellation: There were two cancellations during the life of the Project: (i) in June
2005, based on a request from Government of India, US$13.94 million was canceled from the
Project and was allocated for the Emergency Tsunami Reconstruction Project, which was
implemented in 2005; and (ii) From Project appraisal to closing, the Indian Rupee depreciated
36% against the US Dollar. As a result, the Project had an additional US$12 million.7 The
additional funds could not be used and US$12 million were cancelled from the Credit.
(v) Reallocation of Credit. In June 2009, an amount of US$22.86 million was reallocated within
the existing disbursement categories. As: (i) more allocations were needed to finance additional
water supply schemes (civil works); and, (ii), savings were anticipated from the allocations made
for Goods and consultancy and trainings. Further, the unallocated credit amount (US $13.72) was
also used for civil works.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Soundness of Background Analysis.
16.     Background analysis undertaken during project preparation was sound. The project was
grounded in careful institutional analysis, and based on a thorough study of lessons learned
during the World Bank’s decade long engagement in India’s RWSS sector. In particular, the
KRWSSP I’s successes and failures influenced the project design. The key lessons identified in
OED’s Impact Evaluation Report of five Bank-supported RWSS projects and from projects
supported by other donors were also reflected in the design. In particular, innovations adopted
during the Swajal Project (Uttarakhand) and the Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Project were reflected in the design of JNP I and II. Most notable among the many lessons

  At the time of appraisal, the conversion rate was Rs. 47.227 to a US dollar, at the time of the AFP the conversion
rate was Rs. 45.68 and in August 2013, the rate was Rs 64.10 to a US dollar.

distilled and incorporated in the project design were: importance of decentralization and
community involvement; strong investment in building capacity and increasing engagement of
local governments in service delivery; and importance of checks and balances to ensure
accountability of local government organizations.
17.     The rationale for the Bank’s involvement was to strengthen India’s RWSS sector, in line
with the Government of India’s National Sector Strategy. This strategy indicated the
Government’s commitment to institutionalize a demand-driven, community based approach for
rural water supply across the country. JNP I and II implemented the principles agreed between
the Government and the Bank, including: operationalizing a demand driven approach; shifting
the role of State and District governments to policy formulation and monitoring & evaluation;
providing opportunities for GPs to contribute to capital costs, operation and maintenance costs,
and to management of schemes; and improving focus on water resource management.
Additionally, the project promoted linkages across multiple sectors, including watershed
development, education, health, rural development, and women’s development programs.
2.1.2 Assessment of Project Design
18.     In order to achieve the PDOs, it was necessary to implement reforms in the sector. These
included: (i) adopting a demand responsive approach and use of participatory processes; (ii)
shifting the role of government from ‘provider’ (direct service delivery) to that of a ‘facilitator’
(policy formulation, arranging for capacity support/building and monitoring and evaluation); (iii)
enabling local governments/communities greater control over resources and decision making;
and (iv) ensuring local ownership by mandating partial capital cost sharing and 100% O&M
from local self-governments and communities. The project was designed to operationalize these
reform elements. Project design was premised on the principles of participation and inclusion,
accountability, transparency, convergence and sustainability.
19.      Institutional and implementation arrangements were fully aligned with the three-tier PRI
institutional setup - the Gram Panchayats (GPs) at the village level, followed by the Taluka
Panchayat (TP) at the tehsil8 level, and the Zila Parishads (ZP) at the district level. The GPs were
put in the driver’s seat and, along with the Village Water Supply and Sanitation Committees
(VWSCs), were capacitated to shoulder the primary responsibility for planning, procurement,
construction, operation & maintenance and management of rural water supply and sanitation
facilities. ZPs (district level PRI) and their engineering wing (ZP Engineering Division (ZPEDs))
were responsible for providing technical support. In order to ensure that the role of the
government shifts from provider to facilitator, the Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Agency (KRWSSA) was set up at the state level. KRWSSA had adequate autonomy for planning
project activities, developing capacity building programs for all project partners, arranging
technical, institutional and financial support for PRIs, and organizing sector strengthening
activities, including monitoring and evaluation. KRWSSA was also responsible for engaging
with private stakeholders and development partners, including the World Bank.
20.     Implementation arrangements established clear links from components to outcomes. The
design of all components was found to be adequate. First, the Community Development and
Infrastructure Building component included support agencies at the GP and District level that

    A tehsil is a subdivision of a district


                                                 6
were responsible for creating awareness, mobilizing communities, providing technical guidance,
and assisting in procurement, supervision, and contract management. Second, the decision to
focus on Institution Building in Component Two was appropriate as it supported decentralization
and helped in institutionalizing a bottom-ups approach to project management. Separate capacity
building plans for each stakeholder group allowed for improved implementation. Third, the
design was appropriate for creating greater awareness about sanitation and hygiene, building an
enabling environment, supporting sector strengthening, and developing ways to share
information on sector status.
21.     JNP II, in particular, enhanced focus on water quality affected areas. The design was not
changed, and ‘more of the same’ schemes were planned under the additional financing. JNP II
sought to extend services to an additional 1,650 villages and meet any remaining demand. In
some cases, low availability of potable water in project districts required that water be drawn
from surface sources up to 110 km away. As a result, JNP II included more multi-village
schemes. These schemes presented a high degree of technical complexity and institutional
challenges, particularly under the decentralized implementation arrangements. A Scheme Level
Committee (SLC), comprising representatives of VWSCs, was set up to address these
governance issues. Yet, O&M proved a challenging task, which meant exploring alternatives
during implementation, including outsourcing of O&M to private operators. However, to
implement such arrangements, a new O&M policy was necessary.
2.1.3 Adequacy of Government Commitment.
22.     Government commitment was high at the time of project preparation and even before. In
1998, Government of India put in place the National Sector Strategy for rural water supply and
sanitation. When the Project was initiated, the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) was in the
process of implementing the sector reform agenda identified in this strategy.
23.      At the State level, the Government of Karnataka also demonstrated its commitment to the
reform agenda by: (i) building a broader partnership with the Bank to implement a
comprehensive development framework for the state; (ii) implementing decentralization
programs which would be conducive to further devolution of powers to GPs and user groups,
(iii) successfully introducing sectoral reforms through other projects, as well as its own schemes
– the “Swajaldhara” and the "Swatcha Grama" (Clean Village) Programs, (iv) obtaining cabinet
approval for the State's new sector reform strategy (2000-2005); and (v) demonstrating
willingness to further broaden and deepen the decentralization agenda for the RWSS sector.
2.1.4 Risk Assessment and Mitigation
24.      At the time of the appraisal, the overall risk rating was ‘Modest’, reflecting a thorough
assessment of project risks, including: the chance that the Government of Karnataka will reverse
the autonomy of KRWSSA; potential unwillingness on the part of State and District agencies to
shift from implementer to facilitator roles; slow implementation due to capacity constraints,
particularly at GP level; district-level agencies unwilling to support GP empowerment or allocate
resources and provide support to GP/community initiatives.
25.     During the design of JNP II, the risk rating was ‘Moderate’. Some new risks were
identified at this stage, including: potential hurdles to the operationalization of the Government
of Karnataka’s O&M policy; inability to meet ambitious targets; cost and time overruns;



                                                 7
procurement issues related to complex water schemes and a decentralized approach; and
inadequate financial management capacity.
26.     Mitigation measures were appropriate including: setting bylaws and MOA to ensure
KRWSSA’s autonomy; providing necessary technical and policy support to facilitating and
implementing agencies at all levels (State, District, and Village); training district and village
level staff to support the demand-responsive approach to rural water supply and sanitation
service delivery; releasing funds to GPs based on the utilization of previous tranches and
physical progress of schemes; internal checks for procurement and financial activities; collecting
data and mandatory recordkeeping for all contracts procured by GPs; ‘training of trainers’
(support agency staff at district and state level) in procurement; ensuring that KRWSSA is
carrying out project monitoring & evaluation; and, joint reviews of program performance by the
Bank and Government.
27.     Despite the comprehensive risk identification, several unanticipated issues emerged
during the course of implementation, including: (i) GoK enacted a policy banning sand mining,
which delayed progress because sand for the construction of civil works had to be brought in
from outside the State; (ii) there were three PRI elections during implementation which led to
delays and, after each election, the capacity of the GPs had to be re-built; and (iii) time taken for
getting the necessary permissions from other departments, such as Railways and National
Highway Authority of India, also affected implementation progress.
2.1.5 Quality at Entry

28.     The rationale for Bank involvement was strong and the PAD comprehensively analyzed
the background issues, which justified the Bank’s intervention. The project PDO had two
distinctive elements - Increasing rural communities’ access to improved and sustainable
drinking water and sanitation services, and Institutionalizing decentralization of rural water
supply and sanitation service delivery to Gram Panchayats and user groups. The PDOs and
PDO indicators were designed to address issues identified in project preparation, e.g., weak
capacity at local levels, and limited access to water supply and sanitation services. The indicators
were enhanced and refined at the time of JNP II in order to better assess achievements against
the PDOs.

2.2. Implementation
29. The Project became effective on April 19, 2002. The implementation progress was rated
unsatisfactory for 18 months, from November 2003 to June 2005. In June 2005, after the mid-
term review (MTR), implementation improved significantly. Ultimately, the physical targets
were not only achieved, but were surpassed at the time of credit closing. Some reasons for
implementation delays are discussed below:
      Aligning with the PRIs. The project aimed to decentralize constructing, operating and
       managing of RWSS schemes to GPs. This required changing the existing way of
       managing RWSS projects, at State, district and local levels. Most GP representatives had
       not previously worked on RWSS schemes, and additional time was needed to build their
       capacity, particularly on financial and technical aspects. The district and state level
       agencies also needed to change their standard operating procedures in order to provide
       more technical support to GPs. GPs were managing large and complex activities for the

                                                  8
           first time and GoK too was new at playing the role of a facilitator. GPs’ capacity had to
           be built on all fronts, including procurement and book keeping and audits. The selection
           and orientation of support agencies (to work with PRIs) was also a formidable challenge.
           All these activities took time, especially putting in place appropriate protocols and
           building understanding and coordination among different stakeholders. Thus, the learning
           curve was long and steep; however, by project closing, these challenges were addressed.
          Large and Complex Surface Source Schemes. The surface source schemes were
           technically and institutionally complex: (i) the project was contingent on voluntary land
           donations by the community which was time consuming; (ii) Private sector consultants
           were expected to support the design and implementation of these schemes, however this
           did not materialize as expected, some consultants left halfway through the work; (iii) It
           was challenging to mobilize communities across villages/GPs for multi-village schemes;
           and (iv) it was time consuming to obtain clearances and approvals from other agencies,
           including the departments of irrigation, urban development, forestry, national highways
           and railways.
          Rupee-Dollar Ratio. The Dollar to Rupee exchange rate varied almost on a daily basis,
           and it was not possible for the project to change activities continuously to absorb all the
           surplus credit. As contracts in the Project were in Indian Rupees, and it was decided to
           firm up the work program at INR 9,398 million, which was 15% higher than the original
           outlay. Eventually, the undisbursed balance of US$ 12 million was cancelled from the
           credit.
          Level 2 Restructuring: The Project went through two closing date extensions before
           JNP II became operational9. Subsequently, two additional Level 2 Restructurings were
           also processed - first was in May 2010 to process the Additional Financing, and the
           second was in June 2013 to extend JNP II’s closing date (see Section 1.7 for more
           details).
Section 2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation
30.     M&E Design: The M&E design was comprehensive. There were some changes in
reporting and presentation as the project aligned itself in 2009 with the Bank’s global core sector
indicator system, and then again in 2010 at the time of the additional financing. JNP II had three
PDO level indicators compared to four for JNP I. The intermediate indicators were increased
from 17 in JNP I to 23 in JNP II. The indicators were refined to better measure sustainability and
decentralization. Not all of these indicators were captured in the ISRs. The changes in PDO-level
indicators are discussed in Section 1.3.
31.      JNP I used an innovative sustainable monitoring tool – the Village Immersion Program
(VIP) to conduct sustainability monitoring exercises (SME) for MVSs and SVSs. An extensive
computerized MIS was also developed to gather village level data across four areas – inputs,
outputs, sustainability and impacts. The project required that all stakeholders - village
communities, GPs, SAs, Contractors, and KRWSSA - sign off after evaluating completed
activities against expectations. The stakeholders together identified difficulties and deficiencies
(if any), agreed on corrective measures, and put in place an O&M management plan.

9
    Prior to the extension of JNP II, closing date extensions were not regarded as ‘Level 2 restructurings’.


                                                             9
32.     M&E Implementation. The ISRs did not include information on all indicators; however
this data was included in the clients’ progress reports, and monitored in the aide memoires. The
MIS system was used to track and review activities, and also to enhance transparency. The
system functioned well throughout the life of the Project. All reports were produced on time: (i)
monthly consolidated reports were prepared at the village and district levels and sent to
KRWSSA for review; (ii) quarterly reports were shared with GoK and the Bank; and (iii)
detailed notes were developed for the Tri-Partite DEA-Bank-GoK reviews, which were held on a
bi-annual basis.
33.     M&E Utilization. M&E results were used to enhance the effectiveness of
implementation. Internal and independent control mechanisms helped ensure good quality
construction. The SME was a useful tool to evaluate the completed schemes. For example, it
looked at the quality and quantity of available water, based on which it was possible to identify
areas where groundwater recharge was required. However, the SME did not sufficiently assess
financial sustainability and the M&E utilization was weak in addressing cost recovery gaps (see
Section 3.2). Several thematic studies were undertaken and best practices under the Project were
documented. Three detailed documents in the local language (Kannada) have been disseminated
widely across the State.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
34.     Environmental and Social Safeguards Compliance. There are no outstanding
environmental or social safeguards issues in the Project and social and environmental
management were seen as key areas of focus.
35.       Environmental Management. The Project was appropriately classified as Category B
and triggered OP/BP/GP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment). In response, an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was developed and successfully integrated into the Project. Civil
works financed under the Project were environmentally safe and in compliance with local
legislation and standards, as well as Bank policies.
36.     Social Safeguards: No land acquisition was required because the Project was contingent
upon voluntary donation of land by GPs/community members. As a result, OP 4.12 was not
triggered.
37.     The Bank’s operational policy relating to Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20 at project
appraisal, currently replaced by OP 4.10) was triggered and in response, an Integrated Tanda
Development Program was included as a sub-component under Component 1. An Integrated
Tanda Development Plan (ITDP) was prepared and successfully implemented. In line with Bank
Policy, ITDP involved community development and infrastructure building in settlements
inhabited by identified indigenous peoples -- Lambanis and Siddis. Overall, 400 water schemes
serving the tribal communities were implemented. In addition, all safeguard requirements were
implemented in compliance with Bank policies.
38.     Procurement was carried out in accordance with agreed procedures. Despite the highly
decentralized operations involving a large number of civil works and a variety of actors, the
Project procurement was efficient and transparent. KRWSSA and district level agencies were
seen as having adequate capacity to carry out procurement activities.
39.      Having a large amount of contracting done at the community level was seen as a potential
risk at appraisal. To mitigate this, several steps were planned, in particular: (i) continual capacity
                                                 10
building for stakeholders at various levels; (ii) extending the project auditors’ scope of services
to cover a percentage of physical assets; and (iii) technical audit of community constructed
works on a sample basis. The outcome was increased ability at the GP level to procure works
contracts. GPs followed proper accounting and recording procedures. A complaint handling
system was also put into place. Going forward, KRWSSA will continue to monitor this system,
as per Bank recommendations. An online procurement system was also established and is being
regularly updated by the district project support units (DPSUs).
40.     Although the mitigation measures worked well and community contracting was central to
the Project, there were some delays in scheme completion and contract closures due to the
inexperience of GPs in handling such activities. When more than one GP was involved (for
example, in MVS), contract management was noted as a key issue. As a result, procurement was
rated as ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ for most of the implementation period.
41.     Financial Management. Financial management was implemented well. The Financial
Management Reports (FMRs) were provided in a timely manner and the accounts were up to
date. Contract closure and GP account closure processes worked well and accounts for a majority
of schemes have been successfully concluded and closed. However, funds advanced to GPs need
to be recovered to ensure accountability. The Project complied with all fiduciary covenants
during implementation. There were no overdue or qualified audits. No significant accountability
issues were raised in any audit report.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
42.    Transition arrangements. Transition arrangements for future operations appear
adequate, as demonstrated by the following measures adopted by GoK
      Policies. GoK approved a new O&M policy in September 2012. A Government Order
       has been issued towards operationalizing this policy. The policy provides for: (i) the
       establishment of a Sustainability Fund; (ii) out-sourcing of MVS common facilities; (iii)
       a transparent subsidy for power charges; and (iv) full cost recovery of operational
       expenses over a period of eight years.
      Institutional. Karnataka is one of the two states in India which (till recently) did not have
       any dedicated department for RWSS activities. As a result of an institutional analysis, a
       new department – Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Department – has been established.
       KRWSSA is expected to be scaled up throughout the state and merged with the
       Department.
      GoK needs to accord urgent attention to defining the role of KRWSSA in the new
       institutional setup. Earlier deliberations had planned to carve out a niche for KRWSSA
       by assigning it all software functions (such as capacity building, IEC, M&E including
       water quality monitoring, sector strengthening, and O&M). However, this has not
       happened as yet.
      Technical. Capacity of KRWSSA staff has been strengthened, especially on technical,
       procurement, financial management, and project management aspects. KRWSSA’s
       inclusion in the new institutional setup will ensure continuity of technical support to GPs
       and VWSCs. Capacity building and IEC activities will be continued as a part of sector
       development programs.

          Financial. In the initial 3-4 years, the operations of large MVS, 30% subsidy for O&M
           will be available to GPs. Subsequently, GPs are expected to meet O&M expenses through
           taxes/ tariffs.
          Other Managerial Support. Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (RDPR) has
           Panchayat Development Officers (PDO) and Secretaries for each GP, who will extend
           managerial support. Consultants will also be engaged as needed.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
priorities, and
Bank Assistance Strategy)

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objective: High
44.     The Project development objectives are highly relevant to the country’s development
objectives, needs of the RWSS sector in Karnataka, and the Bank’s Assistance Strategy. GOI
aspires that every rural person has enough safe water for drinking, cooking and other domestic
needs as well as for livestock throughout the year, including during natural disasters. GOI also
desires that by 2022 every rural person in the country should have access to 70 lpcd water, either
within their household premises or within a horizontal/vertical distance of 50 meters or less from
their households.10 GoI has increased its commitment to the water supply and sanitation sector,
both in terms of sector investments and focus on reforms. Karnataka intends to align itself with
the national goal of improving water supply service delivery in a sustainable and accountable
manner. Thus, the decentralized approach implemented and institutionalized in the design is
highly relevant to the priorities of GoI and GoK.
45.     The Project is also highly relevant to the Bank’s priorities and development objectives.
The Project remains consistent with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 201311). The
project contributes to the CPS 2013 outcome indicators across two strategic areas of engagement
- transformation and inclusion. Under the transformation pillar, the Project contributes to
improving water supply and sanitation services; and under the inclusion pillar, it contributes to
improving access to services for the residents of the poorer northern part of Karnataka.
Relevance of Design: Substantial
The design is relevant from three perspectives.
46.    First, infrastructure improvements were appropriate and technically sound. Multiple
technology options were considered for water supply interventions before one was selected for
implementation. For the construction of latrines, alternate design of superstructures and use of

     Country Partnership Strategy – India dated March 21, 2013 Report No. 76176-IN.


                                                         12
local materials was promoted. Interventions also focused on increasing water supply and
sanitation access for vulnerable groups, and tribal communities, thus addressing Bank, GoI and
GoK’s priorities.
47.    Second, implementation arrangements were appropriate. Extensive consultations,
feedback from GPs and VWSC, and independent monitoring were important aspects of
implementation arrangements. The Project also expanded and refined techniques used in
KRWSSP I, including linking District level agencies to KRWSSA for improved communication
and data transfer, and monitoring progress on the Project website.
48.     Third, the project nurtured and supported government partnership with GPs and VWSCs
as well as with private sector consultants/operators and NGOs. Local level capacity building
programs were planned to ensure that GPs were able to acquire ‘governance’ skills. In some
cases, GPs were also able to manage construction through community contracting.
49.     Even though the project design was relevant, it had some shortcomings: (i) institutional
arrangements for the Project were quite complex, and involved bringing together multiple
stakeholders from different sectors – public, private & NGO- with their own priorities and
preferences; (ii) GP capacity was quite low and to prepare them for project activities was a
formidable challenge; and (iii) JNP II was quite ambitious as it planned for an outlay of US$150
million in three years, even though it had taken almost eight years to spend the same amount
under JNP I.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Overall Rating: Substantial
50.   This section assesses outcomes against project targets and objectives. Annex 2 provides a
more detailed picture.
Development Objective 1: Increasing rural communities’ access to improved and sustainable
drinking water and sanitation services (High achievement of coverage targets, substantial
achievement on sustainability of services)
51.    The Project has resulted in wider water coverage across 11 districts12 in Northern
Karnataka that comprise 2,305 GPs and 9,693 villages. JNP I and II together have led to
improved water supply in 1,369 (59.4%) GPs and 4,796 (49.5%) villages. This is about 4% and
17% higher than the respective appraisal targets. In two districts-Uttar Kannada and Bidar-,
coverage exceeds 80% of all villages. The remaining nine districts have more than 50% GP
coverage (Table 1). Cumulatively, the project has financed 3,516 water supply schemes13, thus
surpassing the PAD target by about 17%.

52.    The Project also led to better access to improved sanitation. Overall, more than 380,000
people gained access to improved latrines, exceeding the PAD target. Targets from JNP I were
exceeded and 73% of the PAD target for JNP II was achieved at closing. Household sanitation
also improved due to increased access to smokeless chullahs. More than 449,000 households
were provided access to smokeless chullahs, exceeding PAD targets by 49%. Table 2 indicates
the overall improvements in access to water supply and sanitation in Project districts.

53.     Completion of the physical infrastructure was affected by some delays. JNP I and II had
to be extended for three years and one year, respectively, in order to meet, and eventually
surpass, PAD targets.
54.      Sustainability of Services. The Project has made multi-pronged interventions to
ensure ‘sustainability’ of the water and sanitation services. At the State level, policy and
institutional development efforts have been made to formulate a long term sustainability
framework (LTSF) for the RWSS sector as a whole. At the GP level, a sustainability monitoring
exercise (SME) was deployed to assess overall sustainability. The SME served as an operational
tool to assess the sustainability of service delivery across multiple pre-defined parameters,
including - the availability of minimum levels of water, supply schedules, effectiveness of
institutions, O&M, and community perception- across technical, social, institutional and
financial factors. Finally, based on the scores, the sustainability of schemes was ranked. The
SME was conducted 5 times across the life of the Project and covered all schemes. Most

                                                      14
schemes from JNP I schemes have now been functioning well for over 7-8 years. The latest
SME, which covered 300 schemes from JNP II, reveals that 59% schemes were ‘highly likely’ to
be sustainable, 33% of schemes were ‘likely’, and about 7% were ‘uncertain’. Only 1% was
found as ‘unlikely to sustain’14. Based on this analysis, at least 92% of the schemes are
functioning well and are expected to continue to perform as per expectations. The SME was a
useful tool to assess schemes but it did not look at cost recovery from these interventions
(discussed in the next section on Development Objective 2).
Development Objective 2: Institutionalizing decentralization of rural water supply and
sanitation service delivery to Gram Panchayats and user group (Moderate achievement on
institutionalization of decentralization)
55.      The decentralized service delivery model has been successfully implemented, with some
residual challenges. GoK decentralized the rural water supply and sanitation services by aligning
the Project’s institutional arrangements with the existing PRI set up – ZP at the district level; TP
at tehsil level; and GP at the village levels. GPs were placed in the ‘driver’s seat’ and, together
with the VWSCs (established as a sub-committee of the GP), were capacitated to make
decisions, procure materials, carry out construction, manage funds, and contribute towards
capital cost. The TPs and ZPs provided additional support as needed. However, the capacity
building process required significantly more time than was envisaged at appraisal. Additionally,
at Project closing, the schemes had not met the financial parameters set at appraisal and it is
likely that the schemes will not be sustainable without financial grants from the State
government. The institutional arrangements, particularly the role of KRWSSA, were also not
firmed up. These residual issues (discussed below) raise questions regarding the GPs ability to
operate and manage schemes in the long run :
        Construction funds were devolved fully to the GPs. Before the Project, GPs were only
         allowed to handle about Rs500,000 (about US$10000). Under the Project, GPs were
         managing the construction of schemes, and handling funds ranging from Rs.5 million to
         Rs380 million per scheme (US$100,000 to US$6 million). Overall, civil works costing
         Rs133,700 million were devolved completely to GPs. However, the community
         contribution to capital cost was at US$ 31.7 million, significantly lower than the appraisal
         targets of US$ 15.2 and 43.82 million for JNP I and II, respectively.
        Out of a total of 4,328 contracts, 40% were implemented through community contracting.
         These were completed within budget, to quality, and within the required timeline.
         Currently, about 4,400 VWSCs are carrying out O&M responsibilities, including
         revising, levying and collecting water tariff from consumers. However, the tariff
         collection efficiency at Project closing was at 52%, significantly lower than the appraisal
         targets for JNP I (60%) and JNP II (70%). Percent user fee collected towards O&M costs
         was 48% compared to the target of 80%.
        The cost recovery figures are conservative estimates of sustainability, and only provide a
         part of the picture. A large number of water supply schemes from JNP I have now been
         functioning well for over 6 years. There have been no cost recovery related issues with
14
  Highly Likely: performing as planned and can continue to do so; Likely: performance slightly below expectations
demanding minor repair/ rehabilitation measures; Uncertain: demands major repair and rehabilitation measures;
Unlikely: requires a complete re-visit.

         SVS. For large and complex MVS, the new O&M policy includes provisions for
         government subsidies and for private sector support to ensure financial sustainability and
         better management.
        At the state level, under the aegis of the RDPR, GoK established KRWSSA, a special
         purpose agency to provide policy and implementation support to the GPs. As appraisal, it
         was expected that KRWSSA would eventually be scaled up and would become a part of
         State’s institutional set up to manage RWSS service delivery. Since then, GoK has
         established the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Department, which is responsible for
         RWSS service delivery in the state and KRWSSA has no clear role under this new set-up.
         Even though the Project supported extensive capacity building for agency staff, the long-
         term impacts of this activity remain uncertain.
Overall, the results under this component suggest that even though GP capacity was increased,
and provisions were made to ensure scheme sustainability, some financial and institutional
targets were not fully achieved.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial
56.     An ex-post economic analysis of water supply investments (For more detail, see Annex
3) was carried using the same methodology that was employed at Project appraisal. At appraisal,
the ERR for the Project was computed based on 23 schemes, and was estimated to be 21.4%, for
a 20-year horizon. At Project closing, the ERR, based on 300 completed schemes at a discount
rate of 12.5%, is estimated at 29%. The ERR for MVS (at a discount rate of 12.5% for a 20-year
horizon) is 22% and for SVS it ranges from 8 to 40%, depending on the technology15. The
analysis revealed variations due to difference between districts and due to the use of varying
technologies - essentially diverse pre-project situations. The project also established a culture of
paying for water as a result of the long-term engagement with the communities, and was able to
improve the capacity of communities to manage RWSS schemes.
57.    Even though the project was able to substantially meet its development objectives, four
additional years were required and there were significant delays during the early stages of
implementation, which affected the overall efficiency. Efficiency is rated as Substantial.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Project remains highly relevant to the GoI, GoK and Bank priorities. Taking into account the
rating of High for Relevance of Design, and Substantial for Achievement of Project
Development Objectives and Efficiency, overall Project Outcome is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. The Project’s development objective rating on the final ISR was ‘Satisfactory’;
however, looking at the progress across the life of the Project, on balance, the ICR team has
assigned a rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

15
  The ERR (at a discount rate of 12.5% for a 20 year horizon) for Ground Water schemes is
estimated at 40; for ITDP schemes at 10; for Gravity schemes at 8; for SSI schemes at 33; and,
for SSR schemes at 23.


                                                 16
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
58.     Schemes have been designed in way to ensure that all the households in a village and
associated settlements are covered. Consequently, the coverage for Scheduled Castes/Tribes
(SC/STs), Below Poverty Line (BPL) and other Tribal households/ settlements is high. Half of
the beneficiaries of the project belong to the BPL category, and 25% to the SC/STs. About
180,000 women have joined the VWSC, accounting for 35% of all members under the original
project and nearly 50% of all members under the JNP II.
59.     It is expected that the Project will make life easier for all members of the households,
particularly women and girls, saving from the daily drudgery. The Project also recognized that
women are the ‘managers of water’ and developed programs aimed at building their capacity,
including training them to run sanitary marts. In a number of villages, exclusive women’s
committees were set up for monitoring and evaluation of Project activities. Women were also
involved in sector strengthening and O&M activities. 353,000 women were trained in
construction, operation and maintenance of schemes and in ways to mobilize communities for
Project related activities through 37,550 programs. Apart from the training programs, 96
exposure visits, and 971 cross learning programs were conducted, which were all well attended
by women.
60.    Social Development: The Project included areas with indigenous peoples. An ITDP was
developed and 400 water schemes to serve tribal communities were implemented. Many tribal
areas were also equipped with solar energy devices to supplement/complement the power supply.
Ground water recharge measures were also adopted to counter the dwindling resources.
61.     The project succeeded in promoting sanitation by using innovative methods such as the
Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach. As compared to the situation at appraisal, at
Project closing there was a 93% increase in access to sanitation and 149% increase in use of
smokeless chullahs.
62.    Due to the increased number of household-level water connections and latrines, it is
expected that children will not be required to spend time collecting water or defecating in the
open. Consequently, school drop-out rate and absenteeism may reduce.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
63.    The project resulted in substantial institutional development impact:
     GoK successfully decentralized rural water supply and sanitation services by aligning the
      project’s institutional arrangements with the existing Panchayat Raj Institutional set up
     Sector Information Management System developed under the project facilitated two-way
      flow of information between state level policy makers and GP members.
     GPs successfully closed civil works contracts and implemented proper accounting and
      recording procedures.
     The online procurement information system was implemented well and is kept up to date
      by individual DPSUs.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
64.    There were several unintended outcomes and impacts resulting from the project:

                                                17
         Pressure filter based water treatment plants were used extensively as a viable alternative to
          traditional sand filter based plants that require large tracts of land. This is now being
          implemented in other states.
         Impounding Reservoirs were used extensively to serve as summer storage, enabling year
          round water supplies for irrigation canal based schemes. This is being promoted in the
          country for water security.
         A variety of innovative technologies were adopted: (i) SCADA based audit system to
          ensure equitable supply under MVSs; (ii) mobile water distribution system that purifies
          water on site using an Ultra Filtration system (or other similar measures); (iii) solar
          pumping to address power shortages and/or high power costs, particularly in groundwater-
          based schemes; (iv) water purification & kiosks in areas facing water quality problems
          due to arsenic, fluorides, iron etc.; and (v) groundwater well recharge with V-Wire
          technology.
         Property prices are expected to rise in Project villages due to the easy availability of
          drinking water and improved lanes and drainage facilities.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops.
Not Applicable
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
65.     The risk to development outcome is rated Moderate for the following reasons: (i) More
than 90% of all schemes have been completed and commissioned, contracts closed, and are
operating successfully; (ii) following the operationalization of the O&M policy, GoK has out-
sourced O&M of the common facilities of one MVS (Belgaum district) to private operators; (iii)
Adequate capacity development for GPs/VWSCs; (iv) an O&M management action plan is in
place for all single and/or in-village facilities; (iv) Even though the future of KRWSSA is
uncertain, the new Department of Water Supply and Sanitation is committed to providing post-
construction O&M support to schemes; (v) For large and complex schemes, the Government is
providing financial support through subsidies and is also allowing for private sector involvement
in O&M; and (vi) there is sustained political commitment to decentralization.
66.        There are several major concerns that are likely to impact Project outcomes:
          Inadequate and erratic power supply.
          Dwindling of resources, which will particularly affect groundwater schemes.
          Even though more people are paying for water as a result of the project interventions,
           sustainable cost recovery mechanisms have still not been established. The cost recovery
           and tariff collection targets need to be met in order to ensure sustainability of schemes.
           Going forward, the Government of Karnataka will have to monitor scheme performance
           on a regular basis to plan appropriate corrective measures as needed.
          Despite significant efforts to build KRWSSA’s capacity, the future of the agency remains
           uncertain. This can impact overall project outcomes.

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
67.     The strategic relevance of the project was strong, both in terms of objectives and design.
Capacity building arrangements and interventions were put into place to ensure readiness for
implementation. The Project design included a focus on building GP capacity to ensure smooth
implementation. Project preparation was carried out with adequate resources. The Bank provided
specialists with the necessary technical skills to address any concerns that arose during
preparation. In particular, financial and procurement specialists provided necessary support to
GPs. The Project included two sub-components that focused on women’s development and tribal
development to allow for an increased focus on gender and social development aspects. All
relevant safeguards were properly addressed during project design and appraisal. Fiduciary
aspects were designed based on an assessment of capacities in procurement and financial
management. Risks were identified upfront and mitigation measures were incorporated.
68.     The quality at entry was affected by a number of shortcomings: (i) complex institutional
arrangements involving multiple stakeholders; (ii) ambitious scale and scope of the Project,
particularly JNP II, which envisaged US$150 million being utilized in three years; (iii) the M&E
system design (Section 2.1.5) required modifications; (iv) low capacity of the implementing
agency and of the local governments necessitated additional dialogue and technical assistance,
and led to delays, particularly during the initial years of implementation; (v) the design did not
take into consideration that water schemes needed to be completed before lane and drain
schemes were initiated; and (vi) difficulties in implementing MVS were not addressed (multiple
GPs are involved, and management responsibilities for common assets are not clearly defined).
These shortcomings led to initial implementation delays.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
69.      Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was moderately
satisfactory. Specifically, the task team took the following actions that helped achieve the
development objectives: (i) the implementation faced considerable challenges due to the
devolution of responsibilities to the GP that lacked sufficient capacity, and due to low
community contributions towards capital and O&M costs. As a result, the team downgraded the
Implementation Progress (IP) and Development Objective (DO) rating during the initial stages of
implementation. The MTR was held in 2005. At the MTR, the team and the implementing
agency agreed on a set of measure to address these issues – GoK agreed that GPs could
contribute in kind (food grains, labor, etc.) in addition to cash and the State government agreed
to cover any remaining shortfall. Post-MTR, the IP and DO ratings were upgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory (MS); (ii) At the MTR, the team updated the implementation plan to
allow the Project to make up for initial delays; (iii) the team supported the use of innovative
technologies to address implementation challenges, including improving groundwater levels
through recharge and using different filtration methods to improve water quality in affected
areas.

70.     The Bank allocated sufficient budget and staff resources for the Project. The team
regularly prepared Aide-Memoires and was candid and rigorous in assessing and addressing
project management issues. However, there were some weaknesses in M&E reporting. While,
the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project in
terms of achievement of development objective and project implementation, they did not assess
the progress across all indicators. Even though all indicators were included in client reports and
in aide memoires, only a few were monitored in the ISR. Additionally, the PDO level indicators
monitored in the ISRs are not the same as those in the additional financing paper.
71.       Supervision of fiduciary and safeguards aspects was strong. The Bank team provided
detailed reports and recommendations in the aide memoires, and adjusted the ISR ratings to
reflect compliance performance.
72.     There are residual issues related to cost-recovery at the GP-level. Both community
contribution towards capital and O&M costs, and the tariff collection efficiency were lower than
the targets for JNP I and II. These issues could not be addressed by Project closing and are likely
to impact scheme sustainability.
73.     The task team was involved in a dialogue with GoK to define KRWSSA’s role and
significant efforts were made to build the agency’s capacity. However, KRWSSA’s role in the
new institutional set-up remains unclear (See Section 3.2).
74.    One important aspect of the Bank's performance and contribution was the continuity of
the Task Team, including the TTL and other key sector specialists, from project inception
through completion. This continuity ensured consistency, and facilitated dialogue with the
government to resolve implementation issues.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
With a Moderately Satisfactory rating for Quality at Entry and a Moderately Satisfactory rating
for Quality of Supervision, overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75.     GoK’s commitment to the decentralized service delivery remained unchanged despite
three government changes during the project period. As planned, GoK also set up the new
KRWSSA, staffed it fully, and enabled it to operate with full autonomy. However, the post-
Project role of the agency is unclear and GoK has included no provisions to scale-up or
mainstream KRWSSA.
76.     Counterpart funds were provided in a timely manner and sufficient resources made
available for all activities. Necessary directives (Government Orders) were issued for the project
and the sector to work efficiently. In particular, GoK established: appropriate levels of review
and approvals; financial accountability and follow-up mechanisms; authorization of expenditures
before they were incurred; and, periodic review of all documentation. GoK deliberated
extensively on ‘sustainability’ and formulated a long term sustainability framework. However,
the cost recovery from Project interventions is uncertain, and no measures are in place to address
these issues. As a result, the financial sustainability of schemes is uncertain.

                                                20
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
77.     The project includes two implementing agencies: KRWSSA at the state level, which
provided apex support; and ZP- DSUs at the district level and GPs at the village level. KRWSSA
excelled in its functions and went beyond its mandate to become a water supply and sanitation
leader in the State. However, at the district level performance was uneven, with a few districts
lagging behind consistently throughout the Project. KRWSSA had to put in substantial efforts to
ensure that the districts accorded approvals as well as made payments in a regular and proper
manner. Significant efforts were required to secure accounting information for reimbursements
claims. Despite these efforts, both the community contributions towards O&M and the tariff
collection efficiency remained low. Project staff, especially the Chief Executive Officer of the
ZP (who was also the Project Manager) was burdened with a number of other activities and
responsibilities. Based on the varying performance at State, District and Local level, the
Implementing Agency performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
With a Moderately Satisfactory rating for government performance and a Moderately
Satisfactory rating for implementing agency performance, overall Borrower performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.
6. Lessons Learned
The lessons emerging from this project are as follows:
78.      Decentralization. In order to implement decentralized RWSS service delivery, strong
institutions and political will is needed at State, District and GP level. For JNP I and II, the
presence of KRWSSA at the State level, and technical support from ZP for local governments
was essential for successful implementation. The success of such a model requires significant
Bank dialogue with government (as well as technical assistance support) before project
effectiveness. It is also necessary to build adequate time and flexibility into the design of RWSS
projects.
79.     Ensuring sustainability. The project was able to establish a culture of paying for water
and also used the sustainability monitoring index to assess completed schemes across several
parameters, however many GPs were unable to establish sustainable cost recovery mechanisms
and, as a result, tariff collection targets were not met. This is linked to larger sector issues
regarding scheme sustainability, which needs to be systematically thought through and
addressed across other RWSS projects. A Sustainability Framework was established under this
Project. Such a framework, backed up by legislative support, is necessary to ensure consistent
and uniform implementation of RWSS Projects across the State.
80.    Capacity building. RWSS projects that implemented in a decentralized environment
should build in additional time to enhance capacity of the lowest tier of local government
agencies. For JNP I and II, GPs lacked experience in managing water schemes and required
extensive training to perform procurement, financial management, and M&E functions.
Ultimately, this led to some implementation delays.



                                               21
81.    Community Management: Community management is difficult to implement for MVS
schemes, and can lead to implementation delays as seen in JNP I and II. For RWSS projects that
include MVS, it may be necessary to spend time addressing these challenges before the schemes
are implemented, or explore other management strategies.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
82.     Annex 7 provides a summary of the Borrower’s ICR. The report was very well prepared,
drawing on a strong evidence base. The overview of the project design and assessment of its
implementation and outcomes are consistent with the ICR. The Borrower’s evaluative comments
are highlighted the following: (i) the project improved the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Sector in Karnataka; (ii). The Bank’s role was highly valued and a good working relationship
was established between Bank staff, GoK and implementing agencies; (iii) the importance of
maintaining and enhancing decentralized service delivery piloted under this Project. The
Government of Karnataka had no comment on the draft ICR shared with them.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
Component A: Community Development and Infrastructure Building (Village Level)
The component on Community Development and Infrastructure Building includes the following sub-
components:
A.1.1 Community Development Support
The sub-component mainly caters to recruiting the services of over 22 Support Agencies during Jal
Nirmal Project. The SAs provided support to GPs and project communities in technical, financial
and management aspects. During the AFP, 16 additional SAs were recruited to provide technical and
social support for 18 MVS. For the AFP, instead of SAs to support SVS, technical agencies were
recruited to provide engineering surveys. Individual consultants and coordinators at the district level
also supported the GPs.
KRWSSA took the necessary steps to ensure that the SAs were from different parts of the state and
had the necessary skills to support project activities. Immediately upon selection, KRWSSA
provided training to the selected SAs to enable them to gain understanding on the project objective
and the expected outcomes. SAs later carried out similar training programmes at the district level.
A.1.2 Women Development Initiatives
The sub-component mainly catered to providing training for women to enhance their participation in
water supply and sanitation activities. The aim was to enable women to serve as “change agents” for
hygiene behaviour. Additionally, under this component, women’s groups were encouraged and
supported to establish of sanitary marts. This increased household latrine construction substantially,
as the required materials were available in villages, reducing the cost of transportation.
Other key achievements under this sub-component are indicated below:
         A total of 37,551 training programs were held across the project area to train over 333,897
          women. The training programs were conducted by the SAs. In addition to training
          opportunities, women also participated in 96 exposure visits, and 971 cross learning
          programs.
         Self Help Groups (SHGs) were set up in each participating village.
          Over 28 sanitary marts and 31 supply chains were established in the project region between
          2002 and 2005.
         Over 80,000 women are members of VWSCs, constituting 35% of all members under the
          JNP and close to 50% under the AFP. Women hold at least 392 executive posts in the 4,806
          VWSCs formed under the project. In a number of villages exclusive women’s committee
          were also set up for monitoring and evaluation.
A.2       Infrastructure Building
This sub-component mainly focused on building water supply schemes, implementing groundwater
recharge measures, promoting community sanitation and household sanitation including constructing
household latrines and providing smokeless chullahs, and improving drainage and lanes. The
physical progress covering the various elements of this sub-component are as follows:

                                                    25
A.2.1 Water Supply Schemes:
A total of 3,273 schemes were implemented to provide water supply to over 4,322 villages in the
project area. A variety of technologies were utilized to meet the site-specific requirements. The
achievements under this subcomponent surpassed the targets at appraisal and for the AFP by 122%
and 109%, respectively. Private household connections were provided on an on-demand basis with a
mandatory requirement for the household to fund the cost. At project completion, over 60% of the
households in the Project area have private household connection.
The water supply schemes were implemented using a variety of technologies to ensure that they were
site-specific. More importantly, community concurrence was ensured through extensive
consultations prior to the selection of the technology. The array of technologies utilized is discussed
later in this annex.
A.2.2 Groundwater Recharge Measures:
A total of 1,419 groundwater recharge measures were implemented to augment groundwater levels in
a number of schemes. These measures included check dams, infiltration galleries, and point recharge
structures. Under the AFP, 92 point-recharge structures that use v-wire technology were
implemented.
A.2.3 Sanitation
A total of 322,938 household latrines (229, 000 in KRWSSP I) and 93,938 (under the AFP) were
constructed against a total target of 356,476 (204,000 in JNP I and 152,476 in JNP I), respectively.
Additionally, a total of 207 community latrines were constructed under the JNP against a target of
700. Under KRWSSP I, 1,735 institutional latrines were built for schools and GP offices against a
target of 700; under the AFP, 2,260 against a target of 2,700 were built. Upon the launch of Total
Sanitation Campaign in April 2005, the role of KRWSSA was continued in promotional activities for
constructing HHLs.
In addition, 422,104 smokeless chullahs (336,000 in JNP and 86,104 in the AFP) were commissioned
for Project area households.
A.2.4 Drainage and Lane Improvement
Drainage and lane improvement was one of the critical infrastructure building measures that was
implemented under the. A total of 1,750 drainage and lane improvement works were carried out
across all Project villages. The drainage and lane improvement works have led to improvements in
the immediate living environment around the households and has provided an incentive for the
community to participate in the Project.
A.3    Indigenous Peoples Development Program
The Bank policy on indigenous peoples outlined in its Operational Directive (OD) 4.20 was
successfully implemented in the project. The OD 4.20 stipulates that the Indigenous Peoples in the
region benefit from the project and, any potential adverse effects from the project should be avoided
or mitigated. In order to address issues related to inclusion, equity, accessibility and for the
empowerment of social and sub-social groups living in the Project district, the Integrated Tanda
Development Plan (ITDP) was developed and implemented. In line with the Bank Policy, the ITDP
involved community development and infrastructure building in settlements inhabited by identified
indigenous peoples, including the Lambanis living in Tandas and Siddis in Siddi habitations of Uttara
Kannada.



                                                  26
About 424 settlements were selected based on selective targeting and prioritizing. As part of IEC
campaigns between 2002 and 2005, 112 films screenings, 51 cable shows, 50 audio programs, 133
wall paintings and 15 folk-media programmes were conducted in the districts of Dharwad, Gulbarga
and Haveri. Additionally, over 315 awareness campaigns and 11 exhibitions were conducted for the
benefit of the Lambinis to familiarize them with institutional arrangements emerging from the
project. In each of the identified settlements, all the infrastructure components viz., water supply
schemes, groundwater recharge, community and household sanitation, smokeless chullahs, drainage
and lanes were implemented.
The project has successfully completed infrastructure building activities in all selected settlements.

Component B:Institution Building

The component on Institution Building includes the following sub-components:

B.1     Project Management
This sub-component financed investments and operating costs of KRWSSA and the DSUs housed in
the 11 ZPs. The investment costs covered procurement of office-equipment, vehicles, and a range of
consultancies for technical assistance, including M&E, SHP, Training, Audit and Construction
Quality Surveillance.
B.2     Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion
The three distinct elements of Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion (SHP) - personal hygiene,
household hygiene and community environmental sanitation - were achieved by implementing it as a
social-marketing program. A SHP Consultant was appointed to finalize the strategy formulation and
production of IEC materials. A total of 2,379 training and dissemination workshops for key
stakeholders, including for Anganawadi workers, GP / VWSC members, and other professionals
involved in the project. A hygiene education professional, who worked under the guidance of a state
level specialist, was placed in each project district to promote behavior changes in communities.
These promotional activities have added to the positive effects from building 332,478 household
latrines and providing 422,104 smokeless chullahs.
Sanitation and hygiene promotion resulted in achieving 93 % increase in sanitation and 146%
increase in use of smokeless chullahs, as compared to the situation at appraisal. Further, the SHP has
resulted in improved hygiene behaviour among the households in the project villages.
B.3     Capacity Building
This component financed costs to build the capacity of stakeholders of various institutions. The
target groups consisted of policy makers in the government, staff of KRWSSA and associated
government departments, staff of ZPs, TPs, SAs, grass-root level participants encompassing GPs, and
other user groups. More than 58,041 (40,682 under JNP and 17,359 under AFP) training programs
were conducted against a target of 24,465 (4959 for JNP and 19,506 in AFP). 98% of the
participation in these programs was from stakeholders at the district level and the GP level. The
project also included specific training programs to build capacity to implement multi-village water

This sub-component financed three key things for GPs – (i) implementation of small-developmental
works in 369 GPs; (ii) procurement of office equipment, including computers, printers and copier on
an as-needed basis by KRWSSA and RDPR; and (iii) personnel for account management.
Component C:             Sector Strengthening (State Level)
The component on Sector Strengthening supported new roles that the government had to carry out as
a result of the Project.

Component C has six sub-components.
C.1    Creating Enabling Environment
Under this sub-component, over 96 advocacy workshops were held to disseminate the sectoral
reforms to a wider audience. The advocacy workshops were attended by over 3,069 participants
from government, private sector, NGOs, citizen groups and community organizations. Additionally,
representatives from KRWSSA, RDPR, PRED, GPs and VWSCs participated in exposure visits to
other projects to gain an understanding of reform effectiveness. In addition, the project generated
publications including a Technical Manual, Procurement Manual, and Finance Manual and “We,
Our Water, Our Life – Best Practices in Community Water Management” for use by other programs
across the country. KRWSSA also hosted a website for dissemination of the project’s performance
for the benefit of public in general and project stakeholders in specific. A study was carried out to
determine the institutional arrangements for ensuring sustainable rural water supply and sanitation
facilities. As part of the study, a long term sustainability framework was developed. The
dissemination of reforms and creating greater awareness was performed effectively through these
activities.

C.2     Sector Information Management System (SIMS)
This sub-component supported the design of a system to scale up the sector information management
system. A number of computers and other equipment were procured to modernize the sector
information management system. The SIMS helped the project achieve a two-way flow of
information between the state level policy makers and the district and GP members. This allowed for
effective policy formulation and improved O&M. Under the AFP, GP coordinators and accounting
firms were also employed, to enable smooth flow of information between the GPs and the state. A
management control was also instituted through the use of internal auditors.

C.3      Continuous Learning
This sub-component enabled the state to monitor sustainability and pilot alternate institutional
models to formulate a long-term sectoral strategy and an action plan for its implementation. Under
this sub-component, four consultancy studies were performed to conduct research and experimental
activities to learn from the project experiences and achieve continuous improvement in sector
performance.
Additionally, KRWSSA participated in a number of tri-partite Portfolio Review (TPR) meetings
during the term of the project. The TPR meetings were held once in six months at various locations
across the country. The participants at the TPR meetings included representatives from the
Department of External Affairs (DEA) GoI, World Bank, New Delhi and the States. The TPR
meetings were an opportunity for the participating states to share their project-related experience and
learn from one another.

C.4    Goods and Equipment


                                                  28
This sub-component enabled the state to procure a range of state-of-the-art equipment for scientific
water prospecting. Under this sub-component, vehicles and other equipment were also procured and
professionals were trained in their use.

C.5     Water Quality Monitoring
Providing high-quality potable water was one of the key benefits envisaged from the project. The
project institutionalized water quality testing and also involved the Chief Executive Officer of the ZP
and the District Health Officer of the ZPED. Under this sub-component, each of the project districts
was provided with quality monitoring equipment. Approved private testing agencies and laboratories
were used to conduct water quality tests.

C.6      Piloting water quality affected habitations
The AFP focused on providing improved water supply in quality-affected habitations. To support
this, various technologies such as solar membrane filter, SCADA, solar pumps, mobile filtration
units, geo-membrane units and V-wire technology were implemented under this sub-component.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

     1. Project Benefits and Rate of Return estimated in PAD
The project planned for investments in: (i) water supply infrastructure; (ii) sanitation facilities; (iii)
capacity building as well as capacity support to the communities and local self-governments; and (iv)
other managerial costs. Economic analysis in the PAD was based on generating data from 23
proposed schemes, and drawing samples from different sources of water supply and technologies.
The analysis focused on quantifying benefits from: (i) time savings in fetching water; (ii) the
incremental water consumed; (iii) health benefits from reduction in diarrhea and gastroenteritis
diseases; (iv) time saved as a result of household latrines ; (v) time saved resulting from improved
‘chullhas’; and (vi) value of capital and O&M costs saved. On average, a household spent 1.37
hours/day on water collection and the expected time savings was 0.81 hours/household/day after the
project. The incremental water consumption, as a result of improved availability, estimated as the
difference between the designed supply (49 liters per capita per day (lpcd)) and the current
consumption (34 lpcd), was 15 lpcd. With regard to household latrines and ‘chullhas’, it was
expected that time saving will be for 25% of the households only. The benefits from reduction in
morbidity of diarrhea and gastroenteritis (GE) and reduction in mortality from GE had been
considered rather ‘conservative’. Estimations were made as a result of both direct and indirect costs
associated with the two diseases- value of the labor days lost and the treatment costs. Benefits and
costs were forecasted over a 20 year horizon. Switching values were calculated using the 12%
opportunity cost of capital in India. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) estimated for the project
was 21.4% for the whole project (all costs and benefits) and 29% if drains and lane improvements
were excluded. ERR of water supply alone was estimated at 24.6%.
2. The ICR economic analysis closely followed the appraisal methodology. Economic values
generated by the Jal Nirmal Projects I and II16, emanates from a representative randomized sample17
of 300 schemes, spread across the two phases.1819 The set of stakeholders was defined so as to
include beneficiaries of these 300 schemes and a proportionate percentage of project team and
partner resources20. Tangible and non-tangible socio-economic benefits created by the projects were
identified, and where possible, values of tangible benefits were quantified over 10, 15 and 20 year
time horizons21. Different time horizons were considered as it became evident that some of the
technologies, especially GW based schemes, may not sustain beyond 15 years. Only the surface
source based schemes seem to have a potential to sustain up to 20 years. The data was collected
through primary survey and corroborated by community discussions. The data on health benefits was
further corroborated by discussions with medical practitioners A discount rate of 12.5% was used for
calculation of ERR. Given the differential impact of the various technological options, the cost
benefit analysis segregated benefits by technology and computed the weighted average based on the

   Schemes selected are representative of districts, the different types of schemes and technologies used
18
   To exclude nascent schemes in their period of morphosis towards stable forms, only schemes which had been
operational for at least one year were allowed to compete for selection in the random sample.

   Proportionate to the share of these 300 schemes in the total budget of JNPI and JNPII. The approach was premised
on VIP based participatory rural appraisal methods which also included structured interview scheduling with 1000
households.
21
   Assuming a uniform 20 year horizon was found impractical in respect of certain technologies and hence three
different durations were considered. Further, instead of extrapolating benefits of all schemes to a particular point in
time, benefit streams of schemes were considered to begin from the respective year of commencement of operation

total project value. The analysis has been conservative in estimating benefits and liberal in
calculating costs. As a result, the net Project benefits are expected to be higher.
    2. Costs and benefits
Economic analysis of investments draws from: (i) the primary information gathered from additional
benefits accrued to user community; and (ii) from secondary information on the costs.
2.1 Costs
Costs considered for economic analysis include:
    1. Direct capital investment in infrastructure development for water supply and sanitation, and
       lanes and drains; including costs incurred on community development, women development
       initiatives, and indigenous peoples development programs
    2. Costs for institutional development, capacity building, strengthening of PRIs and VWSCs,
       and promotion of sanitation and hygiene
    3. Costs incurred on program management including: (i) expenses on dedicated institutional
       resources and proportionate expenses on non-dedicated resources, and (ii) expenses on wages
       and salaries of dedicated team members (e.g. KRWSSA and DSU), and proportionate
       expenses on non-dedicated staff (e.g. PRI staff, ) engaged in program management
    4. Costs incurred on operation and maintenance of infrastructure and systems, including costs
       incurred by VWSCs or other agencies on levy and collection of user charges

2.2 Benefits
The project resulted in tangible and non-tangible benefits. The tangible benefits of the project include
savings in time, avoided cost of medical expenditure from illness, avoided wage loss due to illness,
and utility gains from increased water supply. The intangible benefits include women’s
empowerment, increased school attendance, particularly for girls, and improved social status for
marginalized communities. The analysis computes value of three of the tangible benefits from those
mentioned above. The intangible benefits are listed in a tabular format, recognizing that, while these
are important but no attempt has been made to quantify these.
Tangible benefits
       Time Savings: Members of the households had to spend time walking to fetch water, often
        making several trips through the day. The project has provided household connections, and as
        a result, residents no longer have to spend as much time fetching water. As a result of the
        Project interventions, user families are spending 30 minutes to 3 hours per day less on water
        collection, as compared to the pre-project situation. The gross benefit has been computed
        using the formula “time saved per household” x “adjusted daily wages” x “households in the
        community”.
       Avoided cost of medical expenditure: The consumption of drinking from unsafe sources
        was a health hazard to the community. Project interventions resulted in safe piped water, and
        led to reduced instances of water borne diseases. As a result, average households’ medical
        expenditure reduced. After the scheme implementation, the medical expenditure per family
        per month reduced from RS 300 to Rs 100. The gross benefit has been computed using the
        formula “reduction in household expenditure” x “households in the community”



                                                   31
        Utility gain from incremental water: The project was undertaken because the consumers
         were not receiving adequate quantity of water supply. Water usage increased from the pre-
         project numbers of 30 to 40 LPCD, to 55 LPCD after the project. The increase in water
         availability is expected to have resulted in utility gain. The computation of utility gain is a
         complex process, requiring expensive surveys to discover its true value. For the sake of
         simplicity, the analysis assumes that price for operation and maintenance of water supply
         systems, for which collection rate is 90 percent or above, is a suitable proxy for the utility
         gain. This understates the true value of utility gain but is consistent with the principle of
         computing benefits conservatively.


Intangible benefits
The following are the intangible benefits from the project22:
        As the project adopted community based decentralization approaches, huge capacity has been
         built in the local communities and PRIs in areas such as procurement, financial management,
         and contract management. PRIs also interface with external agencies, which is useful for both
         the project as well as other development activities.
        The project enabled empowering vulnerable sections of community and women to take part
         in local governance and other developmental process. Capacity building and engagement in
         the VWSCs has allowed women to take part in O&M of schemes as well as other
         developmental activities beyond water supply and sanitation.
        Improved school attendance due to less time spent fetching water. This also results in better
         prospects for higher future income.
        As a result of the project, 25 to 40 % of the households have constructed and are using HHL.
         This not only saved time, but also ensured privacy and dignity, particularly for women. In
         addition, around 66% of the households are using smokeless chullahs, which has reduced
         respiratory problems.
        Sector strengthening activities, especially, technological innovations, have improved the
         overall RWSS sector in the State.
        Due to improved services, Project villages have reported inward migration of retired persons
         and of residents form nearby towns. This may also increase property value and improve
         investments in the districts.
        Creation of new job opportunities, especially for private sector consultants, NGOs, and other
         social entrepreneurs, due to program activities including for O&M of schemes.
        The Project activities led to an improved environmental sustenance due to artificial recharge
         of source aquifers.

     3. Economic Returns of the Project
At credit closure, the project has benefited 1,871,240 people spread across 625 GPs in 11 districts of
the State. Economic benefits have been mapped for 15 years for simple (Gravity and Ground Water
based schemes) and 20 years for large/complex surface water schemes. Against a project cost of
US$ 356.50 million, the ERR for the project at credit closing is estimated at 29%, with Borewell-

   These intangible benefits are real and do reflect true values. However, they do not lend themselves to valuation. It
is difficult to derive or assign a figure.

based SVS recording as high as 40%, and surface source schemes at 23-33%. The NPV of the project
(at an assumed discount rate of 12.5%) works out to INR 1,911 million, which translates to US$35
million (at INR 55 to a US$). In comparison, these values are higher than the estimates from the
project conceptualization. An ERR of 22% had been estimated assuming a uniform horizon of 20
years for all technologies.

The analysis reveals significant differentials across the various technologies as well as districts.
Overall, ERR ranges between 8 to 40% (Table-2). Several factors contribute to the significant
differentials: (i) the heterogeneity in the pre-project situation in water availability status; (ii)
population to be served and the geo-physical situation; (iii) technology adopted; and (iv) distance
from the source. Lower returns are understandable in the case of Gravity and ITDP schemes as they
are isolated settlements and households are quite small. One significant determinant was the time
horizon. Returns on investment declines significantly if the time horizon gets reduced (to 10 or 15
years), emphasizing the importance of an effective O&M system.

Details of costs and benefits considered
Estimated cost: The cost of JNP I & II was Rs 9,296.675 million and Rs 9,398.million, respectively.
JNP I schemes are completed and being managed by user communities for the past 3 to 10 years.
Most schemes under JNP II are also complete; however, O&M has started recently. The ERR is
estimated based on the entire Project cost including the construction costs, which vary with schemes
and districts. Other costs included in the calculations are for capacity building and community
development. The per capita cost of community development is Rs. 194 and Rs 525 for JNP I and
JNP II, respectively, for and capacity building, it was Rs.213 for JNP I and Rs. 240 for JNP-II.
O&M costs include: electricity, manpower and others consumables such as disinfectants and minor
repair and replacements.

Time savings: The absolute time saved has been gathered on an annual basis from residents of
Project villages. The time saved by a household varies from 1 to 3 hours per day in different
schemes, depending on the pre-project situations. It also includes the reduction in time spent
commuting for, collecting, and waiting for water as compared to the pre-project situation. To assign
an economic value, total time saved is multiplied by the minimum wage rate for agricultural labor.
The benefit from time saved is estimated based on the rate adopted in the JNP I PAD, which was
Rs. 24.4 per day( in 2000-01) and then compounded based on the price index for agricultural
laborers. For estimation of return, the time saved is compounded for an entire village, which is
converted into working man days of eight hours. As the opportunity cost is limited and water
collection was usually done by non-working family members and at odd time, the time saved has
been reduced to 25% of the estimated person days for arriving at an opportunity cost for economic
activities.
Incremental water: Water availability in scheme villages during pre-project was estimated at 40
LPCD. Project design is for delivery of 55-70LPCD. The user community is getting benefitted from
the increased water supplies. Incremental water availability gets reduced during the summer seasons
by about 20% due to drying of source and inadequate power supplies. Hence, incremental water
availability is estimated for 200 days. The benefit accrued is estimated by equating production cost of
water at the rate of O&M cost for the scheme.
Reduction in household cost of illness: The increased availability of water has influenced the user
community to improve consumption and maintain healthier lifestyles, which has reduced the
morbidity and medical expenditure. The primary survey showed that an average Rs 150 to Rs 300
per household per month is being saved on medical bills in villages where the Project was
implemented. This reduction in medical expenditure varied between schemes and districts and it is
one of the tangible benefits from the schemes.

1.0 Project Information
Government of Karnataka (GoK) implemented the World Bank assisted Karnataka Integrated Rural
Sanitation and Water Supply Project covering 1,104 villages in 12 districts (became 16 districts after
bifurcation) districts across the state during 1993-2000 (Cr. 2483-IN). Based on the encouraging
results of the 1st World Bank project, GoK took up the Second World Bank Assisted Karnataka Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Project namely JNP I to cover a target of 2,500 villages coming under
700 Gram Panchayats (GPs) of 11 districts in North Karnataka. Encouraging from the success of Jal
Nirmal Project, GoK sought additional financing from the
World Bank for implementing the demand of community
for additional schemes. Adopting the same objective,
principles, institutional arrangement and implementation
strategy as the JNP i.e. more of the same, the additional
financing project covered another 1,600 villages in the
same 11 districts of north Karnataka. The Jal Nirmal
Project and the AFP ushered the state into a new era of
reforms in the rural water supply and sanitation sector
especially in terms of demand-response approach,
community participation, devolution of responsibilities to
the Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs), cost-recovery, 100%
financing for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and
ensuring sustainability of services, among others. This
summary reflects the completion of the Second Karnataka
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project implemented
between February 2002 and June 2010. (Hereinafter
referred to as JNP or JNP I) and Project under
Additional Financing implemented between July 2010 and
June. 2014 (hereinafter referred to as JNP II).

3.0 Project Development Objectives
The project assisted GoK in: i) Increasing rural communities’ access to improved and sustainable
drinking water and sanitation services and its sustainability; and ii) Institutionalizing decentralization
of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) service delivery to Gram Panchayats (village
governments) and users’ group.
4.0 Project Components
There are three main project components. Each project component has a few sub-components. The
details of the main project components include the following;
Component A: Community Development and Infrastructure Building (Village Level)
This component involves providing support to community and user groups in social, technical and
management aspects of planning, design, implementation and operations of water supply and
sanitation facilities. The component comprised following four sub-components: i) Community
Development Support ii) Women Development Initiatives; iii) Infrastructure Building; iv) Integrated
Tanda Development Program (Lambanis and Siddis)
Component B: Institution Building (Project Level)
This component involved constituting VWSCs as sub-committee of Gram Panchayat and
strengthening the Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) in planning, design, implementation and
maintenance of water supply and sanitation facilities. The component comprised the following four
sub-components: (i) Project Management; (ii) Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion; (iii) Capacity
Building; (iv) Panchayat Strengthening.

Rules of Engagement
The project conceived democratic procedures called rules of engagement which have been adopted in
the selection of villages. The rules of engagement include the following:
          I.   Demand Driven Development: The project adopted a Demand Driven Approach that
               required that the communities must demand their desire for water services.
         II.   GP Selection Criteria: GPs were included in the project by adopting a self-selection
               process, a prerequisite of demand driven development. All the GPs in the project area
               that agreed to the project rules were eligible to apply.
        III.   Village Selection Criteria: The criteria for selection of villages to participate in the
               project included obtaining an agreement from the villages to adhere to project
               approach and rules. However, those villages that had a baseline supply level of 55lpcd
               of safe water were not eligible to participate. Further, in JNP II, the priority was given
               to villages having water quality issues.
        IV.    Community Contribution and Cost Recovery: The participating communities took
               the lead in implementing rural infrastructure schemes including water, sanitation, lanes
               and drainage through mandatory contribution to all construction and operating costs of
               water and sanitation systems.
6.0 Institutional Arrangement


                                                     42
GoK had the overall responsibility for managing project implementation. The institutional
arrangement of the project is shown below:

     State Level      Sector Strengthening Program           KRWSSA with GoK

The institutional arrangement envisaged for the project revolved around the PRIs being the prime-
mover of the project covering all stages. However, the PRIs were provided support from the various
government agencies at the state and district level including KRWSSA, PRED and RDPR. Further,
the PRIs were provided additional assistance through the SAs, consultants and NGOs who were
recruited by KRWSSA to work with the PRIs on specific schemes. Karnataka is the first state in the
country to involve the three-tier PRIs to create a vital service to the rural community.
Implementation Mechanism
The JNP’s Bottom-Up implementation model has ensured required convergence of acts and actors
partnering in project implementation. This has substantially improved the sustainability of schemes
implemented under the project. The Bottom-Up model for the project implementation is depicted in
Figure below:




                    Bottom-up Implementation Model for JalNirmal Project
Implementation of the project started slowly and gathered pace after the successful completion of the
pilot stage and finally exceeded the coverage targets.

The table included above reveals, more than 90% schemes fall under likely to highly-likely
sustainable categories which means schemes are providing water on daily basis and management of
schemes (technically, institutionally, socially and financially) is satisfactory. The reasons affecting
schemes to fall under ‘Un-Certain’ or ‘Un-Likely’ sustainable categories, as emanated from the
assessment, are being addressed locally making the schemes to move to higher sustainability level.
7.4 Development Objective – 2
Achievement of DO 2 can be seen from the results on the ground that shows that successful
decentralization has been accomplished by aligning the services with the existing three-tier PRI set
up – Zila Panchayat, at the district; Taluka Panchayat (TP) at Taluka; and Grama Panchayat (GP) at
the village level. Additionally, it confirmed the viability of the project’s demand - approach in which
the GPs and VWSCs make decisions, procure materials, carry out construction, manage funds, share
in the capital cost and manage the system operations with their own resources. Project GPs, hitherto
used to handling funds of the order of a maximum of Rs. 500,000, today, are managing construction
funds ranging from Rs. 5 million to Rs. 10 million. The entire civil works costing Rs. 800 Crores
were devolved to the GPs and has been managed by GPs efficiently. In summary, there is ample
evidence to demonstrate that GoK has : (i) decentralized WSS related decision making to the GPs
and user groups; (ii) this is adequately backed up by financial devolution; (iii) transferred all the

                                                   49
corresponding functionaries to the ZPs and TPs who in turn provide technical assistance to the GPs;
(iv) transformed the role of all apex institutions, including the Government Departments from that of
a ‘provider’ to a ‘facilitator’; and (v) capacitated and enabled GPs achieve operational sustainability
by appropriate tax/ tariff fixing and collection mechanisms.
As a part of the project, over 37,551.training programs have been organized by KRWSSA to train the
VWSC / GP members in procurement, financial management, construction supervision and operation
and maintenance of the schemes. As a result, 40% of the schemes have been implemented by the
community.
The GPs have successfully accomplished institutional responsibilities by closing civil works
contracts and obtaining complete documentation including No-Due Certificate and As-Built
drawings from the Contractor. Further, proper accounting and recording procedures have been
followed by the GPs diligently. The community contributed to the extent of Rs. 87.2 Crores during
JNP and Rs. 61.49 Crores in JNP II towards scheme capital costs. At this time, over 4,404 VWSCs
are carrying out the O&M responsibilities effectively as per the bye laws since scheme
commissioning including revising, levying and collecting water tariff from the consumers. The

GoK, GP and User’s community contribution to the project increased from approximately 15% that
was envisaged at project start to 27.7% at project close on JNP I and 18% on JNP II. An amount of
US$12million was returned to the Bank to meet the emergency assistance required for Tsunami
Rehabilitation Project during JNP I. Additionally, an amount of US$12 million was returned to the
Bank during JNP II as well because the fluctuation in currency exchange ratio resulted in the surplus
funds being available for the project. The overall expenditure for JNP I and JNP II are provided
below:

8.0 Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion
The three distinct elements of Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion (SHP) viz., personal hygiene,
household hygiene and community environmental sanitation were achieved by implementing it as a
social-marketing program. The sanitation and hygiene promotional activities have had a positive
effect in the project villages as 332,478 household latrines were constructed and 422,104 smokeless
chullahs were provided under the project. As such, sanitation and hygiene promotion resulted in
achieving 93 % increase in sanitation access and 146% increase in introduction of smokeless
chullahs with respect to baseline situation. Other aspects related to sanitation are given below:

9.0 Capacity Building
The project has implemented a comprehensive capacity building programmes for various
stakeholders of the project. The target groups consisted of policy makers in the government, staff of
KRWSSA and associated government departments, staff of ZPs, TPs and SAs and grass-root level
participants encompassing GPs and other user groups.
10.0 Gram Panchayat Strengthening
The sub-component financed costs towards implementation of small-developmental works within
GPs, procurement of equipment for office facilities for GPs and personnel for account management
within GPs. As a part of the project, small-developmental works were implemented in 369 scheme
GPs.
11.0 Sector Strengthening (State Level)
The component on Sector Strengthening to support the new-roles that the government has to carryout
includes the six sub-components which are; (i) Creating Enabling Environment; (ii) Sector
Information Management System; (iii) Continuous Learning; (iv) Goods and Equipment; (v) Water
Quality Monitoring; (vi) Piloting water quality affected habitations.
12.0 Benefit Assessment
The project’s major contribution include (i) Availability of time for villagers; (ii) Additional income-
generating activities; (iii) Improved health status; (iv) Procurement of local materials as an added
benefit for local economies; (v) increased project implementation experience for GPs and VWSCs in
internationally accepted procurement mechanisms; (vi) Increased demand for project activities in
non-project villages, as a result of which GoK requested JNP II; (vii) Improved family well-being
through household water connections; (viii) Improved scheme ownership and accountability through
O&M.
13.0 Key Highlights and Significant Achievements
Array of Technologies
Technology has been an integral part of the project activities. In order to overcome certain
shortcomings in meeting the demands of water supply to certain pockets within the villages /
habitations, and also meet the requirements of group of villages / habitations, multiple technologies
have been adopted, including (but not limited to) gravity schemes, piped water supply, and surface
source schemes. Multiple treatment methods were also used including pressure filter, micron filter,
lamella filter, solar condensation unit and a mobile ultra-filtration purification unit. Other
technologies used were Scada Systems for Monitoring Water Supply, Pico-Micro Hydro Power
Generation, Solar-based Water Pumping Systems and Solar-based Stand Alone Water Purification
System.

14.0 Social and Environmental Management
Considering social and environmental issues in rural infrastructure projects were almost non-existent
prior to the start of the JalNirmal Project. The project set a new direction for the introduction of
social issues in decision making. Towards this, the World Bank guidelines on social management
have been utilized. Some of the key social issues include the following;
   i) Community participation in deciding on the particular technology for water extraction and
        treatment viz., Asoga Village, Belgaum District;
   ii) Participation of women in VWSCs viz., 33% of the VWSC members are reserved for
        women; (GoK has raised the quota to 50%);
   iii) VWSCs participate in construction activities;
   iv) Establishment of water quality testing labs and conduct of water quality tests on a regular
        basis;
   v) Construction of covered drains for draining storm-water runoff and sewage from households;
   vi) Wastewater treatment plant was also constructed as part of the project viz., Hulikoti Village
        to showcase the possibility of utilizing treated water for agricultural purposes.
15.0 Private Sector Participation
The project set a new horizon for the participation of private sector as they are engaged in many
development and welfare activities at the grassroots level and upwards. During the project, the
services of individuals (subject specialists), NGOs, SAs and Chartered Accountants were procured
on consultancy basis at State, District and GP level as the case may be for assisting project
implementation including quality monitoring. Apart from these professionals, services of State Level
Consultancies for Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion and Training Management have also been
procured. In addition to SA, provision has also been made for SAs to have partnership with NGOs in
the specific areas of community development. The participation of both government and private
sector in RWSS schemes has resulted in the owning the assets by the bottom line PRI and the user’s
community.
16.0 Women’s Participation
In order to ensure effective mobilization and participation of women, the project has made a separate
component on Women Development Programme. This has focused on institutional development,
inclusion and empowerment. Towards this, by-laws of VWSC provide 33% reservation for women in
the committee in the project villages. This provision has enhanced the women’s capabilities across
board including decision making in water and sanitation activities. Further, to enhance the capacity
of women for active participation in the project various levels, 192251 (33%) women have been
trained in the project villages. Women are involved in O&M of water supply schemes as caretakers
of pumps and pump houses, bill collectors, conducting water quality tests etc.
17.0 Community and GP Contribution
Community and GP both have shared partial capital cost of the JNP, which resulted in developing
sense of ownership of the assets created in the project villages and also reflected significantly in
managing the schemes locally with user charges. Achievement of the project (JNP-1 & JNP II) in this
regard is represented below:

18.0 O & M Outsourcing
The demands of communities for save drinking water enormously increased; JNP opted for multi
village schemes. These schemes required technical and financial support to sustain O & M.
KRWSSA’s persistent effort, GoK approved the O & M Policy in September 2012. The O & M
Policy provides for: (i) establishment of a Sustainability Fund; (ii) out-sourcing of the Common
Facility (CF) of Multi GP/Village water supply schemes; (iii) a transparent subsidy, particularly, for
meeting the power charges; and (iv) full cost recovery of the operational expenses to be achieved
over a period of eight years. The O&M of the CF of the Mamdapur MVS in Belgaum District is
being performed by a private agency for the last three years and their contract has been renewed for a
further period of three years. The performance of the Mamdapur MVS under the O&M outsourcing
policy is provided below.

       2         Power Charges        Power charges have been reduced on an average of
                                      27% per year as against estimated by supplying treated
                                      water as per the requirement of the community.
       3         Water Tariff         Household Connection = Rs. 50/= per month;
                                      Stand post = Rs. 25/= per month.

Mamdapur scheme was visited by two foreign country delegates which are Bangladesh and France.

19.0 Reinvestment on Schemes
Reinvestment on schemes has done towards construction of infrastructure or enhancement of service
delivery. The investment includes the following;
    i) Upgradation to piped water supply from the multi-village source;
    ii) Expansion of distribution line to include additional households;
    iii) Drilling of additional bore wells and construction of new open well etc.;
    iv) Arranging of express feeder line to existing SSI scheme;
    v) A total of Rs.93.61 lakhs and 8.5 lakhs is invested in U. Kannada and Raichur district
         respectively for various infrastructure facilities and repairs;
Reinvestments on existing RWSS schemes implemented under the JNP showcases not only the
acceptability of the schemes by the communities but also their willingness to provide a share of the
fund requirements towards capital infrastructure and / or enhance service delivery.

   20.0 Cost Recovery
   The project, for the first time, introduced reforms in RWSS sector that envisaged community
   ownership and management of water supply schemes. The PRIs have realized that efficient recovery
   of O & M costs on a regular basis is essential for effective service delivery. Two major costs for O &
   M of the schemes have been found to be towards salary to the scheme operator and cost for repairs to
   the pump-set and electrical installations. Each GP / VWSC is allowed to fix the monthly tariff and
   devise their own methods for recovery of tariff. The average cost recovered is in the range of 50% of
   the total estimated monthly charges. Many PRIs have not been able to establish sustainable cost
   recovery mechanisms. However, the project in general has definitely been successful in inculcating
   the culture of paying for the water services among the people. District wise cost recovery status both
   for JNP1 and JNP2 is given below:

      21.0 Financial Management
      JNP envisaged that GPs are the focal point for implementation of the scheme and payments to the
      works. The stakeholders for the project were the community, GPs and GoK. Hence, the Financial
      Management system to meet the funds flow to the GPs and the accounting was put in place for
      proper maintenance of accounts at all the levels and reliable and timely flow of funds and accounting
      information from the GPs to DSUs and in turn to the KRWSSA at state level.
      22.0 Source of Funds
      The funds come from the World Bank, Government of Karnataka, Gram Panchayat / Community
      contribution.

      23.0 Procurement Management
      Procurement arrangements have been in accordance with the Bank’s procurement guidelines, making
      the process more effective and efficient. To ensure the consistency in procurement and for
      mobilization of works, project prepared a Procurement Manual. The implementing entities have
      followed the procedures laid in the procurement manual for its procurement activity. A Procurement
      Cell was established at the Head Office to oversee the procurement happening across the 11 districts.
      Adequate training programmes were organized to all technical and non-technical and social staff of
      Districts, including President of JCs, SAs and presidents of GPs in case of big Surface Source
      Regional schemes. During trainings, emphasis was on contract management and contract closure to
      avoid legal complications in future. Robust procurement information system was established within
      the project MIS to have effective, efficient and transparent procurement systems. The records were
      maintained at both District and GP level. Details of procurement undertaken in the JNP under various
      procurement methodologies are given below:

24.0 Reporting System
A regular reporting system was adopted under the project for ensuring proper flow of accounting
information from the GPs to the DSUs and to the KRWSSA. For this, district wise designated
Chartered Accountant firms provided accounting support to the GPs and furnished a consolidated
statement of financial transactions in the GPs along with the transactions at the DSUs level. Further,
all district-wise financial transactions were consolidated at state level and these reports were
processed for Project Progress Appraisal to the WB and for reimbursement of project expenditure.
25.0 Best Practices
   i) Google awarded village for best O&M of water supply scheme by user community in
        Shiraguppi village of Belgaum district where VWSC makes live telecast of its meeting.
        100% house hold connection and 1005 water tariff collection.
   ii) Belwadi village of Belgaum district: O&M of water supply is managed by community with
        100% house hold connection and 100% tariff collection. User community deposit monthly
        water tariff directly to the O&M account in the local bank.
   iii) Determination makes decision a reality – Hulkoti Village, the only village in the State
        (Gadag district) with water supply scheme and UGD system
   iv) Excellent example of community management - Iddalahonda village of Belgaum district
   v) O&M of Multi Village Scheme – Mamadapur MVS, Belgaum district
26.0 Government Order and Policies Initiated
    i) Government Order on State Policy for Operation and Maintenance of Rural Drinking Water
         Supply Schemes dated 26.08.2011 (provided in Annexure V);
    ii) Government Order on Operation and Maintenance Outsourcing dated 12.03.2013 (provided
         in Annexure VI);
    iii) Circular on Responsibilities of VWSC towards Operation, Maintenance and Management of
         RWSS schemes dated 02.12.2013 (provided in Annexure VII);
    iv) Government Order on creation of State Water Supply and Sanitation Department dated
         04.03.2014 (provided in Annexure VIII).
27.0 Return on Investments
The analysis on the Return on Investments (RoI) made in JNP was conducted by Ecorys (India)
Private Limited. The analysis on the return on investments made in JNP is based on the primary
information gathered on the benefits accrued to user community on implementation of schemes and
from secondary information on the costs. The analysis is considered for 15 years for ground water
schemes and 15- 20 years for surface source schemes with a discount rate of 12.5%. For surface
source based schemes, ROI has been estimated for 20 years as theses have sustainable sources. The

                                                  59
ROI estimated for 20 years higher ERR for SSI scheme and at equal level for SSR and MVS
schemes.
28.0 Long Term Sustainability Framework
JNP has provided opportunity to understand the various spectrums of the process required for
community based demand driven rural water supply and sanitation project. Over the years, the
project has demonstrated successfully the philosophy of demand driven project. Success lies with the
decentralized three-tier system of PRIs. Advocacy workshops, exposure visits, hands on training,
capacity building programmes, regular IEC activities at the grassroots levels have sensitized the GPs
/ VWSCs / user groups to realize their lead role and understand the importance of managing RWSS
facilities in a sustainable manner. Additionally, the complexity of managing MVS has given rise to a
need for the GoK to provide a suitable policy framework that addresses the key issues involved in
ensuring effective delivery of RWSS services. Towards this, studies were conducted to determine
the sustainability status of the schemes in terms of technical, financial, social and institutional facets.
29.0 Institutional Study
An institutional study was also conducted to determine the best possible institutional arrangement for
ensuring an effective service delivery system. The project enabled the GoK to develop an O&M
Policy under the umbrella of a long-term sustainability framework that addressed technical, financial,
social and institutional aspects of sustainability. Further, the GoK created a State Water Supply and
Sanitation Department to exclusively deliver water and sanitation services to the people living in
rural areas.

30.0 Lessons Learnt
Following are the lessons learnt during the implementation of the project:
 i)    The change of the Government perception from its role as a “provider” to “facilitator” of
       service is essential to successfully deepen the a bottom-up approach for implementing water
       supply and sanitation schemes;
 ii)   Introducing an innovative approach such-as demand-driven approach resulted in the
       identification of villages that had critical water supply service issues including accessibility,
       scarcity and quality.
 iii) Participatory approach facilitated the communities to exercise “voice & choice” for
       improved services and ownership;
 iv) Decentralized governance is the key to bring in transparency and accountability in
       implementing schemes;
 v)    The role of PRIs is critical to improve efficiency and achieve sustainability of water and
       sanitation service delivery;
 vi) Utilizing un-biased criteria for selection of schemes is important to ensure acceptance and
       eventual success of the scheme;
 vii) Sustainability of any scheme can be enhanced when schemes promote ownership, flexibility
       in design, appropriate tariff setting and simplicity in operation and maintenance;
 viii) Active participation of communities has established organic linkage among stakeholders and
       facilitated inclusive development and sectoral reforms;
 ix) Communities’ willingness to contribute to capital costs and pay for services is often much
       higher than expected especially when a demand-based approach is utilized to implement
       schemes;
 x)    Communities and user-groups need assistance in planning and implementing schemes and
       deciding how to operate, maintain and manage these schemes through regular training,
       exposure visits and peer-to-peer learning programmes;


                                                    60
 xi)   Women participation is the key to increase acceptability of any water supply and sanitation
       scheme as women tend to have a major say in decision making in such aspects and are in a
       better position to facilitate community actions;
 xii) Achieving lasting and sustainable project outcomes depend on the degree of attention paid to
       gender considerations, sanitation and hygiene promotions;
 xiii) Vulnerable groups need to be identified and their view needs to be incorporated in project
       design to ensure that these groups receive the intended benefits from the project;
 xiv) Participation of the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in all phases
       of the project can be enhanced and alternative ways of packaging participatory and
       construction activities should be considered to improve service.
 xv) Better ways for ensuring spare parts availability in the local market should be developed.

31.0 Looking Forward – RWSS Sector in Karnataka
Sector Strategy developed as part of the project has an underlying principle that the success of rural
water supply and sanitation services is in maintaining a focus on sustainability rather than speed of
implementation. Towards this, the GoK and the executing agencies has recognized that IEC activity
is a vital element and gives particular emphasis to making people fully aware of the relationship
between water supply, sanitation facilities and health. Also, the sector strategy is underpinned by the
principles of allocating decision-making and management at the lowest appropriate level, and
emphasizing the participation of women in management.
As a way forward, the GoK has issued orders to form the State Water and Sanitation Department
under the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Department with an exclusive focus on planning,
design, implementation and operation and maintenance of rural water supply and sanitation services.
In the immediate future, the GoK’s focus shall be to operationalize the Government Order and
disseminate the decision through issue of necessary executive orders describing the roles and
responsibilities of RDPR, the new RWSS Department, KRWSSA and PRIs (GPs, ZPs, VWSCs, etc.)
as far as RWSS activities are concerned. Additionally, the RWSS Department shall focus on
continued enhancement of the overall capacity of district and local institutions in carrying out all
stages of activities in providing effective water and sanitation services to the rural population.
Further, the GoK policy encourages private participation in water and sanitation sector particularly in
community development, technical assistance and operation and maintenance services.

32.0 Contribution of the World Bank
The project has extremely benefited from the contribution of following members of the World Bank
Team which visited Karnataka at different stages of implementation of the project.
The World Bank support to the project is encouraging. The Bank has regularly offered critical
suggestions for improving project implementation. The WB supervision missions have been taking
place at regular intervals. The team members of the supervision mission were renowned experts in
different areas who provided high-quality of technical and managerial advice on several issues,
including technical, financial management, implementation, procurement, water sector, environment,
social etc. Upon completion of the missions, the Bank shared the Mission Field Visit and Aide
Memoires which greatly helped in guiding implementing agencies to realize project outputs and to
comply with agreed actions time to time.
The WB’s norms and guidelines for quality control mechanism were effective to improve quality of
work. The Bank assisted and guided the field engineers and staff from time to time to achieve
quality in construction. The Bank’s mission played a vital role of a facilitator and partner in
development which has had a healthy impact on the borrower. Additional financing provided a boost

                                                  61
to increase water supply and sanitation coverage and enable the Borrower meet the overwhelming
demand from the project districts. Another important outcome of the Project is the establishment of
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Department with a specific focus on achieving sustainable water
supply and sanitation services in the rural areas of the state. Supervisory mission of the Bank
provide valuable guidance and support for creation of this apex body. The reimbursement of funds
was smooth and timely.
A very good working relationship was established and continued throughout the project period
among the Bank staff, the GoK and the implementing agencies. The Supervision Missions played a
supportive role in the Community Development and formation of VWSCs in the respective schemes.
The technical advice and support provided by the successive missions contributed to identification
and timely resolution of several implementation issues.
33.0 Conclusion
This project has immensely improved Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector in Karnataka
through its strategic interventions namely principles, polices, implementation strategies, institutional
mechanism, community participation modules, capacity building programme, private sector
participation, cost recovery, monitoring and evaluation system, external support etc.
