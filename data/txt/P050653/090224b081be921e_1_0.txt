                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1.   Project has achieved substantial physical and financial progress during the past eight months. All Infrastructure Works, planned under the project (aggregating to 1,000) have
                         been procured and a good number of them are already completed. As against a total of about 500 Single Village water Supply Schemes (SVS), 369 or 74% are completed. All the
                         Road & Drainage Schemes (481) have been completed. All the 18 Multi Village Water Supply Schemes (MVS) contracts have been awarded and are under various stages of
                         completion.

                         2. Number of people expected to be benefited from the project would be about 2.98 million--1.78 million from improved access to water supply and 1.20 million from improved
                         sanitation.
                         3. As of now, the Bank’s credit assistance is available up to end June 2013. By this time, it is expected that all single village water supply schemes will be completed. As regards
                         multi village water supply schemes, ten of them will be completed and the remaining will spill beyond June 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         (i)    Multi village water supply schemes – Progress continues to be slow. This necessitates continued monitoring and resorting to mid-course corrections.
                         (ii)   Energization – Several water supply schemes have been completed and many are about to be completed soon. There are substantial delays in securing power supply
                         connections affecting the project completion schedule. Assurances have been given that this issue will be taken up with the Electricity Supply Companies and resolved.
                         (iii) GP/ VWSCs Leadership Change – In accordance with the Karnataka PRI Act, following a two year period, Chairpersons of Gram Panchayats have changed. In turn,
                         membership of the Village Water Supply Committees Single Village Schemes and Joint Committees of Multi Village Schemes have changed. So, there is a need to re-orient the new
                         leaders. Capacity Building Programs will be revised to provide for orientation programs.
                         (iv)   Sustainability Framework-- Operation and Maintenance Policy has been approved recently and the same needs to be operationalized. As a first step, GOK will issue a
                         Government Order to make it effective in the field.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
