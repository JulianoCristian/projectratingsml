"The Command Water Management Project\n            will demonstrate the high return to be obtained from a\n            comprehensive approach to irrigated agriculture by providing\n            complementary investments in the physical and institutional\n            aspects of water management in seven sub-project areas in\n            the four provinces of Pakistan.  To this end, it will\n            develop water management techniques replicable in other\n            areas of the country; build within the relevant provincial\n            agencies a capability for planning, implementing, operating,\n            and maintaining integrated, efficient programs of irrigated\n            agriculture; and strengthen farmer participation in water\n            user associations.  Financing will be provided for canal\n            rehabilitation and remodelling, drainage, on-farm water\n            management, project management, training, and technical\n            assistance.  Some 50,000 farm-families on about 500,000 ac\n            of irrigated land will benefit directly from improved water\n            resources and management, as well as deliveries of other\n            agricultural inputs and services."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
