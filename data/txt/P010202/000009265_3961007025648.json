"The outcome of the Command Water\n            Management Project for Pakistan was marginally satisfactory.\n            The project achieved most of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was modest, sustainability is\n            likely, and both the Bank and Borrower acted satisfactorily.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            while designing projects for canal command area development,\n            institutional constraints should be carefully diagnosed, and\n            resources and activities focused on achieving declared\n            objectives. Second, a project aimed at raising agricultural\n            production must delineate a structured role for agricultural\n            extension services. Third, integrated management of\n            irrigated agriculture needs a radical reorientation away\n            from compartmentalized line agency thinking. Fourth,\n            expatriate technical assistance must be closely integrated\n            into the objectives and operations of the project. Lastly,\n            water scheduling intervention promoted by expatriate experts\n            must take into account that the Indus Canal System is water\n            scarce by design, and farmers tend to maximize income per\n            unit of water by expanding crop area rather than applying\n            optimum amounts of water to crops."}, "docdt": "1994-08-08T00:00:00Z"}
