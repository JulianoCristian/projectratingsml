will demonstrate the high return to be obtained from a\n            comprehensive approach to irrigated agriculture by providing\n            complementary investments in the physical and institutional\n            aspects of water management in seven sub-project areas in\n            the four provinces of Pakistan. To this end, it will develop\n            water management techniques replicable in other areas of the\n            country; build within the relevant provincial agencies a\n            capability for planning, implementing, operating, and\n            maintaining integrated, efficient programs of irrigated\n            agriculture; and strengthen farmer participation in water\n            user associations. Financing will be provided for canal\n            rehabilitation and remodelling, drainage, on-farm water\n            management, project management, training, and technical\n            assistance. Some 50,000 farm-families on about 500,000 ac of\n            irrigated land will benefit directly from improved water\n            resources and management, as well as deliveries of other\n            agricultural inputs and services."}, "docdt": "1984-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
