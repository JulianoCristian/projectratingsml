INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR AN IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of US$12.2 million to help
finance an irrigation rehabilitation project. The loan would have a term of
25 years, including 7-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum.
Of the proceeds of the loan, $1.0 million would be relent to the National Bank
of Tunisia (BNT), on terms and conditions to be agreed with the Bank following
completion of an agricultural credit policy review presently being carried out.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Tunisia" (EEA-51a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 14,
1972. A basic economic mission visited Tunisia in February and March 1973;
its report will be distributed shortly. An updating economic mission visited
Tunisia in November, 1974; its report is now in preparation. The main con-
clusions of the report of the basic economic mission are reflected below.
Country data shieets are attached (Annex I).
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural re-
sources. Muchi of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agriculture is highly
dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality and, apart from
phosphates, limited in quantity. In the mid-1960's, petroleum was discovered
and has since become an increasingly valuable source of revenue and export
earnings. Industrial development has been handicapped by the small size of
the domestic market, as well as a lack of skills and experience. Tourism has
developed rapidly and workers' remittances have become a significant item in
the balance of payments. Per capita income increased by 4.4 percent annually
between 1961 and 1972 to reach a level of $382. Tunisia has enjoyed a large
amount of external aid and has used this to expand economic and social infra-
structure, broaden the industrial base, increase the rate of growth, and make
available a wide range of social and welfare services to a large part of the
population. Like most developing countries, however, it has not yet found
adequate ways to eliminate unemployment and poverty and to achieve a balanced
distribution of consumption araong income groups, between urban and rural areas,
and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central planning
of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a major
role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services. Foreign
exchange shortages and preoccupation with restraint of inflation led to re-
course to a pervasive systenm of official price determination and administra-
tive controls. An unusually long series of poor crop years due to shortage
of rainfall slowed down growth of output. Many of the investments in public
enterprises proved to be uneconomic and private initiative in most sectors



- 2 -
except tourism and petroleum was weak. Growth was relatively slow until 1970,
but was combined with the development of infrastructure and a high degree of
domestic price stability.
5.        The Government's present development strategy was introduced after
1969 and forms the basis of the current Fourth Plan, 1973-1976. The principal
objectives are (a) accelerating growth based on export-oriented industries,
mainly by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct Government involve-
ment in production and relaxing administrative regulations; (b) easing the
country's unemployment problem by creating new jobs primarily in the expanding
industrial sector, but also by encouraging worker emigration, reducing popula-
tion growth and improving education and training; and (c) maintaining internal
and external financial stability. The target rate of GDP growth is 7.1 percent,
providing for a 5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption. In-
vestment is projected to increase by 70 percent above Third Plan levels. Na-
tional savings are to finance three-quarters of investment. Exports of goods
and services are projected to grow at 8.8 percent per year at constant prices
and imports at 12.2 percent. An increase in net external capital flows of
almost 100 percent over 1969-1972 average levels would be required, with ex-
ternal capital providing 23.5 percent of total investment; the debt service
ratio would be held to below 20 percent. The Plan targets may be conservative
in terms of both growth and savings potential, and are affected significantly
by the impact of the changed petroleum and phosphates situations on the
Tunisian economy (paragraphs 7 and 8).
6.        The annual growth rate of the gross domestic product over the decade
1961-1970 was 4.5 percent. A remarkable upsurge has taken place since 1970,
with GDP growing in real terms by 9 percent in 1971, and 18 percent in 1972.
The improvement can be attributed in part to exogenous factors such as good
weather, leading to record cereal crops and a three-fold increase in olive pro-
duction, in part to important growth in several areas (tourism, petroleum and
emigrant workers' remittances) which previous policies had fostered, and in
part to the general reorientation in Government policy since 1969, generating
renewed self-confidence and initiative in the private sector. By 1972, the in-
vestment rate was 23.6 percent of GDP compared to 20.8 percent in 1970; domestic
savings were 21.1 percent of GDP compared to 16.3 percent in 1970, reducing
Tunisia's dependence on external borrowing from 31.6 to 13.6 percent of in-
vestment. The balance of payments has improved steadily since 1967, with the
current account deficit dropping from about D 60 million up to 1967 to D 23
million in 1972. The traditional negative net payments balance was reversed
in 1968, and at the end of 1973 net foreign assets amounted to $256 million,
covering 5.5 months of commodity imports.
7.        Following the very rapid expansion of t}he economy in 1972, the growth
rate slowed in 1973 to an estimated 2.8 percent. Agricultural output fell
by 11.6 percent from the very high 1972 level, increases in production of
cereals and livestock offsetting only part of the expected drop in olive pro-
duction. Growth may be about 9 percent in 1974. The Government is attempting
to maintain its past success in controlling inflation, though there are in-
creased pressures arising from the higher level of investment, the build-up



-3-
of foreign exchange reserves and the increased cost of imports. Assuming no
major recession in developed countries, Tunisia's gain from the rise in petro-
leum and phosphate prices should more than offset foreseeable adverse external
developments on tourism earnings, workers' remittances and other exports due
to events abroad. Export earnings from petroleum are projected to increase
threefold from $110 million in 1973 to some $310 million in 1974; phosphate
prices have also risen sharply. A continued build-up of reserves may be ex-
pected over the next several years. A substantial reduction in the net rate
of emigration, originally projected at 20,000 per year, could have serious
repercussions on unemployment and income, particularly in rural areas, unless
energetic measures are taken to increase labor absorption in other sectors.
8.        The increased foreign exchange reserves and Government surplus ex-
pected from higher export prices and consequent tax revenue do not call for
a basic revision in development strategy but suggest that Tunisia could step
up its efforts to achieve higher investment and growth rates and increased
employment, and to depend less on emigration and foreign aid. The main con-
straints are likely to be the speed at which policies and institutions re-
spond to the challenge and projects are prepared and executed. The new
orientation since 1969 and the improved economic situation provide the Gov-
ernment with an opportunity to step up efforts to achieve its declared social
objectives, including greater impact on unemployment.
9.        Tunisia has made some impressive social gains.   By 1971, primary
school enrollment had reached 73 percent and secondary enrollment 42 percent
of the relevant age-groups. Public health services have been greatly expanded
with many provided free, a family planning program introduced and social secur-
ity services provided to an increasing proportion of the labor force. Public
social expenditure, both current and capital, has increased at the rate of
9.3 percent per year and accounted for 11.4 percent of GDP in 1971. Nonethe-
less, major social issues remain. Further progress is needed in land reform.
Wide regional and income disparities are persistent and there has been a grow-
ing concentration of productive activities in urban areas. Job creation has
not kept pace with the growth of the labor force, and in 1972 the unemploy-
ment rate was estimated at 18 percent in the non-agricultural sectors.
10.       During the 1960's manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
8 percent annually. There was a remarkable 30 percent further increase in
1972 due in part to a record year for the olive oil processing industry.
The early thrust of industrialization was supplied by large import substitu-
tion projects in the state sector. These suffered, however, from the limited
domestic market and shortages of experienced staff and management. Under the
Fourth Plan, private manufacturing investment, particularly in textiles,
fertilizers and metals transformation, is expected to average D 25 million
per year between 1973 and 1976, compared with D 12 million in 1972, and to
account for two-thirds of total investment in manufacturing. Foreign private
investors have been offered incentives and are expected by Tunisia to contri-
bute, through finance, know-how and overseas marketing, to the creation of com-
petitive industries producing a wide range of exports. Tunisia's preferential



-4-
trade agreement with the EEC, currently being renegotiated, also gives it some
advantages. Preinvestment work, and the preparation of programs for re-
equipment and modernization in priority subsectors have been started. Tunisia
aims to develop petroleum-based industries and production of phosphoric acid
and other phosphate derivatives for export, while possibilities for metal
manufacturing for export are being explored. The Government has recently
established a special fund to encourage growth of small industries and indus-
trial decentralization.
11.       The development of tourism is relatively recent.   Foreign-visitor
arrivals in Tunisia reached 780,000 in 1972, with an annual rate of growth over
the period 1961-1972 of 30 percent -- higher than any other Mediterranean
country. Earnings from tourism are now a main source of foreign exchange,
reaching US$154 million in 1973. While 1973 saw a drop in the number of visit-
or nights, and 1974 is also expected to be a poor year for tourism, the long-
term outlook is favorable. The Government actively supports expansion through
incentives to private hotel promoters and has recently embarked on long-term
tourism infrastructure and hotel training programs, with support from the Bank,
IDA, and KfW.
12.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has received large amounts of external
capital. Official aid amounted to an average of US$19 per capita per annum,
almost half from the United States, mostly in the form of program loans and
PL 480 commodity aid. Other major lenders were France, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Italy, Kuwait and the Bank Group. Project loans, particularly for
public enterprises, accounted for 58 percent of total disbursements in 1969-
1972. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms: from 1969-1972, the
average terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were 2.3 percent interest and
27 years to maturity, including 9 years of grace; from multilateral sources
5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including 6 years of grace.
For private borrowing (about $40 million annually), average terms were 6.0
percent interest and 9 years to maturity. Direct foreign private investment
in Tunisia has been limited. However, mainly as a result of increasing out-
lays on petroleum exploration and development, it has risen from an average
of $19 million per annum in the late 1960's to $40 million in 1972.
13.       Tunisia's total external public debt was $1,108 million (of which
$693 million were disbursed) at the end of 1972. Disbursed debt is estimated
to have been $862 million at the end of 1973. The debt service in 1973 is
estimated to have been 12.7 percent of exports of goods, non-factor services
and workers' remittances. The ratio is expected to fall significantly by 1976,
following recent petroleum and phosphate price increases. Government policy
on future external borrowing in the light of its new balance of payments po-
sition is still under review. Tunisia is capable of servicing substantial
additional debt on less concessionary terms than it has received in the past.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
14.       Starting in 1962, Tunisia has received a total of nineteen Bank
loans and ten IDA credits amounting respectively to $218.5 million and $65.7
million, net of cancellations and refundings. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of October 31,
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       While there have been some problems in project execution, as in the
railways, agricultural credit and family planning projects, on the whole
project implementation has been satisfactory. Important institutional improve-
ments have been achieved. In both the transport and public utilities sectors,
independent agencies have been created or strengthened.
16.       In accordance with Tunisian priorities, much past Bank Group lending
has emphasized support for long-term investments in infrastructure and social
development. Lending for transport, power and tourism infrastructure, has ac-
counted for 34 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in Tunisia. Lending for urban
and social development, including water supply, education and training, family
planning and the Tunis urban planning and public transport project, accounts
for a further 32 percent. Industrial and hotel financing through Banque de
Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET, formerly Societe Nationale d'Inves-
tissement) comes third with 17 percent. Finally, agriculture and fisheries
have received 9 percent of Bank/IDA commitments, and the most recently approved
Gafsa phosphate development project accounts for 8 percent of total commitments.
17.       Two more projects, for BDET and urban sewerage in the Tunis area,
are expected to be presented to the Executive Directors this fiscal year.
Future lending is expected to support the Government's policies aiming at
rapid growth in a more open, export-oriented economy, measures to create
employment and to achieve a more equitable income distribution, and institu-
tional reform. Like the project proposed in this report, the proposed lending
program will emphasize agriculture, including rural development. This will
require substantial inputs of manpower and technical assistance, to increase
production and support institutions which reach the rural poor. The project
proposed in this report is the first of a number of projects, expected to be
presented over the next several years, which address the problems of land
reform, organization for agricultural and rural development, and integration
of agricultural with other aspects of rural development. Urban and social
development will be furthered by a first operation in the sewerage sector
involving important organizational changes, while a third education project
would also be presented.
18.       Lending for industry has so far been largely through the development
finance company, BDET, and has mostly benefited medium-size companies. Such
lending will continue, but at a declining rate as BDET diversifies its sources
of funds. It was recently supplemented by direct industrial lending for the
Gafsa phosphate mining project. Later, further industrial projects may be



-6
proposed, for small-scale industries and in other priority subsectors, now
being studied with Bank technical assistance, in which Tunisia has a compara-
tive advantage. Two additional transport projects, for highways and railways,
may also be presented.
19.       The Bank Group accounted for almost 20 percent of disbursements of
official aid to Tunisia between 1969 and 1972 and is expected to maintain its
share, with that of the US declining and that of other, particularly Arab,
sources of funds rising. The Bank Group's shares in total debt outstanding
at the end of 1972 and in debt service during 1972 were 18 percent and 7 per-
cent respectively. Over the rest of the decade, the Bank Group's share in
total external debt is not expected to vary much; its share in debt service
will probably rise to approach the share of debt outstanding.
20.        IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in BDET, in COFITOUR (a
company to promote and invest in tourism projects), in RYM (a large hotel
development) and in a promotional company Sousse Nord which is preparing
plans for an integrated tourism resort development in one of the areas in
which tourism infrastructure is being financed jointly by the Bank, IDA and
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). IFC's most recent investment, in May
1974, was in Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce aluminum
fluoride from local fluorspar for export. IFC's net commitments in Tunisia
total $14.0 million.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN TUNISIA
21.       While less important, relatively, than in other Maghreb countries,
agriculture still dominates the Tunisian economy. It provides nearly half
of total employment, 35 percent of exports, and 18 percent of GDP. However,
exports represent only a small fraction of farm output. In contrast, agricul-
tural imports (mainly cereals, edible oils, dairy products, livestock and
sugar) have increased sharply over the past decade, representing about 22
percent of the value of total imports.
22.       Nine million hectares, or 55 percent of the country's land area, is
suitable for agriculture. Of this area, about 4.5 million hectares are cul-
tivable; the rest is range land suitable for sheep-grazing, and low-yielding
forest. The cropped area covers about 3.1 million hectares, with about 1.8
million hectares under annual crops, and about 1.3 million hectares under
perennial crops. The most important agricultural areas are the Lower and
Central Medjerda River Valley, the Cap Bon Peninsula, and the coastal zones
near Sousse and Sfax.
23.       Agriculture is the Achilles heel of the Tunisian economy.     Despite
major investments in the sector during the 1960's, agricultural production
stagnated, and the proportion of agriculture in GDP declined. In the period
1962-1964 agriculture accounted for 21 percent of GDP, while in the period
1970-1972 its share was 18 percent. Production increased rapidly in 1971,
and then again in 1972; 1973 saw a small decline from the record crops,
especially olives, in 1971 and 1972. The failure of agriculture to keep



pace with the rest of the economy in the 1960's may be attributed to unusually
low rainfall, the departure of large numbers of foreigners active in the sector,
the stress on investments in infrastructure and reforestation yielding benefits
only in the very long term, weaknesses in extension and other supporting ser-
vices, the failure to resolve a variety of land tenure issues, and the abortive
attempt to extend production cooperatives to the whole sector. In late 1969
the cooperative experiment was abandoned, and three separate, coequal forms
of organization were recognized: the state sector, consisting largely cf land
formerly owned by foreigners, now destined eventually to be distributed to
Tunisian smallholders; the cooperative sector, consisting of the remaining
land in cooperatives; and the private sector, consisting in large part of
land that had been brought into cooperatives but subsequently returned to
former owners.
24.       While the Fourth Plan does not define a clear strategy of agricultu-
ral development, it endeavors, with some success, to draw lessons from a decade
of centralized planning. It emphasizes directly productive investments, in-
cluding the rehabilitation of existing irrigation infrastructure, encourages
a higher level of private sector investment, and proposes to increase the
allocation of investment resources to livestock, fish, fruits and vegetables.
The access of small and medium-size farmers to credit is to be facilitated,
and the amounts of seasonal as well as investment credit are to be increased.
Security of tenure is to be improved, and other measures taken to enforce
existing land reform legislation. The Plan aims at an annual increase in
agricultural output of 6.2%.
The Role of Irrigation
25.       While Tunisian agriculture is largely extensive and rainfed, the
insufficiency of rainfall causes irrigation to play an important role in
diversification. Of the total cultivable area of about 4.5 million hectares,
the potentially irrigable area is about 200,000 hectares; the total area pres-
ently irrigable (that is, with water available at the farm boundary) is about
110,000 hectares. Of these 110,000, about 45,000 fall in public irrigation
areas, including the zones covered by the present project. From 1962-1971,
irrigation works absorbed 40 percent of public expenditures in the agricul-
tural sector; over this period the value of farm production on irrigated
land -- now about 20 percent of the total -- rose only from 20 to 28 million
dinars (1966 prices).
26.       Existing irrigation facilities are substantially under-utilized.
In the public irrigation areas, only about half the irrigable land is effec-
tively irrigated, and only about one quarter of the water available from the
main dams is used. The failure to make better use of past investments is due
to lack of experience by farmers with irrigated crops and the inadequacy of
the extension effort to deal with this problem; insufficient access to inputs
and credit; the failure to complete terminal works in some irrigation areas;
inadequate maintenance of facilities; and, above all, delays in the applica-
tion of land reform legislation. Most of the infrastructure in public irriga-
tion areas was planned and built for cooperative agriculture, and the change
in policies since 1969 has made resolution of land tenure problems central
to increasing the returns to these public investments.

PART IV - TIE PROJECT
Background
27.        In 1971 the Government of Tunisia requested Bank assistance in in-
creasing the returns to investments in public irrigation infrastructure.
Three priority zones for rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure and
intensive development of small-scale irrigated farming were identified by the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. Two of these areas, the Lower Medjerda Valley
and Nebhana, are the zones covered by the present project. The third, in
Central Tunisia, will be included in the Central Tunisia Integrated Rural
Development Project for which a detailed project request prepared by the
Tunisian authorities is now being studied.
28.       The present project was prepared by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.
It was appraised in November-December, 1973. Negotiations were held in
November, 1974. The Borrower was represented by Mr. E. Chelbi, Director of
Human Resources and Investments, Ministry of Planning. A report entitled
"Appraisal of Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- Tunisia" (No. 505a - TUN.),
dated December 10, 1974, is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. A loan and project summary is attached as Annex III.
The Project Areas
29.       The Medjerda and Nebhana projects are the two oldest public irriga-
tion investments in Tunisia. The French and US Governments financed feasibil-
ity studies for both in the 1950's. Construction of major works was completed
in the Medjerda in 1960, and in Nebhana in 1970. The water distribution net-
work in both areas is still under construction.
30.       The Medjerda Valley, in Northern Tunisia, has about 90,000 hectares
of potentially cultivable land, of which about 40,000 could be irrigated. It
is the best equipped area of the country for modern agricultural development,
including dry farming on a large scale. A ten year "Minimum Plan" for the
Medjerda, initiated in 1962, foresaw the development of 32,800 hectares for
irrigated farming. About 22,000 hectares have been equipped, but only about
10,500 hectares are presently irrigated. The Office for the Development of
the Lower Medjerda Valley, OMVVI, was established in 1958 as an autonomous
agency of the Ministry of Agriculture. Its functions include the equipment
of irrigated and dry land, operation and maintenance of the irrigation and
drainage networks in the area, and implementation, in cooperation with the
Ministry of Agriculture, of the 1958 Medjerda Valley agrarian reform legisla-
tion.
31.       The Nebhana project, in East-Central Tunisia, extends over a 130
kilometer-wide area eastward from the Sidi Messaoud Dam on the Nebhana River
to the Mediterranean Sea. The irrigation area covers about 5,000 hectares
net. Only about 1,800 hectares of this area are actually being irrigated.
The Office for the Development of Nebhana, OMIVAN, was established in 1973.
(OMVVMI had previously been responsible for Nebhana also.) It has functions
comparable to those of OMVVM.

The Project
32.       The objectives of the project, which follow closely the goals of the
Fourth Plan in agriculture, are to close the gap between potential and actual
use of irrigation investments; to raise incomes of small farmers; to increase
tenure security; to increase the accessibility and volume of credit available
to small farmers; to strengthen agricultural development institutions; and to
provide needed public services and improved housing for the low-income settler
farmers in Medjerda.
33.       The project will provide full development of about 10,300 hectares
in the Medjerda and about 2,000 hectares in Nebhana. In both sub-project zones
the project will encompass rehabilitation of the existing irrigation, drainage,
and road networks, establishment of windbreaks, supply of equipment and
machinery for operation and maintenance of the irrigation and road networks,
on-farm development, and consultant assistance to strengthen the project
authority. In addition, in the Medjerda area, the project will provide for
construction of about 370 farmhouses and works to provide 614 and 678 existing
farms respectively with electricity and drinking water; rehabilitation and
repair of existing rural centers (used to support the extension service) and
construction of new centers; housing for extension agents, and technical as-
sistance to support the extension service. Project elements specific to
Nebhana will be assistance of a consultant in land reform; some new irrigation
and drainage works; improvement of marketing services through provision of
field boxes, vehicles, and buildings; and feasibility studies for development
of irrigated agriculture over the remaining 3,000 hectares of the Nebhana area.
The integration of new investment, rehabilitation of existing structures, and
technical assistance is an essential element of the project in both zones.
34.       The Medjerda sub-project area covers about 20,000 hectares net, of
which 15,500 are fully equipped with irrigation and drainage facilities. Be-
cause of the need for more time for the application of the land reform legisla-
tion applicable to the privately held part of the sub-project zone, intensive
support by the extension service will be limited, under the present project,
to 7,500 hectares, made available by the OMVVM to 1,200 settlers under legisla-
tion governing the distribution of state-owned land to private individuals.
The Nebhana sub-project area covers 5,000 hectares; because further feasibility
studies are required, intensive development under the present project will be
limited to the 2,000 hectares of small farms with an average size of one hec-
tare, for which full preparatory work has been completed.
Project Execution
35.       OMVVM and OMIVAN will have overall responsibility for project execu-
tion in the two sub-project zones. Each will have the assistance of consultants
to aid in the establishment of final designs for project works, preparation of
tender documents and evaluation of bids (Project Agreements, Section 2.02).
OMIVAN will also recruit a senior advisor, to assist its Director in coordi-
nating all project activities (OMIVAN Project Agreement, Section 3.05). Within



- 10 -
four months of effectiveness, OMVVM and OMIVAN will establish project coordi-
nation committees, chaired by their respective Directors-General, to meet at
least quarterly to review past work, coordinate project implementation and
program future work (Project Agreements, Section 2.06). It is expected that
OMVVM will utilize the services of the public electricity company, STEG, and
the public water company, SONEDE, to execute the power and water supply com-
ponents. A major strengthening of the extension staff of OMVVM in the settler
area is foreseen; assistance from two extension specialists will be provided
under the Bank loan (OMIVAN Project Agreement, Section 3.03).
36.       In addition to the senior advisor, OMIVAN will engage a marketing
and cooperatives consultant, to support its management at its Sousse head-
quarters. An outside group of consultants will undertake the feasibility
studies (OMIVAN Project Agreement, Section 3.03). OMIVAN will create a special
team for the land reform program, which will be supported by a consultant spe-
cialist. It receives some technical assistance in extension work from Belgium,
and will coordinate the Belgian assistance with the consultant services provided
under the project (Project Agreement, Section 3.04). It will rely on the central
services of the Ministry of Agriculture for maintenance of the Sidi Messaoud
dam, the main pipeline, and major hydraulic structures outside of the irrigation
sections for which it is immediately responsible (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
Within six months of effectiveness, OMIVAN will complete a plan of action
acceptable to the Bank, providing for the strengthening of marketing services
within the Nebhana portion of the project area (OMIVAN Project Agreement, Sec-
tion 2.07). OMIVAN will also receive operational assistance from consultants to
aid in establishing domestic and foreign markets for the fruits and vegetables
to be produced under the project.
Credit
37.       Credit for on-farm development and related purposes is essential
to the success of the project. The Government's present agricultural credit
policies provide for low interest rates and relatively high downpayments. The
Government is undertaking an agricultural credit study (Loan Agreement, Section
3.04). The study will encompass a critical review of the conditions presently
governing agricultural credit in Tunisia and the structure of the institutions
concerned. It will propose new conditions for agricultural credit. During
negotiations it was agreed (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(c), and Schedule 1,
para. 4) to defer disbursements on the $1.0 million allocated under the loan
for sub-loans to project farmers until the conclusion of the policy review,
when an agreement acceptable to the Bank will be concluded between the Gov-
ernment and Tunisia's principal agricultural credit agency, the National
Bank of Tunisia (BNT).   This agreement will contain the conditions of on-
lending of IBRD funds to BNT and the terms of sub-loans to be financed in
part from Bank funds. It is expected that the Bank funds will be on-lent
to BNT on the same terms as the Bank loan to the Government. Should the
agreement not be concluded by February 1, 1976, the Bank would have the
right to cancel the credit component of the loan. Pending conclusion of
the agreement between the Government and BNT, the Government will finance
the credit component of the project entirely from its own resources.



Cost Estimates and Financing
38.       The project is estimated to cost a total of $23.8 million, with
a foreign exchange component of $12.2 million, or 51 percent.   The Medjerda
sub-project will cost $17.2 million, the Nebhana sub-project $6.6 million.
Overall, contingencies amount to 50.2 percent of base costs, including 9.1 per-
cent for physical contingencies and 37.7 percent for price contingencies on base
costs plus physical contingencies.
39.       The Bank loan of $12.2 million will finance the full foreign exchange
cost of the project. It will have a 25-year term, including 7-1/2 years of
grace matching the period of project implementation and loan disbursement.
The bulk of the proceeds of the Bank loan will be made available by the Govern-
ment as grants to OMVVM and OMIVAN (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(c)(iii)).
Counterpart funds remaining in the Central Bank from the sale of equipment
financed under the Cooperative Farms Project (Loan 484-TUN, Credit 99-TUN)
will be utilized for the local currency requirements of the project.
40.       OMVVM and OMIVAN maintain budgets and accounts which are under
constant external review by the controleurs financiers responsible to their
Boards and the Ministry of Finance. OMVVM and OMIVAN will maintain separate
accounts for the subprojects, identifying the water charges, purchase payments
by Medjerda settlers, and contributions of farmers to investments in irriga-
tion infrastructure (Project Agreements, Section 4.01). The controleurs
financiers will certify the agencies' annual financial statements, and prepare
reports on their financial condition for submission to the Bank. (Project
Agreements, Section 4.02) Since OMVVM and OMIVAN are, basically, service
agencies comparable to a government department, rather than financially
autonomous revenue-producing public entities, an audit of their accounts by
private auditors was not deemed necessary.
Procurement and Disbursement
41.       The civil works contracts are too small and disparate to attract
foreign firms, and will be tendered on the basis of local competitive bidding
or, in the event that this is impracticable, carried out by force account.
OMVVM will negotiate contracts, up to a maximum of $0.6 million, with Neyrpic,
S.A., of France, for specialized hydraulic equipment to replace similar equip-
ment manufactured only by this firm (Loan Agreement, Schedule 4, para. A (2)).
Contracts for livestock will be awarded after receiving at least three quota-
tions from suppliers for each contract. All other equipment for both sub-
projects will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines; in the evaluation of bids,
domestic suppliers will be given a margin of preference of 15 percent, or the
applicable customs duty, whichever is lower.
42.       The Bank loan will finance 39 percent of the cost of civil works,
representing the estimated foreign exchange component; 100 percent of foreign
expenditures for equipment, livestock and vehicles; 100 percent of foreign
expenditures for consultant services and studies; and 38 percent, representing
the estimated foreign exchange component, of seasonal credit and medium- and
long-term credit for fruit tree orchards, housing, stables, stilling and storage
basins, sprinkler irrigation equipment, and marketing suppo\t facilities.



- 12 -
Retroactive financing is recommended for up to $100,000, for flood damage
repairs carried out in 1974.
Land Reform and Cost Recovery
43.       The settlers' lots in the Medjerda range from 3 to 12 hectares, with
over three-quarters of the total holdings in the 5-10 hectare range. In
Nebhana, holdings range from 0.2 to 0.8 hectares in the coastal sections and
from 1.3 to 3.3 hectares in the inland sections; holdings are frequently dis-
persed in several non-contiguous plots. Joint ownership is common. The
cooperative system (para. 23 above) would have permitted the imposition of a
rectangular irrigation network, but its demise and the subsequent return to
a complex holding structure now necessitate land consolidation, realignment
of field boundaries and the imposition of maximum and minimum holding sizes,
to permit full use of the irrigation infrastructure. Technical assistance
provided under the project is expected to help accomplish this task.
44.       The legislation covering the two project zones contains detailed
provisions for minimum and maximum holding size, penalties for failure to
introduce irrigated crops, obligations to contribute to irrigation infrastruc-
ture investment, land consolidation, and registration and titling of holdings.
Implementation of the land reform legislation has been weak, and a major
objective of the project is to increase the security of tenure of the direct
beneficiaries of the project. During negotiations, the Government reviewed
with the Bank its timetable establishing dates for the initial collection
of investment contributions; preparation and delivery to project farmers of
certificates which serve as a provisional title and as collateral for invest-
ment credit; implementation of limits on the size of land holdings in the
project area; and implementation of requirements that project area farmers
irrigate their land. Before making changes in the timetable, the Government
will submit them to the Bank for approval (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
45.       The collection of charges -- entirely uncollected in the past from
Medjerda settlers and Nebhana farmers -- will be a crucial step towards an
economic approach to irrigation development. In the Medjerda area, settlers
will pay an average price of D 400 per hectare for their land, including the
irrigation infrastructure and other improvements made to it (OMIVVM Project
Agreement, Section 2.07). Some 600 Medjerda private farmers benefitting
directly from the project and covering some 3,000 hectares only pay invest-
ment contributions (the amount of which is fixed under Tunisian law) ranging
from the equivalent of 25 to 70 percent of the value of irrigable land and
in value from D 25 to D 140 per hectare, but they must finance the subsidiary
channels required to bring irrigation water to the farm. In the Nebhana area,
the contributions, fixed by decree, average D 650 per hectare but the state
constructs the irrigation infrastructure to the farm level. While the farms
are smaller in Nebhana than in the Medjerda, the greater cost of the irrigation
infrastructure and the considerably greater increase in land values associated
with the irrigation investments in Nebhana justify a higher per hectare pay-
ment. At a discount rate of 10 percent, the Medjerda settler payments and the
Nebhana contributions will provide a recovery index for project investments



- 13 -
of 77 percent for Medjerda, 93 percent for Nebhana, and 81 percent for the
project as a whole.
46.       The project authorities will fully recover the operation and mainte-
nance costs of the irrigation and drainage networks included in the project.
Operation and maintenance charges at an average rate of D 0.006 and D 0.008
respectively per cubic meter of water will initially be charged in Medjerda
and Nebhana. It was agreed that, in order to maintain full recovery of op-
eration and maintenance costs, water charges will be reviewed at not more
than three year intervals, and that the Bank will be informed of the results
of such reviews. (Loan Agreement, Section 4.04).
Project Justification
47.       The direct economic benefits of the project will be derived from in-
creased cropping intensity, increases in crop yields and crop diversification.
The aggregate economic return for the combined project is 28 percent, based on
a 35 year life. The rates of return for the Medjerda and Nebhana sub-projects
are 30 percent and 24 percent, respectively. In this analysis all costs in
the development of the two irrigation areas prior to the present project have
been treated as sunk costs. Were the sunk costs included in the economic
analysis, the rate of return on the project as a whole would be negative.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that, under the adverse assumption of a 25
percent increase in both capital costs and operation and maintenance, the
incremental return on the Medjerda sub-project would only fall to about 19
percent, on the Nebhana sub-project to about 18 percent.
48.       The project will have an important impact on the income of small
farmers in the two zones. The direct benefits will accrue almost entirely
to farmers with less than 12 hectares in Medjerda and one hectare in Nebhana.
Average farm income in the Medjerda settler area will increase by 142 percent,
in Nebhana by 153 percent. By accelerating the titling process, the project
will increase tenure security, encourage investment, and facilitate access to
credit. In addition to increasing self-employment of farm families by about
36 percent in the Medjerda area and about 53 percent in Nebhana, the project
is expected to double the demand for hired labor, and provide full-time
employment to some 3,000 persons.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. 94: Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1970; (current) December 31, 1974.
Physical execution of the project is almost complete. All project
schools have been accepted by the government from the contractors, virtually
all equipment and furniture have been purchased, and most of it has been de-
livered and installed. Despite early delays in the appointment of UNESCO ex-
perts and their counterparts in the Educational Planning Unit, an interim re-
port, including a diagnosis of primary and general secondary education and a
preliminary analysis of higher education, has been prepared. However, the
report does not cover vocational and technical training, education finance
and management, and administration of the education system. To allow for the
full utilization of savings and the completion of the technical assistance
program, a further extensioni of the present Closing Date is being considered.
Ln. 573: Port Development Project; US$8.5 million loan of November 29, 1968;
Closing Date:   (original) December 31, 1972; (current) December 31, 1974.
Construction is virtually completed and is satisfactory. Additional
studies on traffic, tariffs, and a master plan for Tunisian port development
will soon be finished.   The Borrower has financed all project costs from in-
ternally generated funds and the Bank loan. All loan and guarantee conditions
have been or will be met. Loan disbursements are expected to be completed
by the present Closing Date.
Ln. 581: First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973; (current) December 31, 1974.
Cr. 209: Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
Ln. 989: Third Water Supply Project; US$23 million loan of May 29, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Because of problems with locally manufactured asbestos-cement pipe,
completion of the First Project was delayed and the Closing Date of the Loan
was extended. Constraints resulting from lack of capacity in the local con-
struction industry will require that the Closing Date be set back by a further
six months. Final project costs are expected to be about 6% below appraisal
estimates (but 7% higher in dollar terms because of devaluation). The Second
Project is 12 to 18 months behind schedule for the same reasons as well as
because of initial delays in final design. Final costs may be about 5% higher
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems wlhich are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in protect execution.

than original estimates because of current inflation rates, but they will be
20%-25% higher in dollar terms.  Because of delays in execution, the Closing
Date will have to be extended. The loan for the Third Project has become
effective; procurement has begun and is on schedule.
Ln, 606: Railways Project; US$8.5 million loan andU US$8.5 million credit,
?r, 150:  both of June 4   1969  Closin  Date of loan:  (oniinal) December 31
1973; (current) December 31, 1975.
The project has been delayed botlh by floods (one year) and by finan-
cial difficulties (one vear).   It is now e.,c:..tad to be stinistantially completed
by December 31, 1974,  ThIe financial probLcz.-.- cwtri caused by non-payment of
freight charges by the railway's largest custotaer, the state-controlled Gafsa
Phosphate Company; operational deficits, due to low rates and fares; and higher
than estimated prices of rolling stock. The Government has undertaken to reim-
burse railway losses for 1972 and 1973. A new cost-based tariff was introduced
on January 1, 1974; traffic and operating results, however, have not improved as
expected, and continuing Government contributions to the railways and further
tariff increases will be required. A reallocation of the proceeds of the loan
and credit permitted the placing of all outstanding orders; cast increases of
about $6 million for items in the original list of goods are being financed by
utilizing a Spanish line of credit. The credit has been fully disbursed; the
Closing Date of the loan was extended to permit completion of project execu-
tion.
Cr. 238: Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976,
After a slow start, resulting in a 24-month delay, there has been
some progress in recent months, but several problens remain,   A new Director
General has recently been appointed to the National Office for Family Planning
and Population. Program performance, though showing signs of improving, is
still inadequate. An Association sector report incorporating a Four Year Plan
of Action has recently been forwarded to the Government. This, together with
the appointment of the new Director General, should assist in improving per-
fornmance. The total cost of the project is now estimated to be at least three
times the $7.7 million estimated at appraisal. The Association is consulting
the Government on the measures to be taken to deal with this situation, In-
tensified supervision of the project is being maintained.
Ln, 746: Highways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project execution, which fell behind schedule initially due to
lengthy Government procedures and changes in key personnel, is now proceeding
satisfactorily. Progress in reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads and
bridges is good. The estimated cost of the project has increased significantly,
mainly as a result of dollar devaluation. One major road section may be elim-
inated from the project. The Government has been requested to provide supple-
mentary funds to permit completion of the other project components.



ANNEX II

Ln. 779:  Agricultural Credit Project; UUS$5 million loan and US$3 million
Cr. 263:  credit, both of July 12, 1971; Closing Dates:     July 31, 1975.
Disbursements are behind schedule, especially for mechanization of
grain farms and for dairy farms, since the cost of imported cows has risen
and there is competition between Bank/IDA and Government subsidized funds.
This competition has resulted in financing of livestock operations by BNT to
farmers who should only borrow at the higher interest rates foreseen under the
Bank loan and IDA credit. A severe flood in Marclh 1973 also affected project
progress. Consultations between the Bank and IDA and the Government and BNT
are underway with a view to accelerating the progress of the project, and
solving the problem of competition between Bank/IDA and Government subsidized
funds.  Slhould agreement not be reached on this matter, the Bank and IDA may
have to consider cancelling the uncommitted portion of the loan and credit
foreseen for livestock development.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is now being actively implemented after earlier diffi-
culties and delays experienced in design of an economic project vessel suit-
able for operation by traditional fishermen. Problems were also encountered
in selecting the marine engine to equip the project boat. Although costing
100% more than originally estimated, the project boat is still economic be-
cause of sharp.increases in fish prices since appraisal. The demand for the
project vessel is also strong as it represents a significant improvement over
traditional vessels of the same quality and costs about 23% less than these
boats. It is expected that about 190 boats will be constructed under the
project, instead of the 335 provided for under the project initially.
Ln. 858: Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 million
Cr. 329: credit, both of September 28, 1972; Closing Dates: December 31, 1977.
The project experienced initial delays because of the time required
to adopt legislation establishing the public land corporation which is to ac-
quire land in the project zones for resale to investors. The development
studies for the six project zones, being executed by consultants, are almost
on schedule. Invitations for bids for some project works have been issued.
A study of Government incentives for investment in tourism is nearly complete.
Ln. 798: Fourth Development Finance Company Project; US$10 million loan of
February 9, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
Ln. 881: Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Closing Date:    March 31, 1978.
Disbursements under Ln. 798 are slightly behind schedule, while
disbursements under Ln. 881 are ahead of schedule. Business greatly exceeded
projections in 1973 and is continuing at an accelerated rate. Persistent
problems are the substantial amount of arrears of hiotel borrowers and the
lack of valid mortgage security for certain sub)-loans; these are being closely
watched. Tlue dependence of BDET (ex-SNI) on the Government and the IBRD is
expected to be reduced by EDET's raising considerable funds from local and
other foreign sources.   A sixth1 loan is currently being processed.

Ln. 937:  Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432:  million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973;
Closing Dates: December 31, 1976.
Due to delays in appointment of consultants and preparation of the
necessary legal opinions, the loan and credit for this project only became
effective in September 1974. Signature of the UNDP Project Document for tech-
nical assistance to the Tunis District was completed in October, 1974. As the
offer of the Tunisian supplier fell within 15 percent of the international
reference price agreed with the Bank/IDA, the public transport company (SNT)
has decided to award him the contract for supply of project buses.
Ln. 1029: thotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974
Closing Date: October 31, 1978.
Due largely to delays in the acquisition of sites for project hotel
training centers, effectiveness of the loan for this project has been delayed.
Sites for the hotel training centers are in the process of being acquired by
the National Tourist Office (ONTT). Consulting architects are being selected
from official lists provided by the Ministry of Equipment. Current and pro-
jected price increases are not expected to increase project cost beyond con-
tingency allowances. The project unit created for the tourism infrastructure
project has been enlarged by addition of the staff necessary for supervision
of the construction of the hotel training centers.
Ln. 1042: Gafsa Phosphate Project; US$23.3 million loan of October 1, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
This loan has not yet become effective; however, prequalification
of equipment suppliers is underway. Terms of reference for a study of develop-
ment possibilities in the mining region are under discussion.
