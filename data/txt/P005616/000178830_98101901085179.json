The Government of Tunisia has requested a Bank\n            loan to help finance subprojects in the Lower Medjerda\n            Valley (Medjerda) and East-Central Tunisia (Nebhana)\n            comprising: rehabilitation of the existing irrigation,\n            drainage, and road networks; construction of rural\n            infrastructure; on-farm development; and strengthening of\n            management, extension, marketing services and employment of\n            consultants. The project also includes assistance in land\n            reform in Nebhana through land consolidation and\n            establishment of farm titles as well as in the preparation\n            of detailed engineering designs and feasibility studies for\n            future on-farm development. In addition, the project will\n            finance a land reform specialist to strengthen the Ministry\n            of Agriculture's Directorate of Land Affairs and\n            Legislation (DAFL) in its nationwide operations."}, "docdt": "1974-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
