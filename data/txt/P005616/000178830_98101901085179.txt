IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Summary and Conclusions
i.        Rainfed agriculture predominates in Tunisia.  Three million of nine
million hectares of agricultural land are cultivated but only 110,000 ha are
presently equipped for irrigation. The low annual rainfall, the majority of
which falls from September to April, precludes much increase in production
except by expansion of irrigated lands. A study of the Northern Tunisia's
water resources (including the water resources of the Medjerda River) has
been carried out and a Water Master Plan has been prepared under a Bank tech-
nical assistance agreement.
ii.       The main irrigation areas are in the lower and central Medjerda
River Valley, the Nebhana area, in Cap Bon and the oases of southern Tunisia.
Construction of public irrigation facilities began in 1959 and continues.
About half of the 20,000 ha area in the Medjerda valley and 1,800 of 5,000 ha
in the Nebhana region are irrigated. The development has been financed through
bilateral aid of France and the United States, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Eco-
nomic Development, and the African Development Bank.
iii.      Land tenure, lack of maintenance of the irrigation and drainage
systems, inadequate extension, credit and marketing support services are the
main reasons for the underutilization of the developments in the Medjerda
valley and in the Nebhana area. The Governnent has requested Bank assistance
in financing a rehabilitation and development project.
iv.       The project's objectives, which are in line with the objectives of
the 1973-76 Plan, are to:
(a) use the existing irrigation infrastructure more fully and
more effectively;
(b) raise incomes of small farmers by intensifying and diversifying
the cropping patterns;
(c) increase security of tenure and accessibility to adequate
agricultural credit;
(d) provide needed public services together with assistance to
the project authorities; and
(e) improve housing conditions for the lowest income farmers in
the Medjerda.
v.        In Medjerda and Nebhana, the project comprises rehabilitation of
existing irrigation, drainage, and road networks; construction of rural infra-
structure; on-farm development; and strengthening of management, extension, and



- ii -
marketing services and employnent of consultants. It also includes assistance
in land reform in Nebhana through consolidation and establishment of land
titles as well as preparation of detailed engineering studies for future on-
farm development.
vi.       The project cost is estimated at about US$24 million, including
physical and price contingencies. The proposed Bank loan will finance the
estimated foreign exchange component of US$12.2 million equivalent (51%).
International competitive bidding will apply to equipment (US$3.2 million)
except for a certain type of hydraulic equipment (US$0.6 million), which is
reserved for special procurement. Furthermore, international competitive
bidding would not be appropriate for civil works, roads, buildings, electric
and water supply facilities because they are small, widely scattered and
spread over a long period. These works will be tendered locally or carried
out by force account. Contracts for livestock (US$1.0 million) will be awarded
after receiving at least three quotations from suppliers. Tender documents
will be prepared by the two subproject authorities responsible to the Ministry
of Agriculture, the Office for the Development of the Lower Medjerda Valley
(OMVVM) and the Office for the Development of Nebhana (OMIVAN).
vii.      Project implementation, including planning, design, contracting, and
supervision, will be carried out by OMVVM and OMIVAN. OMVVM has been respon-
sible for development work in the Medjerda Valley since 1958; OMIVAN is a
small organization, established in 1973. Both authorities will be responsible
for coordinating all project activities carried out by their own staff, other
Government agencies, private contractors, or consultants. The latter will
provide technical assistance and undertake studies.
viii.     Particular emphasis will be placed on improving agricultural exten-
sion in Medjerda and Nebhana. The OMVVM extension program will be strength-
ened by technical assistance from consultants and by rehabilitation of Rural
Centers, while the OMIVAN program will be strengthened through a seven-year
program of technical assistance financed by the Belgian Government which
commenced in 1973.
ix.       Both subprojects will be served by long-, medium- and short-term
credit. Land reform, under existing legislation, will be completed in the
project area during the construction period.
x.        Implementation of both subprojects will take seven years.  Full
agricultural development is expected six years following irrigation rehabil-
itation.
xi.       At full development in 1987, the net value of annual incremental
production to the economy will be about US$5.48 million annually. The Economic
Rate of Return, with all previous expenditures treated as sunk costs, for the
whole project is 28Z, for Medjerda 30%, and for Nebhana 24%. Even under ad-
verse assumptions of costs and benefits, the Rate of Return for the combined
project is not likely to be less than 19%. However, if the sunk costs are
included in the analysis, the aggregate return for the project becomes nega-
tive.



- iii -
xii.      The project will greatly reduce the disparity in income and standards
of living between small farmers on the one hand and large farmers in Medierda
and the urban population on the other.  As a result of the project, about
1,800 farmers in Medjerda will have a net income rise of 142% to about D 2,400
(US$5,600), and about 2,000 farmers in Nebhana will have an increase in net
farm income of 153% to about D 415 (US$955) compared to D 1,006 (US$2,315)
and D 164 (US$380), respectively, without the project. Moreover, all farmers
will obtain titles to their land. The demand for hired labor will double at
full development, while self-employment of farm families would be increased
by about 36% in Medjerda and 53% in Nebhana. Full time employment for about
3,000 persons is expected to result.
xiii.     Agreement having been reached on the principal issues, subject to
the conditions of effectiveness and disbursement, the project is suitable for
a Bank loan of US$12.2 million to the Government of Tunisia. In view of the
lengthy development period, full development not being foreseen until 1987,
an appropriate term for the loan is 25 years including 7 1/2 years of grace.

IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tunisia has requested a Bank loan to help finance
subprojects in the Lower Medjerda Valley (Medjerda) and East-Central Tunisia
(Nebhana) comprising: rehabilitation of the existing irrigation, drainage,
and road networks; construction of rural infrastructure; on-farm development;
and strengthening of management, extension, marketing services and employment
of consultants. The project also includes assistance in land reform in Nebhana
through land consolidation and establishment of farm titles as well as in the
preparation of detailed engineering designs and feasibility studies for future
on-farm development. In addition, the project will finance a land reform
specialist to strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture's Directorate of Land
Affairs and Legislation (DAFL) in its nationwide operations.
1.02      Originally, the Government requested complete project development
for intensified irrigated farming of about 20,000 ha in Medjerda and 5,000 ha
in Nebhana. Because of land reform considerations and inadequate preparation
of parts of the project, the area included for full development has been
reduced to about 10,300 ha in Medjerda and to about 2,000 ha in Nebhana (the
zones where intensive irrigation development is feasible in the immediate
future), while rehabilitation and ancillary works will be carried out for the
entire areas.
1.03      This report is based on:  feasibility studies prepared by the FAO/
IBRD Cooperative Programme in cooperation with the Government of Tunisia;
detailed studies by the Office for the Development of the Lower Medjerda
Valley (OMVVM), the Office for the Development of Nebhana (OMIVAN), and other
Goverument agencies and the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of
Messrs. Paul Peperzak, J. P. Dumoulin, H. J. van Wersch and A. E. Maffei
(Bank) and V. Gioia and G. Thal Larsen (Consultants). Mrs. P. Valad assisted
in the preparation of this report.
II. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
A. Country Background
2.01      Tunisia, with an area of some 164,000 km 2, is the smallest and
poorest of the four North African Maghreb countries. The country can be
conveniently divided into three parts: Northern Tunisia (20% of land area);
Central Tunisia (20%); and Southern Tunisia (60%). The population (5.4 mil-
lion in 1973) concentrated in Northern Tunisia and along the eastern coast-
line is growing at about 2.6% annually. Per capita income averages about
US$235. Annex 1 presents additional statistics.



_2_
B. The Agriculture Sector
2.02      Only Northern Tunisia, where average rainfall exceeds 350 mm, grows
a wide range of rainfed crops, dominated by wheat and barley. Yields often
are depressed, when fluctuations in the amount and seasonal distribution of
rainfall result in drought or floods. Central Tunisia agriculture, with aver-
age rainfall of 200-350 mm, is characterized by rainfed tree crops (predominant-
ly olives and almonds), marginal cereal production, and sheep grazing. South-
ern Tunisia, where rainfall averages below 200 mm, has extensive grazing with
date and vegetable crops cultivated in the oases.
2.03      Some 90,000 km2 (9 million ha), or 55% of land area, is suitable
for agriculture, including 45,000 km2 (4.5 million ha) of cultivable land;
the remainder is range land suitable for extensive sheep grazing and low-
yielding forest. The cropped area is about 3.1 million ha including 1.3 mil-
lion ha under perennial crops, but only 3.5% is equipped for irrigation. Ir-
rigation is mostly confined to the Lower Medjerda Valley, the Nebhana area
near Sousse, Cap Bon, and the oases of Southern Tunisia. Principal irri-
gated crops are tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, melons, and citrus. Off-season
vegetables are grown in small quantities along the coast near Sousse and
Zarzis and on the island of Jerba. Areas in citrus and in vegetables increased
considerably during the 1960's.
2.04      The State owns 815,000 ha of agricultural land while private indi-
viduals own as much as 4.5 million ha. Legislation exists for land redistri-
bution and consolidation in public irrigation areas, transfer of public land
to private farmers, and distribution of part of the collectively-owned land
to individuals.
2.05      The agriculture sector is less dominant in Tunisia than in other
Mediterranean countries, mainly because the natural resource base for agri-
culture is low. Agriculture contributes about 18% of GDP, employs a little
over 50% of the labor force, and provides some 35% of total exports (prin-
cipally olive oil, citru:^ and other fruits, and vegetables); however, exports
represent only a fraction cf total farm output. Agricultural imports (mainly
cereals, edible oals, dairy prod1cts, livestock, and sugar) have increased
sharply over the past decade in contrast to agricultural exports, representing
about 22% of total imports. The net trade balance was positive until 1967,
but since then has been negative and even the exceptional olive crop and good
cereal crop in 1971 together only balanced exports and imports.
2.06      The Government's Fourth Plan (1973-76) aims at an annual increase
in agricultural growth of 6.2% from the level attained during the Third Plan
(1969-72). Investment policy under the Fourth Plan is to emphasize directly
productive investments including rehabilitation of existing irrigation infra-
structure, encourage a higher level of investments by the private sector, and
direct more resources to production of livestock, fish, fruits, and vegetables.
Credit policy under the Plan is to facilitate access and increase investment
and seasonal credit to small farmers. Extension services are to be strength-
ened to reach more medium and small farms.  The Plan also contains specific



-3-
proposals for increasing security of land tenure and proposes to enforce exist-
ing legislation for sequestration of underutilized land. An ambitious time-
table has been drawn up for completing land reform in public irrigation areas.
Price regulations are in effect for a limited number of commodities (including
cereals, edible oils, and sugar) and retail mark-up on all foods is Government-
controlled.
2.07      Many factors constrain intensive agricultural development.  Insuffi-
cient rainfall causes irrigation to play an important role in diversifying the
basically extensive rainfed agriculture. The potentially irrigable area is
limited to 200,000 ha, mostly in Northern Tunisia where rainfall is above
average and where incremental benefits from irrigation development are lowest.
The present irrigable area, that is, with water available at the farm boundary,
covers 110,000 ha, of which 45,000 ha are in public irrigation areas. Recently,
irrigated crops (virtually only fruits and vegetables), produced on about
70,000 ha of irrigated land, represented 20% of the total value of farm pro-
duction. Existing irrigation facilities are substantially underutilized,
especially in public irrigation areas where only about half the irrigable land
is effectively irrigated. A study of Northern Tunisia's water resources (in-
cluding the water resources of the Medjerda river) has been carried out and
a Water Master Plan has been prepared under a Bank technical assistance agree-
ment, one of the objectives being to expanding irrigated land. Other con-
straints are inadequacies in the agricultural extension services, credit sys-
tem, and marketing infrastructure.
C. Previous Agriculture Projects
2.08      The Bank/IDA financed the first Tunisian agriculture project, the
Cooperative Farm Project, in 1967 (Loan 484-TUN and Credit 99-TUN). Follow-
ing major changes in Tunisian agricultural policy in 1969, the original proj-
ect was substantially revised and was completed in 1973. Since 1971, the
Bank/IDA has been financing the Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 779-TUN and
Credit 263-TUN). A major difficulty experienced by this project is competi-
tion between Bank/IDA funds and Government subsidized funds; this problem has
not yet been resolved. Execution of the 1971 Fisheries Project (Credit 270-TUN),
financed by the Association, is proceeding satisfactorily.

III. THE PROJECT AREA AND NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
A. Historie Development of Medjerda and Nebhana
General
3.01      Medjerda and Nebhana are the oldest public irrigation projects in
Tunisia (Annex 2). The French and US Governments financed feasibility studies
for both in the 1950's. Construction of major works for Medjerda was completed
in 1960 and those for Nebhana in 1970; the distribution network in both proj-
ects is, however, still under construction.
Medjerda Subproject
3.02      Medjerda has about 90,000 ha of potentially cultivable land, of which
about 40,000 ha could be irrigated. It is the best equipped area in the coun-
try for modern agricultural development, including dry farming on a rather
large scale. The 10-year "Minimum Plan" for Medjerda, initiated in 1962, aimed
at developing about 32,800 ha area for irrigated farming; so far, 22,000 ha
has been equipped with irrigation and drainage facilities. The Kuwait Fund for
Arab Economic Development, African Development Bank (ADB), and United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) have each financed a part of this
development.
3.03      The subproject is part of the "Minimum Plan" for Medjerda and in-
cludes 29,320 ha gross (20,066 ha net), of which about 75% (net) is fully
equipped with irrigation and drainage facilities; the balance lacks secondary
and tertiary distribution works. The existing facilities are badly maintained
which has led to breakdown of turnouts, stilling basins, culverts, drains and
roads. Lack of security of farm titles and fragmentation of holdings have
resulted in significant further underutilization of the irrigation system.
At present, only about 10,550 ha (net) are irrigated.
Nebhana Subproject
3.04      The Nebhana subproject covers about 5,000 ha net.  The incomplete
on-farm distribution network irrigaces about 1,800 ha, mainly under vegetable
cultivation. The layout of the existing tertiary system, which was designed
to serve State production cooperatives since abandoned. It does not fit the
existing fragmented small farm holdings and additional on-farm development as
well as rehabilitation is required along with land consolidation.
B. The Area
Medjerda
3.05      This subproject is in the Medjerda River basin, the country's main
water course (Map IBRD 10986) with ground slopes of only 1:1,000 from Tebourba,



- 5-
at the head of the lower valley, to the sea. The area is crossed by high
tension transmission lines serving local centers but not individual farms, and
by two main water supply pipelines for Tunis. The national road network serving
the area is adequate and provides good access to Tunis. Secondary and feeder
roads are in poor condition and require resurfacing or complete reconstruction.
The main railway passes through the area, but trucks transport virtually all
agricultural commodities. Telephone service is available throughout the area.
Nebhana
3.06      This subproject is in East-Central Tunisia (Map IBRD 10987).  The
sections of the subproject area are scattered and the topography varies greatly.
In some sections, primarily in a narrow strip of land along the sea, topography
is either flat or gently undulating. Sections farther inland have slopes
exceeding 5%. Electricity and piped water are available along the coast but
not inland. National highways link the area with the capital and regional
centers; secondary roads are adequate, except in one irrigation section. Flash
floods in winter may disrupt traffic for several days.
C. Natural Resources
Medjerda
3.07      Average annual rainfall is about 450 mm (Annex 3), more than half
falls during November-February, but winter crops need supplemental irrigation
in spring. Practically no rain falls from May through August, making irriga-
tion essential for growing summer vegetables, forage crops, and fruits. Winter
temperatures fall below freezing in inland areas, limiting production of citrus
and off-season vegetables. Strong cold winds during winter and dry hot winds
in summer affect crops but appreciable damage has been infrequent. Valley
soils are mostly alluvial, with adequate natural drainage except in the lower
parts. Toward the hills, soils grade into brown and reddish calcareous types.
Detailed soil surveys of the entire subproject area have been carried out on
1:5,000 scale and show that USBR Class I and II soils cover about half of the
area, the balance being Classes III and IV.
3.08      Water Resources and Irri&ation Infrastructure.  The flow of the
Medjerda River varies between 1,500 ms/sec in winter and 1 m3/sec in summer.
Average annual discharge is about 1 billion m3. Existing dams can provide
a year-round base flow of 15 m3/sec at the head of the main conveyor canal
system (El Aroussia Dam). With an estimated average water requirement of 0.4
i/sec/ha, the existing water supply and main distribution systems are designed
to irrigate more than 35,000 ha. Water quality is good in winter, with salt
content of 1-1.5 gram/l, but is poorer in summer as salt content increases to
3-3.5 gram/l. Details are in Annex 4.



- 6 -
3.09      Drainage.  The Medjerda River's high peak flows cause periodic
water logging in the low-lying parts of the subproject area. In the heavier
soils this creates a surface drainage problem requiring rehabilitation of the
drainage network.
Nebhana
3.10      This area has two different climatic zones.  The Maritime Zone--
suitable for off-season vegetables, early apricots, and citrus--encompasses
ten sections between Chott Mariem and Mahdia (Annex 3).  The Semi-Continental
Zone, cold in winter and hot in summer--suitable for stone fruits, citrus,
and late summer crops--encompasseS Sbikha, Fadhloun, and Enfida. Average
annual rainfall in the Maritime Zone is 325 mm, with no rain from June through
August, thus necessitating full irrigation for all summer crops. Water deficits
occur in all other months, except January, requiring irrigation for all off-
season vegetable and fruit crops. Soils in the area have been surveyed in
detail and are of colluvial origin with, generally, light to medium textures.
Minor limitations related to texture, type of sub-stratum, depth, and topo-
graphy prevent the soils from being rated in USBR Class I; all belong to
either Class II or III. No problems of drainage or salinity exist, and most
of the area is eminently suitable for vegetable and fruit crops.
3,11      Water Resources and Irrigation Infrastructure.  The Nebhana River
with good quality water has been harnessed by means of the Sidi Messaoud dam
(storage capacity 86 million m3) and the Bel Assoud Diversion dam, completed
in 1966. In addition, groundwater has been tapped in the Sbikha and Bled
Sisseb aquifers. A 120-km pipeline conveys water to irrigate about 5,000 ha.
The main irrigation network was completed in 1970, but only about 1,800 ha
are presently irrigated. Some water is used for industrial, urban, and tour-
ism developments, and intersector competition for water is growing around the
cities of Sousse and Monastir. Details are in Annex 4.
D. Land Tenure
3.12      Implementation of the existing agrarian reform legislation is un-
satisfactory: enforcement of provisions on obligations, payments, and limita-
tion of farm size is poor, and land consolidation, registration, and titling
are proceeding slowly. The Medjerda Agrarian Reform Law of 1958, as amended
in 1960, covers: the contribution that owners of more than 2 ha of irrigable
land have to make to public investments; the size of holdings, with a 50 ha
ceiling; land consolidation; obligations on owners to irrigate at least
two-thirds of their irrigable land. A 1970 law and decree regulate the dis-
tribution of State land to individuals. In Nebhana, legal status of holdings
is complicated by joint ownership by co-heirs and fragmentation of holdings;
the Agrarian Reform of 1963, as amended in 1971, applies.
3.13      Details on land tenure in both subproject areas are given in Annex 5
and are summarized below:



-7-
Medjerda      Nebhana       Total
------------- ha ---------------
State Land                            3,260            200         3,460
Settlers Under Land Reform            7,531             -          7,531
Privately Owned Land                  9,275          4,800        14,075
Total                           20,066          5,000       25,066
In Medjerda, the State owns 16 percent of the area, 1,230 settlers 38% and
1,397 individuals own the remainder. Settlers' farms vary in size from 3-12
ha with 76% in the 5-10 ha range. 86% of individuals own 36 percent of the
privately-held area in units of less than 10 ha (average farm size of 2.8 ha),
while 2% own 32% of the land in more than 30 ha units and the remainder is in
farms of 10-30 ha. In Nebhana, the area was originally developed for produc-
tion cooperatives. When this failed, the land reverted to private ownership.
Farm sizes vary from 0.2-0.8 ha along the coast and from 1.3-3.3 inland. In
both subprojects, joint ownership is common, while some tenancy and share-
cropping occurs.
E. Land Use, Agricultural Production, and Yields
Medjerda
3.14      About 17,900 ha (89%) of the project area are under some form of
cultivation, of which 15,482 ha are fully equipped with irrigation facilities.
During the last few years, the cropping pattern has shifted towards vegetable
and forage crops at the expense of cereals. At present about 34% of the
cropped area is under irrigated vegetables, 26% under fruit, 22% under forage,
and 18% under dry land grains. Farmers do not follow an agronomically appro-
priate cropping pattern; most alternate cereals or forage with irrigated
vegetables (mostly artichokes, tomatoes, and cucurbits) in two-to four-year
rotations. Farmers have used purchased inputs in modest quantities, but due
to recent expansion of short-term credit in kind, fertilizer use has been
increasing. Yields are generally low because farmers have limited knowledge
of irrigated cropping and due to the deficient supply and poor distribution
of irrigation water. The area has about 4,425 selected cattle, of which
3,100 are owned by about 600 private farmers and 1,325 by four well-run State
farms. Livestock are in satisfactory condition but inadequate and unbalanced
feeding on the private farms results in below average milk production. Details
are in Annex 6 and 7.
Nebhana
3.15      Only 1,800 ha (36%) of the land area equipped for irrigation are
actually being irrigated. Lack of land consolidation and the layout of the



- 8 -
original irrigation distribution systems are the main causes for the under-
utilization of facilities. In the coastal area 1,400 ha are irrigated for vege-
table crops and 400 ha for fruit trees, mostly on State farms in the Semi-
Continental Zone. Olive trees (grown for oil under rainfed conditions) occupy
about 10% of the irrigable area, obstructing development of new fruit tree
plantations, especially in the higher parts of the coastal irrigation sections.
Main irrigated vegetable crops are cucurbits, peppers, potatoes, and tomatoes.
The coastal area is suitable for off-season vegetable production, but most
farmers grow seasonal vegetables because of their lower production costs and
easier cultivation. In some sections (Chott Mariem and Teboulba) skilled
farmers have, however, shifted to growing early and late varieties. Details
are in Annex 7.
F. Marketing and Cooperatives
Mledjerda
3.16      Except for artichokes, which are exported, vegetables and fruits
(70% of total) are mainly produced for the Tunis wholesale market; increasing
amounts of tomatoes are, however, being sold for processing to private and
cooperative factories in the area. Marketing is carried out by the private
sector. Milk is sold either to the Tunisian Company of Milk-Industries (STIL)
or to individual vendors.
Nebhana
3.17      Seasonal vegetable production is mainly for the wholesale markets
of Sousse and Tunis. Of the early season vegetable production (tomatoes and
peppers), 80% is sold in Tunis and 20% in Sousse and Sfax. Export marketing
from the project area is limited. The Cooperative of Teboulba markets off-
season produce from the Teboulba and Vieux Teboulba sections and vicinity.
The Cooperative owns and provides field boxes, transport, and storage facili-
ties. It is efficient and has a good and consistent record of distributed
earnings to members. The Central Cooperative for Fruits and Vegetables
"Nebhana" (CCN), created in June 1971, is intended to perform all marketing
functions required by its members. At present, CCN rents centers for produce
collection and input distribution at Sbikha, Chott Mariem, Sahline, Moknine,
and Bekalta. So far, its activities have been rather restricted. The private
trade sector handles all other marketing functions for seasonal crops, with
the inherent disadvantage to small farmers. Details are in Annex 8.
G. Irrigation Development Institutions
3.18      The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for irrigation development
and its Directorate for Hydraulic Studies and Major Works (DEGTH) is entrusted
with the maintenance, operation, supervision, and safety of dams and major
hydraulic works. At the project level, special offices or semi-autonomous



-9-
public agencies, such as OMVVM and OMIVAN, operate under the Ministry of
Agriculture's nominal authority (See Charts 8651 (3R), 8649 (2R) and 8970R)
and are responsible for the management and maintenance of the network within
the irrigation sections.
H. Credit Sources
General
3.19      Credit sources are OWVVM and OMIVAN, Mutual Credit Societies (CLOI),
National Bank of Tunisia (BNT), commercial banks, and local storekeepers and
merchants. OMVVM and OMIVAN give short-term credit-in-kind to irrigation
farmers with 6 ha or less for material inputs and tractor services based on
a 10% downpayment with the balance due, without interest, at harvest time.
The Government budget provides OMVVM and OMIVAN with funds. In 1973-74 a
major effort was made to reach virtually all qualifying farmers. Repayment
performance has been poor. CLCM was designed to provide short-term credit to
small farmers, but the OMVVM and OMIVAN credit-in-kind programs have taken
over its role. BNT, the only banking institution specializing in agricultural
credit, makes short-, medium-, and long-term loans. 1/ Short-term loans are
available to credit-worthy, large farmers, on the same terms as those of com-
mercial banks. Medium- and long-term loans are mostly from Government funds,
particularly the Special Fund for Agricultural Development (FOSDA). In 1973,
the Government took steps to improve small farmers' access to this type of
credit and assigned to OMVVM and OMIVAN the role of assisting farmers in pre-
paring loan applications. Annex 9 gives details on conditions and terms of
FOSDA credits. Local storekeepers and merchants provide consumption credit
to farmers through interest-free loans to maintain or promote stable business
relationships.
T. Agricultural Research Training and Extension
3.20      Both subprojects are adequately served by research stations and in-
stitutes situated in or near the project areas covering the range of crops
to be grown under the project and livestock. Agricultural training is also
adequate for both professional and technician levels and the average annual
output from these institutions is more than adequate to meet the expanding needs
of the project. The existing extension services in both subprojects is weak
and grossly understaffed. In Nebhana, Belgian bilateral technical assistance
is presently providing extension assistance which is expected to continue until
1980. Details are in Annex 7.
1/   BNT is the borrower in the 1971 Bank/IDA financed Agricultural Credit
Project (Loan 779-TUN and Credit 263-TUN).

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      For Medjerda and Nebhana, the project's objectives, which are in
line with the objectives of the Fourth Plan (1973-76), are to:
(a) close the considerable gap between the low utilization level
of existing public investments in irrigation and the produc-
tive potential of these investments;
(b)  raise incomes of about 3,830 small farmers by intensifying
and diversifying the cropping patterns;
(c) increase the security of land tenure;
(d) increase the accessibility and volume of agricultural credit
to small farmers;
(e) provide needed public services and improve housing conditions
for the lowest income farmers in Medjerda; and
(f) strengthen agricultural institutions.
B. Description
4.02      To achieve the objectives, two subprojects have been prepared; one
covers 20 irrigation sections of Medjerda scattered within a triangular area
bounded by Bordj Toum, Utique, and Soukra (20,066 ha) and another covers 13
irrigation sections of Nebhana located between the Sidi Messaoud dam, Chott
Mariem, and Mahdia (5,000 ha) (Maps IBRD 10986 and 10987). Existing irriga-
tion, drainage, and road networks will be rehabilitated in the entire Medjerda
and Nebhana areas and new irrigation and drainage works will be constructed
in Nebhana only. Full development will be confined to about 10,300 ha in
Medjerda and to the Akouda, Bekalta, Chott Mariem, Moknine, Sahline, Teboulba,
and Vieux Teboulba sections of Nebhana (about 2,000 ha) where immediate inten-
sive development of irrigated agriculture is feasible.
4.03      The project works are described in Annex 10 and the equipment and
vehicle are listed in Annex 11.  The project elements are summarized as
follows:



- 11 -
Medjerda
(a) rehabilitation of the existing irrigation, drainage, and
road networks over a net area of about 20,000 ha;
(b) construction of 370 farmhouses, installation of facilities
to provide 614 existing farms with electricity and about
678 existing farms with drinking water, rehabilitation and
repair of 7 existing rural centers and construction of 2
new centers and of housing for 30 extension agents;
(c) establishment of windbreaks for crop production over about
5,000 ha;
(d) purchase and utilization of equipment and machinery for
operation and maintenance of the irrigation, drainage, and
road networks over about 20,000 ha;
(e) strengthening the project authority (OMVVM) through provi-
sion of specialists, fellowships and vehicles;
(f)  on-farm development on about 1,230 settler farms and 600
small private farms (together about 10,300 ha), including
establishment of fruit orchards over 850 km, provision of
900 selected dairy cattle, stables, short-term credit for
crop production inputs, and farm machinery services; and
(g) assistance to OMVVM by consultants in preparing final de-
signs and tender documents for works financed under the
subproject.
Nebhana
(a) assistance in land reform through consolidation and establish-
ment of farm titles for about 3,800 small private farmers with
holdings totalling about 5,000 ha and through the provision of
supplementary consultant services;
(b) rehabilitation of existing irrigation, drainage, and road net-
works over about 5,000 ha;
(c) construction of irrigation and drainage works over about
2,000 ha;
(d) establishment of windbreaks over about 1,500 ha;
(e) purchase and utilization of equipment and machinery for
operation and maintenance of the irrigation, drainage, and
road networks over about 5,000 ha and for additional land
development work;



- 12 -
(f)  on-farm development on about 2,000 ha, including the
construction of stilling and storage basins, establish-
ment of fruit orchards over about 300 ha, provision of
sprinkler equipment for about 400 ha, and short-terz
credit for crop production inputs;
(g)  improving marketing facilities through provision of
credit for field boxes, vehicles, buildings, and equip-enrt;
(h)  strengthening the project authority (OMIVAN) through provi-
sion of specialists, fellowships, and vehicles; and
(i)  assistance to OMIVAN by consultants in preparing engineering
designs and tender documents for works financed under the s'u,-
project and feasibility studies for development of irriga-ed
agriculture over 3,000 ha not included in the subproject.
C. Status of Engineering
Medjerda
4.04      Complete feasibility studies have been executed and adequate data
are available on soils, water resources, and other agricultural aspects.
Detailed engineering studies for rehabilitation of the irrigation, drainage,
and road networks as well as final designs and preparation of tender docu-
ments will be undertaken by consultants.  Final engineering designe and cost
estimates for provision of electricity and water will, it is expected, be pre-
pared by the Tunisian Company for Electricity and Gas (STEG) and the National
Company for the Exploitation and Distribution of Drinking Water (SONEDE), which
are capable of doing this work. Support to OMVVM for the final design, cori-
struction, and rehabilitation of roads will be given by the Ministrv of Pub-
lic Works. Design and execution of the project will be by OMVVM's own staff,
which has the necessary capability. Rehabilitation or replacement of spe-
cialized hydraulic equipment will be provided by Neyrpic S.A. (France), the
designer and manufacturer.  OMVVM has agreed that it will employ consultants,
acceptable to the Bank, for detailed engineering studies of prciect works.
Nebhana
4.05      For about 3,000 ha of the Nebhana area, the status of project prep-
aration is far less advanced than that in Medjerda. Although a number of
soil surveys were carried out between 1957 and 1965, most sections need more
detailed and better land classification for irrigation development. Further-
more, feasibility studies and detailed engineering will have to be prepared
for the six sections excluded from full project development. Water demanci
and supply projections must be revised in the light of intersector competî-
tion, and consideration given to reusing treated sewage water from Sousse
for irrigation.  On the other hand, for the about 2,000 ha recommended for
full development under the project, the necessary basic data are available.
Considering the complexity of efficient irrigation development in some



- 13 -
sections of the subproject area and the limited capability of OMIVAN's staff,
consultants acceptable to the Bank, will have to be employed, ta prepare the
feasibility study. Cconsultants will also prepare tender documents for the
rehabilitation and new works to be financed under the Bank project.  OMLVAN
has agreed to the employment of consultants for these tasks an- draft terms
of reference are in Annex 12. The Governmient has undertaken that in the
allocation of the Nebhana water resources adequate amounts will be made
available for irrigation of about 2,000 ha to be fully developed under the
project.  The estimated water requirements with the project are given in
Annex 13.
D. Cost Estimates
4.06      The estimated project cost is US$23.83 million, including local taxes
as well as contingencies. Physical contingencies are 15% for civil works, 10%
for studies and technical assistance and 5% for equipment. Price contingencies
adopted are (i) for civil works (domestic contractors) 8% in 1974 and 1975,
5% in 1976 and 1977, and 4% in 1978 through 1981; and (ii) for imported equip-
ment 14% in 1974, 11% in 1975, and 7.5% in 1976-1981. The foreign exchange
component is US$12.2 million or 51%. Cost estimates for civil works were
based on unit rates obtained in recent contracts and force account work
for similar works contracted by the Government, OMVVM and OMIVAN, as well
as on those for irrigation development financed by the Kuwait Fund in other
areas of Medjerda. Estimates for equipment, machinery, and vehicles were
based on tenders obtained in Tunisia and prevailing international prices.
Cost estimates for buildings, rural electricity and water supply were based
on costs of local contracts and local bids. Since the original cost esti-
mates were based on mid-1973 prices for Medjerda and on early 1973 prices
for Nebhana, they were adjusted to a January 1974 base level. Price con-
tingencies adopted for the construction period take into account the effects
of recent increases in petroleum prices. Overall contingencies amount to
50.2Z of base costs and include 9.1% for physical contingencies and 37.7%
for price contingencies on base costs plus physical contingencies.
4.07      Detailed cost estimates are in Annex 14 and are summarized below:

E. Financing
4.08         Of the total project  cost of US$23.83 million,  the  foreign exchange
component of US$12.2 million will be financed by the Bank loan. The loan will
be made to the Government of Tunisia for a 25-year term, including 7-1/2 years
of grace, on the usual terms. The Government will allocate the proceeds of
the loan to OMVVM and OMIVAN through the respective annual budgets of these
agencies. BNT will be a sub-borrower of that part of the loan which is ear-
marked for credit (D 924,000 or US$2,125,000). The Government will finance
the local currency costs which, in the case of OMVVM and OMIVAN, will be chan-
neled through the annual budgets. BNT will obtain the funds required for the
project's credit operations under terms and conditions to be worked out between
the Government and BNT and to be agreed on by the Bank prior to February 1,
1976. This agreement is to be reached in the framework of the national agri-
cultural credit review currently being carried out by the Government. In the
interim, the Government will ensure full funding of the credit component. The
Bank has agreed to the use, under tlhis project, of local currency funds in the
Central Bank remaining from the Cooperative Farms Project. The Government has
agreed that OMVVM and OIIVAN will be provided with adequate budgetary alloca-
tions and that BNT will receive adequate resources to meet the local currency
cost of the project. The project's financing plan is as follows:

F. Implementation Schedule
4.09     The construction period will be 7 years for both subprojects.  In
both areas, construction will begin in 1975 with the preparation of design
and bidding documents for rehabilitation works. Construction will end in
1981. An implementation schedule is given in Chart 8876(R).
G. Procurement
4.10     OMVVM, OMIVAN and their consultants will prepare design, specifica-
tions and bidding documents for the contracts to rehabilitate the irrigation,
drainage, and road networks, and for equipment, livestock, and vehicles to
be purchased. Civil works include irrigation, drainage and road networks
rehabilitation, construction of rural extension centers, and of facilities
for rural electrification and domestic water supply. Because the proposed
contracts for civil works are small and scattered (about US$7.8 million for
some 25 different operations) and are to be implemented over a long period
of time (up to 4 years), they are unsuitable for international competitive
bidding. Consequently, civil works will be tendered based on local compe-
titive bidding or -- in the event contracting proves impracticable -- carried
out by force account and in accordance with OMVVM, OMIVAN, SONEDE, STEG, and
Ministry of Public Works regulations. The local bidding and force account
procedures are acceptable.
4.11     Except for special hydraulic equipment to rehabilitate the Medjerda
irrigation system (about US$0.60 million), to be ordered by OMVVM from Neyrpic,
S.A. (France), the only manufacturer of this equipment, all other equipment
for Medjerda and Nebhana irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, including
the electro-mechanical equipment and parts for pumping stations, pipes, taps,
turnouts, and water meters (about US$1.7 million), as well as operation and
maintenance equipment and vehicles (about US$1.5 million), will be tendered
subject to international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
"Guidelines for Procurement11. Contracts for livestock (US$1.0 million) will
be awarded after receiving at least three quotations from suppliers for each
contract.



16 -
4.12      Proposals will be requested from suitable consulting firms and/or
individuals acceptable to the Bank, to carry out engineering studies, prepara-
tion of final designs and tender documents for Medjerda and Nebhana, and also
for feasibility studies in Nebhana, as well as technical assistance in exten-
sion services to OMVVM, and in management, cooperatives and marketing to OMIVAN.
In addition, individual land reform specialists, acceptable to the Bank, will
be retained by OMIVAN and DAFL. Consultants services are estimated to amount
to about US$1.4 million; further details and terms of reference are given in
Annex 12.
H. Disbursements
4.13      The proposed Bank loan of US$12.2 million will be disbursed over 7-1/2
years. Disbursements will be for the full foreign exchange component of the
project cost and will finance:
(a)  39% of the cost of civil works (US$4.90 million);
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for equipment, vehicles and live-
stock or 77% of total expenditures (US$3.93 million);
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures for consultants, studies and
fellowships (US$1.39 million); and
(d)  38% of total expenditures for credit (US$5.64 million).
Any savings after completion of the project would be cancelled.
4.14      Disbursement of the credit component will be dependent on an agree-
ment between the Government and BNT, acceptable to the Bank and effective as
of February 1, 1976 at the iatest. This agreement would cover terms and con-
ditions of the subsidiary loan agreement with BNT and of subloans to farmers
and marketing cooperatives. Should the agreement not be concluded by February
1, 1976, the Bank would have the right to cancel the credit comaponent of the
loan.
4.15      Retroactive financing of expenditures for civil works and equipment
incurred after June 1, 1974 and up to a maximum of US$100,000 bas been agreed
to by the Bank.
4.16      The proposed schedule of expenditure over the 7-year construction
period is in Annex 15 and that for disbursement in Annex 16. The annual
local and foreign financing requirements are:

I. Environment and Health
4.16      The project area is free of all environmental and health hazards
such as bilharzia and malaria. A cellulose plant has been in operation for
two years near the Algerian town of Souk Ahras on the Upper Medjerda River.
At the end of the dry season no deleterious effects have been observed from
the plant's waste water discharge on water quality in the lower Medjerda
River. Consequently no adverse effect is anticipated due to the project.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
Medjerda
5.01      OMVVM will be responsible for planning, designing, contracting, and
supervising this subproject. From its establishment in 1958 under the Ministry
of Agriculture until 1973, OMVVM was responsible for development of agriculture
and irrigation in Medjerda, Nebhana, and several other areas. In May 1973,
separate autonomous offices were established for Nebhana (OMIVAN) and other
Public Irrigation Areas (PPI), and OMVVM was reorganized under a Director
General (Chart 8649 (2R)). He is supported by four Directors with Directorates
responsible for: Studies and New Works; PPI, Supplies, and Marketing; Lower
Medjerda Valley; and Administration and Finance. It has a staff of about 900.
5.02      Under the Bank project, OMVVM's Directorate of Studies and New Works
will be responsible for designing, executing, and supervising the irrigation,
drainage, road rehabilitation, construction, and on-farm development works.
This Directorate also will supervise construction and repairs, including those
for on-farm development works, te be carried out under subcontract by special-
ized firms. The Directorate of Lower Medjerda Valley will operate and maintain
irrigation infrastructure, including water distribution and water charge col-
lection, through its regional offices. It also will provide agricultural ex-
tension services.
5.03      Other Government agencies and organizations will provide additional
services. However, under the Law of 1973, OMVVM has the authority to coordi-
nate their activities with its own (Chart 8651 (3R)). Two extension special-
ists will be provided under the project to assist OMVVM. OMVVM will also
recruit an experienced economist for its staff. In addition, a coordinating
committee will be established within three months of the loan becoming effec-
tive to assist in coordinating the work of the project, to review past work,
and to program future work. Reports of the committee's meetings, which will
take place not less than once in every three months, will be sent to OMVVM's
Board of Administration for approval and to the Bank for information. The
committee will consist among others of the Director-General of OMVVM (Chairman)
and representatives of BNT and of the settlers and of Project farmers, respec-
tively. Agreement about this has been reached with the Government and OMVVM.



- 18 -
Project farmers, respectively. Agreement about this has been reached with
the Governnent and OMVVM.
5.04      OMVVM and the Central Cooperative for Agricultural Mechanization
(COCEMO) will provide farm machinery services. The Central Cooperative for
Seeds and Selected Plant Materials (CCSPS) will continue to supply seeds and
plant material, and the Cereals Office to supply fertilizers and other chemicals
to farmers entitled to supervised credit. To improve distribution of such
inputs, the subproject will include additional, larger storage facilities at
rural centers. Private dealers will supply farm inputs to all others. OMVVM
will arrange with the Bureau of State Land Management (OTD) for imported se-
lected cattle to be raised from the time of import to the time of distribution
to project farmers.
5.05      The Research Center for Rural Engineering (CRGR) (Cherfech), the
Experimental Station for Vegetable Crops (SEM) (Manouba), and the National
Institute for Agricultural Research (INRAT) (Ariana - Tunis) will continue to
carry out research (Annex 7). Existing training facilities, especially at
Saida, can amply meet subproject requirements. Graduates from agricultural
secondary schools will be available to fill the subproject's needs in the
extension program. Additional more specialized technical assistance will be
provided by such organizations as the Livestock Office, the Cereals Office,
and the Oil Office.
5.06      The success of the Medjerda subproject depends largely on intens-
ified farming, which requires farmer acceptance of improved irrigation prac-
tices. However, OMVVM has few direct contacts with farmers, and its manage-
ment will have to introduce a much more effective extension program.  Strength-
ening of the field staff supported by a pool of full-time specialists is pro-
posed, based on the well-distributed rural centers (Map 10986).  Each rural
center will have its own extension staff, consisting of 1 to 8 agents (with,
as a rule, at least 1 agent for each 200 ha of smallholder farms or 1 agent
for about 30 farms whichever is the greater). A Senior Agent will direct,
supervise, and participate in the local extension program. The present staff
of 35 agents will be augmented by 15 agents and 9 senior agents making a total
force of 59. A training program will be instituted to periodically upgrade
and maintain the professional competence of field staff through on-the-job
training and short-courses at a training center such as Saida (Annex 7). For
the 1,230 settler farmers 39 agents will be assigned, including 1 Senior Agent
at each rural center. Extension work among the other farmers of the project
area will be assured by the remaining 20 agents. The field extension staff
will be supported by a full-time central pool of subject specialists at OMVVM
headquarters (Annex 10). The field extension staff will work under the direc-
tion and supervision of 3 subdivisional extension directors to be located at
Tebourba, Dovar el Bey, and Sidi Thabet, or other suitable sites in the sub-
project area. OMVVM's entire extension program will be planned, organized,
and directed by the Head of OMVVM's Division of Extension, with the assistance
of two senior extension specialists recruited in agreement with the Bank.



- 19 -
Nebhana
5.07      OMIVAN will be responsible for planning, designing, contracting, and
supervising this subproject. As OMIVAN was only established in May 1973 it is
still being organized and several positions remain to be filled (Chart 8790R).
OMIVAN is headed by a Director, who is supported by two divisions (Hydraulic
Works, and Extension) and five services (Administrative, Financial, Technical,
Land Affairs, and Marketing). Its present professional staff consists of about
25 supported by a team of extension experts provided through Belgian technical
assistance.
5.08      Under the Bank project, OMIVAN will be responsible for:  operation
and maintenance of the irrigation, drainage, and road networks within the
irrigation sections; water distribution and water charge collection; estab-
lishment of windbreaks; land reform; on-farm development consisting of land
levelling and deep plowing before planting of fruit orchards; extension serv-
ices; and coordination of marketing services.
5.09      Other specialist Government services will assist in particular works
and the regional office of CCN as well as other cooperatives will supply inputs
and provide marketing facilities (para 3.17). DEGTH will construct additional
engineering works directly or under subcontract to a local firm. Both DEGTH
and local firms have had considerable experience in irrigation construction
during the past 15 years.
5.10      DEGTH has been responsible in the past for planning, designing, and
supervising construction and operations and maintenance of large water re-
source development projects in Tunisia. Recently, DEGTH took over the Nebhana
dams, tubewells, and pipelines, from the Rural Water Development Department,
which until then had fully controlled the water supply system. The Government
has clarified the role of DEGTH under the project, which will be to construct,
operate, and maintain in Nebhana dams, tubewells, pipelines and other irriga-
tion water delivery devices located outside the irrigation sections.
5.11      Problems that constrain development in Nebhana include the slow
pace of land consolidation and titling, inadequacy of OMIVAN management and
services, insufficient access to farm credit, and unsatisfactory marketing
arrangements. To overcome these constraints it will be necessary to assist
OMIVAN by (a) establishment of a coordinating committee, (b) appointment of
a Senior Advisor to the Director, (c) appointment of a vegetable specialist,
a marketing and cooperatives specialist, two short-term marketing specialists
and one land reform specialist (para 5.25), and (d) coordination with sub-
project activities of the existing technical assistance project in agricul-
tural extension financed by the Government of Belgium.
5.12      The coordinating committee will be established within three months
of the loan becoming effective to assist in coordinating the work of the
project, to review past work, and to program future work. Reports of the
committee's meetings, which will take place not less than once in every three
months, will be submitted to OMIVAN's Board of Directors for approval and to



- 20 -
the Bank for information. The committee will consist of the Director of OMIVAN
(Chairman), and representatives of DAFL, DGETH, BNT, and of project farmers,
respectively. The Governnent and OMIVAN have agreed to this. The Senior
Advisor will assist OMIVAN's Director in coordinating all subproject develop-
ment activities concerned with land consolidation and establishment of land
titles, provision of credit to farmers in the area, improvement of extension
and marketing services, and preparation of final design and tender documents
of subproject works and of feasibility studies for further development of
irrigated agriculture. The appointment of a Senior Advisor acceptable to the
Bank under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of
effectiveness. The vegetable specialist will aid OMIVAN's extension service.
CCN and other cooperatives will distribute inputs and market farm produce
under the subproject. Distribution centers recently set up in Chott Mariem,
Sahline, Moknine, and Bekalta will channel inputs. Marketing services will
include collection of produce from the field, one-day storage at the centers,
transport and sale to local markets, and operation of the proposed packing and
grading station for export. One full-time and two short-ternm specialists will
prov$de technical assistance in marketing and cooperatives under the project.
OMIVAN has agreed that no later than six months from the date of effectiveness
it will complete a plan of action, acceptable to the Bank, providing for the
strengthening of marketing services, including those of CCN, in Nebhana. The
Government of Belgium will provide technical assistance to strengthen OMIVAN's
extension service in the form of some 62 man-years made available over the
period 1973-80. OMIVAN has agreed that it will closely coordinate with other
project activities the Belgian assistance to its extension department in order
to link optimal cropping patterns with improved water use, credit availability,
and marketing possi-bilities.
B. Operation and Maintenance
Medj erda
5.13      The operation of the irrigation system and other infrastructure and
equipment has been fair. irrigation development began in Medjerda in 1960.
Sweeping changes in Government poYicies, especially in the mid-1960's when the
cooperative organization was encouraged, and in 1969, when this policy was
abandoned, together with OMVVM's repeated reorganizations, have made satisfac-
tory operation and maintenance exzremely difficult. Moreover, OMVVM has suf-
fered from staff shortages and limited budgetary allocations. Since 1972, how-
ever, OMVVM has had a satisfactory Operation and Maintenance Division, with
adequate staff. The project will provide equipment for repair and replacement,
including spare parts (Annex 11).  In addition, OMVVM intends to call upon
foreign or local contractors for special maintenance operations, such as Neyrpic
for heavy hydraulic equipment and others for road repair.



- 21 -
Nebhana
5.14      In 1969, the irrigation scheme began partial operation though by
1973 only about 36% of the equipped area was being irrigated (1,800 ha). Lack
of maintenance is evident on the main hydraulic structures, such as the pipeline
and other water delivery devices. DGETH will operate and maintain that part
of the system located outside the irrigation sections. OMIVAN does not yet
have the manpower capability or the equipment to satisfactorily operate and
maintain the existing distribution system and those works to be constructed
under the project within the irrigation sections. A complete operation and
maintenance unit must be established within OMIVAN, and equipment, machinery,
and spare parts must be purchased. Most of the work will have to be done by
force account because of the small size of individual works, which are scat-
tered over the length of the project (130 km).
C. Safety of Dams
5.15      Failure of the storage dams in the project area would have serious
consequences. The Oued Mellegue dam not only plays a role in the supply of
water to Lower Medjerda farmers, but also has an important function in reduc-
ing flood damage to the River basin. The safety of the Sidi Messaoud dam on
the Nebhana River is essential to the availability of adequate amounts of
irrigation water for the Nebhana subproject. Government has agreed that it
will cause DGETH: (i) to carry out an inspection of the Oued Mellegue and Sidi
Messaoud dams and their appurtenant structures in 1978 and at intervals there-
after of not more than five years to determine whether actual or potential
deficiencies exist in the condition of these dams or in the quality and ade-
quacy of their operation and maintenance; (ii) to forward a copy of each in-
spection report to the Bank; and (iii) to undertake any necessary action to
operate, adequately maintain and repair these dams and structures.
D. Credit
5.16      To facilitate the flow of required credit to farmers in Medjerda and
Nebhana, institutional and policy changes will be necessary. The FOSDA loan
terms for establishing orchards are unattractive to farmers because of their
high downpayment requirement. Also, investment credit is not easily accessi-
ble to small farmers. The existing credit-in-kind program is unsatisfactory
due to very poor repayment performance and its high and increasing cost to
Government (Annex 9).
5.17      To overcome the present shortage of credit the project will provide
for D 1,452,000 (US$3.3 million) in medium- and long-term credit. Of this,
D 383,000 (US$0.9 million) is needed for orchards in Medjerda, D 125,000
(US$0.28 million) for orchards in Nebhana, D 209,000 (US$0.48 million) for
stables and D 438,000 (US$1 million) for farm houses in Medjerda, D 107,000



- 22 -
(US$0.25 million) for stilling and storage basins and sprinkler equipment
on Nebhana farms and D 190,000 (US$0.44 million) for marketing support facil-
ities to Nebhana Cooperatives. In addition, seasonal credit will be provided
to cover incremental working capital requirements, D 700,000 (US$1.6 million)
in Medjerda and D 300,000 (US$0.7 million) in Nebhana.
5.18      These funds will be exclusively available to the principal project
beneficiaries -- the 1,230 settlers and 600 small private farmers of Medjerda
and the 2,000 farmers in Nebhana. The Government has confirmed that, under
Tunisian law, the contract of sale in Medjerda encompasses a provisional title,
and that provisional titles have legal standing as collateral for credit from
BNT.
5.19      The terms and conditions under which the loan proceeds for the
credit component will be made available to the lending institution as well
as that institution's staffing requirements for project purposes and the
terms and conditions governing subloans to project farmers will be part of
the review of agricultural credit policy which is being undertaken by the
Government. The study will encompass a critical review of the conditions
presently governing agricultural credit in Tunisia and the structure of the
institutions concerned. It vill propose new conditions for agricultural
credit.  In these circumstances, it was agreed during negotiations to defer
disbursements on subloans to project farmers and marketing cooperatives until
the conclusion of the policy review. An agreement acceptable to the Bank will
be concluded between the Government and BNT; this agreement will contain the
conditions of on-lending of IBRD funds to BNT, the terms of subloans to be
financed in part from Bank funds, and the credit institution's staffing require-
ments for project purposes. Should the agreement not be concluded by February
1, 1976, the Bank would have the right to cancel the credit component of the
loan. Pending conclusion of the agreement, the Government will finance the
credit component of the project entirely from its own resources.
E. Land Reform Activities
Medjerda
5.20      The Ministry of Agriculture has under the Land Reform Legislation,
overall responsibility for all Land Reform activities. OMVVM has been en-
trusted by the Ministry with carrying out land reform activities in the
Medjerda subproject and to prepare settler contracts. There is an urgent
need to accelerate issuance of provisional sales contracts within the 7,531
ha allocated to 1,230 settlers and of provisional titles to private landowners
in the remainder of the project area. In general, parts or all of existing
agrarian reform legislation are still to be enforced on privately owned land
by carrying out land consolidation, limiting land ownership to 50 ha, col-
lecting farmers' contributions toward public irrigation investments in irrig-
able land, and enforcing effective irrigation of at least two-thirds of the
irrigable land in each farm holding; the latter is the main objective of the



- 23 -
legislation. The Government has agreed to carry out its obligations under the
land reform law in accordance with an implementation timetable agreed with the
Bank.
Nebhana
5.21      Under the Ministry of Agriculture's overall policy responsibility,
OMIVAN has recently been charged with the carrying out of Land Reform activi-
ties in Nebhana. OMIVAN will recruit additional staff for this purpose.
Furthermore, in order to assure an adequate implementation capacity, a land
reform specialist, vehicles, specialised equipment, and funds for field sur-
veys are made available to OMIVAN under the project.
5.22      The project provides also for a land reform consultant to the
Directorate of Land Affairs and Legislation (DAFL) in the Ministry of Agri-
culture to strengthen it.
F. Recovery of Costs
5.23      In accordance with the Land Reform Legislation (Annex 5), the prin-
ciple of farmer contributions to public irrigation investments was established.
In Medjerda, private farmers contribute towards the costs of primary and
secondary components of the distribution system, development of the remainder
of the system being the responsibility of individual farmers. These contribu-
tions are fixed at the equivalent of 25% to 70% of the value of irrigable land,
valued at present between D 100 and D 200 per ha. The average amount of the
contribution is therefore about D 80/ha, payable in land or in 10 installments
with 5% annual interest (D 10/ha/year). The settlers investment contribution
is included in the price of the sales contract for his lot, which averages
about D 400/ha, payable over 20 years without interest (D 20/ha/year). In
Nebhana, investment contributions are fixed by decree for each irrigation sec-
tion and average about D 650/ha, payable over 10 years at 5% annual interest
(D 84/ha/year).  No recoveries have yet been made.  The Government has agreed
to commence collection of these contributions under a timetable acceptable to
the Bank.
5.24      Farmers do not pay for rehabilitation works as the Government con-
siders that these costs were incurred because of its own neglect. On the
basis of the above farmer contributions to past investments, the total re-
covered amount would be D 3.3 million (US$7.6 million) in Medjerda and D 1.4
(US$3.1 million) in Nebhana.
5.25      All farmers receiving irrigation water in Medjerda and Nebhana will
initially pay an average annual water charge of D 0.006 (USé 1.4)/m3 and
D 0.008 (USe 1.8)/m3 respectively to cover the full cost of operation and
maintenance of the irrigation and drainage networks together with major struc-
tures. These charges exclude recurrent expenditure on roads, electricity,
water supply, marketing and extension services (Annex 17).



- 24 -
5.26      Investment contributions, settlers' payments for land, and operation
and maintenance charges will amount to 12%, 13% and 12% respectively of the
net value of production of the three farm models in Medjerda (Annex 19, Tables
8-10) and 29% and 22% respectively of the two models in Nebhana (Annex 19,
Tables 11 and 12). These charges will result in full recovery of operation
and maintenance costs of the irrigation and drainage networks, attributable
to the areas to be fully developed under the Project as well as project invest-
ment costs, less excluded items 1/, over the 35-year life of the project at
6% interest. At a social discount rate of 10%, the recovery index will be
77% for Medjerda, 93% for Nebhana and 81% for the total project. This will
leave a Government subsidy to the principal beneficiaries of D 0.4 million
(US$920,000), in present value terms, or 19% of attributable capital costs
(Annex 18). In addition, a Government subsidy will be required to cover the
recurrent expenditure for OMVVM and OMIVAN extension services of D 300,000
(US$690,000).
5.27      Assurances were obtained from Government, that it will recover the
capital cost of the project as well as water charges at rates not less than
those shown above. In order to maintain full recovery of operation and main-
tenance costs, an assurance was obtained that the water charge rates will be
reviewed by OMVVM and OMIVAN at intervals of not less than three years and
that any adjustments necessary to the rates would be implemented and the Bank
will be informed of the results of each review.
G. Accounts and Audit
5.28      OMVVM and OMIVAN maintain budgets and accounts which are under
constant supervision by a controleur financier appointed to each agency by
the Ministry of Finance. OMVVM and OMIVAN have agreed to (i) maintain sepa-
rate accounts for the subprojects identifying the amounts collected from
settlers (through sales contracts), from private farmers (through investment
contributions), and from all project area farmers (through water charges);
and ii) furnish to the Bank within four months after the end of each finan-
cial year copies of their financial statements certified by the controleur
financier, the report of the controleur financier to be in a form acceptable
to the Bank.
1/   The cost of (1) rehabilitation of the road networks, to be recovered
through user charges and gasoline taxes; (2) electricity and water
supply, to be recovered through user charges; (3) on-farm investments,
housing, and marketing support facilities in Nebhana to be repaid
through credit; and (4) the Nebhana feasibility studies for the 3,000
ha to be developed in the future.

VI. BENfFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Production
6.01      The project would increase cropping intensity from 112% at present
to 133% at full development in 1987. Significant increases are expected in
the production of fruits, tomatoes, wheat, forage and sorghum. Production
increases are estimated on the basis of five farm budgets - three for Medjerda
and two for Nebhana. In Medjerda the farm budgets are based on cropping pat-
terns emphasizing vegetables (4 ha model), fruits and vegetables (6 ha model)
and forage, vegetables and livestock (7.5 ha model). In Nebhana the budgets
are based on cropping patterns based on vegetables (1 ha model) and fruits and
vegetables (1 ha model). It is expected that in Medjerda there would be 700
vegetable farms, 570 fruit/vegetable farms and 550 forage/vegetable/livestock
farms under the Bank project; in Nebhana there would be 1,470 vegetable farms
and 570 fruit and vegetable farms. Estimates of cropped area, cropping
intensity and incremental production from the project are summarized below
with details in Annex 7:

- 27 -
6.02      Increased production would result primarily from improved irriga-
tion water distribution and application and from an improved extension pro-
gram.  Farmers in Medjerda and Nebhana are familiar with the use of manure,
fertilizers, improved seed and pesticide inputs. The extension service,
under the project, will teach/demonstrate to the farmers the advantages of
using improved techniques of land preparation, planting and planned use of
water and other modern inputs. Contract use of machinery on larger farms
would be encouraged in Medjerda and would be supplied by OMVVM, COCEMO and
private farmers. Besides increasing output of traditional crops, the proj-
ect would cause a shift from seasonal to off-season fruits and vegetables
and introduce new crops in order to increase net value of production and
promote diversification.
B. Markets
6.03      Most of the incremental production of fruits and vegetables would
be absorbed in the domestic market which is growing due to rapid urbanization,
rising consumer incomes and tourist demand. Tunisia has a geographic advant-
age with respect to Western Europe which may be exploited to increase its
share of the market in Europe. Two important pre-requisites will be the
strengthening of the national export organizations and active encouragement
of foreign importers to link with national marketing channels. The Govern-
ment is taking steps to satisfy the above prerequisites and the services of
marketing specialists financed under the Bank project should be instrumental
in improving export marketing prospects. The processing sector is relatively
developed for tomatoes and total production from the project (in Medjerda) will
only be about 15% of the existing processing capacity in the Tunis area.
6.04      For the new crops - groundnuts and pistachioes - the total incre-
mental production (groundnuts 1,000 tons; pistachioes 80 tons) would be read-
ily absorbed domestically. Increased cereal production from Medjerda (from
3,700 to 9,000 tons) would be less than 1 percent of national production and
would find a ready local market. The significant increase in forage output
(from 118,000 to 180,000 tons) would basically supply the feed requirement of
livestock in Medjerda itself. Presently, 60% of the demand for milk of the
Tunisian Company of Milk Industries is satisfied by import of milk powder
(about 100,000 litres/day of fresh milk equivalent). Additional milk produc-
tion from the Project would be economically competitive, in the absence of
dumping, with imports, and would be easily absorbed domestically. Similarly,
the incremental meat produced (700 ton liveweight) would easily be absorbed
domestically. Imports of meat are expected to increase from 3,000 tons (cold
dressed weight) in 1973 to 10,000 tons in 1976. No marketing difficulties are,
therefore, expected for the produce of the project. Details are given in
Annex 8.



- 28 -
C. Prices
6.05      Prices for project produce are based on present farm gate prices
and the projected prices are adjusted for inflation. The adjustments account
for variability in the quality of the produce, seasonal variation in prices
and, overall, are conservatively estimated. The prices used in the economic
analysis are based on the projections provided by the Bank's Economic Analysis
and Projections Department (EAPD).. Prices of products which are not included
in the EAPD list of commodities are mission estimates of projected border
prices. The two sets of prices are given in Annex 20.
D. Farm Income
6.06      At full development the average annual net farm incomne of Medjerda
beneficiaries is estimated at D 2,430 (US$5,590), and of Nebhana beneficiar-
ies at D 415 (US$955). These compare with D 1,006 (US$2,314) for Medjerda and
D 164 (US$380) for Nebhana without the Project. The family income for Nebhana
beneficiaries is low due to the small farm size (1 ha) but would compare well
with the national average farm income expected to be about US$770 by 1987.
The project is estimated to bring a Nebhana family from 26% below the 1974
national farm family income level to 24% above the 1987 average farm family
income. Details are given in Annex 19 and summarized below.

E.  Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.07      Aggregate Economic Return.  The economic benefits from the project
will be derived from increased cropping intensity, expansion of cropped area,
crop yield increases and crop diversification. Additional benefit transfers
to Nebhana farmers are expected from savings in marketing costs due to project
investments in expanding cooperative marketing services, notably by the Central
Cooperative for Fruits and Vegetables. The aggregate economic return for the
combined project is estimated at 28% and is based on a 35-year life of the
project. For the Medjerda and Nebhana projects respectively the rate of re-
turns are 30% and 24%. These rates of return are based on the assumption that



- 30 -
all costs incurred prior to the project in the development of the irrigation
areas are sunk costs. If the sunk costs are included in the analysis, the
aggregate rate of return for the project becomes negative.
6.08      Sensitivity analysis of costs and benefits indicates that for the
Medjerda project the most pessimistic rate of return would be about 19%; for
Nebhana this rate of return would be about 18% (details in Annex 20).
6.09      Beneficiaries.  The main beneficiaries of the Project will be (a) in
Medjerda about 1,230 settler farmers (from agrarian reform) and about 600 pri-
vate farmers with holdings of 10 ha or less, and (b) in Nebhana about 2,000
small private farmers.
6.10      Income distribution.  Benefits from both projects would mainly
accrue to small farmers (less than 10 ha in Medjerda and 1 ha or less in
Nebhana).  In addition, the provision of farm houses, electricity, water,
and other services would add to the real income of the relatively poorer
segments of the rural population. By 1987, the average income of the 1 ha
Nebhana farm faamily would rise by about 24% above the national farm average
and that of the Medjerda farmers by nearly six times approaching (within 90%
of) the estimated average non-agricultural family income. The project would
thus tend to reduce income disparities between rural and urban incomes and
should markedly improve the standard of life in the project area.
6.11      Title Security and Credit.  The project will facilitate and accel-
erate the issuance of secure titles to the main project beneficiaries. It
also provides for full implementation of the existing land reform legislation
in the entire project area. This will give farmers easier access to long-
term credit for land improvements. In addition, BNT in collaboration with
the OMVVM and OMIVAN extension services will assure an adequate credit supply
to project beneficiaries.
6.12      Employment.  In addition to increasing self-employment of farm
families by about 36% in Medjerda and 53% in Nebhana, the project is estimated
to double the demand for hired labor. Full-time employment for some 3,000
persons is expected to result (Annex 20, Table 7).
6.13      Foreign Exchange.  The net annual impact on the balance of payments
from the increased production is estimated at US$4.2 million. Net of debt
service, the net annual foreign exchange savings from the project will be
about US$3 million.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Agreement having been reached on the principal issues referred to
in Chapters 4 and 5, and subject to the conditions of effectiveness and dis-
bursement described in paras 5.12 and 5.19, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$12.2 million to the Government of Tunisia. In view of the lengthy
development period, full development not being foreseen before 1987, an ap-
propriate term of the loan is 25 years including 7 1/2 years of grace, equal
to the length of the disbursement period.

IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Historic Review of Development andpBank invoivement
in Medjerda and Nebhana
A. General
1.        Medjerda and Nebhana are the oldest and costliest public irrigation
projects in Tunisia. The French and US Governments financed feasibility studies
for both between 1950 and 1957.
B.  Development in Medjerda
2.        Construction of major works (the Nebeur Dam (regulation), the El
Aroussia Dam (diversion), and a main canal) was completed in 1960. The works
cost D 9.9 million (US$23.6 million), of which D 7.1 million (US$16.9 million) 1/
was for irrigation and the balance for flood controi and hydropower production.
Financing was by low-interest loans from the French Government.
3.        Development of agriculture in Medjerda started in 1958 and took
place in several phases. Before 1962, about 5,300 ha had been equipped for
irrigation. In 1962, development began under the 10-year Minimum Plan. The
Plan called for development of 44,600 ha gross (32,816 ha net). By the end
of 1973, 22,000 ha gross (15,482 ha net) had been equipped with main irriga-
tion and drainage facilities.
4.        Various external financing organizations participated in this de-
velopment. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic DeveLopment assisted in finan-
cing development of an area of 10,000 ha gross (8,188 ha net), completed by
1966. The African Development Bank (ADB) and the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) financed 6,000 ha and 4,400 ha, respectively,
developed during 1970-71. Finally, the Kuwait Fund is currently financing an
extension of 14,700 ha gross (11,223 ha net), the last phase, to be completed
by the end of 1975. The total cost of these works is about D 21 million
(US$48.3 million) at current prices. Taking into account the cost of major
infrastructure works and investments in irrigation works, the unweighted,
non-discounted average cost for Medjerda ls about D 950 (US$2,200)/ha.
1/   At the exchange rate of D 1.00 = US$2.38, whîch was in effect from 1955
to September 28, 1964.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
C. Development in Nebhana
5.        Construction of primary infrastructure works began in 1962.  The
Sidi Ilessaoud Dam was completed in 1966 and became operational around 1970,
along with the associated vell fields and the main pipeline. These works
were partially financed by USAID. However, part of the distribution network
to cover about 5,000 ha net, is still under construction. At the time of ap-
praisal, works for about 1,800 ha net had been completed. The total cost of
the works is about D 24 million (US$55.2 million) or about D 4,800 (US$11,000)/
ha, making Nebhana the costliest irrigation development project in Tunisia.
D. Bank Involvement in Medjerda and Nebhana
6.        The Bank first became interested in the Medjerda subproject in early
1967 when the Government was preparing the second phase of the Minimum Plan.
In March 1967, the Government requested Bank assistance in financing an 11,000
ha extension estimated to cost D 6.8 million (US$16.3 million), with a 39%
foreign exchange component. The Government was then negotiating with ADB
and USAID concerning development of additional land in Medjerda. A new
project for Bank financing could not be identified. Thus, the Bank en-
couraged the Government to obtain ADB and USAID financing and to undertake
a study leading to a 20-25 year Water Master Plan for Northern Tunisia; the
Bank agreed to be the executing agency for the study.
7.        In September 1969, Government economic policy changed from massive
State intervention to greater reliance on private enterprise and free market
forces. Also, the Government decided to improve the usage of public invest-
ments made during the previous decade. During 1962-71, nearly 40% of public
investments in the agriculture sector had gone to irrigation development,
yet only 50% of irrigable land in the public irrigation areas was regularly
being irrigated. This situation prompted the Bank's interest in irrigation
rehabilitation.
8.        Rehabilitation and complementary land development projects in three
public irrigation areas have been identified for possible Bank financing
through two projects. The first is the Central Tunisia Rural Development
Project, for which a detailed project request is under study by the Bank. It
covers the Sbiba and Oued Derb irrigation areas, together with smaller irriga-
tion areas and surrounding rainfed farming areas. The second is the Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project. It covers the Medjerda and Nebhana irrigation areas,
and is the subject of this report.

IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Available Water Resources and IrriSation Development
in Medjerda and Nebhana
A. Available Water Resources
MedJerda
1.        The Medjerda River is the largest river in Tunisia.  Its watershed,
of more than 26,000 km2, lies mainly in the northwestern part of the country,
which has the heaviest rainfall. Average annual discharge of the river is
about 1 billion m3, or almost half of the country's total surface water re-
sources. Water quality varies according to the tributary and season involved:
salinity ranges from less than 0.4 gram/i in some parts to 3.5 gram/i in the
lower reaches during summer. The Medjerda Valley's total potential for irri-
gable land is about 100,000 ha.
Nebhana
2.        Nebhana has far less water than Medjerda.  Water quality (0.6 gram/l
salinity), however, is better and a true asset for high value irrigated crops.
On the other hand, such high quality water also is very attractive to satisfy
demands other than irrigation in this part of Tunisia (para 12).
B. Irrigation Development
Medjerda
3.        Existing_Projects.  Development of the Medjerda River has been
determined by water availability and flood control.  The following medium-
to-large dams have been built, as part of this development:

power (4.75 MW)
Kasseb          1967-70         52.5         0.4          Tunis water supply
4.        Large-scale irrigation in the Lower Medjerda Valley, downstream of
the El Aroussia Dam, was started in the 1950's.  At the end of 1973, 20,000
ha had been totally or partially equipped, of which only about half vas irri-
gated.  In addition, the Badrouna Project in the Upper Medjerda Valley IVas
completed in 1969. Irrigation water for this area (2,000 ha) is pumped from
the Medjerda River.
5.        At present, water stored or diverted annually for urban use (about
100 million m3) is far greater than that for irrigation (not more than 50 mil-
lion m3). Water available annually for irrigation, however, is as much as
250 million m3, and more than 35,500 ha could be irrigated annually. Water
salinity (3.0-3.5 gram/l) can be high in summer; its impact on crops may be
harmful, especially when soils are heavy and have poor internal drainage,
such as those in the Cherfech irrigation section.
6.        Winter rainfall (November-February), averaging 250 mm annually,
is important in leaching soils irrigated with the saline water from the
Medjerda River. Thus far, no large irrigated areas have gone out of pro-
duction because of salinity, and significant decreases in yields in the areas
with heavy soils have been prevented by additional leaching through excess
irrigation. Insufficient water is not likely to limit irrigation in the
Medjerda Valley for quite some time.
7.        Projects Under Construction.  In the Upper Medjerda Valley, the
Ghardimaou Irrigation Project is important. As early as 1961 a series of
tubewells was established, while drilling continued up to 1969. Results
have proven the feasibility of groundwater irrigation for some 4,000 ha.
This project is now being executed. In the Central Medjerda Valley, the
Bou Heurtma Dam, with a capacity of 55 million m3, is under construction
and will provide irrigation water (0.6 gram/1 salinity) for some 18,000 ha.
Present plans call for implementation of two irrigation development stages
(3,300 ha and 3,600 ha). In the Lower Medjerda Valley, about 12,000 ha are
being equipped in addition to the existing 20,000 ha. Once completed, irri-
gation works there would service up to 32,800 ha, which is the final objec-
tive of the Minimum Plan, conceived in the 1950's.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
8.        Future Projects and the Northern Water Master Plan.  As a result
of the increasing demand for water, primarily for Tunis but also for addi-
tional irrigation projects, the Government outlined in 1968 a strategy for
a Northern Water Master Plan.  The Plan covers practical the whole north-
ern part of the country, including the Medjerda River B   , the Ichkeul
Watershed, the Djoumine, Sedjenane and Madene Rivers, an  he Cap Bon Water-
shed system. The Government and consultants started studies in 1969, with
an initial Bank grant of US$150,000 and with the Bank acting as Executing
Agency. The final report on these studies shows that multipurpose development
of Northern Tunisia's water resources (flood control, irrigation, and urban
and rural water supply) would require a total investment of about D 108 mil-
lion (US$248 million) up to the year 2000.
9.        Within this framework, the Government is considering a first-stage
development project which would include:
(a) construction of:
(i) a major multipurpose storage dam at Sidi Salem (450
million m3);
(ii) the El Aroussia-Cap Bon Main Canal (90 km, 20 m3/sec);
and
(iii) Tunis water supply system (40 million m3/year);
(b) irrigation of an additional 10,000 ha; and
(c) rehabilitation of some 6,000 ha of irrigated tree crops in
the Cap Bon area.
The total cost of the project is about D 43 million (US$100 million). Follow-
ing review by the Bank and discussions between the Government and the Bank,
the Government will carry out sensitivity tests to determine the effect of
modifications considered essential by the Bank.
10.       The Medjerda subproject fits well within the Northern Water Master
Plan. The quantity of water would be ample for the requirements of the 20,066
ha area at full development, following rehabilitation, since the existing ir-
rigation system is designed to irrigate more than the 38,000 ha under the
Lower Medjerda Valley's Minimum Plan. Full development of the area under
the Plan might be reached in about ten years. Meanwhile, new water storage
facilities and irrigation sources as conceived within the Northern Water
Master Plan may continue to be built either in the Medjerda Valley or in
the Ichkeul Watershed to provide additional water of even better quality
for irrigation.

Nebhana
il.       Water ief  ailable from two main sources:  surface and groundwatar,
Surface water is Ï  plied from the Sidi Messaoud Dam (storage) (86 million m3)
and the Bel Assoud Dam (diversion) (3 million m3/year) on the Nebhana River.
Groundwater is obtained from a series of tubewells from the acquifers at Bled
Sisseb (11 tubewells) and Bled Sbikha (5 tubevells). A 1969 study, based on
40 years of inflow records, shows that even during the most critical years
the combined dam and tubewell system would be able to supply 80% of the 35
million m3 annual irrigation requirement for 5,000 ha at the rate of 5,600
m3/ha.
12.       Meanwhile, since irrigation development has been slow, some 4 mil-
lion m3/year of water have been diverted to satisfy growing urban, industrial,
and tourist demands. Further, within the Northern Water Master Plan, supply
of the Sahel region (including the cities of Sousse, Monastir, and Sfax) from
the Medjerda and Ichkeul water systems by means of a canal or pipeline from
the Cap Bon area is being considered. This would be an extension of the El
Aroussia-Cap Bon Main Canal, now under study. But the water, brought from
the north at high cost by means of a major conveyor, would be of less desir-
able quality (1.8-2.0 gram/l salinity) for urban, industrial, and tourist
uses than the high quality water available from Nebhana.
13.       Enough water is available to fully irrigate the 2,000 ha under the
Nebhana subproject. The Government has agreed to ascertain whether sufficient
water would be available to irrigate the full 5,000 ha, taking due account of
nearby urban, industrial, and tourist demands. This would include investigat-
ing the possibility of using treated sewage water from Sousse for irrigation.
The study of water availability will be undertaken by the Ministry of Agricul-
ture's Directorate for Hydraulic Studies and Major Works within the framework
of the regional water master plan studies.

Legal Aspects and Present Situation of Land Reform
A. Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform Legislation Applicable
to Irrigable Areas of the Lower Medjerda Valley
Land Tenure
1.        The proposed subproject in the Lower Medjerda Valley comprises
20,066 ha of irrigable land, or which 15,482 ha are fully equipped and
4,584 ha are partially equipped, lack&ng tertiary and quaternary (field)
distribution systems. Table 1 describes the present land ownership pattern
in the project area.
2.        The fully equipped part of the subproject area (15,482 ha) con-
3ists of:
(a) State Land'(1,850 ha). Most of this land is leased to state
cooperative or private farms and the remainder is used for
experimental and training purposes (Table 2). Eventually,
the State may distribute about 414 ha to private farmers
as small holdings.
(b)  Settler Land (7,531 ha).  Land belonging to foreigners
(mainly French) vas purchased or nationalized, with com-
pensation to former owners, in accordance with provisions
of Law 64-5 of May 12, 1964, and was transferred to the
State. The State divided this land into small lots, rang-
ing between 3 ha and 12 ha depending on land use classifica-
tion, and distributed it to settlers, such as farm workers of
the former owners. Table 3 shows the size distribution of
holdings and number of holdings of each size per irrigation
sector.
(c)  Private Land (6,101 ha). Table 4 shows the size distribution
of holdings and number of holdings of each size per irrigation
section.
3.        The partially equipped part of the project area (4,584 ha) consists
of State land (1,410 ha) leased to private farmers, companies, and state or-
ganizations as well as private land (3,174 ha). Tables 5 and 6 show the size
distribution of private holdings and number of holdings of each size per ir-
rigation section. Many privately owned holdings appear to be held merely as
an investment, consequently there is a high degree of absenteeism.

Agrarian Reform Legislation
4.        Law 58-63 of June 11, 1958, as amended by Law 60-6 of July 26, 1960,
contains the agrarian reform legislation applicable to the Lower Medjerda Val-
ley. Law 70-25 of May 19, 1970 and Decree 70-199 of June 9, 1970 regulate
distribution of State land to individuals. Under the overall responsibility
of the Ministry of Agriculture, OMVVM is entrusted with carrying out land
reform activities under these laws.
5.        The main features of the agrarian reform legislation (Law 58-63,
as amended by Law 60-6) are:
(a) Contribution Toward Public Irrigation Investments in Irrigable
Land. An owner of more than 2 ha of irrigable land has to con-
tribute to public investments which enable his land to be irri-
gated. A scale of contributions is set (varying from 25% to 70%
of the acreage of irrigable land held by each owner), in accord-
ance with the land capability class 1/. The Minister of Agriculture
determines the class in which each holding or fraction of a hold-
ing is to be included. Contributions may be either in cash or in
kind (land). Cash contributions are compulsory for holdings under
4 ha or for holdings planted with fruit trees in accordance with
requirements set by the Minister of Agriculture. The Minister
may authorize cash contributions to be spread over five or ten
installments bearing 5% annual interest. Contributions in kind
(land) are required for those parts of holdings exceeding 50 ha.
Each landowner is notified individually by order of the amount
of his contribution and of the time allowed for payment. If
payment is not made within the allowed time, the amount due
is recovered in two ways. When a cash contribution is due,
procedures provided for government claims are applied. When
a contribution in kind is due, expropriation procedures are
applied.
(b) Land Ownership Limitation. Land reform legislation applicable
to the irrigated area provides for a 50 ha ceiling 2/ on the
amount of irrigable land that may belong to one owner 3/. Any
land exceeding the ceiling is subject to expropriation. The
State may abstain from expropriation or expropriate only par-
tially, however, if the owner carries out intensive irrigated
cropping on the land involved or pledges to do so in accordance
with a program approved by the Minister of Agriculture, or if
1/   OMVVM has estimated the present value of these lands between D 100 and
D 200 per ha.
2/   This ceiling is determined after enforcement of the provisions of the
law referred to under (a) preceding.
3/   Jointly owned and corporately owned holdings are considered to belong
to one owner for purposes of this provision.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
the owner divides and sells the land in accordance with a plan
approved by the Minister of Agriculture. The State is to pay
compensation for expropriated land in the form of 25-year State
bonds bearing 2% annual interests.
(c) Land Consolidation. OMVVM may proceed with land consolidation
to achieve a land pattern enabling irrigated farming to be
carried out rationally. To initiate consolidation proce-
dures, the Minister of Agriculture issues an order. OMVVM
then proceeds with a land survey and a proposal land consolida-
tion plan. The plan is posted on a notice board and sent to
each individual landowner. Three months are allowed from the
posting date for landholders to submit comments.  Next, a com-
mittee is formed to make a recommendation on the plan. The
committee is chaired by OMVVM's General Manager (President
Director General) and composed of representatives of the
Ministries of Agriculture, Housing, Justice, and Public Works
and of three representatives of owners, designated by local
authorities.  The committee sends its recommendation to the
Minister of Agriculture. He reaches a final decision and
issues an order effecting land consolidation and transferring
title among parties involved. OMVVM then submits to the Land
Registry a detailed map prepared by the Ministry of Equipment's
Topographical Services or by a private surveyor licensed by
the Services and files the transfer of title with the Registry.
Any liens or mortgages attached to titles on lands transferred
to new owners under the consolidation plan are automatically
attached to titles on lands acquired by mortgages under the
same plan.
To avoid undue splitting up of landholdings, those less
than 4 ha may not be subdivided. Distribution or sale of land
cannot take place if holdings below this size would result.
Until now, OMVVM has proceeded with three consolidations
in the fully-equipped, private land area (about 88 ha in El
Mansoura section, 310 ha in Tebourba section, and 1,140 ha in
Henchir Hamada section). The final stage of the consolidation
procedures in those three instances has not been reached yet,
that is, obtaining an order from the Minister of Agriculture
for Tebourba and Henchir Hamada sections, submitting to the
Land Registry detailed maps of the three sections, and filing
with the Registry transfers of title for the three sections.
(d)  Obligation Imposed on Farmers to Irrigate Their Land.  Farmers
are obliged to cultivate their land regularly, that is, to ir-
rigate annually at least two-thirds of the equipped irrigable
land.  Each owner is given two years of grace from the time
the irrigation conveyance system reaches his fields to carry
out the necessary works for irrigation. In case of default,
the owner has to pay an annual tax of D 5/ha.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
(e)  Miscellaneous.  Landholders may be obliged to adhere to differ-
ent types of cooperatives (production, marketing, or processing).
6.        Under Law 70-25 and Decree 70-199, State land not required for es-
tablishment of production cooperatives, public interest purposes, or exchange
with owners of publicly irrigated land may be sold to private individuals.
Some sales have taken place, but the extent is not known. Based on the recom-
mendation of a Regional Committee established under the Decree, the National
Advisory Council establishes a list of candidates eligible for assignment of
State land. Present occupants of the land have first priority. The Ministers
of Agriculture and Finance jointly determine the list of beneficiaries of
such assignments. Assignments of State land are subject to certain terms
and conditions and to payment of a price equal to the market value of the
land, as determined by the Minister of Agriculture and Finance. The price
may be paid either on signature of a sales contract drawn by OMVVM or in
ten annual installments. If a contract is signed for payment of the full
purchase price, State land assigned to settlers cannot be transferred for
five years from the date of the contract, unless authorized by the Minister
of Agriculture. If installments are paid, the State, represented by OMVVM,
takes a first mortgage on the land. Special payment conditions may be
granted to settlers on the land to be distributed.
7.        By a joint decision of the Ministers of Agriculture and Finance,
sale of land may be forfeited in case of: (i) failure to pay the full pur-
chase price on the agreed dates; (il) failure to farm the land before full
payment of the purchase price or to improve it so that productivity is in-
creased; (iii) sale of the land before full payment of the purchase price
without prior approval of the Minister of Agriculture; or (iv) failure to
comply with the terms and conditions imposed upon individual farmers by
Article 4, 1/ Law 69-56, Reform of Agricultural Resources, September 22,
1969.
8.        Regarding the fully equipped former State land distributed to
settlers, OMVVM is preparing provisional contracts with settlers. When
those contracts are ready, OMVVM will request a detailed topographic sur-
vey of each parcel either by the Ministry of Equipment's Topographical
Services or by a private surveyor licensed by the Services. On the basis
of such survey, OMVVM will prepare a final contract for each parcel to be
registered with the Land Registry. The settler then will have valid title
to his land.
1/   This Article requires private land to be farmed in accordance with the
objectives of the national development plans and in accordance with
conditions in a statement of terms and conditions.

B. Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform Legislation
Applicable to Nebhana
Land Tenure
9,        The proposed subproject in Nebhana comprises 5,000 ha of land to
be developed under irrigation. Usually holdings are small, between 0.23 ha
and 1.33 ha, and of irregular shape. They are fragmented and dispersed in
a number of non-contiguous parcels between 0.15 ha and 0.83 ha in size.
10.       The land is privately owned and farmed, except 186 ha in Monastir
and Enfida sections, previously held by State Cooperatives and the Bureau
of State Land Management. The legal status of ownership is complex: one
owner may own the standing olive trees but another may own the land on which
they stand; as many as three plots, usually non-contiguous., may exist per
farm; co-heîrs often may be joint owners; and legal titles often may be out
of date. Most units are farmed directly by one of a number of possible
owners. In the case of absentee owners, a number of holdings are rented
or farmed by share croppers. Only in exceptional cases are holdings not
farmed.
11.       Superimposed on this complex land use and ownership pattern is a
rectangular irrigation network laid out according to soil type and topography.
The network cannot be fitted to the existing land use pattern as this would
cause very costly distribution and sub-optimal irrigation practices and pro-
duction levels. Thus, landholdings must be fitted to the network by consol-
idation and realignment of parcel boundaries, and must be regrouped and ex-
changed to form a new land tenure pattern.
Agrarian Reform Legislation
12.       Law 63-8 of May 27, 1963, as amended by Law 71-9 of February 16,
1971, contains the agrarian reform legislation applicable to publicly irri-
gated areas (PPI) outside Medjerda. Under this Law, public irrigation areas
are created by Decree upon recommendation of the Ministries of Agriculture,
Finance, and Planning and of a National Advisory Committee for PPI established
under Law 63-8. Decrees have been issued for all sections in the Nebhana sub-
project area, 1/ as shown in Table 7. Under the Ministry of Agriculture's
overall responsibility OMIVAN has recently been charged with the execution of
land reform activities in Nebhana.
13.       The main features of the agrarian reform legislation (Law 63-8 and
Law 71-9) are:
1/   During appraisal, the Bank was asked to include 11 sections in the sub-
project area. However, inclusion of only 7 of those sections (about
2,000 ha) is feasible under the project. For the remaining 4 (about
3,000 ha) a feasibility study for their development is proposed.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
(a)  Contribution toward Public Investment and Limitatins9 o#
Size of Holdings.  Any property jointly owned or corporately
owned 1/ at the date of the Decree creating each PPI is deemed
to belong to one owner. The Decree determines each owher's
contribution toward public investments in the PPI. The amount
of each contribution has been determined for each section in
the subproject area, as shown in Table 8. This contribution
may be paid by the owner either in cash or in kind (land). It
must be paid in land, however, by farmers owning within the
same section either less than a minimum amount of land (floor)
or more than a maximum amount of land (ceiling), as authorized
by Decree. For the 11 sections in the subproject area, these
floors and ceilings were authorized (as shovn in Table 8) by
the same Decrees referred to in Table 7.
By order, the Minister of Agriculture notifies each owner
of the amount of his contribution due in cash or in kind (land)
as well as the time allowed for payment. For purposes of deter-
mining the amount of each individual contribution, prior invest-
ments by each owner in his land are taken into account. If pay-
ment is not made vithin the time allowed, the cash contribution
is recovered by the State and the contribution in kind is ex-
propriated by Decree without compensation.
Owners may not hold in the same section either less than
the authorized floor or more than the authorized ceiling of
land after deduction of the contribution toward public invest-
ments. Owners of less than the authorized minimum may sell
their holdings or exchange land inside the irrigated sections
for rainfed State land outside the irrigated sections in ac-
cordance with Law 70-25 (paras 6-9). These owners may enlarge
their holdings when State land is distributed in the irrigated
section, as available, or when private land derived from hold-
ings exceeding the maximum size is distributed or sold. If
their holdings remain below the floor in spite on these pos-
sibilities, owners will be invited to group themselves to
farm at least a minimum size lot or to appoint one of thém
to farm it. As a last resort, if the above proposals are
not acceptable to owners, their holdings will be expropriated.
Also, owners of land in excess of the authorized ceiling will
have their excess holdings expropriated. In addition, whole
areas may be expropriated where land is overburdened with
owners and where land ownership status is utterly confused.
1/   An exception is made, however, for property owned in partnership by
farmers who farm the land thenselves.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
Land is expropriated by Decree.  The State gains posses-
sion of expropriated land upon publication of the Decree in
the Official Gazette.  Based on market value of the land and
upon recommendation of a committee composed of representatives
of the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance, and Planning and of
the National Farmers Union, compensation is paid by the Special
Fund for Agricultural Promotion, created by Article 5, Law 70-
25.
For owners of less land than the authorized floor, compen-
sation is paid entirely in cash. For owners of more land than
the authorized ceiling, compensation is paid half as cash at
the time the amount is determined and half in 10-year State
Bonds bearing 4% annual interest. For owners of land over-
burdened with owners and where ownership status is confused,
compensation is paid in full to farmers compelled to leave
the area and is set off against assignment of new land in
the same area for farmers remaining in the area.
(b) Land Consolidation. Land consolidation is to be undertaken,
generally, to ensure more rational farming of land. No specific
procedures are set out under Law 63-8 or Law 71-9. The procedures
used are as follows:
(i)  An agro-economic, land, and social survey is made for
each section. Three surveys have been completed in
Nebhana project area sections (Chot Mariem, Sidi Bou
Ali, and Sbikha).
(ii) Detailed proposals are made for consolidation, realign-
ment, and redistribution of holdings. These proposals
take into account proposed contributions toward public
investments in PPI to be charged to PPI landowners and
proposed expropriation and exchanges of land to be made
in PPI (referred to in (a) preceding).
<iii) Proposals are submitted to individual farmers and nego-
tiations are started. Negotiations are conducted by a
local committee. 1/ After agreement is reached with a
farmer, a record of possession is drawn and signed by
all parties involved.
1/ When no agreement is reached, the Government may have recourse to ex-
propriation.



ANNEX 5
Page 8
(iv) Formal legal procedures are undertaken by issuing orders
to levy contributions toward public investments in the
PPI, issuing expropriation decrees when necessary, and
exchanging land outside the PPI if necessary.
(v) A detailed survey of the land covered by the con-
solidation plan is contracted by the Ministry of
Equipment's Topographical Services or a private
surveyor licensed by the Services.
(vi)  A registration procedure for each parcel involved, covered
by Sections 319-357 of the 1965 Codé of Real Estate Law,
is started. First, a registration request is filed with
the clerk of the Real Estate Court, 1/ who publishes the
request in the Official Gazette. Then land survey pro-
cedures ((v) preceding) are started. At various points,
information is published in the Official Gazette. Next,
the clerk of the Real Estate Court receives objections
about the proposed land survey. Then Real Estate Court
proceeds with various inquiries and reaches a final
judgment. Finally, this judgnent is sent to the Land
Registry, which proceeds with final registration. The
owner can then be considered to possess a valid title.
(c)  Obligation Imposed on Farmers to Improve PPI.  Farmers are
obliged to improve their land in the equipped irrigable areas
by annually growing irrigated crops on at least two-thirds of
their holdings. Two years are allowed between the date irri-
gation infrastructure is operational and the date irrigated
farming begins. If farmers..fail to proceed accordingly, the
Government may provide the necessary on-farm investments to
make irrigated farming possible. The farmers then have to
reimburse such on-farm investments( ehose cash value is
determined by order of the Ministry of Agriculture). Credit
may be granted for such reimbursement, in which case the State
takes a first mortgage. Under exceptional circumstances, the
Government may decide by Decree to proceed with such on-farm
investments before the end of the two years allowed. Such
investments are then to be reimbursed as indicated .earlier.
December 1974
1/   Up to now, most of the land in the Nebhana is not registered with the
Land Registry. The Government is now proceeding with registration in
two sections of the project area (Chot Mariem and Sidi Bou Ali).

IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Agricultural Development in Medjerda and Nebhana
A. Medjerda
Agricultural Research, Training and Extension
t.        The agricultural development of the area, both without and with
the project, is influenced by the research, training and extension facilities
available. The Research Center of Rural Engineering (CRGR) at Cherfech, the
Experimental Station for Vegetable Crops (SEM) at Manouba, and National Ins-
titute for Agricultural Research in Tunisia (INRAT) at Ariana-Tunis carry out
agricultural research for the area. CRGR has been active for eight years
(originally with UNDP/FAO assistance) covering crop water needs, fertilizer
response, and salt tolerance. SEM, of which the technical assistance compo-
nent is subcontracted to the University of Ghent, emphasizes cultural
practices, disease control, and varietal research on irrigated vegetable
crops, especially artichokes, tomatoes, and peppers. INRAT extensively
studies all common crops in the area.
2.        Under supervision of the Directorate of Agricultural Research,
Education and Training, formal agricultural education in Tunisia is provided
at the National Institute for Agronomy (INAT), various technical specialized
schools, 8 agricultural secondary schools, and 17 professional agricultural
training centers. Their average annual output is 40 agricultural officers,
110 technicians, 350 extension workers, and 1,200 specialized workers. Train-
ing is also provided through training centers for extension workers at Saida
and for cowmen at Sidi Thabet, and through a farm machinery and farm manage-
ment institute at Medjez el Bab. Additional training ïn livestock production
is available through a USAID-assisted livestock project or directly by
State livestock farms in the subproject area.
3.        The extension service, officially entrusted to OMVVi-s Division
of Extension, is virtually non-existent. There is little coordination between
headquarters and regional offices. Field extension staff is weak (one agent
for about 1,000 ha) and senior irrigation officers lack proper experience.
Rural centers, established before 1969 to provide information and inputs,
have been abandoned except to provide housing to a limited number of agents.
Contacts with farmers are mainly confined to water distribution matters and
surveys for input requirements to be provided under the credit-in-kind prograx,.
Situation Without the Subproject
4.        According to land capability studies, irrigated crops originally
planned for the various soil classes in the Medjerda subproject area were:

/a Soils that are skeletal, heavily eroded, or saline, or have relatively
impermeable calcareous crusts, which are suitable for some cereals,
pulses, and forage crops.
Crops could easily be shifted in areas having the same soil class, but shifts
would be less desirable in areas having different soil classes.
5.        Recent statistics from the Office for the Development of the Lower
Medjerda Valley (Annex 6) show that cropping patterns have changed during
1971-1973. The area under vegetables increased from about 4,400 ha to
6,600 ha (double cropping from about 200 ha to 1,500 ha) and that under forage
from 1,800 ha to 4,300 ha. These increases were largely at the expense of
areas under cereals, which decreased from 6,700 ha to 3,500 ha.
6.        Of the 20,066 ha in Medjerda, 15,482 ha are fully equipped for
irrigation and the balance partially equipped, but only 10,550 ha were ac-
tually irrigated during the 1972-73 cropping season. This included practically
all of the vegetable area, 70% of the fruit area, and 45% of the forage area.
Most cereal crops are grown under dry land conditions, although new high-
yielding varieties of wheat under irrigation have been introduced recently on
a very small scale.  The small agrarian reform settlers and private farmers
in Medjerda use irrigation facilities to a greater extent than the large
private farmers.
7.        Irrigation is mostly through the basin method, regardless of the
type of crop. The drawbacks of this method are: (a) water is unevenly dis-
tributed to fields due to poor land levelling; (b) borders, ditches, and
other small earth structures occupy much usable land; and (c) too much labor
is required and mechanization is not possible.
8.        Breakdowns and impairments in the distribution system have resulted
in insufficient water to irrigate most fields. But adequate amounts are
being applied to vegetables and more than average quantities are being used
to leach heavy soils of possible salt accumulation. At full development,
leaching is expected to continue over a large part of Medjerda to control
salinization following irrigation with water from the Medjerda River, which
is rather saline in summer.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
9.        The farming level in Medjerda ranges from fair to poor.  Herbicides
and pesticides are almost never used. Fertilizers and farmyard manure are
widely used for vegetables, but hardly used for cereals and forage. Farmers
may obtain fertilizers through the Cereals Office or direct from private
dealers; however, distribution centers are scarce and inputs often have to be
collected at Tunis. Several nurseries and a few private farmers in the area
produce plant material of the major vegetables (tomatoes, artichokes, and
peppers). Vegetable seed is partly produced locally and partly imported, and
is distributed by the Central Cooperative for Seeds and Selected Plant
Materials. The seed is often poor in quality, being diseased (nematode in-
festation) and uneven in size and vigor. Seed varieties propagated in nur-
series often are not authentic, but seeds produced through a new program
under bilateral technical assistance are more homogeneous and genuine.
10.       Tractor services are provided by the:  large farmers (contractors),
OEMVM, and the Central Cooperative of Mechanized Farming. The latter owns
55 tractors plus implements and has 9 Rural Centers strategically located
throughout the area. Its services are offered on a cash payment basis. Land
preparation and harvesting of dry land cereal is highly mechanized, even on
fields of 1 ha to 3 ha. Harvesting and baling of vetch/oats is also mechan-
ized, but harvesting of alfalfa and berseem is usually by hand.
11.       Livestock production could be important in Medjerda's development,
and could be closely integrated with forage production on soils where other
crops are of limited or no suitability. Pioneering work by OTD (with bi-
lateral technical assistance), has resulted in importation of selected dairy
cattle (Friesian). Three State farms now have 1,325 head of selected cattle.
Over the years, such cattle have been sold to private farmers and settlers.
Large numbers of locally-bred cattle are also maintained on private farms.
12.       The present cattle situation follows:

/a Including two State farms.
13.       Each settler farm with livestock usually has a stable to accommodate
eight head of cattle, including five or six cows and two calves. Veterinary
services are adequate and no major animal diseases exist. But milk yields are
disappointing due to under-balanced and unbalanced feeding as well as poor
hygiene. The lactation period is often reduced to 210 days instead of the
potential 300 plus. Annual milk yields of selected cows are thus between
2,000 and 2,500 liters and often less.
14.       Nilk is marketed through the Tunisian Company of Milk Industries
(STIL). STIL has a collection center in Saida (capacity 23,000 1/day), which
mainly handles milk from the three large enterprises.  Small farmers sell
their milk to private collectors, who pick it up at the farm gate, pay a
slightly higher price, and do not levy the extra 3% charged by STIL. This
type of sale is prohibited because of the price differential and the threat
posed to public health due to possible milk contamination, but it is vide-
spread.
Full Development with the Subproject
15.       Considering climate, land capability, market potential, farm size
distribution, and recent development trends in Medjerda, irrigation rehabili-
tation is expected to result in significantly increased irrigated farmlng
and decreased dry land farming. Greater diversification of irrigated crops
is also expected, due to varied market demanda and labor availability.



ANNEX 7
Page 5
16.       Development under the project would be concentrated on the 7,531 ha
held by settlers and the 2,800 ha held by small private farmers. A fanm size
of 10 ha vas, therefore, chosen as the upper limit for farms which would be
direct beneficiaries. Larger farms were not chosen because they have contri-
buted relatively little to agriculture as provisions of agrarian reform legis-
lation have been poorly applied and enforced. But area-wide improvements in
irrigation, drainage, and roads will result in developmental effects on large
farms and even State lands, which cannot be quantified in terms of cultivated
area and yield increases.
17.       Land use versus land tenure has been analyzed (Table 1).  For the
analysis, several assumptions were made: (a) no change in cropping patterns
would occur on State lands, and (b) a shift in forage and cereal production
from dry land to irrigated farming and an increase in areas under irrigated
fruits and vegetables (including double cropping) would occur, largely on
settler and small private farms. Benefits would be largely noticeable on
about 10,330 ha of the 15,482 ha fully equipped for irrigation as follows:
-      ----- Farm --------- --

/a Area receiving direct benefits (10,330 ha).
18.       Although set patterns for different farm types do not now exist,
distribution of farm sizes and gradual intensification of crop rotation
suggest three representative types of farms smaller than 10 ha:

Table 2 shows approximate cropping patterns for each farm type without and
with the subproject.



ANLEX 7
Page 6
19.       With the subproject, Type I would emphasize traditional vegetable
crops, plus small areas under fruit trees (0.5 ha), and irrigated wheat grown
primarily for consumption by the farm family (1 ha), substituting for a larger
area under dry land wheat (1.5 ha). Type Il would be at least half under
irrigated fruit and the balance tomatoes, artichokes, dry land cereal, or
forage. Type III would be at least half under forage and the balance under
fruits and vegetables. It also would receive one or more head of selected
cattle to add to and upgrade its existing herd and gradually replace some
or all of the local breeds. Tables 3-6 present the expected breakdown of
areas under different crops and their total production over seven years of
development as well as the potential development of livestock in Medjerda.
B. Nebhana
Agricultural Research, Training and Extension
20.       The agricultural development of the area, both without and with
the project, is influenced by the research, training and extension facilities
available. INRAT maintains two research stations in the area; the one at
Bekalta specializes in production of fruit crops, and the other at Teboulba
in cropping practices of different vegetable varieties. In addition, an
experiment and demonstration station at Chott Mariem, run by UNDP/FAO in
association with a USAID sponsored agricultural college, studies cultural
practices and production costs of irrigated vegetables. In addition, SEM
will create a special sub-station at Sahline for field trials with vegetables
and multiplication of seedlings.
21.       The Deputy Director of Extension of OMIVAN is responsible for
agricultural extension and distribution of inputs within the irrigation
sections of Nebhana. The agricultural college annually trains about 40
agricultural officers and assistant engineers. The extension service is
weak and understaffed, with only four extension officers and eleven assistants
for the entire subproject area. However, a Tunisian-Belgian extension
support project provides additional technical assistance, primarily for
Nebhana. This project (1973-80) will also provide inputs for demonstration
areas, seasonal financial support for farmers, training of extension staff,
and collection of field statistics. The Belgian Government is provîding 85%
of the cost, through which four foreign specialists and eight technicians
will be made available at its peak. This technical assistance is expected
to provide needed strengthening of the extension service.
Situation Without the Subproject
22.       Farming is largely confined to the coastal sections (Chott Marlem,
Akouda, Sahline, Teboulba, Vieux Teboulba, Moknine and Bekalta) and ie de-
voted almost entirely to seasonal vegetables. Off-season (early and late)
vegetables and fruits could be extensively produced under Nebhana's climate.



ANNEX 7
Page 7
But relatively small quantities have been produced, mainly because export
facilities are lacking.
23.       A number of fruit orchards were established in 1968-69 under the
cooperative movement. They comprise about 320 ha of apricot plantations in
Sbikha and Enfida (two inland sections) and about 90 ha of mixed peach and
apricot plantations in Monastir (a coastal section). About 1,900 ha, in-
cluding 1,500 ha of vegetables and 400 ha of fruits, are being irrigated in
the 5,000 ha of Nebhana equipped with main irrigation structures. Besides
irrigated crops, much of the area is covered with olive trees, at densities
ranging from 70-100 trees/ha. In some areas, olive trees have been removed
to make room for intensive vegetable production; in others, vegetables and
fruit trees have been planted between olive trees.
24.       A major constraint to intensive irrigation development is the small
size and fragmentation of farm holdings, which, together with the geometric
regular layout of the irrigation distribution system, make rational exploita-
tion of a single farm difficuilt. Moreover, the scattered stands of olive
trees, lack of land levelling, and disrepair of and need for complementary
structures in the irrigation system prevent further development by farmers at
this time.
25.       The level of farming and knowledge of farmers in the vegetable pro-
duction area is generally good. Inputs (fertilizers, chemicals, selected
plant material, plastic for plant protection, etc.) are available through
State organizations or local producers' cooperatives. Access to seasonal
and medium-term credit for inputs and on-farm investments is difficult, however,
and, combined with uncertainty about secure tenure, discourages the efforts
of farmers. Consequently, crop yields have been only moderate. If the con-
straints were removed, yields would increase considerably.
Full Development with the Subproject
26.       In the absence of adequate feasibility studies for development of
the inland sections (Sbikha, Fadhloun and Enfida) as well as two coastal
sections (Monastir and Bembla), full development under the subproject can
apply to seven coastal sections (Chott Mariem, Akouda, Sahline, Moknine,
Teboulba, Vieux Teboulba, and Bekalta). These sections cover a net area of
about 2,000 ha (the exact size of one section, Vieux Teboulba, is not known,
but is estimated to be 400 ha). Most vegetables are being produced in these
sections.
27.       After the irrigation system is rehabilitated, more intensive crop
rotation should be possible. Growing early and late vegetables in rotation
should be emphasized, and winter and summer crops (such as groufidnuts) should
be more diversified. In view of the potential market for early apricots, for
which the coastal sections are highly suiltable, and certain types of citrus
(Maltese oranges and clementines), plantations should be established over a
modest area (400 ha). Fruit trees should be planted to cover only 60% of
the area designated for orchards, leaving 40% for interplanted vegetables; or



ANNEX 7
Page  8
fruit orchards and vegetable plantings should be separate.  Existing olive
trees should be removed to establish fruit orchards, but most should be left
as windbreaks to grow vegetables. Table 7 gives estimates of areas and pro-
duction over the development period.
28.       Average farm sizes (currently about 1.0 ha, consisting of several
smaller holdings) probably would not be much larger following land-consoli-
dation and registration of titles than the minimum sizes fixed by the Agrarian
Reform Law (0.9 ha for vegetables, 1.0 ha for citrus, and 2.5 ha for atone
fruits).
29.       Although set patterns for different farm types do not now exist,
distribution of farm 9izes and introduction of fruit trees in the area suggest
two representative types:
Type         ProductiQn                       Average Size      Number      Total
ha                        ha
I          Vegetablê                             1.0          1,470      1,470
II          Vegetable/Fruit                       1.0            570         570
Total                                                      2,040      2,040
30.       Farm budgets (Annex 19) indicate that a Type I farm in Nebhana, with
an area of only 1 ha, would have the smallest net income of all farms under
the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project. This is because growing of off-season
vegetables requires considerable investments in inputs (plastic sheeting,
artificial windbreaks, etc.), which raise production costs disproportionately.
Raising the income of these farms appears only possible by increasing their
area. However, this can only be achieved by displacing an even greater number
of small farmers than will already be the case because of the implementation
of the land reform procedure. Given the lack of alternative employment
opportunities, an increase in the minimum farm size beyond 1 ha (the minimum
size for a viable entprprise) does not seem in line with present Government
policy.

IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Marketing
A. Present Situation
Introduction
1.        Vegetable and fruit production is mainly for domestic consumption.
Exports are important for certain commodities, such as artichokes, citrus and
apricots. Produce processing is gaining in importance, especially for tomatoes.
In general, marketing is carried out by a traditional, established, private
trade sector. In Nebhana, however, part of the marketing function is being
performed by the Cooperative of Teboulba and the Central Cooperative for
Fruits and Vegetables "Nebhana" (CCN).
Local Market
2.        Fruit and vegetable production from Medjerda and Nebhana for local
consumption is being directed toward the wholesale market in Tunis, which is
congested and has no possibilities for expansion. An increasing amount is
being sold to private and cooperative processing plants. Also, a sizeable
portion of the coastal vegetable production in Nebhana is being sold on the
wholesale market of Sousse. The latter is well laid out, functional, and
large enough for expansion. Private traders, producers, or cooperatives
(rarely and only in Nebhana) assemble and transport produce to Tunis, process-
ing plants, and Sousse.
External Markets
3.        Many studies and prospecting missions have looked into potential
external markets and have reported promising possibilities for Tunisian pro-
duce. However, the production sector has failed to respond. The main reason
is lack of an efficient marketing organization to inform farmers of export
opportunities, consumer demands, and prices. Only through such an organization
would farmers become interested in growing sufficient quantities of new varieties
of acceptable grade and quality so that a position could be established and
continuity ensured in external markets.
4.        Exports from the project area are limited to artichokes (30% of the
production in Medjerda, either fresh or canned) and early season vegetables
(mainly tomatoes from Teboulba). Private exporters in Tunis handle most pro-
duce. During 1971-72, CCN tried export to France of tomatoes, peas, artichokes,
and apricots, but lack of means and facilities for efficient direct export,
such as conditioning stations, restrained development.

Produce Processing
5.        Twenty-three plants, mainly located in and near Tunis, annually
process more than 100,000 ton of fruits and vegetables. The following table
shows the importance of Tunis as a processing center in 1971:
Produce Processed              Share of Produce
Produce                in Tunis                Processed in Country

Others                  1.2                              n.a.
Total            100.0
6.        Development of Tunisia's tomato processing industry began when
imports stopped of French and Italian processed tomatoes. Processing capacity
is estimated at 240,000 ton, of which 150,000 ton or 64% is in the Tunis
region. Only 45% of the tomato processing capacity was used in 1972. Small
quantities of processed tomato paste are exported, mainly because the farmgate
price of tomatoes would have to be reduced more than 20% (from D 0.018/kg to
D 0.014/kg) for the paste to become internationally competitive. Alternatively,
the processing price would have to be reduced, but this seems unlikely as
some expensive raw materials are imported and water and electricity costs are
high. Producers estimate that tomato processing coets are between 20% and
50% higher in Tunis than in Europe.
7.        The only processing plants in Nebhana are two sardine processing
plants in Sousse and three apricot processing plants in Mahdia. Their
capacity is insufficient to handle large quantities, and apricots must be
shipped to processing plants in Tunis and Cap Bon.
Marketing Organization
8.        The prevailing private marketing system places small producers of
vegetables and fruits at a distinct disadvantage because of sharp price fluc-
tuations, lack of standardization, and the perishable nature of these com-
modities. From 1961-69, the State introduced a system of service cooperatives
which among other things were to replace the private marketing organization.
This system failed, along with the effort to totally collectivize the agri-
culture sector.
9.        In the wake of this situation, the Office for the Development of the
Lower Medjerda Valley, Central Cooperative of Agricultural Mechanization,
Cereals Office, and other Government agencies now provide part of the inputs



ANNEX 8
Page 3
or services formerly provided by the service cooperatives, while using some
remaining Rural Center facilities (office space, housing, and storage). Most
facilities, however, are in disrepair or inoperative.
10.       In Nebhana, two types of cooperatives function:  local cooperatives
and CCN. By far the oldest and most important, the local cooperative of
Teboulba was created in 1948. It numbers about 800 members and has its own
field boxes, transport, short-term storage facilities, and vending stalls for
fruits and vegetables at the Tunis and Sousse wholesale markets. CCN was
founded in 1971 to improve and organize the marketing of fruits and vegetables,
first at the regional level for the Nebhana area and second at the national
level for all Tunisia. CCN's Director is also Director of the Teboulba Co-
operative. CCN is run like a private company and is commercially sound. It
has four local distribution centers in the subproject area serving 341 members.
11.       To facilitate export marketing, in particular, several national
services exist. These are the various trade associations: Trade Associations
for Citrus and Fruit (GIAF), Trade Association for Food Processing (GICA), and
Trade Association for Vegetables (GIL). These associations are not directly
active in the project area, but they could provide definite benefits to the
project in promoting local produce to foreign importers. GIAF, founded in
1972, is active in all aspects of export marketing, market research, and
market news. But its activities have been limited to apricots and citrus.
GICA, established in 1967, has similar functions for fruit and vegetable
processing. Its impact on modernization of the industry is, however, not as
great as that of GIAF as it is more concerned with policy matters than with
technical assistance. GIL, only very recently formed, intends to control
prices of vegetables in the wholesale market by manipulating stocks for sale
or storage.
12.       Three possible markets exist for the increased production resulting
from the project: domestic, export, and processing industry.
B. Situation at Full Development
Local Market
13.       The local market for fresh produce is increasingly attracting new
producers in response to the high growth of urbanization and tourism as well
as the rapid increase of personal income of consumers. Adequate market facili-
ties are essential. Initially, requirements would be relatively elementary
and unsophisticated, amounting to little more than improvements in collection,
transportation, warehousing, and conditioning. Certain improvements are
already occurring through the private cooperative of Teboulba and CCN. By
strengthening cooperatives and notably CCN, as proposed under the project,
a start is intended on organizing, coordinating, and streamlining commercial
marketing from the producer to the consumer.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
External Markets
14.       As export opportunities to neighboring countries are practically
non-existent, Tunisia has to depend largely on exports to Western Europe.
Demand in Western Europe for foreign fruits and vegetables has noticeably
slowed down, mostly because of keen competition from producers all over the
Mediterranean, Middle East, and Western and Eastern Africa. But Tunisia
could well increase its share in the market of exotic and off-season fruits
and vegetables if sufficient quantities of good and even quality of desirable
varieties were made available at low prices. Tunisia has a price advantage
over its competitors through its location and transport situation, which pro-
vides for fast roll-on roll-off ferry services to three Southern European
ports with ready access to the major markets.
15.       For Tunisia to gain a foothold in the export market for exotic and
off-season fruits and vegetables, export organizations at the national level
would have to be strengthened and opportunities for foreign importers to
actively participate in production would have to be provided. This could be
effected in various ways, from merely signing contracts with local growers to
establishing demonstration plots in the fruit and vegetable area. Among the
many advantages of such an arrangement, foreign importers would know exact
market requirements in their countries and could make changes when needed as
well as provide technical assistance in choice of varieties, conditioning,
timing, etc.
16.       A recent study carried out by consultants looked into Tunisia's
competitive position in the European markets for vegetables. The study pro-
vides useful data about certain European markets and valuable insights into
the problems that have constrained Tunisia from capturing a greater share of
these markets. However, the study is mostly descriptive, deals only with
selected fresh vegetables, and does not contain specific recommendations to
break down the barriers to an increase in exports. For this study to pay off,
a follow-up is needed that (i) deals with fresh fruits and processed fruits
and vegetables, (ii) quantifies Tunisia's potential market share, under var-
ious assumptions about producer prices in Tunisia and its major competitors,
and (iii) formulates specific and action-oriented recommendations, first in
the areas of organizing production of export crops, their collection, condi-
tioning and processing, and second in working out details for an effective
centralized export marketing organization. This follow-up study is not essen-
tial to assure markets for the additional output produced by the project, but
is important for the longer-run market prospects of planned national production.
Produce Processing
17.       The produce processing industry will be an important market for
Medjerda's full-season tomatoes and, to a lesser extent, artichokes. Because
of its scope for achieving economies of scale in supply, production, and
sales, this industry has a large unutilized import potential. While the pro-
cessing industry is active in the Tunis region serving Medjerda, it is of
limited importance in Nebhana. For this reason, but also because of its
climatic advantage for producing early and late varieties, the proposed
cropping pattern for Nebhana emphasizes growing of off-season vegetables
and fruit to be sent fresh to local and foreign markets.



ANNEX 8
Page 5
Outlets for Individual Products
18.       Tomatoes.  Based on projections included in the 1973-76 Development
Plan, local consumption of fresh tomatoes would increase from 145,000 ton in
1972 to 200,000 ton by 1978 (2.2% annual growth rate of population and 3.8%
per capita annual increase in consumption). Tomato production in the Lower
Medjerda Valley now represents about 15% of domestic demand; assuming the
same or higher percentage would apply in 1980, at least 30,000 ton could be
sold then.
19.       The share of production from the subproject area to be processed
would increase from 50% (12,000 ton) to 70% (23,000 ton), or 15% of the existing
processing capacity in Tunis and Bejaoua. The market outlet for tomatoes from
Medjerda would be at least 53,000 ton, while projections are for 50,400 ton.
Local market demand for tomatoes harvested in Nebhana between November and
June is about 6,000 ton. At full development, exportable surpluses of about
10,000 ton would be available.
20.       The French market for tomatoes during December-May is steady at
around 120,000 ton, while the entire European off-season market for tomatoes
is as much as 300,000 ton. Export potential of tomatoes would be good if
proper varieties were grown.
21.       Artichokes.  Production from the Lower Medjerda Valley represents
the majority of the country's 12,500 ton output, of which 4,000 ton, or 35%,
is exported. According to projections, production should double within the
next 3-5 years to meet increasing local and possible external demand for
both processed and fresh artichokes. Production from Medjerda would be des-
tined as follows:
1978       1983
-ton   ---
Local market                    9,500     11,000
External markets                6,500      9,000
Total                    16 000      20 000
22.       Peppers.  Next to tomatoes, peppers are the most popular vegetable
in Tunisia.  The very small quantities offered on the local market bring high
prices, especially off-season. Peppers will be exported only after wholesale
prices have been reduced as a result of increased local supplies. In view of
improved production methods in Medjerda and Nebhana, this goal should eventu-
ally be achieved. At full development, about 2,000 ton will be available for
export. France will be a ready market for both sweet and pungent peppers.
23.       Cucurbits and Melons.  Output from Medjerda is abQut 9% of the
107,000 ton production. Local demand is expected to reach about 150,000 ton
by 1976, so project projections of 15,000 ton at full development are very
conservative. When the Nebhana production reaches the market in May/June,
export market prices in France are already past their off-season peak and
competition is growing. Export at rewarding prices will be difficult in June.



ANNEX 8
Page 6
Eventually, however, a quarter of production (especially of early cantaloupes)
can be sold in France during May.  The local market will, most likely, con-
tinue to offer a satisfactory outlet for a large variety of cucurbitaceous
vegetables.
24.       Other Vegetables.  Local demand for broad beans is very good and
the present small production from the Lower Medjerda Valley is sold at very
high prices (up to D 80/ton). The projected increase in production of 2,400
ton in year 6 is very small, however, compared with the present production
and the planned increase in local consumption. Practically no local market
exists for green beans, so almost all Nebhana production will be exported.
France is the best European market for thin stringless beans of high quality.
25.       Vegetables such as potatoes, cabbages, cauliflower, and the like are
not suitable for export and are only destined for local markets, with the
exception of early potatoes. All face increasing local demand due to high
rates of urbanization and income growth.
26.       Groundnuts.  Groundnut production for direct consumption started
only recently in Tunisia when imports were stopped. A few hundred hectares
are being cultivated regularly in the Cap Bon area. Demand depends partly on
the almond harvest as the local pastry industry may substitute groundnuts for
almonds. The local market is for about 1,000-2,000 ton, while estimated
production in Nebhana would be less than 1,000 ton at full development.
27.       Pistachios.  A new and welcome introduction to edible nuts, the 80
ton of pistachios to be produced would find a ready market in the major cities.
28.       Fruits.  Planting of peaches, pears, and apples in the Lower Medjerda
Valley has recently increased significantly. But this trend is not expected
to continue indefinitely. With the maturing of existing orchards and relatively
modest additional plantings, peach, pear, and apple production at full develop-
ment is estimated to increase from the present 2,300 ton to about 11,000 ton.
Based on projections, increased local demand would reach 15,000 ton in less
than 3 years.
29.       Peaches command relatively high prices in the local fresh market
and processing industry. Pomegranates also have become extremely popular,
with a ready local market. Increased production of table olives would be
easily absorbed by the local fresh market and processing industry, both of
which now take 7,000 ton annually. Table grapes are gaining in popularity
on the local market, and the relatively small subproject output of 4,800 ton
at full development would not make a significant impact. Muscat varieties,
harvested in June, are among the earliest in the Mediterranean area, and
could also be successfully exported.
30.       Despite growing supplies of citrus fruit on European markets, mar-
keting difficulties are not expected. Tunisian Maltese oranges are much ap-
preciated on export markets and have regularly performed better than other
mid-season sanguine oranges. Production in the Cap Bon area is declining.



ANNEX 8
Page 7
Maltese oranges are scarce, both in Tunisia and abroad, and Nebhana production
will benefit from this situation. Tunisian clementines are less appreciated
in export markets, but the local fresh market is expanding and rewarding.
31.       The quantity of early apricots to be marketed at full development
in Nebhana exceeds the present European market volume during the harvesting
period. The local Tunisian market will grow, but will remain unable to absorb
more than a small fraction of production. The European market during May is
not fully exploited, and no serious competitor exists for Tunisia. Under the
guidance of GIAF, the Tunisian export sector has succeeded in expanding exports
of early apricots substantially during recent years, and as much as 10,000 ton
from Nebhana could be placed abroad (production at full development is esti-
mated at only 2,600 ton). This presupposes that efforts are continued to di-
versify markets and extend air shipments. Present prices fluctuate consider-
ably with quality and timing of shipments.
32.       Cereals.  Increased wheat and barley production in Medjerda, from
3,700 ton to about 9,000 ton, would still be less than 1% of national produc-
tion, and be largely consumed by farmers themselves.
33.       Forage.  Despite large increases in production, from 118,000-180,000
ton, all forage output would be barely sufficient to provide adequate feed
to the increased cattle herd in Medjerda. Thus no marketing difficulties are
foreseen for this commodity.
34.       Milk and Meat.  Local milk presently supplies 40% of the production
of the Tunisian Company of Milk Industries. The remainder is reconstituted
milk from imported milk powder (about 100,000 1/day of fresh milk equivalent).
At present, room exists for an additional 36,000 ton of local milk produced
annually. Additional production from the Medjerda subproject would be about
10,000 ton at full development. Additional meat production from Medjerda
would be about 700 ton (liveweight) at full development. Based on projections,
meat imports would increase from 3,000 ton in 1973 to 10,000 ton in 1976.  The
additional production would thus cause a welcome reduction of such imports.
Marketing Assistance Under the Project
35.       The project provides for an expansion of marketing facilities,
strengthening of the marketing organization, and prospecting of market outlets
to assure marketing of Nebhana production in the best circumstances. Marketing
facilities to be provided include field boxes, field collection centers, con-
ditioning station, offices, and vehicles (Annex 11). The existing marketing
organization will be strengthened through the recruitment of a marketing and
cooperatives specialist and the formulation by OMIVAN of a plan of action,
acceptable to the Bank, providing for the strengthening of marketing services
including those of CCN. Finally, operational assistance in prospecting markets
for Nebhana fruits and vegetables will be provided by two short-term special-
ists; one specialist in foreign markets, and one specialist in domestic markets,
including the processing industry (Annex 12).

Conclusion
36.       No serious market constraints appear to exist for the additional
production generated by the project, provided full use is made of the facili-
ties and specialists' services financed under the project.

IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Agricultural Credit
A. Introduction
1.        Several groups of institutions are involved in agricultural credit.
The first group includes the National Bank of Tunisia (BNT) and the Mutual
Credit Societies (CLCM) controlled by BNT, which are the only lending insti-
tutions specializing in agricultural credit.  The second includes several
special Goverument funds which are channeled through BNT.  The most important
is the Special Fund for Agricultural Development (FOSDA). Others are ear-
marked for specific purposes. The third includes numerous other agencies
which have a primary responsibility for production or marketing but also have
a role in credit distribution. These agencies include the Office for the
Development of the Lower Medjerda Valley (OMVVM), the Office for the Develop-
ment of Nebhana (OMIVAN), Cereals Office, Livestock Office, Bureau of State
Land Management, and others.
BNT
2.        BNT, 1/ the most important institution providing agricultural credit,
was created in 1959 to replace an array of institutions reflecting the dual
structure of pre-independence agriculture. It makes short-, medium-, and
long-terms loans in the agricultural and commercial sectors, carries out all
types of banking and financial operations, and participates in industrial
enterprises through direct equity participation. Its lending conditions for
agricultural credit are as follows: short-term loans for 9 months at 6% annual
interest; medium- and long-term loans on its own resources at 6% annual in-
terest, for varying durations; medium- and long-term loans on special funds
ranging in interest rate from 3.5% (FOSDA) to 8% (Bank/Association). Appendix
1 shows details about this and other key information on BNT.
3.        The Government intended BNT to be a driving force in agricultural
development. But BNT's legal status as a corporation, statutory objectives,
and mixed public-private composition of shareholders soon forced its agri-
cultural lending to be restricted to highly creditworthy medium- and large-
scale farmers and to cooperative farms, the latter benefiting from a Govern-
ment guarantee. Further, since most of BNT's resources come from demand de-
posits and rediscount facilities with the Central Bank, BNT has been dealing
1/   Called National Agricultural Bank (BNA) prior to 1969.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
mainly in short-term credit. When BNT deals in medium- and long-term credit,
loan applications must be approved by the technical services of the Ministry
of Agriculture and then BNT draws on and distributes funds from FOSDA and
other special Government funds.
4.        The volume of BNT's agricultural lending, by type and sector (Table 1),
clearly shows that the great importance the Government accorded to the coopera-
tive sector during 1964-69. The 1969 reorientation of public policy toward
the private sector resulted in increased public funds for loans and subsidies
to private farmers.  More readily available medium- and long-term loans from
FOSDA (supplemented by funds from the United States Agency for International
Development and the Bank/Association), channeled through BNT, have resulted
in increased borrowing by large- and medium-scale farmers.
5.        Several conditions attached to FOSDA credit (Table 2), however,
constitute obstacles to its widespread acceptance, particularly among small
farmers. First, large downpayments are required, especially for fruit tree
plantations (up to 45%). Second, valid land titles are absent in Medjerda
and most of Nebhana. Finally, the maximum loan that may be requested is
legally fixed at an amount which is too low in relation to the considerable
increases in prices of livestock, machinery, and local construction.
6.        In 1973, the Government decided to redirect FOSDA lending from large
to small farmers. Among other things, this led to OMVVM and OMIVAN soliciting
loan applications and channeling them to BNT. In the subproject areas, notably
Medjerda, smali farmers have been able to obtain loans from FOSDA for livestock
but not for land improvement works unless they hold valid titles (Table 3).
CLoe
7.        The Government established the first CLCM in the Cap Bon region in
1963 as the main source of institutional credit for small farmers. Gradually,
other CLCM9 were established. Serious financial difficulties through poor
managerial and accounting practices beset the CLCMs by 1965 and they came under
the control of BNT, which restricted activity to short-term loans up to D 500
(US$1,150) for production of certain crops. By 1971, the number of CLcMs was
45, with a total membership of 78,000. Lending conditions are similar to
those of BNT: a 9-month term at 6% interest, which is deducted in advance.
In addition, borrowers must be shareholders and pay a capital contribution of
1% of the loan amount.
8.        After the CLCMs merged with BNT, overall performance remained poor,
largely due to reasons beyond their control. As a result of the Government's
farm cooperative policy, CLCMs suffered substantial losses from insolvent
production cooperatives and from defaults by farmers who were obliged to join
a production cooperative.  These difficulties were compounded by a three-year
drought resulting in massive delays in payments and defaults on loans. Finally,
in 1969-70 most production cooperatives were dissolved, causing a large number
of defaults.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
9.        CLCMs now are heavily indebted to BNT, and various proposals are
being considered for reorganization and stabilization. Table 4 provides
additional historical perspective. In Medjerda and Nebhana, the CLCMS' role
is rather limited due to their low activity and the 1970 creation of a special
credit line for small irrigation farmers.
OMVVM and OMIVAN
10.       Since 1970, OMVVM has run a seasonal credit program.  This program
provides interest-free credit-in-kind for small irrigation farmers (generally
six ha or less) in public irrigation areas. Extension agents determine
seasonal needs of individual farmers for seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, other
material inputs, and tractor services on the basis of the planned cropping
pattern. They also complete loan applications for the farmers.
11.       The loan applications are submitted for approval to a local technical
commission, and the national technical and credit commissions. Then inputs
are centrally ordered and delivered to local distribution centers where farmers
can obtain then.  Upon taking delivery, farmers pay 10% down and sign a note,
payable at harvest tLme, for the remaining 90%. Depending on local conditions,
OMVM, the Cereals Office, the Central Cooperative for Seeds and Selected
Plant Materials, or local farmer cooperatives distribute inputs.  OMVVM and
the Central Cooperative for Agricultural Mechanization provide tractor services.
12.       The lending volume varies considerably depending on how many exten-
sion agents are deployed to encourage farmers to submit loan applications.
Since the program began, loans have increased to farmers in Medjerda and
Nebhana, with a substantial increase in 1973-74 (Table 5) reflecting the
present Governnent determination to reach all qualifying farmers.  Despite
this impressive growth, the program has significant shortcomings.  Timely
delivery and appropriate use of inputs has not been assured due to a lack of
supervision. Also, timing and quality of tractor services has sometimes
been a problem. Most important, beneficiaries commonly believe that the in-
puts and services are Goverrnment gifts. Consequently, repayment performances
are poor and likely to vorsen as the scale of the program increases.
13.       In Medjerda, recovery percentages reported were 21% in July 1971-
April 1973 and less than 10% in 1972-73. In Nebhana, recovery percentages
reported were 47% for 1971-72 and 45% for 1972-73; for the latter period, a
breakdown by 10 irrigation sections ranged from 10% to 93%. So far, annual
budget appropriations have supported. this program. However, since the Govern-
ment announced that the program was temporary, it can hardly be expected to
maintain annual support of these inefficient operations on the present scale
during the life of the project.

B. The Proposed Credit Component
14.       To meet the credit requirements of farmers in Medjerda and Nebhana,
the flow of long-, medium-, and short-term credit must be increased. This
requires additional credit funds as well as institutional and policy changes.
Long- and Medium-Term Credit
15.       To overcome the present shortage of credit the project wlll provide
for D 1,452,000 (US$3.3 million) in medium- and long-term credit. Of this
D 383,000 (US$0.9 million) is needed for orchards in Medjerda, D 125,000
(US$0.28 million) for orchards in Nebhana, D 209,000 (US$0.48 million) for
stables and D 438,000 (US$1 million) for fanm houses in Medjerda, D 107,000
(US$0.25 million) for stilling and storage basins and sprinkler equipment on
Nebhana fanms, and D 190,000 (US$0.44 million) for marketing support facili-
ties to Nebhana cooperatives. The Bank loan will finance the estimated for-
eign exchange cost of these investments.
Short-Term Credit
16.       Incremental requirements of farmers in Medjerda and Nebhana for
short-ternm credit will be about D 700,000 (US$1.6 million) and D 300,000
(US$0.7 million), respectively, as shown on Page 6. This represents a 130%
increase over present short-term credit needs.  In view of the inadequacy and
uncertain future of the existing highly subsidized program of credit-in-kind,
a new short-term credit scheme will be established in the project area and the
existing interest-free seasonal credit program will be discontinued following
implementations of the agreement between the Government and BNT. The Bank
loan will provide for the foreign exchange component (estimated at 33%) of the
incremental credit needs (D 330,000 or US$759,O03).
17.       Credit funds under the project will be exclusively available to the
principal project beneficiaries--the 1,230 settlers and 600 samall private
farmers in Medjerda and the 2,000 farmers in Nebhana. The Government has
confirmed that the contract for sale given to Medjerda settlers encompasses
a provisional land title, that provisional titles will be issued to all other
farmers, and that this provision-il title has legal standing as collateral for
credit from BNT.
Agricultural Credit Policy Review
18.       It vas agreed during loan negotiations to defer disbursements on
subloans to project farmers and marketin& cooperatives until the conclusion
of an agricultural credit policy study. The study will encompass a critical,
review of the conditions presently governing agricultural credit in Tunisia
taking into account Tunisian credit conditions in general, the structure of
the institutions concerned, agricultural income of farmers, and priorities and
objectives of production by crop or groups of crops. It will further propose



ANNEX 9
Page 5
on-lending arrangements (including risk coverage) for the project, the agri-
cultural credit agency chosen for the project, the latter's staffing require-
ments for project purposes, and the terms and conditions for subloans to proj-
ect farmers and marketing cooperatives. An agreement acceptable to the Bank
viwl be concluded between the Government and BNT; this agreement will contain
the conditions of on-lending of IBRD funds to BNT, the terms of subloans to
be financed in part from Bank funds, and the credit institution's staffing
requirements for project purposes. Should the agreement not be concluded by
February 1, 1976, the Bank would have the right to cancel the credit component
of the loan. Pending conclusion of the agreement, the Government will finance
the credit component of the project entirely from its own resources.
19.       The Government will designate representatives of the Ministries of
Agriculture, Finance and Planning, of the Central Bank and of BNT, who will
form a commission responsible for the study. The study will be completed and
presented to the Council of Ministers on October 31, 1975, at the latest, in
order that its decisions may be taken in the end of November 1975. The Bank
vill be kept informed of all stages in the advancement of the study.
20.       In the interim, the Government will ensure full funding of the
project's credit component.

3.        The existing irrigation network, constructed between 1952 and 1957,
consists of:
(a) The Oued Mellegue Dam (on main tributary of the Medjerda
River) with a 130 million m3 storage capacity;
(b) The El Aroussia Dam (diversion) on the Medjerda River, equipped
with an automatic downstream control, su plying a 4.87 km concrete-
lined main canal with a capacity of 13 m5/sec;
(c) Two main supply canals, emerging from the above main conduit.
The Southern Canal, on the right bank of the Medjerda, is
35 km long with a head discharge capacity of 7.8 m3/sec,
and the Northern Canal, on the left bank, is 14 km long with
a head discharge capacity of 5.2 m3/sec;
(d) 6 pumping stations, 4 on the canals and 2 on the river bank;



ANNEX 10
Page 2
(e) 20 irrigation sections covering 20,066 ha, of which 15,482 ha
were fully equipped with main irrigation and drainage struc-
tures between 1960 and 1971, and 4,584 ha were equipped with
tertiary and quaternary field channels and drains.
4.        Water is distributed to the sections by secondary and tertiary
canals, and to the farms by quaternary or field channels. Constant level
control by special floating valves and modules on the offtakes ensures con-
stant discharge. Field ditches are equipped with simple offtakes. Most of
the canals are either concrete-lined or prefabricated stressed reinforced
concrete. Water losses are minimal. In general, the irrigation network has
been properly maintained, except the special hydro-mechanical equipment (valves
and offtakes).
5.        The drainage network includes dikes and a relatively dense network
of open surface drains to protect low-lying areas from flooding. It also
includes tile drains installed in some 3,000 ha of heavy soîls to improve
internal drainage. The drainage network of open and tile drains has never
been maintained. From a 1971 study, lack of adequate drainage appears to
have been one of the main reasons why half of the farmers have not fully used
the irrigation facilities in areas where they have been provided.
6.        The road network, consisting of main (national), secondary, and
feeder roads, is sufficient to meet present transportation requirements. Main
roads are in satisfactory condition, but secondary and feeder roads lack
maintenance and need to be repaired or rehabilitated.
7.        Heavy floods in 1973 damaged the irrigation, drainage and road
network; in an area of about 6,500 ha floods damaged farmland, river dikes,
canal offtakes, siphons, pumping equipment, and other civil work8.
Project Description
8.        The main elements are:
(a) rehabilitation of the existing irrigation, drainage and
road networks over a net area of about 20,000 ha;
(b) construction of 370 farmhouses, installation of facilities
to provide 614 existing farms with electricity and 678
existing farms with drinking water; rehabilitation and
repair of 7 existing rural centers and construction of 2
new centers and housing for about 30 extension agents;
(c) establishment of windbreaks for crop protection over 5,000 ha;
(d)  purchase and utilization of equipment and machinery for
operation and maintenance of the irrigation, drainage, and
road networks over about 20,000 ha;



ANNEX 10
Page 3
(e) strengthening the project authority, the Office for the
Development of the Lower Medjerda Vally (OMVVM), through
provision of specialists, fellowships and vehicles;
(f)  on-farm development on about 1,230 settler farms and 600
small private farms (together about 10,300 ha), including
establishment of fruit orchards over 850 ha, provision of
900 selected dairy cattle, stables, and short-term credit
for crop production inputs, and farm machinery services;
and
(g) assistance to OMVVM by consultants in preparing final
designs and tender documents for works financed under the
project.
9.        Rehabilitation of Existing Irrigation, Drainage, and Road Networks.
On the main canal, hydro-mechanical equipment (25 major valves) and cesspools
will be repaired. On the secondary and tertiary distribution canals, equipment
will be replaced (488 valves of various types) or repaired (525 valves, pipes,
siphons, and various masonry or concrete structures). Pumping stations will
be rehabilitated through:  repair or replacement of electrical equipment, such
as transformers, motors, and pumps for the Bordj Toum and Soukra sections;
complete modification and installation of new pumping equipment for the Henchir
Tobias-Utique section; and replacement of parts of the pump-lift system in the
Bejaoua section. In addition, minor repairs will be made on small storage
reservoirs scattered over the irrigation sections.
19.       The drainage system will be completely rehabilitated.  About 100,000
m of main open drains will be cleared of weeds and brush and about 125,000 m3
of mud, stones, and other trash will be removed. Some 500,000 m2 of secondary
and tertiary open drains will be cleared of weeds and brush and 400,000 m3 of
mud, stones and trash will be removed. Concrete and masonry works throughout
the drainage system will be repaired. Finally, of the 600 km of tile drains,
300 km (50%) will be cleaned with special equipment.
11.       The road network will be rehabilitiated through construction of main
asphalt roads (17 km), repair and resurfacing of secondary and feeder roads
(145 km), and repair of farm roads (1,500 km).
12.       Construction:  Farmhouses, Electricity, Water, and Rural Centers.  In
five irrigation sections, 370 new farmhouses will be built for about one-half
of the 1,230 settlers who were beneficiaries of 7,531 ha of land under the
agrarian reform:

Total                 607                       370
These farmhouses will be supplied with electricity and drinking water. Also,
in the subproject area, 614 existing farmhouses will be provided with electri-
city and 678 with drinking water. Water mains and transmission lines criss-
cross the project area and these utilities can be extended to individual
farmhouses without major investments.
13.       Rural centers, which were originally for the use of service coopera-
tives, have been neglected following collapse of the four collective system.
Rehabilitation of seven centers and construction of two new ones is intended
to provide centers for extension services (meeting rooms, offices, and housing
for extension agents) as well as service buildings (warehouses for inputs,
storage for farm produce, ànd garages for farm machinery and for repair serv-
ices). Under the project, the following centers will be repaired or con-
structed:

14.       Windbreaks.  Crops, particularly fruit trees and vegetables, need
extra wind protection in Medjerda. Windbreaks, consisting of double or



ANNEX 1 0
Page 5
multiple rows of trees, will be established over about 5,000 ha of the small-
holders' areas. Tree species for such windbreaks are eucalyptus, acacia,
tamarind, and cypress. A complete system of windbreaks for a large area will
consist of a double row of trees along the periphery, single rows of trees
along the roads, and a secondary break or single row of trees on individual
lot-borders, more or less perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction. The
average cost of establishing a complete windbreak system, including materials
(tree-seedlings) and labor, is D 18 (US$41)/ha or D 90,000 (US$207,000)/5,000
ha.
15.       Equipment and Machinery for Operator and Maintenance.  For operation
and maintenance of the irrigation, drainage, and road networks, equipment and
machinery to be provided under the project will consist mostly of hydraulic
equipment, earthmoving machinery (including trucks) and vehicles. Annex 11
contains a detailed list of equipment and machinery.
16.       On-farm Development.  Fruit orchards (peaches, pears, table grapes,
table olives, pistachios and pomegranates) will be planted over about 850 ha
at a cost of D 200 (US$460) - D 740 (US$1,700)/ha, depending on the tree type.
Short-term credit will also be available to farmers for operation and main-
tenance costs of the orchards. Total investment credit needed for the planting
program will be D 450 (US$1,035)/ha or D 382,500 (US$0.9 million) in total.
The livestock development program will be for purchases of 900 two-year old
selected cattle, at D 495 (US$1,138)/head and for construction of adequate
stables to more hygienically house the cattle. At full development, suffi-
cient stable space should be available for 6,000 head of cattle see (Annex 7,
Table 5); as adequate accommodation already exists for 3,630 head, the credit
program would provide for stabling of 2,370 head at D 88 (US$202)/head.
17,       As present investment credit is almost inaccessible to small farmers,
adequate medium- and long-term credit would be provided under the project for
the establishment of fruit orchards and stables. Credit will also be provided
to finance construction of farm houses (para 12).
18.       Short-term credi<  will be provided under the project by partial
funding (foreign exchange element) of the incremental working capital require-
ments. The cost of this part of the project will be D 700 (US$1,610,000).
19.       Farm machinery services -rill be provided by large farmers (contract-
ors), COMECO and OMVVM.
20.       Strengthening of the Project Authority (OMVVM).  The following
specialists will be provided to strengthen OMVVM and its services, especially
its extension services. Two consultant extension specialists will be hired
for a total of 48 man-months. An economist will also be recruited. These
specialists will be located at OMVVM's headquarters in Tunis. Provision has
also been made for visits by short-term specialists (12 man-months) as may
be needed and for 10 man-months of short-term fellowships for in-service train-
ing overseas of agronomic and extension staff of OMVVM.



ANNEX 10
Page 6
21.       The extension service of OMVVM will be strengthened by the creation
of a full-time central pool of subject specialists to back stop the extension
agents in the field. This pool will comprise existing agronomic staff of
OMVVM (four agronomists covering vegetables, peppers, artichokes and fruit
trees) and will be augmented, by secondment from other agencies of Government,
with a cereal specialist, forage specialist, entomologist, plant pathologist,
viticulturist, veterinarian, animal husbandry specialist et al as needed.
Local extension and water distribution staff to be assigned to the project
will be as follows:

22.       About 31 vehicles and 112 motorbikes will be provided under the
project to guarantee sufficient mobility for consultants and extension staff
and to transport limited number of farmers for training purposes.
C. Nebhana
The Area
23.       The subproject is located in East-Central Tunisia.  It extends east-
ward over 130 km from the Sidi Messaoud Dam on the Nebhana River and Sbikha to
the Mediterranean Sea near Chott Mariem, and southeastward along the coast to
Mahdia, scattered over 13 irrigation sectios of various sizes, 1/ totalling
about 5,000 ha (Map IBRD 10987). As immediate intensive development of irri-
gated agrizulture appears to be feasible in only the coastal sections of Chott
Mariem, Akouda, Sahline, Teboulba, Vieux Teboulba, Moknine and Bekalta (about
2,000 ha), several of the project items are limited to those sections.
1/   Sbikha (1,163 ha), Fadhloun (168 ha), Enfida (119 ha), Sidi Bou Ali
(938 ha), Chott Mariem (573 ha), Akouda (194 ha), Sahline (173 ha),
Monastir (186 ha), Bembla (250 ha), Teboulba (153 ha), Vieux Teboulba
(400 ha), Moknine (149 ha), and Bekalta (396 ha).



ANNEX 1 0
Page 7
Existing Irrigation, Drainage, and Road Networks
24.       The existing irrigation network consists of:
(a) the Sidi Messaoud Dam (rockfill) on the Nebhana River, which
was completed in 1966. The total storage capacity of the
reservoir is 86 million m3. Siltation of the reservoir should
not be a problem during the proposed project life;
(b) the Bel Assoud Dam (diversion) on a tributary of the Nebhana
River. Its annual diversion capacity is 3 million m3; water
is conveyed into the Sidi Messaoud Reservoir by a 7 km pipeline;
(c) 2 groundwater aquifers, Bled Sisseb (11 tubewells) and Bled
Sbikha (5 tubewells), from which water is pumped directly into
a pipeline system;
(d) main pipeline, 126 km long and 600-1,400 mm wide, designed to
operate on a 24-hour basis to convey water from various supply
points (above) to the irrigation sections;
(e) 12 irrigation sections covering about 5,000 ha, and scattered
over a 100 km distance, equipped with buried low pressure pipes;
with a flow regulator at the head of each section.
25.       A highly sophisticated distribution system with available flow
varying from 10 1/sec to 40 1/sec has been designed for anticipated cropping
patterns under cooperative farming. Technical considerations, disregarding
existing land distribution and owernship, resulted in construction of rectan-
gular irrigation units with a perfect geometric grid system and with farm
roads crossing each other at right angles. At present, land ownership does
nlot conform to this system and water distribution is disorganized, using a
variety of pumps, mobile pipes, small irregular ditches, and other primitive
means. The most common irrigation method is basin irrigation. At the field
level, irrigation effîcieerry is not of acceptable standards and losses may
be great. The overall water supply system is in fairly good condition, al-
though it has not been maintained since construction.
26.       Drainage works are satisfactorv to take care of the internal drain-
age of most soils in the subproject area.  However, flash floods occur, causing
occasional damage to surface drains. Consequently, rehabilitation of drainage
works is mostly confined to repair of surface drains, culverts, and structures
for road/stream crossings.
27.       The road network is adequate, but needs repair and surfacing of
secondary and tertiary roads.



ANNEX 10
Page 8
Project Description
28.       The main elements are:
(a)  assistance in land reform through consolidation and establishment
of farm titles for about 3,800 small private farmers with holdings
over about 5,000 ha and through the provision of supplementary
consultant services;
(b)  rehabilitation of existing irrigation, drainage, and road networks
over about 5,000 ha;
(c) construction of irrigation and drainage works over about 2,000 ha;
(d) establishment of windbreaks over about 1,500 ha;
(e) purchase and utilization of equipment and machinery for operation
and maintenance of the irrigation, drainage, and road networks
over about 5,000 ha and for additional land development work;
(f) on-farm development on about 2,000 ha including construction of
stilling and storage basins, establishment of fruit orchards
over 300 ha, provision of sprinkler equipment for about 400 ha, of
short-term credit for crop production inputs;
(g) improving marketing facilities through provision of credit for
field boxes, vehicles, buildings and equipment;
(h) strengthening the project authority, Office of the Development
of Nebhana (OMIVAN), through provision of specialists and vehicles;
and
(i) assistance to OMIVAN by consultants in preparing engineering
designs and tender documents for works financed under the sub-
project and feasibility studies for development of irrigated
agriculture over about 3,000 ha not included in the subproject.
29.       Land Reform Assistance.  Except for 305 ha of State-owned land in
the Enfida and Monastir sections, all land is privately owned in the 5,000 ha
subproject area. Average holdings are irregularly shaped and extremely small,
ranging from 0.23 ha to 1.33 ha. The situation is so complex that it is
impossible to fit the land ownership and use patterns to the existing irriga-
tion network. Therefore, an all-out program of land consolidation and re-
alignment of parcel boundaries for about 3,800 small private farmers with
holdings over 5,000 ha is essental for further development of irrigated agri-
culture. This task will be carried out by OMIVAN.
30.       By the end of 1973, the Ministry of Agriculture's Directorate of
Land Affairs and Legislation (DAFL) had completed social, agro-economic, and
land surveys on only the Chott Mariem, Sbikha and Sidi Bou Ali sections. In



ANNEX 1 0
Page 9
Chott Mariem and Sidi Bou Ali sections, most landowners now have a legal
ownership title. However, from a schedule submitted by OMIVAN, completion of
land reform, including consolidation and issuance and registration of land
titles, now appears to require up to six years with the present resources
available (manpower and equipment). To ensure that these phases of Land re-
form will be completed within two years for the 2,000 ha to be developed
under the project, OMIVAN will establish a special team, assisted by a land re-
form specialist provided by the project to: carry out social, agro-economic
and land surveys; interpret topographic and cadastral data; and demarcate and
allocate land to be redistributed in accordance with the existing land reform
laws. DAFL will be provided with a second land reform specialist, to be
stationed in Tunis, to assist it in evaluating results of past land reform
activities and advise on future programs. Total cost of this element, in-
cluding staff, surveys, specialized equipment and vehicles will be D 152,000
(US$351 ,000).
31.       Rehabilitation of Existing IrriRation, DrainaRe, and Road Networks.
Minor repairs will be made on the main irrigation pipeline (120 km), supply-
ing the irrigation sections from the dams and tubewells system, where it
crosses stream beds and at other locations where additional protection needs
to be provided against floods and erosion. In addition, many hydraulic equip-
ment parts (automatic valves, air vents, outlet and safety valves, and cathodic
control) will be replaced on the main pipeline. Storage tanks, service build-
ings, storehouses, houses for watchmen, fences, etc. will be repaired. Cost
of this element, including parts and civil works, will be D 75,200 (US$173,000).
Surface drains constructed four years ago will be repaired at a cost approxi-
mately 10% of initial investtent, or about D 80,900 (US$186,000). Secondary
and tertiary (farm) roads (about 50 km) will be surfaced at a total cost of
D 58,300 (US$134,000).
32.       Construction of Irrigation and Drainage Works.  To make the existing
irrigation system more functional, some new works and equipment will be pro-
vided over about 2,000 ha in Chott Mariem, Akouda, Sahline, Teboulba, Vieux
Teboulba, Moknine, and Bekalta sections for rehabilitation or repair. This
includes:
(a) land levelling, including occasional uprooting and removal of old
olive trees and stands, and deep plowing to prepare for planting
of fruit trees (300 ha);
(b) six pumping stations in four sections to boost water pressure
for locations where topography and elevation require irrigation
by sprinklers;
(c) accessory equipment, such as pipes, taps, turnouts, and meters
for infield water distribution; and
(d) construction of civil works involved with providing additional
surface drainage facilities in low areas of four sections (215 ha).



ANNEX 10

33.       Windbreaks.  Windbreaks will be established in the vegetable grow-
ing areas of the project (about 1,500 ha) by double rows of cypresses. Addi-
tional protection against wind in these areas will be provided by prefabricated
artificial windbreaks, such as matting, furnished by the farmers. As field
layouts in Nebhana are quite different from those in Medjerda, the average
cost of establishing similar windbreaks (para 14) will be D 28 (US$64)/ha in
Nebhana versus D 18 (US$41)/ha in Medjerda. Total cost will be D 42,000
(US$96,000).
34.       Equipment and Machinery.  Equipment and machinery for operation and
maintenance of the irrigation, drainage, and road networks over 5,000 ha as
well as for additional land development work over 2,038 ha consist primarily
of earthmoving machinery, trucks, and tractors. A mobile workshop, assorted
tools, generators, and pumps will also be included. Total cost of these
items, detailed in Annex 11, will be about D 168,000 (US$386,000).
35.       On-Farm Development.  Investment credit will be provided to assist
farmers with the construction of stilling and storage basins, the establish-
ment of 300 ha of fruit orchards (apricots and citrus), and the purchase of
sprinkler equipment for about 400 ha. Total cost of these items will be about
D 232,000 (US$534,000). In addition, short-term credit will be extended under
a new credit scheme for crop production input (D 300,000 or US$690,000).
36.       Marketing Services.  Most technical aspects of marketing, consisting
of market information, transport and storage facilities, and sorting, grading
and packing facilities, will be handled by marketing cooperatives, notably the
Central Cooperative for Fruits and Vegetables "Nebhana" (CCN), with guidance
from OMIVAN. Under the project, the following items will be added to existing
facilities so a more effective marketing system is created in the area:

extension agents (where this will not be provided under a Belgian Technical
Assistance Program) and watermen, vehicles, a repair shop for vehicles, and
equipment will be provided.
39.   Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering Design.  The project will
provide for a team of five consultants to make a detailed study of the devel-
opment of irrigated agriculture in 3,000 ha of the four inland sections of:
Sbikha (1,163 ha), Fadhloun (161 ha, Enfida (119 ha), and Sidi Bou Ali (936
ha) and the two coastal sections of Monastir (200 ha) and Bembla (280 ha).
This study will include choice of method of irrigation for each individual
section or part of each section, preparation of designs for irrigation dis-
tribution works in these sections, need for reallocation and consolidation
of farm lands, and crop water demands at full development. The consultants
will use this study as the basis of a feasibility study which could be used
by the Government to request financing of the second development stage in
Nebhana. The consultants will also assist OMIVAN in preparing designs of
complementary works in the seven coastal irrigation sections included in the
subproject. Annex 12 contains detailed terms of reference for the team of
consultants. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture's Directorate for
Hydraulic Studies and Major Works (DGETH) will undertake a study of water
availability for the subproject area within the framework of the regional
water master plans (Annex 12 provides details).

IRRIGATION REHABILITATION PROJECT
Consultants
A.   Introduction
1.        Proposals will be invited from suitable consulting firms or indi-
viduals acceptable to the Bank, to carry out the following:
(a) engineering studies, preparation of final designs and tender
documents for rehabilitation of Medjerda;
(b) extension services and management assistance to OMVVM;
(c) engineering studies, preparation of final designs and tender
documents for Nebhana, including a feasibility study for the
development of the remaining 3,000 ha;
(d) cooperatives, marketing and management assistance to OMIVAN;
In addition, individual specialist consultants, under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, will be employed as follows:
(e) a land reform specialist who will be assigned to the Nebhana
sub-project;
(f) a land reform specialist who will strengthen the Directorate
of Land Affairs and Legislation of the Ministry of Agriculture.
B.   Engineering ad Final Designs for Medjeda
2.        Feasibility.studies, data on soils, water resources etc. are suf-
ficient to enable OMVVM, with the assistance of two consultants (whom it
agrees to recruit) to complete detailed engineering studies for rehabilitation
of the irrigation, drainage and road networks as well as final designs and
tender documents; these consultants will also assist OMIVVM in the evaluation
of bids and supervision of construction during the two years of construction.
The services of two consultants for about 48 man-months are expected.
C.   Extension Services and Management to OMVVM
3.        To assist OMVVM in coordinating its own activities and those of
other Government agencies and organizations concerned with implementing the
project, and in organizing an integrated extension service and undertaking
in-service training, it will be necessary to strengthen the present team.
Two extension specialists will be hired for a total of 48 man-months. The
two extension specialists' experience should be complementary (one should



ANNEX 12
Page 2
have had animal husbandry experience); they should have had about ten years
experience of organizing and operating an integrated extension service and
of in-service training of extension agents and be in a position to coordinate
the work of the pool of specialists, backstopping the agents in the field.
An economist will also be recruited. He should also have had about ten years
experience in organizing and managing economic operations, particularly in the
agricultural sector, as well as in the collection and monitoring of statistical
series. It is expected that a Tunisian economist acceptable to the Bank can
be found.  If external assistance proves necessary, the Government will not
request IBRD financing of his services under the Project.
D.   Feasibility and Design Studies for Nebhana
4.        Detailed technical and economic feasibility and design studies of
three inland sections (Sbikha, Fadhloun, and Enfida) and three coastal sections
(Sidi Bou Ali, Monastir and Bembla) are required before bank financing for a
subsequent project can be contemplated. The scope of work for the studies
will be to:
(a) review and evaluate existing data and documents, with special
attention to soil surveys, land classification and crop produc-
tion and yields, irrigation methods, and identification of
missing information;
(b) undertake field surveys to complete information on agro-
economic and social aspects, in particular future cropping
patterns, taking due account of irrigation water limitations;
(c) prepare feasibility studies for each of the six irrigation
sections, including all engineering, agricultural, economic,
financial, organizational, and legislative aspects;
(d) establish a timetable for further improvement of irrigated
agriculture in the six sections (3,000 ha);
(e) study available irrigation water for the Nebhana irrigation
area (about 5,000 ha) taking due account of existing water
requirements for the seven irrigation sections (2,000 ha) to
be developed under the project. The main objective will be
to ascertain whether sufficient water will be available to
irrigate all the 5,000 ha in the light of growing tourist and
urban demand in nearby areas, and to examine the possibility
of using treated sewerage water from Sousse, Monastir, and
other towns in at least some of the irrigation sections.
In addition, evaluation will have to be made of the extent
to which good quality water from the Nebhana supply system,
presently allocated to irrigation, could, at economic cost,
be diverted to other uses if the same could be replaced by
water less desirable for drinking, but acceptable for irriga-



ANNEX 12
Page 3
tion. The study of water availability will be undertaken
within the framework of the water master plans prepared by
DEGTII. No IBRD financing is foreseen; and
(f) assist OMIVAN with the preparation of:
(i) engineering designs and tender documents for works to be
financed under project; and
(ii) a final feasibility report for the development of part
or all of the remaining 3,000 ha in Nebhana.
5.        Study and preparation of the feasibility report as well as assistance
with detailed designs and tender documents for work to be financed under the
project will be completed within three years. The team of consultants for the
study should include, but need not be limited to the following specialists:
(a)  Civil Engineer/Team Leader (12 months), with practical
experience in design and construction of pipelines, pumping
stations, and associated civil works;
(b)  Irrigation Engineer (12 months), with practical experience
in design, construction, and maintenance of irrigation systems,
including sprinkler systems, in semi-arid areas;
(c)  Agriculturist (6 months), experienced in Mediterranean agri-
culture, especially irrigated vegetable and fruit tree farming;
(d)  Agricultural Economist (12 months), with practical experience
in small farm management and different systems of operation
(such as owner-operator, sharecropper, and cooperative farming)
as well as in the special requirements of off-season vegetables
and fruits for export;
(e) Soil Specialist (6 months), with experience in making and
interpreting soil and land capability surveys.
E.   Cooperatives, Marketing and Management Assistance to OMIVAN
6.        To assist OMIVAN in coordinating its own activities and those of
other Government agencies and organizations concerned with impletnenting the
project, strengthening its extension and marketing services and undertaking
in-service training, a team of three consultants will be required, consisting
of a Senior Advisor, one marketing and cooperatives specialist, and one
vegetable specialist. The Senior Adviser shoulld preferably be an agriculturist
with experience in extension service organization as well as vegetables and
tree crops, in order that he may effectively assist the management in the
organization of extension services. All other members of the team should have
had about ten years experience in organization and managing work in their
respective fields. The marketing and cooperatives specialist will work mainly
with the Nebhana cooperatives, including the Central Cooperative for Fruits



ANNEX 12
Page 4
and Vegetables "Nebhana" (CCN). The vegetables specialist will assist in
OIMIVAN's extension services in the techniques of early vegetables production
and in in-service training. In addition, operational assistance is foreseen
for prospecting markets for production of fruits and vegetables in Nebhana.
One specialist in external markets (3 months) and one specialist in internal
markets, including the transformation industry (also 3 months) will be
recruited, to define and elaborate a marketing system which will assure
marketing of Nebhana production in the best circumstances. In total, 102
man-months are estimated to be needed for these tasks.
F.   Land Reform Specialist for OMIVAN
7.        A land reform specialist will be recruited by OMIVAN to participate
in elaborating land consolidation plans and to assist in executing the different
phases of land reform (24 man-months).
G.   Land Reform Specialist for DAFL
8.        To strengthen DAFL, a specialist acceptable to the Bank will be
assigned to its headquarters (12 man-months).
H.   Short-Term Consultants
9.        It is expected that short-term consultants will be hired for about.
24 man-months.
I.   Fellowships
10.       Fellowships are foreseen for the staff of OMVVM and OMIVAN which
will permit them to travel overseas and to observe how tasks they are expected
to undertake are organized and managed in comparable conditions. A total of
13 man-months is foreseen for this purpose.

Economic Analysis
1.        Tihe main economic benefits from the subprojects are:
(a)  agricultural production increases resulting from:
(i)  additional areas under irrigated crops; and
(ii)  higher crop yields following rehabilitatiotn of the
Medjerda and Nebhana irrigation and drainage systems
and completion of on-farrm development in Nebhana;
(b)  yield increases resulting from strengthened agricultural serv-
ices; and
(c)  savings in rmarketing costs to Nebhana farmers flowing fromi in-
vestments in marketing services to be provided by cooperatives,
notably the Central Cooperative for Fruits and Vegetables
" !rebhana" (CCN).
Tne Internal Economic Rate of Return is based on valuing these benefits over
the 35-year life of the project at economic prices reflecting import/export
parity prices in relevant markets (Table 1).  Table 2 shows the financial
prices used in the f arn incone analysis (Annex 21).
2.        The econonic. costs were obtained by deducting from total project
costs the:
(a)  price contingencies, taxes, and subsidies;
(b)  costs of electrification, water supply, housing, and roads
(nio quantifiable benefits could be estinated for therm);
(c)  suiare of capital ana operation and maintenance costs tlhat
benefit farmers outside tiie 2,038 ha on-farrm development
areas of Medjerda and Nebhana (Tables 4 and 5).
Increased working capital was included as a cost when incurred during the
initial years and added as salvage value to tihe benefits in the last year
of the project.



ANNEX 20

3.        All capital and recurrent costs incurred to date in the development
of the two irrigation areas have been treated as sunk costs. The capital
cost of the Nebhana irrigation system alone is D 24 million (US$55.2 million).
If these costs were included in the economic analysis, the Rate of Return for
the overall project would be negative.
4.        Based on the economic benefits and costs, as defined above, a 28%
overall Internal Lconomic Rate of Return was estimated for the 35-year life
of the project.  For Medjerda and Nebhana, the Rates of Return estimated were
30% and 24%, respectively (Tables 3-5). A number of sensitivity tests were
made on the Rates of Return (Table 6). These tests showed that if the two
most adverse assumptions were to occur together, the Rate of Return would not
be likely to fall below 19% for the combined project and the Rates of Return
for Medjerda and Nebliana would be 19% and 18% respectively.
5.        The project will also result in the following benefits:
(a)  improved income distribution because the sralallest farmers in
IMedjerda and those with less than 1 ha in Nebhana would be the
principal beneficiaries;
(b) better rural living conditions due to investments in social
infrastructure, rural services, and farm housing;
(c) reduced migration to cities as a result of the preceding
factors;
(d)  more secure land tenure through accelerated issuance of land
titles;
(e)  substantially increased employnent, expressed in a 36% in
Medjerda and 53% in Neblhana rise in employment of family
labor and a doubling of the demand for hired labor at full
project development, thus creating full-time employment for
some 3,000 persons (Table 7); and
(f) net foreign exchange savings of about US$3.0 rxillion annually
at full development through increased exports of fruits and
vegetables and reduced imports of livestock and cereals (Table 8).
