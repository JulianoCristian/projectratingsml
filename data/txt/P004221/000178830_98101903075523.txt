INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMNT
REPORT AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR A
TELECOMtJNICATIONS PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in various currencies equivalent to US$4.4 million to Mlalaysia to
finance part of the foreign exchange cost of Malaysia's telecommunica-
tions expansion and improvement program for the 1968-70 period.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       In September 1966, Malaysia applied to the Bank for a loan to
finance the foreign exchange cost of a portion of the telecommunications
expansion and improvement program to be carried out under the First
Malaysia Plan (1966-70). In view of the offers of financial assistance
made by members of the Consultative Group and the particular suitability
of telecommunications equipment for bilateral financing, the Bank asked
the Government to use its best efforts to make the largest possible use
of bilateral credits and grants. This has been done as described in
para 10 below.
3.       The project was appraised in May 1967.  Discussions with the
Government on the introduction of a modern accounting and financial
control system for the Telecommunications Department (IDM) of the
Yinistry of Works, Posts and Telecommunications required subsequent
visits by Bank staff in December 1967 and in M4ay 1968. Negotiations
were held in Washington from July 22 to 26, 1968. Messrs. Abdul Aziz
Zakaria, Permanent Secretary, Nnistry of Works, Posts and Telecommu-
nications, Rastam bin Abdul Hadi, Deputy Under-Secretary (Finance),
the Treasury, Lee Chye Watt, Deputy Director-General, TDM, and Hasim
bin Yeop Abdullah Sani, Deputy Parliamentary Draftsman, Attorney-Gene-
ral's Chamber, represented the Government of Malaysia.
4.       The proposed loan would be the eighth for Malaysia.   A proposed
ninth loan of US$3.6 million for a water supply project is also being
presented (P-631). The Bank made a loan of US$6.8 million in February
1965 to the Public Utilities Board of Singapore under the guarantee of
Malaysia, of which Singapore was then a part. M4alaysia remains the
guarantor of this loan. The following is a summary statement of Bank
loans to Malaysia as at July 31, 1968.

*Effective August 12, 1968.
5.        The rate of disbursement of these loans has been satisfactory,
with the exception of Loan 348-MA to the iMalaysian Industrial Development
Finance Berhad (MIDF); however, the balance of this loan is expected to
be committed by the end of 1968. New loans to Malaysia are under con-
sideration for an education and a power project.
6.        IFC invested US$818,000 in IIDF in conjunction with Loan 348-NA
and in addition has taken part in two financing operations with NIDF; in
March 1966 IFC made a loan of US$1,275,000 and an equity investment of
US$284,000 in Tasek Cement, Ltd., and in May 1967 it made a loan of
US$2,451,000 and an equity investment of US$1,016,000 in Malayawata Steel,
Ltd.



PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.        Borrower:            Malaysia
Amount:              Various currencies equivalent to
US$4.4 million.
Purpose:             To cover part of the foreign exchange
cost of Malaysiats telecommunications
expansion and improvement program for
the 1968-70 period.
Amortization:        In 20 years with a 3-1/2 year period of grace,
through semi-annual installments commencing
March 1, 1972 and ending September 1, 1988.
Interest Rate:       6-1/2% per annum.
Commitment Charge:   3/4 of 1% per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
8.        A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Telecommunications Project,
Malaysia" (TO-662a) dated August 20, 1968.
9.        The rise in demand for telecommunications services - local, long
distance and international telephone, telegraph and telex - has been high
and well above the increase of new facilities during recent years. New
applications for telephones waiting at the end of 1967 were about 12,000,
equal to two years of installation at the 1967 rate. Future demand for
local telephone services is estimated to increase annually by 10% in
Sarawak, by 11% in West Malaysia and by 13% in Sabah.  The program, of
which the project to be financed by the proposed Bank loan is a part,
is technically sound and well designed to meet the countryts essential
needs for telecommunications services. It is economically justified
within the general framework of the First lIalaysia Plan.
10.       The project to be financed by the proposed Bank loan consists
of the last three-year (1968-70) portion of TDM's program under the
First Malaysia Plan for the expansion and improvement of telecommu-
nications services. The total construction cost of the project,
excluding financial charges during construction, is estimated at
US$49.0 million equivalent and the foreign exchange component at
US$25.0 million equivalent. Malaysia has already succeeded in obtaining
for the project bilateral financing on acceptable terms from Australia,
Germany, Japan, Sweden and the U.K. amounting to US$13.4 million equiva-
lent. Negotiations for obtaining a further US$3.2 million equivalent
from Consultative Group member countries are in progress; if negotiations
for the whole or for part of this amount cannot be completed successfully



the Government will make the necessary funds available.  These existing
and expected bilateral credits and grants together with the proposed
Bank loan would thus finance US$21.0 million of the foreign exchange
requirements. Internal cash generation would cover the balance of funds
required for completing the project.
11.      The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange com-
ponent of extensions to the subscribers outside plant and to the telegraph
and telex facilities together with part of the long distance and inter-
national networks. It would also cover mechanical aids and tools, power
and wiring accessories, engineering and planning services. All equipment
to be financed under the proposed Bank loan will be procured on the basis
of international competitive bidding from external sources of supply.
12.      The TDM is capable of carrying out the proposed expansion and is
well prepared to operate the new facilities. However, its system of
accounting, maintained in accordance with present Treasury regulations
and budgetary procedures, does not provide adequate financial information
and meaningful financial data essential to efficient management of a
rapidly expanding revenue earning public utility. The Government has
undertaken to establish by December 31, 1972, and thereafter to maintain
in TDM an effective system of accounting and financial management, within
the framework of a reform of its national budget introducing "Program and
Performance" budgeting.
13.      TDM's present financial position based on a pro forma presentation
of its accounts appears satisfactory and forecasts indicate that it will
remain sound. The Government has undertaken, after the new accounting
system has been introduced, to adjust telecommunications tariffs to provide
revenues sufficient to produce an annual rate of return of not less than
8% on the value of TDM's net fixed assets in operation.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
14.      The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank and the
Report by the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
15.      The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions generally used for
the Bank loans for telecommunications projects. In addition, the draft
Loan Agreement provides that the Borrower shall establish by December 31,
1972 in its Telecommunications Department an effective system of account-
ing and financial management (Section 5.06).



PART V - THE ECN0IOY
16.      The most recent economic report on Malaysia (AS-127) was
circulated to the Executive Directors as follows: Volume I (Main
Report) on May 29, 1967 (R67-72) and Volume II (Agriculture in West
Malaysia) on July 19, 1967 (R67-110). A memorandum updating the infor-
mation in the Economic Report was attached to the President's Report
(P-589) on the Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project, dated March 28,
1968. An economic mission visited Malaysia in July/August 1968, and its
report is expected to be distributed to the Executive Directors in
November.
17.      The rapid rate of economic growth experienced by Malaysia during
the five years up to 1966 slowed down significantly during 1967. The
principal cause for this was the decline in the price of rubber by over
20% between late 1966 and the end of 1967. M4alaysia's export earnings
as a consequence declined in 1967 by US$43.0 million or 3.4 percent,
despite the offsetting influence of the timber export boom. This develop-
ment in turn was largely responsible for a decline in the growth rate
of Malaysia's GNP from an average 7.5% in the preceding three years to
about 4', in 1967.  There has been no significant recovery in exports up
to mid-1968; prospects are for only a modest acceleration of GNP in 1968.
18.      Domestic savings continue at the relatively high level of 17.5
of GNP, and gross investments have remained virtually unchanged at
around 18.5% of GNP. Investment in perennial crops has been going down
since 1963, and this movement is still continuing. Investment in commerce
and industry, after a five-year period of rapid growth, declined soamewhat
in 1967, but for 1968 a slight pickup is expected. Institutional improve-
ments and the recently enacted Investment Incentives Act should, in the
longer run, help improve Malaysia's already generally favorable private
investment climate.
19.       Public development expenditures under the First Malaysia   Plan
(1966-70) have by and large been on target so far. Expenditures in 1966
through 1968 are likely to reach 56% of the five-year target with
relatively faster advances to date in housing, transport and social
investment, and a somewhat slower implementation in agriculture and
education. The latter sector has received an increasing share in the
total budget through a rapid expansion of current expenditures. In the
case of agriculture and land development, Central Government investment
is making satisfactory progress but shortfalls have occurred in schemes
carried out under the authority of independent and State agencies.
20.      With the additional tax effort in recent years, Malaysia's
performance in raising revenue continues to be satisfactory, but the
economy drive in recurrent expenditures envisaged in the Plan has been
only partly successful. This, together with the weakening of the tax
base due to the adverse external factors in 1967, has led to a situation
in which the Government is faced with a difficult financing problem.



- 6 -
Considerable scope remains for extending domestic market borrowing by
the Government, but there has been disappointing progress in the absorp-
tion of external project assistance. Disbursements of bilateral project
assistance in 1967 amounted to only about US$12 million, equivalent to
1.3% of total imports, and renewed efforts are required both in project
preparation and in the simplification of procedures if efficient use is
to be made of existing credit offers.
21.      Malaysia continues to be an open, market-oriented economy.
Encouragement of private enterprise and free convertibility are important
conditions for economic strength. Recent events have brought about a rate
of external reserve drawdown that was faster than contemplated, partly
because of extraordinary factors such as the repatriation of short-term
government securities caused by changes in Singapore's banking regulations,
and the devaluation of sterling. This trend continued in the first half
of 1968, but there are reasons to expect some recovery during the second
half. Total reserves remain at the rather comfortable level of US$580
million or about six months' imports. External debt outstanding in May
1968 was US$276 million, and debt service payments for 1968 will be about
2.5% of merchandise exports. Malaysia continues to be creditworthy for
substantial additional amounts of external borrowing on conventional terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
22.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMIMENDATION
23.      I recommend that the Executive Directors adopt the following
resolution:
RESOLUTION NO.
Approval of Loan to Malaysia in an
amount equivalent to US$4,400,000
RESOLVED:
THAT the Bank shall grant a loan to Malaysia in an amount in
various currencies equivalent to four million four hundred thousand
United States dollars (US$4,400,000), to mature on and prior to September
1, 1988, to bear interest at the rate of six and one-half per cent (6-1/2%)
per annum, and to be upon such other terms and conditions as shall be
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
form of Loan Agreement (Telecommunications Project) between Malaysia and
the Bank, which has been presented to this meeting.
