This program includes output-based subsidies for\n            Medium-Term Service Contracts (MSC) aimed at SHS market\n            development, and will be competitively tendered. The MSC is\n            a new model for PV market development that balances\n            providers' wish to minimize risk exposure with the\n            government's desire to maximize control. The ERTIC\n            program and the MSCs are financed by the International\n            Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank. Locally,\n            the program is technically coordinated by the Program\n            Coordination Unit (UCP) of the Ministry of Electricity and\n            alternative energies of the Government of Bolivia (GOB)."}, "docdt": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
