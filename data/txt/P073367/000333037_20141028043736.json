Some lessons learned included:\n            rural projects should be carefully designed to minimize\n            implementation difficulties. In this project, adopting a\n            multisectoral approach, depending on two different\n            ministries, unduly complicated project design (although at\n            the time of preparation, multisectoral projects were being\n            supported by the Bank). Maintaining flexibility during\n            project execution is an important lesson, as exemplified by\n            the project\u0092s cooperation with other donors with similar\n            interests; implementing a parallel activity to the GIZ cook\n            stove initiative was an incentive to users for adopting SHS,\n            particularly once the first stoves were installed and\n            demonstrated within a community. Cooperation with other\n            Government and local institutions is an important element\n            for project success in rural initiatives. In the case of the\n            project, provincial governments and municipalities were\n            successfully involved to reach the target population. Again,\n            the main lesson is to improve as much as possible on local\n            knowledge and to support contractors for the project to be successful."}, "docdt": "2011-11-23T00:00:00Z"}
