                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER



SUMMARY
This restructuring proposal is in response to the request from the Government of Liberia.
The specific request of the government are as follows: (a) to extend the closing date of
the Emergency Senior Executive Service Project (ESESP) from December 31, 2010 to
June 30, 2011; and (b) to re-allocate the sum of US$60,000 from the recurrent costs
expenditure category of the project to goods, consultancy and training expenditure
category.


PROJECT STATUS
1. The project was approved by the Board on October 12, 2007 and it became effective
on the same day, with a total commitment of US$2.30 million and a closing date of
December 31, 2010. As at September 30, 2010, the project has disbursed about US$1.78
million. The last Implementation Status and Results (ISR) report submitted in June 2010
showed that the project has two risk flags ­ country environment flag and slow
disbursement flag. These risk flags underscore the delays in project implementation in
2008, which was caused by the challenging implementation environment. Despite these
initial challenges, the overall Implementation Progress (IP) and the likelihood of the
project achieving its Development Objective (DO) were both rated Satisfactory (S).

2. The project made good progress in the implementation of activities under the two
components of the project. About 33 professionals recruited under SES have continued to
make valuable contributions to their respective host institutions by playing leadership
roles in setting up new units of government which emerged in response to new post-
conflict challenges. The most notable of these include the Sexual and Gender Based
Violence Crime Unit (SGBVU), the James A.A. Pierre Institute, and the Land Reform
Commission--where SES recruits serve as Chief Prosecutor/Administrator, Executive
Director, and Land Reform Coordinator respectively. SES professionals have also made
contributions to the processes of policy formulation and implementation. They are also
charged with the responsibility for monitoring and ensuring that the Poverty Reduction
Strategy (PRS) deliverables are on track both at the national and sub-national
levels.Overall, the Development Objectives (DO) of the project remains achievable.


PROPOSED CHANGES
3. Extension of the Project Closing Date: The Government of Liberia requested for
the extension of the closing date of the project from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011.
                                           4
If this request is granted, it will be the first extension of the project's closing date.This
extension will give the recipient the opportunity to continue to benefit from the services
of the SES professionals for an additional period of six months. This extra time will help
to compensate for the delays in implementation suffered as a result of weak project
management capacity at the beginning of the project. This capacity issue has since been
addressed by the replacement of the National Project Coordinator, with a more
experienced project manager.

4. Reallocation of Grant Proceeds: The Government of Liberia also requested for
additional resources to cover the gap in funding for monitoring the performance of SES
professionals, who are widely spread across the country. To address this issue, we
propose the re-allocation of the sum of US$60,000 (Sixty Thousand Dollars only) from
the recurrent costs expenditure category to the goods, consultancy and training category.


APPRAISAL SUMMARY
5. None of the proposed changes will have a major effect on the original economic,
financial, technical, or social aspects of the project as appraised; nor will they raise the
environmental category of the project or trigger new safeguard policies. A re-appraisal
will therefore not be needed. Finally, the proposed changes will involve no exceptions to
Bank                                                                                 policy.
