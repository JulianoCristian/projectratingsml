The extension is necessary to\n            extend the closing date of the project from December 31,\n            2010 to June 30, 2011; and to re-allocate the sum of\n            US$60,000 from the recurrent costs expenditure category of\n            the project to goods, consultancy and training expenditure\n            category. This extension will give the recipient the\n            opportunity to continue to benefit from the services of the\n            Senior Executive Service (SES) professionals for an\n            additional period of six months. This extra time will help\n            to compensate for the delays in implementation suffered as a\n            result of weak project management capacity at the beginning\n            of the project. This capacity issue has since been addressed\n            by the replacement of the national project coordinator, with\n            a more experienced project manager. None of the changes will\n            have a major effect on the original economic, financial,\n            technical, or social aspects of the project as appraised;\n            nor will they raise the environmental category of the\n            project or trigger new safeguard policies. A re-appraisal\n            will therefore not be needed. Finally, the changes will\n            involve no exceptions to bank policy."}, "docdt": "2010-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
