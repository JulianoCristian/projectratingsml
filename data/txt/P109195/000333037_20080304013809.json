assistance needed to\n            develop a cadre of technical and managerial public servants\n            who are well motivated to both meet immediate high level\n            capacity needs and help transform the civil service into a\n            more professional, effective and accountable institution of\n            the Government of Liberia. The project has two components\n            with the first being the recruitment of members for the\n            Senior Executive Service (SES) scheme which involves the\n            recruitment of a minimum of 100 SES members. A total of 21\n            positions will be recruited as the first wave of\n            recruitment. The second component is for the management of\n            the SES scheme. This component would be used to procure\n            basic furniture and office equipment to support and\n            strengthen the capacity of Civil Service Agency (CSA) as the\n            oversight civil service institution to eventually manage the\n            SES program at the end of the project. In addition, the\n            component will be used to pay for travel and relocation\n            expenses, workshops and seminars to be organized on the SES\n            scheme, exit package, and monitoring and evaluation of the scheme."}, "docdt": "2007-10-16T00:00:00Z"}
