The project is the Bank's\n            first endeavor to assist in the evaluation of coal reserves\n            in Argentina. The project provided the government with a\n            basic coal reserves inventory, thus enabling it to establish\n            investment priorities, define policies for the long-term\n            development of the Argentinian energy sector, and strengthen\n            the technical capabilities of YCF. This report reviews the\n            implementation of the project based upon the data from\n            project documents and files at the Bank. The evaluation of\n            coal resources improved and strengthened the sector\n            knowledge. The project provided the starting point for\n            dialogue with the Secretariat of Energy on coal as a\n            supplement to other energy sources. The project resulted in\n            a more accurate assessment of the coal resources of the\n            Austral Basin of southern Argentina while providing\n            equipment and training to strengthen YCF. From a technical\n            point of view, the project was successful."}, "docdt": "1989-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
