PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COAL EXPLORATION PROJECT
(LOAN S-20-AR)
PREFACE
The Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews the performance of the
Coal Exploration Project in the Republic of Argentina channeled through
Yacimientos Carboniferos Fiscales (YCF). The project is the Bank's first
endeavor to assist in the evaluation of coal reserves in Argentina.  With a
total cost of US$20.0 million, the nroject provided the governmeat with a
basic coal reserves inventory, thus erabling it to establish investment
priorities, define policies for the long-term dsvelopment of the
Argentinian energy sector, and strer.,then the tezhnical capabilities of
YCF. Established in 1946 as a government department for the oevelopment of
Rio Turbio mine, by 1958 YCF has be:ome the state coal enterprise
responsible for the regulation and exploitation of solid fuels and reported
to the Secretariat of Energy withii the Ministry of Economy.
Loan S-20-AR for US$10.0 million was approved on May 13, 1981 and
declared effective on April 7, 1982. The original closing date (December
31, 1985) was postponed twice to February 28, 1987.
This report reviews the implementation of the project based upon
the data from project documents and files at the Bank. No Bank mission
visited Argentina for the purpose of preparing the PCR. It was prepared by
the Trade, Finance and industry Operations Division of the Country
Department IV, Latin America and Caribbean Region and Asia Technical
De.!artment.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrover, the Executing Agency, and the con-
sulting company on April 17, 1989, for comments by May 30, 1989. Comments
received from the consulting company are attached to the report as Annex 4.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COAL EXPLORATION PROJECT
(LOAN S-20-AR)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The loan under review was the Bank's first coal exploration in
Argentina. It was made to evaluate the coal reserves in the most promising
areas of the Austral Basin, in the province of Santa Cruz, Southern
Argentina. Also, the loan was designed to pruvide the Government of
Argentina with a basic coal reserves inventory, thus enabling it to
establish investment priorities and define policies for the long-term
development of the energy sector. The loan was for US$10.0 million to
finance the foreign cost of the project with a total estimated cost of
US$20.0 million
2.       The project was appraised in April 1980 and approved by the Board
in December 1980. The project was to be carried out over a period of four
years and consisted of: (a) a drilling program, involving approximately 60
boreholes with a total length of 32,000 m; (b) high resolution seismic
tests, with a total line length of 600 km; (c) geological reconnaissance,
including mapping, trenching, and sampling over an area of up to 30,000
km2; and (d) prefeasibility studies, including conceptual and basic
engineering design for specific projects resulting from the exploration
activities. The executing agency for the project was YCF (para. 3.07).
3.       These objectives were successfully achieved.  The government now
has a greatly improved assessment of coal reserves in the Rio Turbio area
and an evaluation of the potential of the northern part of the Austral
Basin. In particular, extensive coal reserves at the Rio Turbio mine were
proven to be technically recoverable. At the same time YCF acquired new
exploration equipment and its personnel received extensive training and
experience in modern exploration techniques and in the development of
conceptual mine feasibility studies (para. 3.02-3.05).
4.       The implementation of the project was slower than had originally
been envisaged. The project started with delays both in the signing of the
loan and in its effectiveness, due to the lengthy process of fulfilling
official requirements in Argentina and the execution of a subsidiary
financing agreement between the government and YCF. This agreement
included the service contract by YCF for consulting services (para. 2.04).
Additional delays occurred during implementation of some components as
result of YCF's lack of experience in dealing with the Bank and in
conducting major explorations (para. 3.01).



S.       Bureaucratic procedures YCF used to procure services, especially
those related to awarding contracts, slowed the pace of the project
implementation (para. 3.10). With regard to the seismic work, the YCF
bidding evaluation procedures were unacceptable to tho Bank, consequently
the Bank funds were not made available to support this contract. Lack of
local funds to pay custom charges on equipment and spare part. delayed the
drilling work. Difficulties in obtaining import permits for goods
purchased overseas also contributed to the delay in the 1 oject
implementation (para. 3.09).
6.       YCF assigned responsibility to a team for the execution of the
project, including administering and monitoring of the project as well as
liasing with consultants. ThM team did not have the experience necessary
to oversee either major exploration or consultants. Also, it did not
receive support from other departments (legal, ,rocurement, administration)
within "CF. Technical input by YCF staff fell below the expected level;
they became assistants to the consultants (para. 3.07-3.08)
7.       The performance of the consultants and contractors met high
standards and formed a basis which will enable YCF to continue exploration
that meets international standards without technical assistance
(para.3.13-3.14)
8.       Bank staff actively worked with YCF durirg the project
implementation and expanded the project when conditions warranted. The
Bank monitored procurement closely to avoid additional delays in the
implementation. Constant requests for the audited project accounts,
stipulated in the Project Agreement, failed to produce results. Bank's
relationship with YCF was satisfactory throughout the project
implementation period (para. 3.14).
9.       The consultants' financial and economic analyses of the Rio Turbio
mine operation were over optimistic, particularly with respect to coal
prices. Such results have encouraged YCF to pursue further coal
development at Rio Turbio despite the clear lack of economic return pointed
out by the Bank during the implementation.
10.      Any corporation implementing a similar project would be greatly
assisted by (a) the establishment of a special account for foreign exchange
and a revolving fund for local currency; (b) granting the project manager
authority to make signi'icant decisions without time consuming review by
management committees: and (c' exempting the project from the 'Compre
Argentina" legislatioa. If the above arrangements had been set up for this
project, it is probable that the project would have been completed within
the original time frame.

(LOAN S-20-AR)
INTRODUCTION
Economic Background
1.01     Argentina is richly endowed with human and natural resources.
However, its recent history has been characterized by volatile political,
social, and economaic change. There has been no net growth in GDP since
1978, even given the high growth rates for exports in some years due to
special conditions (e.g., recovery of cereals or when Soviet Union
purchased US$3.5 billion of grain following the U.S. embargo in 1981).
1.02     President Alfonsin who assnmed the presidency in December 1983
found the country essentially bankru-pt with an external debt of close to
US$45.0 billion equivalent to about 70Z of GDP. Initial attempts to
stabilize the economy failed. In June 1985, a new economic team introduced
the Plan Austral to deal with the country's rampant inflation and external
payment crisis. Its key elements were a wage price/freeze, reform. At the
same time a new currency, the Austral, was introduced with the exchange
rate fixed to the US dollar. The immediate results of the plan were a fall
in inflation to 22 per month in 1985, a money demand increased and an
increase in the trade surplus to US$4.6 billion. A second set of measures,
introduced in 1986, included increasing public sector prices and also wages
and pensions to correct their erosion in real terms.
1.03     In 1986, the economy began a modest recovery, with both investment
and consumption expenditures increasing. GDP rose by about 5.71, led by a
robust industrial recovery. In 1987, the economy slowed considerably as a
result of the impact of adverse weather conditions on the agricultural
sector. The trade surplus dropped to US$492.0 million --about US$1.5
billion less than expected-- and uncertainty regarding country's external
financing contributed to the deterioration of economic conditions. In the
financing plan agreed with IMF and commercial banks, Argentina should
receive a total of US$1.95 million in new money. In early 1988, the
clouded short-term outlook for Argentina seemed to believe the improved
medium-term structural change in the economy. The fiscal deficit was
decreasing but not as quickly as the financing plan required. The economy
stalled. However, structural changes affecting real productive activities
were beginning to take hold.  The main objectives of the government's
economic policy is provide a sustainable growth to help consolidate
democracy.



-2-
Energy Sector
1.04     Argentina's energy resources are abundant and diverse.  They
include oil, gas, hydropower, coal and uranium. Since 1984, 501 of its
energy was produced by oil, 33? by gas, 5Z by hydropower and nuclear
fission, and the balance from biomas, coal, and other sources. These
resources have been inefficiently developed by the public sector, which has
led to a heavy financial burden.  Energy policy in Argentina is set by the
Secretariat of Energy.  The government asts prices and production targets
and approves the budgets for state-run enterprises in the oil, coal, and
gas sector.
1.05     Coal resources have been estimated at 424 million tons, of which
224 million tons can be classified as measured.1/  In addition, another 26
million tons have been reported as inferred.2/   This coal is classified as
a highly volatile, bituminous steam coal. Based on the "Plan Energetico
Nacional 1986-2000", the annual demand for coal will increase from 1219 x
103 tce in 1986 to 1804 x 103 tce in 1990 and 1783 x 103 tce in 2000 (see
Annex 1). The government has decided to maintain production at Rio Turbio
'the only coal mine in the country) rather than import coal. This decision
was made independent of the economic and financial viability of the
operation. The use of coal is rationalized by arguing that gas pipeline
capacity is inadequate and excess fuel oil should be conserved for export.
The "Plan Energetico Nacicnal' recommended major expansion of raw coal
production at Rio Turbio to 4.3 million tons per year. About 80Z of Rio
Turbio's output has been used for power generation in Buenos Aires, the
balance is used for heating and powering the railway connecting the mine
with the port at Rio Gallegos, a port which can only handle about
1.0 million metric tons per year (tpy). New expansion implies a relocation
of tho port facilities.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL OBJECTIVES
Preparation
2.01     Historscally coal production in Argentina, with a few
insignificant exceptions, has been limited to production from the Rio
Turbio mine in extreme southweQtern Argentina, which was developed in the
late 1940s. The mine has been operated by Yacimient-s Carboniferos
Fiscales (YCF), a state enterprise reporting to the Secretariat of Energy.
YCF has been responsible for the exploration and development of the Rio
Turbio mine and for the transpott and sale of the produced coal (para.
3.06). However, iCF's exploration efforts over the last 30 years have been
1/ Measured reserves are those for which tonnage is computed from
dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, mine workings, and drill
holes.
2/ Inferred resources are those for which quantitative estimates are based
on broad knowledge of the geological character of the bed or region and
for which few measurements of bed thickness are available.



minimal and it accumulated insufficient knowledge of coal reserves making
it impossible for the Secretariat of Energy to plan for the energy sector.
2.02     In accordance with government's d6sire to increase its knowledge
of the coal resources in Argentina, the Bank was approached in 1979 for
assistance in evaluating the coal resources of the Austral Basin and its
potential role in the energy seztor. The specific areas to be explored had
already been identified and a detailed exploration plan defined, including
the techniques to be used, the. implementation schedule, the resources
required, the project managemisnt, and the estimated costs. This
exploration program was prepared by the Exploration Department of YCF and
had two main components: to increase the measured resource base at the Rio
Turbio mine so as to permit investment for increased production, and to
carry out extensive exploration of other potential coal-bearing areas in
the Austral Basin.
2.03     Planning for coal development in Argentina has been inadequate ir.
part because of insuffici3nt knowledge of and in part due to the limited
scope and weakness of YCF. For these reasons, it was not possible for the
planning agencies to incorporate the coal potential in long-term energy
policies. After reviewing of all data available, a project was formulated
by YCF. A Bank mission discussed the project with the government in
November 1979 and its preliminary scope was developed at that time.
2.04     The appraisal of the project was carried out in April 1980.
Negotiations were held in Washington from September 30 to October 1, 1980
and a loan for US$10.0 million was approved on December 9, 1980. However,
signing of the loan was delayed until May 13, 1981 due to the lengthy
process of fulfilling official requirements in Argentina, which included
issuance of a Presidential Decree. The loan became effective April 7,1982,
almost a year and a half after loan approval because of delays in the
approval by the Tribunal de Cuentas and the execution of a subsidiary
financing agreement between the government and YCF incorporating a service
contract for consulting services.
Major Issues Discussed During Loan Preparation and Negotiatiors
2.05     During preparation of the loan, adequate measures were discussed
and undertaken to address the following issues:
(a)  Local Financing.  It was agreed that the Secretariat of Energy
would provide US$10.0 million in local currency through the Fondo
Nacional de la Energia. Such funds would be budgeted as part of
contribution to YCF to develop extra exploration activities.
However, the approval from the Ministry of Economy was necessary.
The confirmation of the availability of this local financing was
obtained prior to the loan negotiations.
(b)  Exploration Licenses.  Obtaining the mining exploration licerse
for the area of Santa Craz was a concern during preparation of the
project. YCF held a permanent mining concession over the



- 4 -
exploration adjacent to the Rio Turbio mine. Licenses were
granted to YCF before the Board presentation of the loan.
(c)  Procuiement.  During preparation of the project it was not clear
whether some equipment items included in the Bank procurement
packages, (e.g., vehicles produced in Argentina) could be procured
under Bank guidelines. Bank recommended that government confirm
in writing all items were eligible for ICB. Also, the Bank
euggested that the in-hole geophysical logging service and the
seismic services be included in the general consulting contract,
in case the selected firm could not provide such services.
(d)  Borrower.  It was agreed th-.t YCF could not be the borrower
because of its extremely weak financial situation. (It was
operating at a loss and was heavily subsidized by the government).
The Bank recommended that the borrower should be the Republic of
Argentina; the loan proceeds together with local funding from the
Fondo Nacional de la Energia would then be passed to YCF as equity
contributions.
(e)  Auditing.  The Bank accepced the Sindicatura General de Empresas
Pdblicas de la RepCxblica de Argentina as an independent auditor
provided that it consistently applied procedures and methods
conforming to generally acceptable auditing standards anid it
carried out its work in a timely manner to ensure compliance with
the requirements set forth in Sector 4.02 of the Project
Agreement.
Appraisal Objectives
2.06     The Coal Exploration Project was designed to carefully evaluate
the coal reserves in the most promising aress of the Austral Basin and
provide the government with a basic coal reserves inventory to analyze the
future investment priorities and define polities for the long-term
development of the energy sector. At the same time, extensive training in
current exploration technology would be given to the staff of YCF to enable
them to continue detailed exploration. Given the long period required for
increasing the level of coal production, the exploration program was to be
carried out as soon as possible.
2.07     The project was to have been carried out over a period of four years
(September 1981-April 1985) and consisted of the following activities:
(a)  A drilling program, involving approximately 60 boreholes with a
total length of about 32,000 m;
(b)  High resolution seismic tests, with a total length of about
600 km;
(c)  Geological reconnaissance, including mapping, trenching, and
sampling over an area of up to 30,000 km0;



(d)  Ptefeasibility studies, including conceptual and basic engineering
design for specific projects that might be identified as a result
of the exploration campaign.
The project was to define coal reserves in the Rio Turbio area,
(located at the southern rim of the Austral Basin). Furthermore, coal
prospects along the northeastern and northwestern rim of the basin (in the
areas of Rio Lista, Lago Cardiel, Man Aike, Rio Chalia, Rio Santa Cruz, and
the Bajc de Julian) were to be examined.
2.08     Geologic knowledge of the Austral Basin was based on the surface
information generated by Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF). The
sediments date from the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods; the major
coal-bearing formations formed during early Tertiary times. Oil well data
reveal the overall structure of the basin to be a south-plunging,
asymmetrical syncline3/ with steeper western flank (250) near the Andean
uplift, and shallow dips on the eastern side.  The major coal-bearing
formation is the Rio Leona composed mostly of claystones and shales, with
occasional sandstone layers. This formation generally erodes easily and
does not outcrop very well.4/   The Rio Turbio and Rio Lista areas however,
do form outcrops in various places.
Project Description
2.09     The exploration campaign was designed based on information
obtained from drilling programs and surface mapping carried out by YCF and
concentrated on the following areas (listed in order of priority al.' coal
potential):
(a) Rio Turbio. The proposed YCF drilling program was a continuation
of previous programs. The purpose of the additional drilling was
to upgrade the knowledge of reserves to form more reliable
categories. This area was the most promising target; only 50Z of
total reserves, estimated at 424 million tons, had been measured
and there were excellent prospects for finding considerably more.
Approximately 27 drillholes with a total depth of 17,300 m were
planned.
(b) Austral Basin. The geological and structural characteristics and
the resource potential of the northeastern and northwestern rim of
the Austral Basin were also to be explored. Geological
reconnaissance and mapping would be carried out over the whole
area from Rio Lista in the west to the Bajo de San Julian in the
east. Drilling and seismic requirements were to be determined as
this work progressed. There were four subareas:
3/ Syncline: a fold in which the strata dip inward from both sides toward
the axis.
4/ Outcrop: a geological formation or mineral deposit visible at the
earths surface.

ti)    Rio Lista.  Surface studies had mapped the outcrop zones
showing shale beds containing a series of coal seams up to
3.5 m in thickness. Selected outcrop samples indicated
coal quality comparable to Rio Turbio. Since this was an
area where coal was known to occur exploratory &rilling
herb. wai a top priority.
(ii)   Lago Cardiel.  Oil drilling had discovered carbonaceous
zones from both the Tertiary and Upper Cretaceous periods.
Three deep holes penetrating both zones were to be drilled.
(iii)  Rio Chalia/Man Aike.  Oil well data indicated carbonaceous
zones at depths ranging from 100 m to 800 m. Initially,
three drill holes were to be drilled.
(iv)   Rio Santa Cruz.  Oil well data indicated a carbonaceous
zone at a depth of 450-675m. Six holes were to be drilled
2.10     The training component was designed to strengthen the technical
YCF in the managentent and execution of field exploration and coal-related
feasibility studies. iechnical assistance was to be provided throughout
the exploration program and the prefeasibility studies.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
3.01     Project inplementation was planned for a four-year period
(September 1981-April 1985). YCF was in charge of carrying out all project
components. The project did not get underway until mid-1982. Serious
delays started with the signature and effectiveness of the loan due to
delays in the subsidiary financing agreement and the contracting of
consulting services. As a condition of effectiveness, YCF was required to
enter into a contract with a consulting firm which would oversee project
implementation. YCF took the first steps, however, it was discovered that
YCF failed to comply with Argentine law. (YCF did not publish the required
public notice inviting interested firms to present proposals in local
papers.) Delays in signing the loan and the seasonal limitations for field
exploration contributed to the late start of the first drilling campaign.
More delays accumulaLed duL.ng later phases. YCF had no experienee in
dealing with the Bank; its experience in major exploration efforts was also
limited. Procurement issues and the bureaucratic procedures of YCF (paras.
3.09-3.10) affected the implementation of some components. The closing and
completion dates for the loar, were moved from the original date, December
31, 1985, to February 20, 1987.
Geological Work
3.02     The geologic knowledge about the Austral Basin was mostly based on
subsurface information genarated from YPF's oil well data. The sediments
date from the Cretace(us and Tertiarv periods; the major coal-bearing
formations were created in early Tertiary times.  Geological analysis



- 7
concentrated on the areas adjacent to the Rio Turbio and the northern Santa
Cruz area. The northern areas of the Austral Basin were found to be less
attractive geologically than had been the original thought and no further
exploration of these areas was recommended. A high standard of geological
training was provided Empress Nacional Adaro de Investigaciones Mineras,
S.A. (ENADIMSA), a geological consultant firm from Spain. The training has
formed a basis which will enable YCF carry out exploration meeting
international standards without technical assistance.
Drilling Program
3.03     The total drilled length was 35.861 m distributed as follows: (a)
25,065 m at the Rio Turbio and (b) 10,796 m in the northern area of the
Austral Basin. The 60 holes were drilled through the coal-bearing zone and
measurements taken throughout their length. Two low quality lignite coal
seams, the thickest averaging 4m were found at an average depth of 470 m.
There were serious delays in the implementation of this component were
caused by bureaucratic procedures within YCF and difficulties in obtaining
import permits for drilling equipment. Such delays were critical; a whole
sunmner drilling season was lost, delaying the project for almost a year.
The drilling equipment services were supplied by US consulting firms.
Seismic Survey
3.04     The seismic survey completed only 55 km of testing compared to the
600 km envisioned at appraisal. However, this component was not financed
within the loan as originally planned; YCF bid evaluation procedures proved
unacceptable. YCF failed to submit the results of the seismic program,
apparently because they no longer considered it part of the project (para.
3.11).
Prefeasibility Studies
3.05     As a result of the exploration campaign, a preliminary feasibility
study for additional mine development at Rio Turbio was completed by YCF in
cornjunction with their consultants. In the other areas the coal reserves
seemed inadequate to justify the completion of prefeasibility studies.
Project Management
3.06     YCF took charge of project implementation.  It had originally been
created, in 1946, as a gcvernment department for developing the Rio Turbio
mine. In 1958, it became a state enterprise; its autonomy increased but
even today it is dependent on the Secretariat of Energy, for much support
especially for investment decisions. YCF is responsible for exploration
and exploitation of the Rio Turbio coal deposit as well as for transport
and sale of the coal produced. The company is also responsible for
carrying out exploration activities for solid fuels in other regions of the
country.
3.07     The projected was implemented by YCF through a project management
team, which was assisted by an expatriate consulting firm. In accordance



- a -
Bank recommendations, YCF formed a committee that was responsible for the
administration of the project, including monitoring of the project and
liaising with consultants. The drilling rigs, procured from the proceeds
of the loan, we:: operated by expatriate experts with the assistance of
local YCF personnel.
3.08     During the project implementation, YCF continually impr-ved their
management. Initially, the team responsible for the execution of the
project did not have the sxperience neceesary for a major exploration
*ffozt nor dealing with the bank and consultants. In addition, it did not
have support from other government departments (legal, procurement,
administration, etc.). Consequently, the decisionmaking process especially
with regard to the award of contracts remained very slow. The slow
decisionmaking reflected not so much the inability of YCF to review the
proposals but rather the numerous bureaucratic procedures required to
establish, receive, and evaluate reports from the YCF bid evaluation
committee. Senior management was very slow in reacting to the comnittee's
recommendations and authorizing the necessary actions. Technical input by
YCF staff was below the standard expected; the project consultants finally
become the managers rather than the advisors of the project. In effect,
YCF staff became assistants to the consultants. This reflected lack of
experience at YCF rather than lack of interest.
3.09     One major problem was the lack of YCF management support for
expeditious procurement and for the consultant firm ENADIMSA.  Project
implementation was frequently jeopardized by a lacK of local funds to pay
customs charges on the drilling equipment/spares parts. The problem was so
severe that rather than delay the project by a whole season, the drilling
contractor advanced in excess of US$100,00 equivalent to YCF. YCF were
unable to secure the funds to reimburse the contractor for more than a
year. While the Ministry of the Economy frequently expressed their support
for the project, they were apparently unable to assure the allocation of
local funds. The failure of the government to make timing contribuLions
caused a major delay in implementation.
Procurement
3.10     Procurement was also a major concern.  Bureaucratic procedures
within YCF slowed the evaluation of drilling proposals and the procurement
of vehicles needed to support the project. There were also difficulties in
obtaining import permits for goods purchased overseas. 'Compre Argentina",
legislation regulating the import of goods into the country, caused delays
of up to four months in the release of equipment from customs. One of
these delays was so critical that a whole summer's drilling season was lost
thus delaying the project by one year.
3.11     The project was originally de, gned to provide for approximately
600 km of high resolution seismic to better define the voal reserves. In
accordance with Bank procedures, YCF requested bids under ICB guidelines.
Unfortunately YCF requested one of the bidders to modify their proposal
following ieview of bids and then recommended that the contract be awarded
to this bidder even though originally they had not been the lowest



evaluated bidder. It was pointed out to YCF that such procedures were
unacceptable to the Bank and that either negotiations should comence with
the low bidder or the contract should be re-bid. YCF did not accept this
recommendation and awarded the contract to the company who had modified
their proposal; YCF was therefore informed that Bank funds were not
available to support this contract. YCF has never submitted the results of
the seismic program, apparently no longer considering it part of the
project.
Disbursement
3.12     Disbursements were made against 1002 of foreign goods and
ex-factory costs of locally manufactured goods, 1002 of foreign
expenditures for the drilling contract, and 1002 of foreign expenditures
for the consultant's services. Over all disbursements were much slower
than had originally been planned due to delays in signing, effectiveness,
and implementation. About 59Z of the total loan had been disbursed by the
time of the original closing date (i.e., the end of FY85). The remainder
of the loan disbursed rapidly during the extension period. Bank processed
withdrawal applications until October of 1987 to allow for disbursements of
lending applications, that had not been finalized by the closing date of
February 28, 1987. By the end of 1987, the total loan amount of US$10.0
million had been disbursed (see Annex 2).
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.13     The expatriot consultants handled supervision of the exploration
program, preliminary mine feasibility work and training of YCF staff. The
geological training provided by the consultants was of a high standard and
has formed a basis that will enable YCF to carry out exploration meeting
international standards without technical assistance. Economic analyses
performed by the consultants, however, indicated they were much better
qualified in geology than in financial evaluation, and they may have
encouraged YCF to plan on more optimistic projections than can
realistically be justified. However, in general the assistance provided by
,he consultants in a difficult YCF management situation was of a high
standard and reflected dedication to the project.
3.14     The contractors who operated the drilling rigs provided excellent
service, which exceeded expectations when not hampered by the failures of
the YCF management. In order to continue the project implementation with a
minimum of delay, the contractors went so far as to advance local funds to
YCF and to procure foreign spare parts from their own account knowing it
would be many months before payment could be received.
Bank Performance
3.15     The project was the Bank's first loan to coal operations in
Argentina. Bank's relationship with YCF was satisfactory throughout the
implementation period. Bank staff undertook eight supervision missions
between February 1981 and December 1986. The interval between missions
depended on the need for the Bank staff to be on hand for specific project
review and approval requirements principally connected with the exploration



- 10 -
strategy and the seisLiic and drilling program. Bank staff worked closely
with YCF, and showed flexibility by extending the project when conditions
warranted. YCF war receptive, especially regarding the process of
selecting consultants. Bank closely monitored procurement contract'ng to
decrease delays in implementation, especially to compensate from the lack
of experience of YCF in procurement services. The Bank insisted on
adherence to the Project Agreement especially in regard to the presentation
of audit project accounts (para. 3.17).
Proiect Cost and Financing
3.16     The total cost of the project was estimated at US$20.0 million of
which US$10.0 million represented foreign exchange components to be covered
by the Bank loan. The cost estimate for equipment and drilling contracts
(US$7.2 million) was based on similar works in South America adjusted for
local conditions (see Annex 3). The estimated project cost included US$5.8
million in contingencies, of which physical contingencies were estimated at
US$0.9 million, 6.31 of base project costs. About 70Z of the US$10.0
million of local financing required was to be financed by YCF and the
balance of 30Z by the government out of the National Energy Fund.
3.17     Actual costs of the project were generally in line with appraisal
estimates and minor changes reflect the flexibility inherent in an
exploration program. A total cost distribution and comparison with initial
cost estimates are shown in Annex 3. The final cost estimates are,
however, only a rough approximation, based on disbursement records;
detailed expenditures per component were not available this report was
prepared.
Compliance with Project Agreement
3.18     YCF failed to comply with two explicit requirements of the Project
Agreement--the provision of audited project accounts and the preparation of
a project completion report. Between December 1Q86 and December 1987 seven
telexes were sent to YCF requesting audited project accouits. This
requirement was not only a condition of the Project Agreement but also had
been acknowledged at the working level by YCF in the aide memoire left by
the Bank mission of December 9-12, 1986. In that same aide memoire, YCF
undertook to prepare a project completion report by November 1987 and
despite subsequent requests failed to do so. These omissions by YCF
reflect an institutional failure to fulfill the requirements of the project
and a failure by the Ministry of the Economy to put pressure on YCF. It
should be noted that the consultants compiled extensive documentatio-. on
the project which was transmitted to the Bank. A review of this data
indicates that in all probability there was no mismanagement of Bank funds.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
4.01     The evaluation of coal resources improved and strengthened the
sector knowledge. The project provided the starting point for dialogue
with the Secretariat of Energy on coal as a supplement to other energy
sources. The project resulted in a more accurate assessment of the coal
resources of the Austral Basin of southern Argentina while providing
equipment and training to strengthen YCF. Extensive coal reserves at the
Rio Turbio mine were proven to be technically recover4ble. From a
technical point of view, the project was successful. Financial and
technical analyses of the results as they related to the Rio Turbio mine
were over optimistic, particularly with respect to coal prices and
encouraged YCF to pursue coal development at Rio Turbio despite the clear
signs that this course of action was not economically justifiable. (A
supervision mission in December 198b was explicit with YCF on this point.)
4.02     The exploration program strengthened the technical and specialized
capabilities of the Exploration Department of YCF through technical
assistance in specific fields of expertis- not available in Argentina at
the beginning of project implementation.
4.03     Project design should have included a better definition ot
categories eligible for Bank financing, so that the misprocurement of
seismic services would have resulted in cancellation of funds rather than
informal reassignment to other services.
4.04     In the case of a corporation such as YCF, the implementation of a
similar project would be greatly assisted by (a) establishment a special
account for foreign exchange and a revolving fund in local currency; (b)
granting the project manager authority to make significant decisions
without time consuming review by YCF man.agement committees; and (c)
exempting the project from the 'Compre Argentina" legislation. If these
arrangements had been set up for this project, it is probable that the it
would have been completed on time.
4.05     In a large organization sucn as YCF, the responsibility and
authority of the team leader in charge of the project have to be clearly
defined if the project is to be fully supported. Such support could
prevent delays due to lack of allocations for both foreign and local
components, and bureaucratic inertia in bid evaluations and removal of
import restrictions.
