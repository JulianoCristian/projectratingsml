      Note: This ICR covers the APL-1 phase of a 3-stage APL. While it has been finalized after the board's
      approval of the follow-on (APL-2) operation, a number of very detailed assessment reports on the
      achievements of APL-1 were prepared by specialized consultants as part of APL-2 preparation. These
      included:

           · "The Institutional Evaluation of the Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation project
               (PRAGUAS I)" ("Evaluación Institucional del Programa de Agua y Saneamiento para
               Comunidades Rurales y Pequeños Municipios (PRAGUAS))", Gustavo Guerra García-Picasso,

6.       Project Context, Development Objectives and Design (this section is descriptive,
taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative):

6.1      Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance):

 Sector Background

 At the time of appraisal, the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector in Ecuador had had a
 long history of poor performance well below the standards of other Latin American countries.
 The main problems included: weak institutions and institutional overlap at all levels and a lack
 of consistent sector policies. This resulted in low WSS coverage rates and investments that were
 neither sustainable, nor able to keep up with growing demand.

 The key sector issues identified at appraisal were considered so deeply entrenched that the
 PRAGUAS program was purposely designed as a 10-year, 3-stage APL emphasizing moderate
 policy reform and limited institution building during phase 1 as shown in the following table
 (included in section B4 of the PAD):

                      Phase 1                   Phase 2                 Phase 3
  Policy Reform       Moderate                  Moderate                Moderate
  Institution         Basic coverage (40        Moderate coverage       High coverage (about
  Building            municipalities)           (about 100              150 municipalities
                                                municipalities          nationwide)
                                                nationwide)
  Investment          Moderate (rural areas     High (rural areas and   High (whole country,
                      and pilot projects in     towns)                  though not major
                      small towns)                                      cities)

 Specifically, the main sector issues were:

 Low coverage and quality of services. WSS service levels in Ecuador were among the lowest in
 South America. Although total coverage rates reached 61% for water supply and 40% for
 sanitation (with no wastewater treatment), these numbers hid the deficit in rural areas, where
 one third of the population lived. In the 152 rural municipalities targeted by PRAGUAS

(approximately 22% of Ecuador's population), in particular, only 48% of the population had
access to adequate water supply and only 35% benefited from appropriate sanitation facilities.
In addition, coverage rates did not reflect the poor quality and intermittent nature of the
services.

Poor management of services and lack of sustainability: Services in rural areas were largely
provided through community and project initiatives, usually with no linkages to the
corresponding municipal administration. Where projects had been carried out in the past, few
had been implemented using a demand-responsive approach (DRA) whereby users (i) take the
initiative for requesting investments; (ii) make informed choices about service levels they want
and are willing to pay for; and (iii) contribute financially and in-kind to the systems they have
selected. Furthermore, in towns, there was little consensus around the idea that utilities should
be commercially-oriented and autonomous agencies. Apart from 16 water utilities in medium-
size and large cities, services in municipal capitals were typically provided directly by the city
government with no managerial or financial autonomy. This situation often triggered a
downward spiral in which insufficient cost recovery led to financial problems which in turn led
to poor service and even less cost recovery. Management and operations in these utilities and
municipalities was inefficient. Few were recovering even their operating costs. Billing was
deficient. Meters, where installed, were often not read, and water losses were very high.

Lack of coherent policies. There was no consistent financial policy for the sector in Ecuador.
WSS service provision is the responsibility of municipal governments which ­ with city council
approval - set tariffs for local WSS services. This usually results in politically-motivated tariffs
well below actual costs and, in other cases, in no tariffs at all. Average 1999 tariffs for
residential customers were below US$0.03/m3 - less than half the cost of operation and
maintenance even when investment cost recovery was excluded. It was precisely the low-
income communities in rural areas and small towns whom low tariffs were designed to protect,
that suffered most from unsustainable financial policies, as low revenue generation slowed
service extension to unserved areas. In the absence of a financial policy for the sector,
financiers, such as the Bank of the State of Ecuador (Banco del Estado, BdE), the Social
Investment Fund (Fondo de Inversión Social Ecuatoriano FISE), and other donors often
introduced financial policies for their programs which were not coordinated and often
contradictory, thereby sending confusing signals to beneficiaries.

Unclear roles and functions of sector institutions at all levels. Ecuador is divided into 22
provinces which in turn comprise 219 municipalities. Each municipality is composed of a
municipal capital ("cabecera cantonal") and surrounding (mostly rural) areas. Municipalities
became responsible for the provision of water and sanitation services only in the 1990's, when
IEOS ­ the national government agency that had built, operated and maintained potable water
systems nationally since 1965 ­ was abolished. Central functions in the WSS sector such as
policy setting, planning, defining norms, providing training and technical assistance and
gathering and reporting sector information, were poorly developed. The Sub-secretariat of
Environmental Sanitation (SSA), the successor institution to IEOS, was largely unable to play
the role of sector leader envisaged at its creation. There was overlap of functions among sector
institutions. While municipal governments were supposed to play a more significant role in
overseeing service provision, their work was limited, in most cases, to direct provision of WSS



                                             4

       services in the urban capital, with little oversight of activities in rural areas.

       Country Background

       At the country level, at the time of appraisal, Ecuador faced high inflation and a rapid
       devaluation of the currency (the Sucre) which led to introduction of the US Dollar as the
       country's national currency soon afterwards (the Dollar was introduced at 1 US$ = 25,000
       Sucres). In addition, even in 2000, Ecuador had lived through a period of significant political
       volatility with 5 presidents between 1995 and 2000. This placed a high premium on staying
       engaged through many ministerial transitions to maintain a continuity of sector dialogue.

       Rationale for Bank assistance. The project supported the objectives of poverty alleviation,
       reduction of government subsidies and increased productivity of infrastructure services as set
       out in the CAS4 (June 1, 1993) and the CAS progress reports discussed by the Board on March
       25, 1997 and June 22, 2000. The project was also consistent with the sector policy note
       discussed with the Government of Ecuador in September 1998, which reinforced the CAS
       objectives. The Bank worked with other donors to support sector reforms and ensure
       complementarity in lending and technical assistance.

       The project focused on poverty alleviation and was in line with the findings of the `Consultation
       with the Poor in Ecuador' study, which identified the lack of drinking water as one of the key
       deficiencies that characterize poverty. The project also supported Ecuador's efforts to
       modernize and strengthen the WSS sector as it supported sector reform at the national level, by
       reshaping sector policies, strengthening institutional reform and promoting capacity building in
       sector agencies. More specifically, the financial support and technical assistance that was to be
       provided under the project was to help set-up and jump-start sustainable WSS service operators,
       thereby reducing government transfers to operate these services.

       The Bank had already developed a strong relationship with sector agencies in Ecuador based
       primarily on the experience of the FASBASE pilot project. In addition, the United Nations
       Development Program (UNDP)-World Bank Water and Sanitation Program had been working
       with the Government to translate the lessons of the pilot project into national policy, and linking
       the experiences in Ecuador to those of neighboring countries. In PRAGUAS, the specific value
       added by Bank assistance involved helping establish national policies for the urban and rural
       WSS sector and to support the development of a long-term national WSS program for rural
       areas. The Bank envisioned assisting the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing
       (MIDUVI) in establishing a leadership role in the sector and in coordinating the investment
       provided by other intermediaries (i.e. Ecuadorian Social Investment Fund (FISE) and Bank of
       the State of Ecuador (BdE), as well as other donors (i.e. Inter-American Development Bank
       (IADB), UNDP, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and bilateral aid agencies). Finally,
       the Bank was well positioned to link the sector reform process to the overall Government of
       Ecuador (GOE) agenda of state modernization and decentralization which the Bank supported
       with a series of adjustment operations, several sector investment loans (SILs) in various sectors
       and analytical work (such as a Public Expenditure Review, PER, prepared in 2003/2004).

       6.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) [as approved]:

        The development objective for phase 1 of the APL program ("the project") was the execution of
        investments for increased WSS service coverage and quality for about 350,0005 rural and small
        town beneficiaries in about 40 rural municipalities as well as in about 6 municipal capitals. In
        addition, the PDO included the improvement of sector performance through the application of
        coherent policies, and the strengthening of sector institutions at the central and local levels.

       6.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), and reasons/justification:

        The objective was not revised.

       6.4     Main Beneficiaries, original and revised (briefly describe the "the primary target group"
       identified in the PAD and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and
       organizations expected to benefit from the project):

        The project was expected to benefit the rural population living in municipalities with district
        capitals of less than 10,000, including the residents of both rural communities and small towns.
        Although only 22% of the country's population lived in these 152 municipalities, they
        represented about one third of Ecuador's service coverage deficit with respect to both water and
        sanitation. Only 48% of the urban and rural population of these small municipalities had access
        to adequate water supply and only 35% benefited from appropriate sanitation facilities. These
        communities depended largely on agriculture or small scale commerce for subsistence. The
        project aimed to reach these communities by targeting municipalities that had low service
        coverage rates, high poverty indicators and a high community demand for improved services.

       6.5     Original Components (as approved):

        The project consisted of four components:

        Component 1. Sector reform and institutional development (Project Cost: US$4.50 million)

        This component addressed the needs of the entire sector, both urban and rural (except for the
        three major cities). It included two sub-components:

        lA. Restructuring of SSA and Policy Reform: Assistance to SSA to assume its new role in the
        sector, including: (i) major restructuring in support of decentralization; and (ii) creation of a
        new unit in charge of providing assistance to municipal governments for service planning and
        delegated management.

        lB. Strengthening of Municipal Governments, NGOs and Private WSS Operators: Design and
        implementation of models for WSS service provision through autonomous operators in all
        interested municipalities in Ecuador. Municipal governments would also be strengthened to
        oversee sector activities in their jurisdiction. Small municipalities that chose to delegate service

5The number of water vs. sanitation beneficiaries was not differentiated due to the demand-responsive design of the project
cycle.


                                                             6

provision would become eligible for WSS investments in their urban capital under Component
3.

Assistance was to be provided to help the private sector (PS) and NGOs at the municipal level
organize small multi-disciplinary companies to provide community development and
engineering services as well as to construct systems in rural communities, using demand-based
approaches and participatory development strategies. Potential service operators were also to be
identified and encouraged to form operating companies in small towns.

Component 2. Water and Sanitation Subprojects in Rural Areas. (Project Cost: US$39.00
million)

This component comprised two sub-components:

2A. Promotion, Community Development, Engineering Designs and Supervision. PRAGUAS
was to be promoted in eligible municipalities and communities to stimulate interest in
participating in the project. Preinvestment activities were to include: community organization
and formation of juntas, selection of preferred service level, completion of engineering designs,
initial community training in contract administration, construction and hygiene education, and
selection of management models for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) services.

2B. Water and Sanitation Infrastructure, Community Training and Hygiene Education. Rural
water supply systems were to include a range of technical and service level options, from
simple hand pumps and rainwater catchments to small piped systems. Rural sanitation options
were to focus on on-site systems ranging from improved traditional latrines to ventilated
improved pit (VIP) latrines, aqua privies and "basic sanitation units" (UBS - Basic sanitation
unit comprising shower, sink and toilet).

Component 3. Water and Sanitation Subprojects in Municipal Capitals (Project Cost:
US$3.00 million)

This component comprised two sub-components:

3A. Engineering Studies and Supervision. Municipal capitals (with populations below 10,000
people) that took steps to transfer the operation of municipal water and sanitation services to
autonomous public or private operators were to become eligible for PRAGUAS funding for
studies aimed at rehabilitating municipal WSS infrastructure.

3B. Civil Works. PRAGUAS was to finance the rehabilitation/expansion of urban WSS systems
in eligible municipal capitals up to agreed investment limits.

Component 4. Project Management (Project Cost: US$3.43 million)

This component was to finance the following:

    · Incremental operating costs for the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the Provincial



                                            7

         PRAGUAS Implementing Units (EPPs)
     · Equipment and software for the PMU (and EPPs as necessary)
     · Contractual personnel for the PMU
     · External audits
     · Maintenance of the financial management and project monitoring systems
     · Consultancies (e.g. for a Rural Sanitation Sector Environmental Assessment and
         periodic reevaluation of economic limits for water supply investments)


6.6    Revised Components:

 The components were not revised.

6.7    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

 There was no change in project design, scope and scale, implementing arrangements, and
 funding allocations during implementation. However the schedule of the project was revised
 twice. The closing date of the project was extended first by 18 months from October 31, 2004 to
 April 30, 2006 both because of a nine-month project effectiveness delay and to account for
 accumulated implementation delays. It was extended for a second time for a period of six
 months (through 31 October, 2006) in order to allow the two stages of the Adaptable Program
 Loan (APL) to overlap and the project staff to be retained. In practice, however, PRAGUAS II
 did not become effective until December, 2006, due mostly to internal review procedures in
 Ecuador after approval of the APL-2 loan (7401-EC) by the Bank's board on 25 July, 2006.

7.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

7.1 Project Preparation, Design Stage, and Quality at Entry (including whether lessons of
    earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigation identified, and
    adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable):

 During preparation, project design took into account lessons learned from previous Bank-
 assisted projects in the WSS sector in Ecuador and other countries. Likewise, the design
 considered risk factors and appropriate measures were adopted to mitigate all major risks
 identified at appraisal. The project also provided a participatory framework involving
 stakeholders and direct beneficiaries in the decision-making processes.

     A. Lessons Learned.

 Lessons from projects in Ecuador.

     · The Pilot Rural WSS component of the FASBASE project demonstrated that poor, rural
         communities are willing to organize and able to pay more than 50% of service
         improvements, as well as take charge of sustaining their services. However, FASBASE's
         implementation procedures (through the Ministry of Health) also proved to be slow and


                                              8

        bureaucratic.

    · The implementation results of FISE showed the major limitations and poor
        sustainability that resulted from the lack of a community development and training
        component.

    · Rural WSS projects constructed with a high degree of community participation using
        Implementation Assistance Agencies (IAA), under the USAID-funded WASH programs
        (1980-1992), as well as experience from major NGOs, such as CARE and Plan
        International had shown the capacity of well-trained Juntas (water user associations) to
        achieve good operation and management records, albeit with limitations in terms of
        performing major repairs.

Lessons from the work of the RWSS Thematic Group, UNDP-WB Water and Sanitation
Program etc.

    · Adopt a demand responsive approach where users determine if they want to
        participate and select their preferred level of service based on willingness to pay and to
        assume long-term responsibility for service management.

    · Promote institutional reform based on clear roles for key stakeholders where
        communities own their facilities, the private sector provides goods, services, and
        operational support, and the government facilitates the process. Clearly define the role
        of local government, service providers and Water Users' Associations (WUAs). Include
        clearly defined capacity building components that enable all stakeholders to play their
        roles and build partnerships.

    · Ensure an appropriate legal framework for ownership and management and clearly
        allocate responsibilities between national and local government and WUAs.

    · Support the formation of Juntas for planning, implementation, and management of
        community water supply facilities.

    · Establish sound financial policies that lead to sustained services.

    · Integrate water, sanitation and hygiene education.

    · Ensure representative and informed participation of all stakeholders, including women
        and traditionally excluded groups.

    · For small towns, separate the regulatory, managerial and operational functions. Promote
        the adoption of sustainable public, private or cooperative management models.

The project design also benefited from the lessons learned during a program pilot phase
initiated in March, 1999 in 30 rural communities spread out over four municipalities in four
provinces across Ecuador. The pilot phase drew attention to two deficiencies in the pre-


                                             9

investment phase of the project cycle, namely that the OITS (Technical and Social Intermediary
Organizations): (i) presented project communities with limited (or no) options with respect to
service levels and (ii) did very little financial analysis as to the Operation & Maintenance
(O&M) costs per household that different technical solutions would entail. In response to these
weaknesses, simple tariff calculations and additional background on the spectrum of service
options available were added to the manuals that OITS would receive before they were sent to
the field for the next pre-investment phase.

    B. Risks and their mitigation.

The design correctly identified all major risks that the project actually faced during
implementation, except for the unexpectedly high political volatility (and turnover of ministers
and sub-secretaries of water, sanitation and solid waste) that Ecuador experienced between
2001 and 2006. A strong project implementation unit staffed with highly skilled professionals
competitively recruited and hired under multi-year contracts proved to be the key mitigating
measure for this situation.

The project faced the following high risk and the measures mentioned below were taken to
mitigate it:

    · Municipalities and communities fail to mobilize counterpart funding.

Mitigating Measures: Only those rural subprojects for which municipalities and communities
had mobilized their cash contribution upfront were to be tendered. In addition, first-time
municipalities were to be allowed to propose only a small number of their rural communities for
PRAGUAS financing until their ability to mobilize municipal counterpart funds was clearly
established.

The substantial risks faced by the project and the measures taken to mitigate them included the
following:

    · Sector policies, especially financial, not supported by major WSS sector stakeholders.

Mitigating Measure: The GOE presented a detailed policy letter setting out the government's
WSS strategy. A broad stakeholder dialogue was to be conducted during the project to support
the preparation of a new Water & Sanitation Sector Law. PRAGUAS was also to be rolled out
to Ecuador's provinces in a way that would minimize interference with Ecuadorian agencies and
outside donors still using financing policies inconsistent with SSA's new strategy.

    · Municipalities do not accept new role in sector, fail to apply cost recovery policies, and
        intervene in the day-to-day operations of service provision

Mitigating Measure: The project would only work in municipalities committed to reform.

    · Municipalities fail to provide PS and NGOs with long term incentives to support
        community managed services in rural areas



                                              10

Mitigating Measure: The project would only work in municipalities committed to reform.

   · Juntas/Small town operators are unable to properly administer water systems

Mitigating Measure: Management training programs would be given with follow-up support
from municipalities.

   · Community members do not improve hygiene behavior or make effective use of water
       and sanitation services

Mitigating Measure: High priority would be given to community development, hygiene
education and sanitation promotion, before, during, and after construction.

   · Municipal and community subprojects not prioritized based on demand, with risks of
       political interference and project "capture" by municipal authorities

Mitigating Measure: Cost-sharing and eligibility rules would be enforced, and rejected
communities would be informed of the reason(s).

   · Slow fund approval and disbursement to municipal government

Mitigating Measure: Adequate project procedures would be designed.

In addition, the risks deemed moderate were also taken into account and appropriate measures
to mitigate them were incorporated into the project design.

   C. Adequacy of participatory processes.

The backbone of the project was a participatory approach which incorporated stakeholders and
direct beneficiaries in the decision-making processes throughout the project period.

The selection of beneficiary populations at the municipal and community levels was a
systematic tripartite participatory process involving EPP's, Municipal Sanitation Unit (EMS)/
municipalities and communities. Selection criteria at each level were agreed and tested. Open
fora and consultations based on informed decisions were the norm in the promotion, pre-
investment, and investment phases. Overall, as part of the subproject cycle for rural
investments, communities spent 6 months receiving organizational assistance to form juntas as
well as training and support in selecting their preferred system designs before construction
actually began.

The OITS was a key player in the project, as it accompanied the community through the project
cycle to provide it with the knowledge it needed to make informed decisions about applying for
project support, technical options and service levels available, financial options and
requirements. Juntas in charge of administration and management of the projects as well as the
communities themselves were scheduled to receive appropriate training in local languages and



                                            11

by means of culturally appropriate materials.

Several civil society organizations working on water & sanitation, health and education were
invited to form a Consultative Group and to participate in project preparation. Two 4-day
workshops were held by this Group to discuss the cultural and financial appropriateness of the
project. 22 agencies, public and private (including NGOs), participated in the workshops. The
main topics of discussion were the use of appropriate multi-cultural and multi-lingual
mechanisms to be included in project design to deal with minority groups and isolated rural
communities.

7.2 Implementation Stage (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project
    at Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable):

The project was not restructured and it was never at risk. The Bank conducted a Midterm
Review (MTR) in December 2003, and assessed progress to date on all project components, the
implementation issues and the actions to be taken to ensure the successful completion of the
project. The MTR confirmed the continuing relevance of the project design and recommended
measures to speed-up implementation under components 2 and 3 (rural water supply/sanitation
and service delegation respectively) which represented the bulk of overall disbursements under
PRAGUAS I. At the time of the MTR, slightly less than US$10 million (of the US$32 million
loan amount) had been disbursed. The MTR also flagged delays in the restructuring of the
SAPSyRS, a process that was never satisfactorily completed despite intense supervision efforts.

During the project period, the following factors affected implementation:

(i) Political instability which prevailed in the country during the life of loan 7035-EC created a
difficult environment for implementation. For example, during six years of the project, Ecuador
had four presidents, the Minister of Urban Development and Housing changed eight times, and
the Subsecretary of the Subsecretariat for Water Supply, Sanitation and Solid Waste
(SAPSyRS) also changed eight times. By contrast, the PMU retained qualified technical staff
under long-term contracts throughout the implementation period. Though PRAGUAS I saw
three general coordinators between 2001 and 2006, transitions were generally smooth and
almost all disbursements occurred during the tenure of one coordinator (between 2003 and
2006).

(ii) The progress of implementation was very slow in the early stages of the project because of
various phases involved in the project cycle. The first phase consisted of marketing the
innovative concepts of the project, and convincing community members, mayors, and local
government authorities to accept these concepts. The second phase included negotiating with
the municipalities to agree on the financial policy. The other phases consisted of: (a)
communities accepting the required cash contribution and cost-recovery tariff; (b) hiring
consultants and contractors to design and execute works; and (c) contracting civil works. All
these phases were time consuming and led to a significant disbursement lag before the project
reached full implementation speed.

(iii) Executing PRAGUAS through the Department of Financial Resource Management of



                                              12

MIDUVI introduced delays, which were mainly due to:

    · a lack of timely access to resources of the Special Account; and
    · an average delay of about three months in the initiation of budget execution at the
        beginning of each fiscal year.

(iv) Disbursement was affected in 2003 by a spending cap imposed by the Ministry of Finance
(MEF), which limited the project's access to loan proceeds to US$6 million in 2003.


7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a) M&E design. Monitoring and evaluation was scheduled to be done by the Bank and
qualified consultants. In each province, the provincial project units (EPPs) and EMS would
track program communities for a period of three years after water supply and sanitation systems
had gone into operation to follow-up on the social indicators as well as the effectiveness of
financial and operational arrangements. The Bank planned to conduct at least two full and one
partial supervision missions per year. A MTR of the project was planned to be conducted in the
third Quarter of 2002.

(b) M&E implementation. During project implementation, an M&E framework was
developed to track progress in implementation and measure outcomes and impacts. This
framework consisted of three information systems:

    · The Management Information System (SIG) designed to track contracts and financial
        flows associated with the PRAGUAS project as well as other indicators that track the
        performance in project implementation;
    · The Social Impact Information System (SINSOC) designed to capture the baseline
        surveys that were undertaken in communities where PRAGUAS intervened;
    · The Integrated Water, Sanitation, Sewerage and Solid Waste Monitoring System
        (SISASAR) designed to capture the operational and financial performance of water
        service providers in the country.

The SIG and SINSOC systems were directly managed by the PMU. The SISASAR system was
designed as a comprehensive sector information system that would benchmark performance of
municipal water companies, whether or not they participated in the project. It was managed by
SAPSyRS in MIDUVI.

There were, however, a number of issues with the management information systems, which
made it difficult to use them and kept them from functioning as an effective management tool.
These issues pertained to:

         Fragmentation of the systems. The three systems were built on different platforms.
         The data in the SINSOC and SIG systems were spread over 13 different databases. The
         systems were not linked to one another, meaning that data analysis was cumbersome.




                                           13

         Insufficient data cleaning mechanisms. The systems had limited ability to
         automatically check the data input. As there were few staff assigned to the
         management of the three systems, validation of the data was a long and arduous
         process.

         Insufficient reporting mechanisms. Reporting from the databases was cumbersome,
         partly due to the fragmentation of the systems, but also due to other issues:

               · Standard reports, with specific themes, did not allow for correlating data
                   between different variables. The baseline surveys collected data on health
                   indicators but they could not be linked to service levels;

               · The way the data were aggregated at the municipal/cantonal, provincial and
                   national levels was based on averages without adjustments for population size.

         Lack of incentives to use the information systems. Collecting data into the systems was
         an issue, especially for SIG and SISASAR. In the case of SINSOC, the responsibility
         for entering the data was with the consultants conducting the baseline surveys (OITS).

(c) M&E utilization. Because of the above-mentioned issues, appropriate data was not
evaluated and used to inform decision-making and resource allocation. In practice, contract
data, for example, was managed in parallel to the official information systems using EXCEL
spread sheets.

In sum, while PRAGUAS I included arrangements for M&E that were in line with good
practice for RWSS projects as the time of appraisal, the state of the art has moved on.
Fortunately, both the borrower and the Bank agree on the need for enhanced M&E
arrangements under PRAGUAS II and have included the development of an integrated
management information system (IMIS) as part of the follow-on project.

More generally, given the Bank's increasing focus on the "results agenda", it would be very
useful if the water anchor could take the lead in developing a wider set of standard indicators
for the RWSS sector (used for individual projects as they apply) as well as guidelines for M&E
systems (to be adapted to each project's needs), so that individual project teams wouldn't need
to re-invent the wheel in every operation.

7.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as
    applicable):

There were no significant deviations or waivers from Bank safeguards, fiduciary policies and
procedures during the implementation of the project.




                                            14

7.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-completion
    operation of investments financed by present operation, operation and maintenance
    arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up
    operation, if applicable):

(a) Transition arrangements. The follow-on project, PRAGUAS II, will support post-completion
operation.

Implementation arrangements. The main implementing agency for PRAGUAS II will be
MIDUVI through the SAPSyRS. The PMU established under MIDUVI for PRAGUAS I will be
re-designed and strengthened with additional specialists and will continue to be responsible for
day-to-day project implementation and coordination. In PRAGUAS II, SAPSyRS staff will be
responsible for the implementation of two components, and will report directly to the PMU
Coordinator. In subsequent phases it is expected that more responsibility will be given to
SAPSyRS staff.

PRAGUAS II would provide long term technical assistance, training and operational and
management services to existing Juntas through the creation of Associations of Juntas at the
provincial level to promote sustainability. Currently there are several thousand juntas in Ecuador
and it has become virtually impossible for MIDUVI/SAPSyRS to provide post-construction
assistance to them on an individual basis. While municipalities are being strengthened to provide
post-construction TA to Juntas in areas under their jurisdiction through EMS, an ex-post
evaluation of systems constructed for 41 communities under PRAGUAS I suggests that
additional support to Juntas is critical to long-term system sustainability. PRAGUAS II will
finance basic equipment (e.g. vehicles, computers and printers), parts (pumps, macro and micro-
meters, valves, chlorination equipment etc.) and supplies (such as sodium hypo-chloride), that
each association will sell or lease to its associates at the discounted cost that the association can
obtain by buying in bulk under a revolving fund. Furthermore, to monitor WUA performance, a
four-level junta classification system (A = best, to D=weakest) has been developed and specific
targets have been adopted for PRAGUAS II to ensure that at least 70% of all WUA reach
category A or B status after systems have gone into operation.

Monitoring and evaluation. The SIG and SINSOC systems will be upgraded and integrated
under PRAGUAS II into an Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) to ensure better
monitoring of inputs, outputs and outcomes. Tracking key operational and process monitoring
indicators will be primarily based on inputs, outputs and intermediate outcomes recorded in the
IMIS and through participatory rapid appraisals (PRA), focus group discussions and sample
consumer satisfaction surveys of beneficiaries through the Juntas and EPAS to ensure direct
feedback from beneficiaries during project implementation.

This type of M&E will be supplemented by an impact evaluation to be carried out for a sample
of project and control communities. The impact evaluation will be based on baseline surveys that
were developed under PRAGUAS I as well as ex-post surveys to be carried out at different
points in time during program implementation (mid-term PRAGUAS II review, final PRAGUAS
II review and final PRAGUAS III review).




                                              15

Management of the M&E system will be carried out by the PMU (for the SIG and SINSOC
systems) and by SAPSyRS (for the SISASAR system). These teams will be responsible for
upgrading the systems, daily oversight, operation and maintenance of the databases and the
generation of periodic reports that provide information on the effectiveness of project
implementation and the progress in improving water sector performance for specific service
providers. Periodic monitoring and the development of various feedback mechanisms (rapid
assessments, consumer satisfaction surveys and participatory focus group discussions) will allow
the project to improve implementation.

(b) Sustainability. From the outset, the sustainability of the water, sanitation and solid waste
facilities created under the project has been supported by a comprehensive and integrated
strategy that addresses the key institutional, financial, social, environmental and technical
building blocks required for the provision of sustainable water as well as sanitation services.
Specific supporting elements include:

A. Community Willingness and Capacity to Manage and Sustain Rural Water Supply Services:
In rural areas this has been achieved by requiring communities to demonstrate their commitment
to service improvement upfront, including taking initiative, selecting their preferred service level
and management option, making a cash contribution (no less than 10% of overall investment
costs), agreeing to an adequate tariff, and assuming organizational responsibilities (forming a
Junta) before funding is approved. Overall, beneficiaries have successfully financed 30% of their
water supply investments in cash and through community labor.

B. Rural Demand, Willingness and Capacity to Manage Household On-site Sanitation: Key
indicators for the sustainability of household level sanitation service are that on-site sanitation
infrastructure (VIP latrines, pour flush latrines with septic systems, etc.) is built, properly used
by all family members and maintained.

C. Municipal Government Support to Community Management of Rural Water Systems:
Municipal governments, too, have demonstrated their ownership by funding 20% of overall
investment costs before rural water sub-projects under their jurisdiction were completed.
Municipal governments have been strengthened to provide the required technical backstopping
to Juntas and small companies, without taking over direct operational responsibilities.

(c) Lessons incorporated in PRAGUAS II.

PRAGUAS II, the second operation in this three-part APL, has leveraged the relationship built
with 142 municipalities for rural investments and 32 municipalities for the development of new
management models for urban WSS services by expanding into another municipal service (solid
waste management) and incorporating several new sub-components and activities to deepen the
impact and consolidate the gains in rural and urban WSS investments. First, a nationwide hand
washing initiative has been added (in cooperation with several public and private sector actors)
to maximize the benefits from new WSS infrastructure. Second, a new sub-component has been
added to create and strengthen regional associations of WUA to provide ex-post O&M support
for rural systems. And third, a strategic communications campaign has been added to ensure that
key messages on service delegation in cantonal capitals directed at the general population,



                                             16

municipal councils and other stakeholders are properly designed, targeted and disseminated.

Beyond these additions to project scope, given the importance of sound financial policy to
sustainable RWSS development, PRAGUAS II has been designed to involve MEF more
explicitly in sector policy development.

Finally, based on the lessons learned from PRAGUAS I, PRAGUAS II has adapted the design of
the project's core rural and urban WSS components as follows:

In Rural Areas:

    · Procurement has been simplified. Under PRAGUAS I, the multiple procurement
       processes entrusted to small municipalities (selection of consultants for designs and
       supervision and hiring of construction contractors) introduced significant implementation
       delays. Under PRAGUAS II, designs, supervision and community development/training
       services will be contracted at a national level through large engineering design and
       supervision firms (Consultorias de Diseño y Fiscalización, CDF) and NGO's/social
       consulting firms (Consultorías de Intervención Social, CIS) who will respond to requests
       for support from participating municipalities through work orders from the PMU. This
       modification will limit procurement carried out by municipalities for the rural component
       to goods and works. Since Ecuadorian municipalities tend to have greater experience
       contracting works than hiring consulting services, this change should allow the
       subproject cycle for rural investments to be streamlined while municipal procurement of
       investments (considered key to generating local ownership) is maintained.

    · Steps have been taken to improve "on the job" training of water boards and community
       members. In addition, specifications will be tightened for several system components
       (sedimentation tanks and filters) that have often been under-dimensioned (apparently to
       cut costs) and others (valves, household water meters and accessories) whose quality has
       been inconsistent. Also requirements will be tightened for the protection of spring
       catchments to ensure the long-term viability of water sources. A "community supervisor"
       ("veedor social") will be included to strengthen community oversight of construction
       contractors.

    · PRAGUAS II's M&E systems will be improved, with user-friendly information systems
       that allow the utilization of the baseline and diagnostic data for monitoring of the social
       plan by consultants, the municipality, water board and community.

    · Capacity-building activities will be adopted to strengthen emphasis on the promotion of
       healthy hygiene habits and the appropriate use of sanitary facilities. Inadequate
       maintenance of sanitary facilities, owing to insufficient hygiene knowledge, had been a
       problem encountered in PRAGUAS I beneficiary communities.

In Municipal Capitals:

The financial incentive framework for delegation of cantonal WSS services will be strengthened



                                            17

         in order to achieve more autonomous service models. Successful WSS operators (from other
         Latin American countries or internationally) will be contracted under PRAGUAS II to provide
         delegation assistance to larger municipalities and Technical Assistance (TA) to new operators. In
         addition, the delegation incentive matrix has been revised to provide stronger financial
         incentives for more radical departures from direct WSS service provision by municipalities.

         (d) List of performance indicators. An extensive and innovative set of M&E indicators have
         been developed for PRAGUAS II. Project outcome indicators for the follow-on operation are
         shown below6.

             · The total number of additional people with sustainable access to:
                               (a) water supply services in rural areas
                               (b) improved sanitation in rural areas
                               (c) improved water supply services in cantonal capitals
                               (d) improved sanitation in cantonal capitals
                               (e) improved solid waste services in cantonal capitals
             · Percentage increase in the rates of target population groups washing their hands with
                  soap at key times;
             · 100% of Special Consumption Tax (Impuesto sobre Consumos Especiales -ICE)
                  resources assigned by MEF for WSS investments will be distributed according to the
                  agreed formula.

         (e) Priority and optimum timing of any future impact evaluation.

         In addition to the continuous project monitoring to be carried out under PRAGUAS II, this
         follow-on operation includes a rigorous impact evaluation that will be designed to assess project
         impacts on beneficiary households and communities over time. A specially designed baseline
         survey will be carried out for a sample of households in the selected project communities. In
         addition, the sample household survey will also be conducted for a sample of control
         communities similar in characteristics to the project communities. Follow-up surveys will be
         carried out for households in a sample of project and control communities at the mid-term
         review of PRAGUAS II. At the end of PRAGUAS II ­ after four years of implementation of the
         follow-on project ­ a second survey will be carried out. Finally, an end-of-program impact
         evaluation has been proposed after completion of PRAGUAS III, the final project in the 3-part
         APL program.


        8. Outcomes

        8.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
            priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):




6Project Appraisal Document (PAD) for the "Second Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project"
(PRAGUAS II), June 23, 2006, (Report No. 36579-EC), Annex 3: Results Framework and Monitoring.


                                                        18

The objectives were and are clear and remain important to the country's social and economic
development. They were also timely and appropriate to the needs of Ecuador. The project was
the first phase of a program, designed as an APL, aimed to allow for better integration of sector
improvements with other more broadly defined state modernization and decentralization
reforms undertaken at a national level. These were designed to improve the overall efficiency of
central government agencies, to strengthen municipal governments and to create more
sustainable models for the provision of services.

In Ecuador's rural areas, PRAGUAS envisioned increasing access to sustainable water and
sanitation infrastructure while generating temporary and permanent employment opportunities
in rural communities benefiting from water and sanitation investments. In the WSS sector, these
reforms implied new roles at all levels, and a firm commitment to increased cost recovery
through demand-based investment. The SSA was planned to be re-structured and strengthened
to assume its new regulatory, facilitation and advisory role.

Specifically, by the end of APL-1, the project proposed to:

     · serve 350,000 additional people in the rural communities of about 40 small
        municipalities with new/rehabilitated water and/or sanitation infrastructure
     · initiate policy reform and restructure/strengthen SSA
     · prepare draft sector legislation
     · test service delegation options in at least eight municipalities

The adaptive nature of PRAGUAS was expected to support a learning environment for the
application of a demand-based approach to sector investments whereby community groups and
municipal governments decide whether to participate in the project based on a clear
understanding of the rules of engagement. This included willingness by municipal governments
to delegate service provision and to require users to meet their financial obligations and assume
responsibility for sustaining and making effective use of their improved services. The
programmatic approach would allow for the gradual application of the new policies throughout
the country by providing investment incentives to municipalities that were willing to reform,
and coupling the transition with adequate institution building at all levels.

The continued relevance of the PRAGUAS program's objectives, design and implementation
arrangements is highlighted by the fact that the government has designed a follow-on operation
(the APL-2 operation PRAGUAS II) with a similar PDO, a wider scope of activities and an
expanded resource envelope.

8.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal
    linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 4):

Satisfactory. The project was successful in achieving its objectives. The following achievements
demonstrate the direct correlation between the project's outputs and their resulting outcomes.
For example, the project served as the main vehicle for sector and institutional reforms over the
past 5 years, and provided a forum for wide stakeholder participation in the discussion of a new
Water and Sanitation Sector Law. The participatory approach used by PRAGUAS I generated



                                            19

the necessary backing for this Law. The project also helped consolidate the roles of most sector
institutions, especially in MIDUVI and at the municipal level. The project financed WSS
investments in small towns and rural communities, which contributed in providing new water
supply systems and on-site sanitation solutions. In addition, improvements in the management of
services were supported by the institutional strengthening program partially funded by
PRAGUAS I.

The hands-on experience gained from the project has strengthened the capacity of SAPSyRS
staff to manage the WSS sector. In addition, the capacity of SAPSyRS has been strengthened as
its staff was enrolled in a comprehensive training program developed in conjunction with a local
university and exposed to sector reforms in a number of Latin American countries via two
regional seminars and a study tour to Colombia.


(i) Execution of investments for increased WSS service coverage and quality for about
350,000 people in rural areas.

Coverage. The project has exceeded its coverage target. It has provided new or rehabilitated
water supply systems for about 273,830 beneficiaries and on-site sanitation solutions for
143,320 beneficiaries, with a total number of 417,150 beneficiaries, compared to the project's
target of 350,000 total beneficiaries. About 40% of all beneficiaries were served by rehabilitated
systems.

Moreover, while "outcome/impact indicator" No. 5 envisaged that "210,000 people in rural
communities (would be)...trained in administration, O&M and hygiene education", in fact
PRAGUAS I conducted such social development activities in rural communities with a
combined population in excess of 660,000 inhabitants.

(ii) Improvement of sector performance through the application of coherent policies.

The PRAGUAS I project supported three primary activities that are considered key to improving
the coherence of sector policies and building the basis for improved sector performance.

WSS Sector Financial Policy

(a) Executive Decree. In order to improve Ecuador's incentive framework for WSS investments,
the GOE adopted an Executive Decree (Decreto Ejecutivo No. 2562 published on 21 February,
2005) that links about US$75 million/year in national government transfers to municipalities
under a special tax on telephone calls that is earmarked for WSS investments (ICE) to operator
performance, service model and poverty indicators. In the past, the ICE transfers for the water
sector had generally returned funds to those municipalities that had generated the phone calls. In
effect, this meant that Quito and Guayaquil (which between them account for only about a third
of the national population) received nearly three quarters of all transfers. The new assignment
mechanism came into full force in 2006. Since the ICE is the national government's single most
important source of funding for the WSS sector, the introduction of a performance-and-poverty-
based assignment formula represents a crucial step in structuring an overall incentive framework
conducive to lasting sector reform.


                                            20

The PRAGUAS I project was instrumental in preparing the basis for and designing the
Executive Decree. First, the project financed the preparation of the National Development Plan
for the Water and Basic Sanitation Sector ("Plan Nacional de Desarrollo del Sector de Agua
Potable y Saneamiento Básico", October, 2002) which estimated that nationwide, tariffs covered
only about 2/3 of system operation and maintenance costs and pinpointed the ICE as the key
government transfer program which allowed utilities and municipal sanitation departments to
close the O&M gap and finance new investment. Subsequently, the project financed the services
of a highly respected financial lawyer who determined that the existing ICE law did not mandate
which cities/utilities were to receive transfers (contrary to claims by several of those with vested
interests). The financial lawyer then proceeded to draft the executive decree, which ­ after
several modifications introduced by MEF ­ was approved by the President in February, 2005
despite fierce opposition from the Quito water utility (EMAAP).

While it is too early to assess improvements in utility performance as a result of the new
incentive scheme, the executive decree has already led to a substantial increase in the amount of
investment resources available to higher-performing utilities, among them the 28 municipalities
which adopted improved management models under PRAGUAS I. As a group, these 28
municipalities increased their ICE assignment three-fold from US$2.1 million (2003, before the
Decree) to US$6.3 million (2006) as the table below shows:

(b) Water and Sanitation Sector Law. A draft Water and Sanitation Sector Law has been
prepared and submitted to the President of Ecuador. The new government (inaugurated in
January of 2007) is expected to study the draft law and to decide on its presentation to Congress.

Again, the PRAGUAS project was key to taking a weak initial draft law (prepared by
consultants hired through the National Modernization Council (Consejo Nacional de
Modernización, CONAM), engaging the services of a top Latin American water sector legal
expert and completely re-writing it. PRAGUAS I also covered the costs of several seminars
organized by SAPSyRS in different cities nationwide to solicit input on and garner support for
the draft law.

(c) Preparation of a National Water and Sanitation Policy, which was approved by a
Presidential Decree in 2002. In addition, the project also supported and financed the preparation
of a short and medium-term Sector Plan.

The Water and Sanitation Policy was drafted by the SAPSyRS with support from technical
specialists in the PRAGUAS project unit. While vague on several sensitive issues (e.g. WSS
investment subsidies), the policy was nonetheless a first attempt by the SAPSyRS to fulfill its
role as the WSS lead normative agency.

In terms of increased cost recovery (outcome/impact indicator No. 1 specifies "sector policy for
rural areas launched, increased cost recovery achieved and policy reform initiated for other
aspects of sector"), the results from a structured sample of 32 water users associations created
under PRAGUAS I and surveyed as part of the Ex ­ post Evaluation of the First Phase of the
PRAGUAS Program are encouraging. While traditionally, many rural WUA's and small
municipal systems in Ecuador charge only a few cents per cubic meter of water delivered, about
72% of the 32 WUA's for which tariff data were available had adopted tariffs of 8 or more cents
per cubic meter while more than 46% had adopted tariffs of 12 or more cents per cubic meter.
Similar findings hold true for municipalities that delegated WSS service provision under
PRAGUAS I. The average volumetric water tariff applied by the 14 municipalities that signed
delegation incentive agreements under PRAGUAS II, went from about 3 cents per cubic meter
(pre-delegation) to about 10 cents per cubic meter.

It is worth mentioning, that as a condition of participation in PRAGUAS I, rural WUA were
required to adopt tariffs that allowed them to recover operation and maintenance expenditures as
well as the cost of replacing key system components. Frequently, these tariffs were significantly
higher than the tariffs charged by the municipal water company (or municipal water department)
in the cantonal capital, thereby creating an important demonstration effect with respect to the
population's willingness to pay for improved services.

(iii) Strengthening of sector institutions at the central and local levels.

While institutional strengthening of SAPSyRS at the national level fell short of expectations, the
scale of institutional strengthening at the municipal level far exceeded estimates at appraisal. At
appraisal, the Bank's team estimated that "40 municipal governments (would) have the capacity
to oversee service provision in their jurisdiction and at least 8 (would) have delegated service



                                            22

         provision to autonomous operators" (Outcome/Impact indicator No. 3, annex 1 (p. 36) of
         PRAGUAS I PAD). In fact, 108 municipalities were strengthened to oversee service provision
         in rural areas under their jurisdiction and 28 delegated service provision in their cantonal capital
         to autonomous operators.

         Sector Reform and Strengthening of the SAPSyRS

         Restructuring of the SAPSyRS proceeded at a slow pace over the course of the project, in part
         due to high turnover in ministerial and subsecretary ranks over the past five years. SAPSyRS'
         transition to a normative role as a standard-setter and facilitator of sector investments carried out
         by municipalities and communities is still incomplete. A new organizational structure for the
         SAPSyRS has been adopted which provides for a "Planning & Evaluation Department" and a
         "Technical Assistance Department" ("Dirección de Fomulación y Evaluación del Plan Nacional
         de Agua Potable, Saneamiento y Residuos Sólidos" and "Dirección de Fortalecimiento de los
         Servicios de Agua Potable, Saneamiento y Residuos Sólidos" respectively), each composed of
         two clusters and a total of eight working groups. Nonetheless, in practice, staff has not been
         fully mapped to the new departments, clusters and working groups and few of the units actually
         produce the products for which they were designed.

         Moreover, under the project, MIDUVI was unable to declare as redundant those staff whose
         skills no longer fit SAPSyRS' new role, or to bring in economists, business specialists, public
         health experts and other professionals needed to round out the skill mix of SAPSyRS staff.

         In terms of outcome/impact indicator No. 2 ("reorganization of SSA complete with full staffing
         structure, training and portfolio of services in place in accordance with the restructuring plan"),
         this means that the restructuring of the SAPSyRS (the name for the SSA adopted after appraisal)
         is indeed complete and existing staff have received some training7. On the other hand, it is clear
         that SAPSyRS has yet to develop the "full staffing structure" and the "portfolio of services"
         envisaged for the end of APL-1.


         Delegating WSS services to autonomous operators and oversight of rural service provision

         To address service quality, efficiency and cost recovery, PRAGUAS I provided technical
         assistance and financial incentives to municipalities interested in delegating their municipally-
         run WSS services to autonomous (public, private, cooperative etc.) operators. Out of 219
         municipalities nationwide, 28 municipalities have adopted and are operating delegated
         management models (two cooperatives, one mixed enterprise, seven municipal enterprises with a
         municipal majority in the board of directors, and 18 municipal companies with a community
         majority in the board of directors one of which has outsourced service provision to a private
         operator).

         In addition to bringing about a change of management model in 28 cantonal capitals,


7The "Centro de Investigaciones Territoriales (CITE) of the National Polytechnic School was contracted in 2005 to train
SAPSyRS staff in (i) the fomulation, evaluation and management of projects; (ii) principles of regulation, concessions and
new public and private management models; (iii) sub-national legal frameworks and (iv) management information systems.


                                                           23

PRAGUAS also strengthened (and in many cases set-up) municipal water and sanitation units
("equipos municipals de agua y saneamiento", EMS) in 108 municipalities (about half of all
municipalities nationwide). These units ­ which comprise both technical and social/community
development specialists ­ were designed to give small municipalities the human resources to
provide rural WUA with post-construction support in the operation of their systems. An ex-post
evaluation of a sample of 36 water supply and 23 sanitation systems financed by the project was
commissioned in 2005 and determined that 90% of the municipalities surveyed had indeed
institutionalized their EMS as part of the Water Supply, Sewerage, Planning and Community
Development Unit of the municipal Public Works Department and that the EMS had
significantly improved the technical capacity of the municipal teams.

It is worth mentioning that the delegation approach to water and sanitation (a combination of
technical assistance + financial incentives) applied by PRAGUAS I was so successful, that it
was expanded to municipal solid waste services under PRAGUAS II.

Beyond governmental actors (national and local), outcome/impact indicator No. 4 established
"increased capacity of the PS (private sector) and NGO's to provide goods, services and
operating support for service management at the local level, including at least 50 local
implementation organizations (OITS) trained and certified". In practice, PRAGUAS I trained
206 OITS through two large engineering/social consulting firms (CAMINOSCA y ACSAM)
during the early years of the program.

8.3 Effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and comparisons; & Financial Rate of
    Return):

A detailed economic ex-post cost-benefit analysis was conducted for a random sample of
subprojects financed under PRAGUAS I. This sample represented different types of
technological options financed and all major regions of the country (Sierra, Costa and Oriente).
The size range of the systems analyzed was between 31 and 654 connections.

The main results of the ex-post economic analysis of the sample of subprojects performed are
presented in Table 1. Of the 28 subprojects evaluated as part of the ex-post analysis of
PRAGUAS I, 64% (18 subprojects) were economically viable, with economic internal rates of
return (EIRR) ranging from 12.8% to 93.9%, presenting an average return of 31% and an
average net present value (NPV) of US$109,724. The results of the ex- post analysis compares
favorably to the average results from the ex-ante economic analysis for a sample of 19
subprojects which presented an average NPV of US$ 35,543 and an average ERR of 28% at
appraisal. The overall result of the ex-post analysis of PRAGUAS I is substantially positive for
the sample analyzed; even after compensating for the economically unviable projects the
economy has gained a net US$1,765,143 in 27 projects. Extrapolating this result to the
investments in rural water supply in the overall PRAGUAS I project (which has built
approximately 844 systems), the economic net present value of the first phase can be estimated
at US$ 60.6 million.



                                            24

While the average rate of return per sub-project and the overall economic net present value
were higher than expected at appraisal, the results of the ex-post assessment led the project team
to revise the economic assessment methodology in the Operational Manual for PRAGUAS II to
simplify its application and allow for easier screening of economically unviable sub-projects.

 The project has exceeded its targets for WSS coverage expansion in rural areas (417,000
 beneficiaries served, against 350,000 expected at appraisal) and cases of WSS delegation (28
 municipalities as compared with 8 expected at appraisal). In addition, it has made substantial
 progress towards a performance-and-poverty based sector financial policy. Were it not for its
 limited progress in restructuring the SAPSyRS and re-defining its role as the lead sector agency,
 the overall outcome would be rated "highly satisfactory". As it stands, the overall outcome is
 rated "satisfactory".

8.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or
    to amplify discussion above):

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

 Poverty-targeting. As part of the preparation of PRAGUAS II, a 1,752-household survey was
 conducted to assess the impacts of PRAGUAS I. It showed that the targeting of PRAGUAS I
 was pro-poor: 92% of the beneficiaries of the pilot program and 72% of beneficiaries of the
 regular WSS program were small rural farmers, 5.6% were artisans or worked in small industry;
 5.3% were in trade and 0.5% own micro-enterprises;

 Beneficiaries. Both mestizos and the Indigenous population benefited from PRAGUAS I: over
 70% of users in Azuay, Bolivar, El Oro, Imbabura, Loja and Manabí are mestizos, and 74% of
 users in Cotopaxi, Chimborazo and Sucumbíos are Indigenous. Both groups were equally
 served in Pastaza (Amazonia).


(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-
term capacity and institutional development):

 (i) Financial incentives to municipalities. The project promoted modern, delegated management
 models and tariff levels that cover at least operation, maintenance and replacement costs with
 adequate provisions for protecting low-income consumers. To encourage municipalities to
 delegate services to autonomous providers, PRAGUAS I strategically added a financial
 incentive to municipalities that enroll in the technical assistance component and introduce a
 delegated management model for water and sewerage system operation in the municipal capital.
 The incentives were designed to enhance system operation and to provide the basis for financial
 sustainability. Resources are being used both for engineering designs (works to improve and
 rehabilitate existing services), and for goods and civil works themselves (typically network
 rehabilitation and metering).

 Incentives to individual municipalities range from US$100,000 to US$1.2 million, depending on
 the model selected, its financial and operational efficiency, and the size of the municipal capital,
 as determined by the number of household water connections. Given that information, the size of
 the incentive to which a given municipality is entitled is computed using the following formula: Z
 = I*(T+M), where:

 Z = Subsidy from PRAGUAS program;
 I = Maximum subsidy available based on the number of existing household water connections;


                                              26

T = Operating factor
M = Delegation factor for the model to be implemented

The maximum value of the incentive (I) is multiplied by the sum of two factors: the
delegation factor (M) and the operating factor (T) These factors are determined as follows:

The delegation factor (M) is determined by both the legal structure of the entity charged with
service provision (municipal government department, municipal company, mixed capital
company or cooperative) and the degree to which this entity outsources service provision.

The operating factor (T) is determined from the operating ratio (Co) as shown below:

 Co               Co<0.50        0.5<=Co<1      1.0<=Co<1.20 1.2>=Co<1.50 Co > 1.50
 T                Only TA        0.00           1.00              1.20              1.40

 Co = Operational Income/Cost of Administration, O&M

Incentive payments were assigned to municipalities as matching grants. In order to access the
full incentive (Z), municipalities were required to contribute an equivalent amount for the
goods and works to be procured. After two years of successful operation, the new
management model will be evaluated once again and - if the new operator has maintained or
improved his management indicators - a second incentive payment will be offered to the
municipality for additional water and sanitation investments.

So far 28 municipalities have successfully delegated and moved from direct service provision to
cooperatives, mixed-capital companies or municipal water and sanitation companies with either
a municipal majority (mayor, city counselors etc.) or a community majority (typically,
neighborhood representatives) on the board of directors.

This performance-based financial incentive formula has brought an unprecedented level of
transparency to sector financing in Ecuador and became the basis for the government's own
performance-and-poverty-based incentive formula for the ICE.

(ii) Increased capacity of SAPSyRS staff to manage the WSS sector. The SAPSyRS was
restructured and while several of its working groups are not yet fully operational, SAPSyRS
staff have received training through the Centro de Investigaciones Territoriales (CITE) of the
National Polytechnic School (see section 8.2).

(iii) Institutionalizing Municipal WSS Team. PRAGUAS strengthened (and in many cases set-
up) municipal water and sanitation units ("equipos municipals de agua y saneamiento", EMS)
in 108 municipalities (about half of all municipalities nationwide). These units ­ which
comprise both technical and social/community development specialists ­ were designed to give
small municipalities the human resources to provide rural WUA with post-construction support
in the operation of their systems. An ex-post evaluation of a sample of 36 water supply and 23
sanitation systems financed by the project was commissioned in 2005 and determined that 90%
of the municipalities surveyed had indeed institutionalized their EMS as part of the Water



                                           27

 Supply, Sewerage, Planning and Community Development Unit of the municipal Public Works
 Department and that the EMS had significantly improved the technical capacity of the
 municipal teams.


(c)     Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

 One positive impact of the project not anticipated at appraisal but actively supported by the
 Bank and the PMU during implementation was that the GOE took a bold step to improve
 Ecuador's incentive framework for WSS investments by adopting Executive Decree No. 2562
 that links national government transfers to municipalities under the ICE that is earmarked for
 WSS investments to operator performance, service model and poverty indicators.

 Furthermore, at a community level, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that ­ once
 organized for a rural water supply project -- communities are better able to act collectively to
 carry out other development projects for the betterment of their living conditions.

 No unintended negative impacts are known.

8.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops (optional for
   Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

 An ex-post evaluation of a purposeful sample of rural WSS sub-projects financed by
 PRAGUAS I was carried out in 2005. The sample included pilot projects (completed in 2002)
 and a random selection of new projects completed at least 18 months prior to the evaluation.
 The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the technical, social and economic efficiency and
 sustainability of the WSS systems provided by PRAGUAS and to evaluate the efficacy of the
 technical and financial processes, procedures and norms of rural PRAGUAS I investments
 located in 124 small municipalities with cantonal capitals of less than 10,000 inhabitants. A
 total of 190 focus groups and interviews with mayors and EMS teams, water boards,
 community leaders and male and female WSS users were conducted; a 1,752 household survey
 was applied, and 36 schools were used for observation. Some 38 water systems were assessed
 and 237 water samples were analyzed in laboratories.

 The main conclusions of the ex-post evaluation can be summarized as follows:

 General Conclusions:

 The ex-post evaluation validated the effectiveness of the demand-driven approach to rural WSS
 on a national scale and the tri-partite partnership of local communities, municipalities and the
 national government used for the project.

 The PRAGUAS participation scheme for the design as well as the implementation phases of
 each WSS project was applied in 100% of communities evaluated, however, results showed a
 demand for more standardized hands-on training of EMS, OITS (Technical and Social
 Intermediary Organizations), water boards, and communities.



                                             28

The selection criteria for rural communities and municipalities to be served with water supply
systems should remain: municipalities and communities willing to (i) co-finance 20% and 30%
of RWSS investments, respectively; (ii) adopt rural tariffs that cover the cost of O&M and some
equipment replacement; and (iii) agree to a demand-driven approach. Under these
circumstances, the PRAGUAS program will provide TA for engineering designs, community
development (including training and hygiene education) and supervision of works at no charge.

Financial, Economic and Organizational Conclusions:

The ex-post evaluation confirmed the financial viability of the majority of juntas surveyed, but
suggested that piped systems below 100 connections tended to be only marginally sustainable
(or unsustainable) from a financial and economic point of view. The evaluation also highlighted
the need to strengthen the supervision of consultants preparing project designs given the
competing demands on the time of EMS. Finally, the evaluation pointed to the need for
continuous support to juntas in keeping their tariffs current. The detailed conclusions are
summarized below:

Municipal supervision of the social-technical work was generally weak, perhaps due multiple
commitments of staff assigned to EMS.

There was insufficient planning/budgeting for protection of spring catchments in the majority of
projects assessed.

Water tariffs. The original water tariffs agreed on during the promotion phase of the project
were rarely updated to reflect actual operational costs.

Some 15 systems with higher numbers of connections (165 average) were financially profitable;
10 systems with 78.9 connections on average were marginally profitable; 3 systems with lower
number of connections were not financially viable. The last 12 could not be financially assessed
due to lack of information.

Water boards interviewed have not always received technical assistance to create a set of norms
for efficient financial operation of their systems. The EPAS are responsible for this activity.

It is worth mentioning that in response to these findings, under PRAGUAS II (i) OITS will be
replaced with larger regional design/supervision and community development firms/NGO's; (ii)
a minimum size threshold was introduced for communities requesting piped water supply
systems; (iii) training of juntas was strengthened (through the proposed introduction of new
regional associations of juntas); and (iv) an environmental checklist was introduced to ensure
that all designs would be systematically screened for adequate spring catchment protection.

Technical Conclusions:

While the overall quality of project civil works and technical solutions was found to be
satisfactory, the evaluation highlighted the need for more user training/awareness building



                                             29

regarding disinfection.

Quality of civil works and operation of the WSS units. The overall quality of the civil works,
choice of construction materials (PVC-P pipes, ferro-cement), valves and accessories is
satisfactory. All the WSS systems evaluated are in acceptable working condition.

The on-site sanitation alternative of Basic Sanitation Units (UBS, comprising a toilet, sink and
shower) is very successful and has significantly contributed to improving the living conditions
and enhancing the self-esteem of users. The UBS model has been studied by water delegations
from Peru and Paraguay.

Water quality. Insufficient attention is given by water boards and users to water quality. People
seem to be content with having piped water but have inadequate knowledge of and use of
installed disinfection devices.

Training. The results of community and water board training by OITS and EPAS respectively
are not satisfactory. Water boards are expected to show managerial expertise but in many cases
they have not been adequately trained.

Social Conclusions:

Overall, the evaluation found that municipalities and communities were satisfied with the
project's financial scheme and that beneficiary participation in the preparation and
implementation of WSS investments is high. It also concluded that while there seems to be high
awareness of hand washing as a socially approved practice, the majority of school children do
not wash their hands with soap after using school sanitary facilities. This has been addressed in
the design of PRAGUAS II (see section 11 on lessons learned).


Water Boards (Juntas) Strengths Index - Conclusions:

In general, water boards are more efficient in water system operation than in maintenance,
administration and financial management.

Training of water boards. Despite extensive training efforts under PRAGUAS I, only 53% of
current water boards interviewed had been trained in financial management. This result appears
to be due mostly to turnover of board members every two years. Evaluation results showed
deficiencies in training to operate, maintain, and administer systems and protect water sources.

Tariff collection. Some 81% of Water Boards have revenues from tariff collection. Nonetheless,
collection is regular in only 50% of communities.

The results of the ex-post assessment (which was commissioned as part of the preparation of
PRAGUAS II) have led to a number of design changes for PRAGUAS II:

    · Given uneven results with the training of communities and EMS, small, locally-



                                            30

        contracted OITS will be replaced with larger, centrally-contracted CDF (consultorías de
        diseño y fiscalización) and CIS (consultorías de intervención social).
     · WUAs will be classified on a scale from A (best) to D (weakest), monitored and
        strengthened through regional associations of WUA.
     · A national hand washing component has been added.
     · Only communities with at least 100 households will be eligible for piped water supply
        systems. Other levels of service like point sources (wells, boreholes) and individual
        household solutions (rainwater catchment systems) will be promoted for smaller
        communities.

9.      Rationale for Rating of Risk to Development Outcome

 Rating:  Moderate



 On balance, risks to development outcomes are deemed moderate due to the following
 constellation of factors at the national, municipal and community level:

     · National -- Risk of weak political support. The national government inaugurated in
        January, 2007 has indicated its support for the overall PRAGUAS program by endorsing
        the PRAGUAS II loan, signed by the previous government.

     · Municipal -- Risk of lack of involvement of municipalities. The large number of
        communities served under PRAGUAS I has demonstrated that a demand-responsive
        approach can deliver sustainable results on a national scale. This positive outcome has
        generated credibility for the program among municipalities and enhanced the likelihood
        of their greater involvement in PRAGUAS II.

     · Community -- Risk of communities not sustaining the assets. Hundreds of rural
        communities have contributed labor, materials and cash towards their water and
        sanitation systems. It is expected that communities will be more likely to maintain assets
        they have worked so hard to obtain. Further, the successful financial scheme of
        PRAGUAS I has confirmed that communities are willing to pay if they will get
        satisfactory services in return.


10.     Assessment of Bank & Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation
and outcome issues)

10.1    Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

 Rating:  Satisfactory

 The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was



                                             31

 satisfactory. The project was consistent with the government's development priorities and the
 Bank's CAS. In addition, the Bank also covered in-depth sociological aspects and local issues
 while designing the project. The Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all
 major relevant aspects, such as technical, financial, economic, environmental, institutional, and
 fiduciary aspects. As mentioned in Section 7.3, during project preparation, an M&E framework
 was developed to track progress in implementation and measure outcomes and impacts. Major
 risk factors and lessons learned from earlier projects in Ecuador, including the FASBASE and
 FISE projects were considered and incorporated into the project design.

 The Bank worked closely with the PRAGUAS preparation team in the design and
 implementation of a culturally appropriate social assessment, as recommended by O.D. 4.20.
 The main objective of the social assessment was to incorporate a participation, gender and
 indigenous strategy into every stage of the project design. A series of consultations both at the
 agency level and at the community level were carried out through project preparation to discuss
 lessons learned from WSS interventions country-wide and to generate socially and financially
 appropriate strategies for the supply of water and basic sanitation to small towns, mainly in
 rural areas. A Participatory Rural Appraisal in ten culturally diverse communities was carried
 out by a team of local social scientists with technical assistance from the World Bank. An inter-
 institutional consultative group, formed by the SSA, PRAGUAS, CODENPE, Pan-American
 Health Organization (PAHO), and the World Bank-financed health project FASBASE, was
 organized with the aim of defining a WSS strategy which incorporated gender and inter-cultural
 principles.

 An assessment of the implementing agency's financial management capacity was conducted on
 site in 2000, by a Financial Management Specialist. The objectives of the assessment were to
 determine if the PMU had the capacity to properly manage and account for all project proceeds
 and to produce timely, accurate and reliable project management reports for use by management
 and submission to the Bank.

 The project team had developed an integrated procurement risk mitigation strategy that
 included: (i) extensive training for municipalities participating in PRAGUAS in procurement
 and other RWSS topics under component 2A; (ii) easy "on-demand" technical assistance
 provided through EPPs (PRAGUAS provincial project units) and especially through IAA --
 project consulting firms that provided municipalities with experienced procurement specialists
 to prepare bidding documents, manage tender processes and assist with bid evaluation; and (iii)
 use of local engineering consulting firms (OITS) to supervise construction and sign-off on
 contractor invoices.


(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

  Rating:          Satisfactory

 The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was also satisfactory. The
 project focused on its development impact. Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated,
 and the project was adequately and closely supervised. The continuity of task management



                                             32

 significantly contributed to ensuring uninterrupted supervision of the project. The task team
 maintained continuous monitoring of the project and dialogue with the authorities. Given the
 political volatility of Ecuador, the task team played a key role by constantly marketing and
 explaining the project to each of the eight persons who became Ministers of Urban
 Development and Housing, as well as to eight Sub-secretaries in SAPSyRS during the project
 implementation period.

 Aide-Memoires were regularly prepared and the performance of the project both in terms of
 achievement of development objectives and implementation were realistically rated in the
 Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). Selection of consultants was reviewed by the Bank in
 accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement and the Bank's Guidelines for
 Selection and Employment of Consultants. The review of procurement of goods & works was
 also in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement and the Bank's
 Guidelines for Procurement.

 The Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) in December 2003, and assessed progress to
 date on all project components, by the implementation issues and the actions to be taken to
 ensure the successful completion of the project. The MTR confirmed the continuing relevance
 of the project design and recommended measures to speed-up implementation under
 components 2 and 3 (rural water supply/sanitation and service delegation respectively) which
 represented the bulk of overall disbursements under PRAGUAS I. At the time of the MTR,
 slightly less than US$10 million (of the US$32 million loan amount) had been disbursed. The
 MTR also flagged delays in the restructuring of the SAPSyRS, a process that was never
 satisfactorily completed despite intense supervision efforts.

 Through its follow-on project, PRAGUAS II, the Bank has ensured that adequate transition
 arrangements have been made for regular operations.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

  Rating:           Satisfactory.

 Based on Bank performance during the lending phase as well as supervision, overall Bank
 Performance is rated satisfactory.

10.2    Borrower

(a) Government Performance:

 Rating:    Moderately Satisfactory.

 The indications of borrower commitment and ownership were demonstrated in the early stages
 of the project by the fact that SSA and MIDUVI had established a dynamic project preparation
 team that prepared PRAGUAS for a period of two years. MIDUVI demonstrated commitment
 by taking the lead in establishing institutional alliances for the project, hiring special advisors
 and establishing a control system to gauge project preparation progress. Pilot projects in four


                                              33

 provinces were used to fine-tune PRAGUAS' approach to promotion and pre-investment
 activities.

 On the other hand, the volatile political atmosphere which prevailed during the implementation
 period and the resulting frequent change of administrations created instability and uncertainty in
 the country. As mentioned in Section 7.2, during 5 years of project implementation, Ecuador
 had 4 Presidents, 8 Ministers of Urban Development and Housing and 8 Sub-secretaries in
 charge of SAPSyRS. As a result, the government's commitment was fluctuating and
 inconsistent, and very often, the political leadership was either totally missing or rather weak.
 During the early stages of project implementation, in particular, when the demand-responsive
 approach produced significant community mobilization but few tangible works, there were
 frequent attempts to reduce co-financing requirement for municipalities and rural communities.
 These pressures subsided as the first generation of communities successfully entered the
 construction phase.

 High leadership turnover adversely affected implementation, especially in terms of timely
 resolution of implementation issues. For example, restructuring of the SAPSyRS proceeded at a
 slow pace over the course of the project, in part due to high turnover in ministerial and
 subsecretary ranks over a period of five years. Likewise, MIDUVI was unable to declare
 redundant those staff whose skills no longer fit SAPSyRS' new role, or to bring in those
 specialists needed to complete the skill mix of SAPSyRS. In an environment of political
 volatility and weak leadership, many times the Bank took a leadership role in lobbying for the
 project and put pressure on authorities for making progress in implementation.

 In later stages of the project, however, government commitment improved. For example, MEF
 took a keen interest in ensuring both the quality of public expenditures in the WSS sector and in
 leveraging public funds to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of WSS service providers.
 At MEF's behest, the Government took a bold step to improve Ecuador's incentive framework
 for WSS investments by adopting an Executive Decree that linked ICE transfers to
 municipalities for WSS investments to operator performance, service model and poverty
 indicators.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

  Rating:          Satisfactory



          Implementing Agency                                        Performance
  PMU/SAPSyRS                           The PMU was committed to achieving the project
                                        objective. The PMU's beneficiary/stakeholder
                                        consultations and involvement were extensive and
                                        thorough.

                                        Overall, the PMU developed important skills and
                                        experience during the implementation of the project. Key
                                        PMU staff were selected through a competitive, nationwide



                                              34

                                        selection process administered by an external human
                                        resource management firm and hired under 3-year
                                        contracts subject to annual performance reviews, an
                                        arrangement that largely shielded the PMU from the
                                        political volatility that characterized Ecuador during the
                                        implementation period. Only the general coordinator was
                                        appointed by the Minister of MIDUVI, though always in
                                        consultation with the Bank. Without a doubt, the continuity
                                        and technical performance of PMU staff was the single
                                        most important determinant in allowing a complex
                                        demand-responsive project with a long gestation period to
                                        succeed.

                                        PMU staff were able to maintain financial management
                                        arrangements compatible with Bank requirements. Project
                                        accounts (including contracts for consultants, goods and
                                        works) as well as the deposits and withdrawals from the
                                        Special Account were audited each year by an independent
                                        auditing firm acceptable to the Bank under terms and
                                        conditions satisfactory to the Bank and instances of non-
                                        compliance with good accounting practices were generally
                                        minor.

                                        The PMU prepared and submitted quarterly project
                                        management reports to the Bank according to the
                                        guidelines and formats provided in the OM. Procurement
                                        activities were carried out in accordance with the Bank's
                                        Guidelines for Procurement, and the Guidelines for the
                                        Selection and Employment of Consultants, though some
                                        procurement errors by some of the 124 project
                                        municipalities were detected in ex-post procurement
                                        reviews.

                                        On the other hand, for the reasons mentioned in Section
                                        7.3, M&E arrangements, including the utilization of M&E
                                        data in decision-making and resource allocation were not
                                        adequate. During the last year of implementation, this led
                                        to a situation in which loan resources were over-committed
                                        under contracts not subject to prior review by several
                                        million dollars. Works pending due to this over-
                                        commitment are expected to be completed under
                                        PRAGUAS II.

11.   Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

Positive Lessons

    · First and foremost, the PRAGUAS I project validates the viability of the demand-
        responsive approach to rural water supply to operate at scale at a national level and to
        deliver significant infrastructure outcomes over a five-year timeframe while involving
        rural beneficiaries in project selection, planning and operation. (General Applicability).

     · WSS sector reform needs to move beyond line ministries and sector agencies to include
         the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), since sustainable sector reform requires
         the development of consistent financial incentives and coherent financial policies. This
         conclusion became clear during implementation when the National Development Plan
         for the Development of the Water and Sanitation Sector was prepared and discussed
         with the line ministry and MEF (October, 2002). The plan made it readily apparent that
         Ecuador was missing an opportunity to use national government transfers to local
         utilities/municipalities as a tool to provide incentives for improvements in service
         provision and became a door-opener for a wider sector dialogue with MEF. Similar
         conclusions are valid for the WSS sector in other decentralized countries (e.g. Peru,
         Bolivia). (General Applicability).

     · It is important to be realistic and acknowledge the fact that a community-driven project
         such as PRAGUAS requires more time to get acceptance from the community and start
         implementation. In order to ease the pressure for immediate results, it is desirable to
         define the rules and regulations concerning community participation, financing matters
         etc. in the very early stages of preparation, rather than at a later stage. In addition,
         project implementation can be sped up (as occurred under PRAGUAS I) when
         community-level participatory processes are carried out and designs are prepared
         during the project preparation phase. Even then, the first year or two of project
         implementation are likely to involve slow disbursements. Task teams need to be
         realistic in projecting disbursements in the early years in project appraisal documents.
         (General Applicability)

     · In unstable country environments, a strong PMU may be essential to project success. A
         competitive selection process for PMU staff managed by an external human resource
         management firm and long-term contracts with annual performance reviews can be key
         to ensuring the success of a complex project in such an environment. While PMU's are
         often criticized for not building institutional capacity in host ministries, it is worth
         noting that in the case of PRAGUAS I, a PMU-centered approach was extremely
         successful at building significant capacity at the community and municipal level even
         while capacity building at the subsecretariat level was more modest. After an
         implementation approach has been validated, it should be mainstreamed. For this



                                            36

       reason, PRAGUAS II will be implemented by a "hybrid" PMU composed of both
       external consultants and seconded line ministry staff. (General Applicability)

  · The financial scheme of PRAGUAS I was proven to be socially acceptable. The success
      of this type of financing demonstrates that communities are willing to pay if they get
      satisfactory services in return. The project also showed that communities are more likely
      to maintain projects to which they have contributed in labor and in cash, and to neglect
      the maintenance of donated projects. (General Applicability)

  · The on-site sanitation alternative of UBS has proven to be an important success. Many
      families have improved their UBS with ceramic tiles, water heaters, etc. The operation
      and maintenance of on-site sanitation systems lies with individual households without
      any support from the water boards, OITS, EPAS and EMS. Delegations of specialists
      from Peru and Paraguay struggling with traditional latrines have already visited Ecuador
      to learn from this experience. (General Applicability)

  · The combination of technical assistance and clear, performance-based financial
      incentives for service delegation were effective in creating autonomous operators in a
      large number of municipalities. Nonetheless, the range of models actually rolled out
      (mostly municipal companies with either a municipal or community majority in the
      board of directors) was quite limited. This appears to be explained by the fact that local
      consultants advising municipalities on the range of available models ("consultorias de
      apoyo a la delegación", CADS) lacked experience with any model other than municipal
      companies. (Project specific)

  · Sustainability can be enhanced by pre-selecting municipalities that have: (i) a technical,
      social and financial team; (ii) municipal plans that include WSS and watershed
      protection plans; and (iii) a capable administrative/financial team. (Project specific)

  · Water Boards and communities should be assisted in the formulation of Social Plans
      that include community planning, tax payment, assessment of natural resources, and
      management of water sources. Social Plans should be implemented by both the water
      board and the community. (Project specific)

  · PRAGUAS' Operation Manual for financial and technical operations, administration,
      social control and auditing, should be disseminated more extensively. PRAGUAS
      procedures should be standardized and well disseminated. (Project specific)

Negative Lessons

  · It is important to strengthen M&E of a project both during implementation and after
      completion. In the case of PRAGUAS I, M&E arrangements were insufficient as both
      local municipalities and the regional offices of the SAPSyRS (EPAS) gave priority to
      the development of a pipeline of new projects. A related point is that it was difficult to
      mount an effective project management information system since local municipalities
      and EPAS were not collecting performance data. (General Applicability)


                                          37

   · Community water boards should be efficient both in water systems operation and in
     maintenance, administration and financial management. Many water boards
     interviewed during the ex-post evaluation had not received technical assistance to create
     a set of norms for efficient financial operation of their systems and the water board
     training by OITS and EPAS was not deemed satisfactory. (Project specific)

   · It is necessary to ensure that the procurement processes and contract administration by
     local municipalities are less cumbersome and less time-consuming for the local
     municipality, the private sector and the PMU. In response to this finding, the number of
     procurement processes actually carried out by municipalities will be drastically reduced
     under PRAGUAS II. (Project specific)

   · A more participatory, hands-on, training scheme (away from lecturing) is needed across
     the project, especially for EPAS (Provincial Water and Sanitation Teams, (sub-units of
     MIDUVI), EMS, Water Boards, system operators and communities. In addition,
     internships and workshops to learn-by-doing should be promoted. (Project specific)

   · The forced integration of technical and social specialists into OITS at the local level ­
     though attractive from a philosophical standpoint ­ has been relatively unsuccessful in
     practice, as OITS have typically been headed by engineers who have tended to dominate
     their social counterparts. For this reason, larger engineering firms and NGO's will be
     hired at the national level under PRAGUAS II. (Project specific)


12. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies:




                                          38

                          Borrower's Evaluation Report: Summary


First Component : Sector Reform

This component consisted of two subcomponents:

1.A. Reform of the Sector

The achievement of this subcomponent was that it changed the outlook of the governing entity:
the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MIDUVI); and of the Subsecretariat of
Potable Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste. The project thus enabled them to accomplish their
new roles for: (i) advocating the changes necessary for decentralization; (ii) seeking a
framework within which services are to be provided by the municipal entities; and (iii) finding a
model that emphasizes balanced sector development between rural and urban areas, and
between regions.

1.B. Strengthening the Municipalities and the Operators

This subcomponent had the participation of 49 municipalities and it managed to exceed the
goals stated by the program. With the support of the World Bank, the experience of other
countries was shared with the mayors in Ecuador.

The delays in processing the applications and Technical Assistance agreements during the first
two years, were because of the decision made by the SAPSyRS of MIDUVI, to provide
technical assistance through direct administration rather than following the guidelines
delineated in the Operational Manual.


Second Component : Rural Investment

The goals of this component were surpassed with ease despite the anticipated obstacles foreseen
during the initial program planning. The project managed to create designs for a population of
more than 600,000 inhabitants, while potable water and sanitation works were successfully
executed for 417,000 inhabitants.

The program in this component relied upon a co-financing agreement between the Central
Government and PRAGUAS. Together they covered the pre-investment portion, which
involved prior planning and design, fiscal accounting and half of the investments up to a
maximum of US$350 for water and US$210 for individual sanitation solutions on a per family
basis. The municipalities contributed 20% of the investment in cash and the Communities
contributed 10% in cash and 20% in labor.

This change of the financial policy in the rural sector, with co-financing and the search for a



                                            39

sustainable investment scheme, along with a schedule of tariffs required a great deal of extra
work on the part of the UGP of PRAGUAS. However, the benefits of the initial execution of the
new scheme did not meet the expectations of MIDUVI authorities. It required convincing the
communities and municipalities to believe that the initial interventions would materialize and
that the systems of potable water and sanitation were to be with indoor plumbing and basic
sanitation units, unlike the traditional communal faucets and latrines. The rural population was
informed that this program was about a plan that could meet the needs of the communities.


Third Component : Technical Assistance

The original goals for this component in Phase I of the PRAGUAS Program were to conduct
interventions in 30 Municipalities. 50 applicants signed up for Technical Assistance, of which
9 municipalities withdrew from the Component for a variety of reasons, 4 did not present the
fiduciary guarantee, 4 were unable to initiate Phase I with PRAGUAS I and, 33 adopted a
different new model of which 4 are pending for the implementation of the adopted model, 29
models were implemented (in one Municipality one Delegated Unit was implemented, and later
one Municipal Enterprise whose Board comprised a majority of civil society actors).

Even though the expected goals for this Component were amply met, there were various
obstacles that impeded the program from achieving greater success, some of which can be
summarized as follows:

        Lack of political resolve on the part of the Municipalities in adopting the new model,
        particularly when setting the new tariff, for fear of loosing popularity with the
        electorate.
        Delays in the approval of legal documents required for the new Operator.
        Interference from middle ranking public officials (specially from the Financial
        Directorates), for the re-allocation of resources (specially ICE) to the new Operator,
        displacement of human assets, carrying out projects, and the re-assignment of personnel
        to the new Operator.
        Lack of funds in the Municipality for the execution of projects (disincentive)
        Shortage or non-existence of expertise in the Municipalities to monitor the consulting
        firms, which ended up obliging the Management Model group in SAPSyRS to assume
        that role.
        Procedural delays in processing CAD contracts
        The needs of the Municipalities exceed what the CADs offer for free to initiate new
        processes/systems.


Fourth Component : Project Administration

In carrying out the Program and specifically in meeting the financial obligations one can say
that bills presented for payment, that were to be taken care of through MIDUVI suffered delays
due in large part to the fact that the "Dirección de Gestión de Recursos Financieros" (Office of
Financial Resource Management) was overloaded with tasks and responsibilities. Obtaining a



                                             40

budgetary allocation within the national budget, that was destined for the program always
required special negotiations and led to a loss of time.

Furthermore, the implementation of the PRAGUAS Program, through the Office of Financial
Resource Management of MIDUVI, involved delays in a variety of ways. The main complaints
were as follows:

        The unavailability of immediate resources from Special Accounts, since MIDUVI is in
        charge and not the Management Unit of the Program.
        Delays in starting-up the national budget at the start of each fiscal year, for which
        MIDUVI, before moving to draw the budget for the current year, must close and balance
        the budget for the previous year at the same time that it must fund the new budget. All
        of which entailed delays in drawing up the new budget at the beginning of every year, a
        lag that on the average was about three months.

It is important to point out that the relationship with the World Bank (both with the Project
Officer and with the Department of Disbursements) were smooth and positive. Disbursements
were timely, in a manner that facilitated an excellent availability of resources. Local
counterpart funds were made available in a timely manner as well.

This Component led to the development and implementation of the following systems:

        GUBY PROY, a financial system that has enabled accurate accounting for all of the
        operations carried out directly by the UGP or through the billing statements carried out
        at MIDUVI.
        SIG is a Management Information System that can manage information and is able to
        track the execution of the rural investment component, the management models, and the
        financial control models of the Program.
        SINSOC, is a system of social information that enables baseline collection of data and
        community diagnostics. This system facilitates to gauge the impact upon a given
        community in the delivery of Water and Sanitation services, thereby measuring the
        success in the actual execution of the Program.

During the execution of the first phase of the PRAGUAS Program, the UGP worked with the
General Coordinator, the Technical Director, the Director of Financial Administration, five
specialized consultants with the following expertise: Rural Investment Coordinator,
Management Model Coordinator, Social Consultant, Financial Analyst, Accountant, three
administrative assistants and personnel for support services. In addition, services of an
Advisor/Consultant knowledgeable in Contract Procedures were received.


Procurement

Several procurement processes conducted under NCB procedures had problems that made it
difficult to get the required clearances from the Contraloría General del Estado.




                                             41

 Shopping procedures (under which the UGP pre-qualified a long list of contractors which were
 then compiled into short-lists by way of a random lottery) met with resistance in several
 municipalities and should be re-examined.

 Procurement documents were not always filed systematically by municipalities and the UGP.
 Appropriate guidelines have been incorporated into the Operational Manual for PRAGUAS II.

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document): (the system displays entries in
Section 6)

   The development objective of the project was the execution of investments for increased WSS service
   coverage and quality for about 350,000 rural beneficiaries in about 40 small municipalities as well as in about
   six municipal capitals. In addition, the PDO included the improvement of sector performance through the
   application of coherent policies, and the strengthening of sector institutions at the central and local levels.

Component 1. Sector reform and institutional development

1.A Restructuring of SSA and Policy Reform

As part of the overall WSS sector reform, the Program (i) assisted MIDUVI through the Sub-Secretariat
of Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste (SAPSyRS) in the preparation of a National Water and Sanitation
Policy, which was approved by Presidential Decree in 2002. It also supported and financed (ii) the
preparation of a short and medium-term Sector Plan; (iii) regulations for the assignment of the Special
Consumption Tax (ICE), which generates about US$75 million/year in resources earmarked for the
WSS sector; and (iv) preparation of a draft Water and Sanitation Sector Law (Ley de Prestación de
Servicios de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado).

To support the transition of SAPSyRS to its new role as lead agency of the WSS sector, the project
financed: (i) a study on the restructuring of SAPSyRS; and (ii) the preparation of a capacity building
plan for the agency's personnel.

1B: Strengthening of Municipal Governments, NGO's and Private WSS Operators

To improve the provision of water and sanitation services in urban areas of all cantonal capitals
throughout the country (with the exception of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca), PRAGUAS provided
technical assistance for the delegation of WSS services to autonomous operators. Delegation models
provide services with efficiency and efficacy, reduce political interference, and foster the participation
of citizens in service provision.

During PRAGUAS I, 50 technical assistance agreements were signed with 49 municipalities in 14
provinces, of which 9 dropped out of the Program due to political indecision. Eight (8) additional
agreements are pending and will be addressed by PRAGUAS II.

The remaining 32 Municipalities have adopted delegated management models, of which 28 have
completed the transition process and are operating new management models (two Community
Enterprises, 1 Mixed Enterprise, seven Municipal Enterprises with a municipal majority on the board of
directors, and 18 Municipal Enterprises with a community majority on the board of directors, one of
which has outsourced service provision to a private operator). The remaining four will implement their
new management models under PRAGUAS II.

In terms of assistance to NGO's and private sector service providers, PRAGUAS I fostered the
integration of engineers and social specialists into technical-social intervention entities (organizaciones
de intervención técnico-social, OITS) and created a large market for them. In all, OITS were awarded
318 design contracts with 118 municipalities worth US$6.0 million and produced technical and social
designs for 664,000 rural inhabitants. In addition, municipalities signed 113 supervision contracts with
OITS for an amount of US $ 1,868,766. Overall, 206 OITS were trained by 2 large engineering/social
consulting firms.




                                                    48

Component 2. Water and Sanitation Subprojects in Rural Areas

Target Group: Rural areas of small municipalities (cantons), with cantonal capitals of less than 10,000
inhabitants, according to the 1990 census. This meant that 152 of a total of 219 Municipalities were
eligible.

Financing Policy: For potable water systems, PRAGUAS I established an investment ceiling of
US$700 per family, which was financed as follows:

           · 50% as a national subsidy, through MIDUVI/PRAGUAS, with maximum financing of
               US$350 per solution
           · 20% as a municipal subsidy
           · 30% as a community contribution (20% in labor and materials and 10% in cash)

For individual on-site sanitation solutions with flush toilets and washbasins, costs were capped at
US$300 per unit, of which PRAGUAS subsidized up to 70%, while 30% was financed by the user, using
labor, materials or cash. The maximum amount financed by the Program was US$210 per solution.


Goal: The component operated at the national level, co-financing investments with municipalities and
communities to provide new or rehabilitated water and/or sanitation services to 350,000 people.

Achievements: For the elaboration of Integrated Designs, 318 contracts were signed, which benefited
1,794 communities with 100,434 potable water and 110,811 sanitation solutions, serving 664.014
inhabitants.

For the execution of Works, 432 contracts were signed for works in 948 communities with 54,766
solutions for Potable Water and 28,644 for Sanitation, serving 417,050 inhabitants, with an investment
of US$25,677,332.

For the supervision of works, municipalities signed 113 supervision contracts for an amount of US $
1,868,766.


Component 3. Water and Sanitation Subprojects in Municipal Capitals

3A: Engineering Studies and Supervision

The objective was to finance the preparation of specialized engineering designs in those municipalities
that delegated WSS provision under component 1B, primarily for works that would provide quick
improvements in the quality of services. These designs were financed completely from loan proceeds.

During PRAGUAS I, these designs were prepared by Delegation Assistance Consultants (CADS) and
SAPSyRS staff.

The most relevant designs were: Designs for the spring catchment, transmission main and flocculator in


                                                  49

Echeandía; water storage tanks (2000 m3) and network sectorization in Cayambe; sectorization of
networks in the central area of Guaranda; and a redesign of the water treatment plant in the city of
Caluma.


3B: Investments in Cantonal Capitals

Municipalities that implemented new delegated management models under component 1B, were offered
a financial incentive to co-finance (50% PRAGUAS and 50% municipality) the civil works and goods
designed under sub-component 3A. The incentive was calculated as a function of the number of
household water connections, the degree of delegation in the selected management model and the level
of financial solvency achieved through tariff income. Municipalities with the political will to adopt (i)
more ambitious delegated management models (thereby limiting the risks of future politization of the
new operators) and/or (ii) higher levels of tariffs to cover operation & maintenance and some investment
costs, were rewarded with higher incentives.

Under PRAGUAS I, 15 incentive agreements were signed for US$2,600,000 and works were executed
in six Municipalities in the amount of US$1,416,000, of which the Program financed US$708,000.
Remaining payouts under the incentive agreements will be made under PRAGUAS II.

With financial incentives, service improvements (works) were carried out in:
    · Caluma: improvements to spring catchments (captaciones) transmission mains and the water
       treatment plant, expansion of networks and household water metering, improved water quality,
       increased water coverage from 70% to 90%, micro metering from 30% to 95%, and service
       continuity from 3 hours to 24 hours.
    · Riobamba: construction of and equipment for 1 new well (20 l/s), improvement of the aerators of
       the water treatment plant, construction of a new storage tank (2000 m3), increase in network
       coverage (5%), installation of 7500 micro meters (an increase from 50% to 75%).
    · Cayambe: provision and installation of hydrants, valves and pipes, improvements to spring
       catchments and storage tanks. The provision and installation of macro meters and household
       water meters is still pending.
    · Guaranda: works for hydraulic sectorization in the central area of the city.
    · Pedro Moncayo: system improvements in the main transmission pipeline and the regional water
       distribution network, and installation of macro meters for the sale of bulk water.
    · Espejo: initiated improvements for spring catchments and transmission pipeline.
    · A commercial system (service management software) was designed by PRAGUAS and installed
       in 25 of the 28 enterprises created.

Component 4. Project Management

The project financed the: (i) incremental operating costs for the PMU and the EPPs; (ii) equipment and
software for the PMU and EPPs; (iii) contracting of personnel and consultants for the PMU; and (iv)
maintenance of the financial management system.

The PMU included a General Coordinator, a Technical Director, a Financial Administrative Director,
five specialized consultants, three administrative assistants and technical support staff. Additionally, the

Program was supported by a Procurement Advisor.

The Controller General of the State was responsible for hiring an independent private auditor for the
PRAGUAS Program. The audit reports presented by the firms were satisfactory, were approved by the
Controller and sent to the World Bank.




                                                  51

          Annex 5.        Economic and Financial Analysis (including assumptions in the analysis)

To determine the net incremental costs and benefits of the project, "with" and "without" project
scenarios were constructed. On the basis of these scenarios, the net incremental financial benefits and
costs of the proposed investment programs were assessed, which were then adjusted for the impact of
taxes, subsidies, and externalities to arrive at the economic flow of costs and benefits. The cash flows
were discounted using a discount rate of 12 percent, which is estimated to be a proxy for Ecuador's
opportunity cost of capital.

The costs included in the analysis were: (i) capital investment costs, (ii) recurrent costs (operations,
maintenance and depreciation), (iii) institutional development costs, and (iv) community development
costs (organization, training, social promotion activities, hygiene education and hand washing
campaigns). For the components analyzed, the costs of complementary actions necessary to derive the
expected benefits and targeted sustainability levels were included. It was deemed necessary to include
these additional costs in order to permit the assumption that the expected benefits of the project will
actually be realized and maintained over the 20-year timeframe of the project. All transfers including
taxes and subsidies are excluded from the analysis. All costs included in the economic analysis were
adjusted to reflect economic prices using conversion factors calculated by the Banco del Estado de
Ecuador.

To estimate the benefits from increased water consumption due to improved water quality, as well as
more reliable and lower cost water service provided by the project, data was collected from direct
beneficiaries (household surveys) and from the Juntas. This data was compared with the results from
baseline surveys of households in the same project communities.

The benefits for resource savings were also estimated using observed information from the ex-post
surveys of PRAGUAS I, basically time savings and other costs (monetary and non-monetary) reported
in interviews. Health benefits known to users were captured by their willingness to pay for good quality
water; additionally, a reduction in costs related to water borne diseases (diarrhea) were assessed based
on the frequency of occurrence and monetary expenditures (in the last two weeks of the survey) by the
potential beneficiaries. The surveys showed a reduction of illness-related monetary expenditures and a
reduction in the time lost (related to the episode), both of which were included in the analysis.

Additional benefits expected from the on-site sanitation component, were not be quantified. Rather, a
least-cost analysis of the alternatives and cost-effectiveness criteria were used for investment decisions.
The strategy was based on strong promotion and demand generation of user investment in sanitation,
low levels of subsidy, targeted coverage levels of at least 60 percent of households per community to
achieve full health impacts and promotion of a wider range of lower cost options.

Results of the economic analysis are shown in the main text (see section 8.3).

                                 Annex 8.      Beneficiary Survey Results (if any)


An ex-post evaluation of a purposeful sample of 40 PRAGUAS I sub-projects was carried out in 2005.
The sample included pilot projects (completed in 2002) and a selection of new projects completed at
least 18 months prior to the evaluation. The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the technical, social
and economic efficiency and sustainability of the WSS systems provided by PRAGUAS and to evaluate
the efficacy of the technical and financial processes, procedures and norms of the projects located in 124
small municipalities with cantonal capitals of less than 10,000 inhabitants. A total of 190 focus groups
and interviews with mayors and EMS teams, water boards, community leaders as well as male and
female WSS users were conducted; a 1,752 household baseline survey instrument was applied, and 36
schools were used for observation. Some 38 water systems were assessed, and 237 water samples were
analyzed in laboratories.

The main conclusions and recommendations of the ex-post evaluation are summarized below.

General Conclusions:

a) As a result of PRAGUAS intervention, 90% of municipalities have institutionalized a Municipal WSS
Team (EMS) as part of the Public Works Unit. The inclusion of the EMS has significantly improved the
technical capacity of the municipal teams.

b) The PRAGUAS participation scheme in the design as well as in the implementation phases of each
WSS project was applied in 100 % of communities evaluated, however, results showed a demand for
more standardized hands-on training of EMS, OITS (Technical and Social Intermediary Organizations),
water boards, and communities.

c) The financial scheme of PRAGUAS I has proven to be socially acceptable. Ex-post evaluation results
indicate satisfaction of municipalities and communities with the established contributions. Moreover,
experience in Ecuador shows that communities are more likely to maintain projects where they have
made some investment, and neglect maintenance of donated projects. Therefore, PRAGUAS II will
continue its tripartite financial policy: PRAGUAS (50 %), municipality (20 %) and community (30 %:
10% in cash and 20% in kind).

d) The selection criteria for rural water should remain: municipalities and communities willing to (i) co-
finance 20% and 30% of RWSS investments, respectively, (ii) adopt rural tariffs that cover the cost of
O&M and some equipment replacement; and (iii) agree to a demand-driven approach. Under these
circumstances, the PRAGUAS program will provide TA for engineering designs, community
development (including training and hygiene education) and supervision of works at no charge.

e) The ex-post evaluation indicated that the targeting of PRAGUAS I was pro-poor: 92% of the
beneficiaries of the pilot program and 72% of beneficiaries of WSS systems in 2002- 2004 were small
rural farmers, 5.6% were artisans or worked in small-scale industry; 5.3% worked in trade and only
0.5% own micro-enterprises.

General Recommendations:



                                                     57

a) Include in the criteria for selection of beneficiaries for piped systems, those organized communities of
100 or more households willing to pay tariffs. Smaller communities with less than 100 household
connections will be encouraged to consider lower cost alternatives, although exceptions can be justified
by an economic analysis on a case-by case basis.

b) The emphasis of PRAGUAS II should be on strengthening EMS and water boards. A periodic
strengthening program of the Municipal Sanitation Unit (EMS) to ensure adequate skills of staff that
have turned over should be developed.

c) Improve the PRAGUAS Monitoring and Evaluation systems, with user-friendly information systems
that allow the utilization of the baseline and diagnostic data for monitoring of the Social Plan by the
municipality, water board and community. Require periodic reporting from the PMU to Ministry and
Bank teams to be generated using the information systems to ensure their use.

d) A more participatory, hands-on, training scheme (away from lecturing) of EPAS (Provincial Water
and Sanitation Teams, subunits of the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MIDUVI)), EMS
(Municipal Sanitation Units), water boards, system operators and communities is needed across the
project. Promote internships and workshops to learn-by-doing.

e) Assist water boards and communities in the formulation of Social Plans that include community
planning, tax payment, assessment of natural resources, and management of water sources. Social Plans
should be implemented by both the water board and the community.

f) Disseminate more extensively PRAGUAS' Operation Manual for financial and technical operations,
administration, social control and auditing in general. PRAGUAS procedures should be standard and
universally known.

Financial and Economic Conclusions:

a) Some 15 systems with higher numbers of connections (165 average) were financially profitable; 10
systems with 78.9 connections on average were marginally profitable; 3 systems with lower number of
connections were not financially viable. The last 12 could not be assessed due to lack of information.

b) Water boards interviewed have not received technical assistance to create a set of norms for efficient
financial operation of their systems. The EPAS are responsible for this activity.

Economic and Financial Recommendations:

a) Provide water boards with training in accounting, and financial management of systems, revenue
investment, tariff collection, and enforcement of penalties, etc.

b) Review the EPAS' terms of reference to ensure that technical and financial reviews of proposed
designs guarantee compliance with project rules.

Technical Conclusions:

a) In general, designs meet SAPSyRS norms. No technical problems were detected in hydraulic
calculations for transmission mains and water distribution.

b) Quality of civil works and operation of the WSS units. The overall quality of the civil works, choice
of construction materials (PVC-P pipes, ferro-cement), valves and accessories is satisfactory. All the
WSS systems evaluated are in acceptable working condition. Problems found are related to the choice of
technical option and community organization to manage the system. A considerable number of water
meters in unsatisfactory condition were found.

c) Water quality. Insufficient attention is given by water boards and users to water quality. In many
systems, proper disinfection procedure is not followed, resulting in insufficient chlorine residuals in the
network. In a few cases, a poor choice of surface water source (prone to contamination or high in
turbidity) results in high costs of disinfection. There was no assessment of water sources, or planning/
budgeting for protection of water sources in the majority of projects assessed.

Water meters. 100 % of families in most provinces, except for Manabi (67%) and Sucumbíos (22%)
have water meters, however not all of them operate well. Some 83.4% of users pay by water volume,
and the other 16.6 % pay fixed tariffs.

d) Training. The results of community and water board training by OITS and EPAS are not satisfactory.
Water boards are expected to show managerial expertise but in many cases have not been adequately
trained.

e) Protection and conservation of water sources. Some 74 % of water sources evaluated may be prone to
contamination and water volume reduction in coming years due to unprotected catchments,
deforestation, farming, and the excessive use of pesticides/fungicides. Only a few municipalities and
water boards implement watershed protection plans.

f) Sanitation. Basic Sanitation Units ("Unidad Básica de Saneamiento", (UBS), comprising a toilet, sink,
and shower) are a great success in the communities assessed, as they have significantly contributed to
improve the living conditions and self-esteem of users. Several families have improved the UBS with
ceramic tiles, hot water, etc. In sum, 37 % of users have selected UBS, 40 % selected only a toilet and
sink, and 23 % improved their pour flush latrines.

Social Conclusions:

In general, results show high satisfaction in beneficiaries as well as positive impact on the improvement
of hygiene habits and maintenance of water systems in rural communities, through the development of
Social Plans.

a) Environmental impact. Insufficient work has been done towards conservation of water sources.

b) Community participation for reforestation was evident only in Chimborazo, Loja and Sucumbíos (60
to 100 % participation). The majority of beneficiaries have no trash collection, except for Bolivar,



                                                      59

Pastaza and El Oro (between 42 and 65 %). Use of chemicals for agriculture is high in all provinces, e.g.
in Cotopaxi (99 %), Imbabura (91%), and Pastaza (66 %).

c) Hygiene. The majority of families do not disinfect water, except for Imbabura and Loja. However,
more than 70 % of users "wash hands before meals", "wash foods before eating them", and "wash hands
after using the latrine". Water boiling is s more uneven: it ranges from over 50% of families in
Chimborazo, Pastaza and Sucumbíos to 25% in Azuay and Cotopaxi. The number of liters boiled ranges
from 3 (Azuay) to 8 (Sucumbíos), mostly with gas (wood in Chimborazo). Direct observation of water
storage indicates that 80% of receptacles were covered, although receptacles are often unclean.

d) Utilization of WSS systems in schools. Most problems were found in schools in the highlands and
Amazonia. Sanitation items such as soap are rarely available.

(e) Community Contributions. Beneficiary participation in the preparation and implementation of WSS
processes, and labor is high (over 80 %) for men and women. Participation in monetary contributions
was highest in Azuay, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, El Oro, Loja and Sucumbíos (over 90 %) and
contributions ranged from US$12 to US$120 (Chimborazo).

For details on beneficiaries, coverage, water quality and quantity, health and user satisfaction, see
Section 8.2.

Technical and Social Recommendations:

a) Technical Supervision. Improve the technical supervision of construction contracts and enforce
quality controls.

b) Reinforce the requirement that communities have title to water sources before works commence.

c) Enforce the use of Operation Manuals for water boards and EMS.

d) Verification of demand. Ensure the selection criteria used for municipalities, communities, water
sources and number of connections responds to demand, and not to political pressures. Consider
contracting this activity separately.

e) PRAGUAS should assist communities in fixing water tariffs to maintain economically sustainable
systems. At the moment, tariffs adopted by many communities are not economically viable to provide
quality water.

f) Social control/supervision. More involvement of the water boards and community members is needed
during the processes of technical supervision of civil works, to promote beneficiary awareness of
materials used, agreed implementation timelines, costs and contractual terms and to empower them with
the knowledge and skills needed to demand efficiency from the EMS, consultants, contractors and
PRAGUAS.

g) Enforce the protection of water sources under the environmental protection plan of each project that
includes prevention and mitigation measures.



                                                    60

h) Community training. Evaluation of community training results highlight the need to adjust training to
local needs with more efficient focus on gender and interculturality of beneficiaries (language, world
view).

i) Community Social Management Plans should include a module on community planning for the
operation and maintenance of systems.

j) Communities request that the community contribution in cash and in kind be calculated and also
advertised on the project signs, next to that of the municipality and PRAGUAS.

Water Boards Strengths Index - Conclusions:

a) In general, water boards are more efficient in water system operation than in maintenance,
administration and financial management. Some deficiencies may be due to low schooling, (e.g. 20 % of
Presidents, 42 % of Secretaries, and 47 % of Treasurers have only primary education).

b) The most efficient water boards are those of the coastal region, administrating new water systems,
and serving non-indigenous populations. The 27 water boards administrating new systems show
significant improvements over the 11 boards of the Pilot PRAGUAS program in all areas, except for
Local Planning, Performance and Products. The water boards located in Parish capitals (5)
("parroquias") are found to be more efficient than the 32 boards serving disperse rural communities.
Likewise, boards serving non-indigenous communities are found to be more efficient than the 12 boards
serving the Indigenous.

c) The Social Management Plans do not have separate strategies for (i) community and (ii) water board
training in management and administration of systems.

d) Training of water boards. Only 53 % of present water boards interviewed have been trained by the
EPAS in financial management (turnover of boards every two years). Evaluation results show
deficiencies in training to operate, maintain, and administer systems and protect water sources. At the
moment, low cost recovery does not allow capitalization /reinvestment or adequate maintenance of
systems, much less the protection of water sources.

Water boards have not participated in the operation, maintenance and administration of on-site sanitation
systems.

In some communities, neither the WSS systems nor the water sources are accounted for as assets.

e) Participatory Planning. Only 25 % of water boards included community leaders and civil society in
operations planning, and only half of those include monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The other 75
% lack a plan (operational, financial, management, maintenance), and a budget.

f) Legal and tax issues. Only 8 % of assessed water boards have a tax-payer ID (RUC) and pay taxes, the
other 92 % don't.




                                                     61

g) Tariff collection. Some 81 % of Water Boards have revenues from tariff collection. Collection is
regular in 50 % of communities, but the other 50 % refuse to pay for nonpotable water.

Water Boards -Recommendations:

a) Increase education standards of water board members. Arrange literacy training particularly for
treasurers and secretaries.

b) Provide hands-on training of water boards in basic accounting (control of inputs and outputs),
administration (calculation of real costs of tariffs, and differential tariffs for commercial, industrial and
household use), use of stationary for billing, payment registration, etc. Avoid `lecture style' training.

c) Provide "intercultural" training for water boards serving Indigenous communities.

d) Ensure water boards are aware of tax administration procedures, and comply with the legal
requirements.

e) Train operators to ensure water quality is acceptable.

COMPONENTE 1 REFORMA SECTORIAL

El Componente desarrolló, dos subcomponentes:

1. A Reforma del Sector

En este subcomponente se desarrollo la Política Sectorial, el Plan Sectorial, el Borrador de la Ley de
Prestación de Servicios de Agua Potable y Saneamiento, y el Reglamento de la Distribución de los Recursos
del Impuesto a los Consumos Especiales ICE. Para el desarrollo de estas herramientas se contó con un fuerte
apoyo del Banco Mundial, quien condicionó la aprobación de estos documentos a desembolsos. Falto el
desarrollo de la Normativa Sectorial y el Plan Sectorial de Residuos Sólidos, los cuales se quedaron en los
procesos de contratación de las consultorías, por falta de dedición de las autoridades y de gerenciamiento de la
UGP, que priorizó la inversión a los cambios sectoriales.

El Logro en este subcomponente está en haber cambiado la visión del ente Rector (Ministerio de Desarrollo
Urbano y Vivienda y de la Subsecretaría de Agua Potable, Saneamiento y Residuos Sólidos) para que cumpla
su nuevo rol, que impulse el cambio del sector para tener una descentralización y la forma de prestación de los
servicios por parte de las municipalidades, así como buscar un desarrollo del sector balanceado entre áreas
Urbanas y Rurales y entre regiones.

1.B Fortalecimiento de Municipios y Operadores.

Que se refiere a la Asistencia Técnica para la delegación de la prestación de los servicios de agua potable y
saneamiento, este subcomponente contó con la participación de 49 municipios y se logró superar las metas
planteadas por el Programa. Con apoyo del Banco Mundial se difundió a los Alcaldes del Ecuador, las
experiencias de otos Países. Los logros se detallan en el cuadro siguiente.

                                                     64

originó por la decisión de la SAPSy RS del MIDUVI, de realizar las intervenciones de Asistencia Técnica por
Administración Directa, sin cumplir lo señalado en el Manual Operativo,                 que estipulaba que las
intervenciónes se desarrollarían mediante la contratación de Consultorías Externas, metodología aprobada por
el Banco Mundial en primera instancia.

Frente a los retrasos del componente se cambio la modalidad conforme a lo establecido originalmente, y se
asistió mediante la contratación de Consultoras de Apoyo a la Delegación CADS, lográndose en los dos años
finales mayores logros que los planificados.

Para la Fase II del PRAGUAS, se desarrollarán las intervenciones mediante la contratación de CADS para
Municipalidades que tengan en su servicio de agua potable hasta 6000 conexiones, y para Municipalidades de
mayor tamaño y que demanden la Asistencia Técnica, se está contratando la Consultoría de Empresas
Operadoras Internacionales ECADS, que tienen mayor capacidad de asistir y mejorar la prestación de los
servicios con modalidades de concesión.

COMPONENTE 2.- INVERSION RURAL

Con enfoque de demanda, hacia la dotación de servicios de agua potable y saneamiento a las comunidades
rurales de aquellas municipalidades que en su Cabecera Cantonal tuvieron hasta 10.000 habitantes. Para el
presente análisis describimos las fases de diseños y ejecución y las principales observaciones en lo referente a
la administración financiera que tuvo impacto en la operación de este componente, así como los aspectos de
coordinación.

Las metas en este componente fueron superadas con holgura a las previstas en la programación inicial del
programa. Es así como se logró dotar de diseños a una población superior a los 600.000 habitantes; y en la
ejecución de obra se llegó a 417.000 habitantes dotados de servicios de agua potable y/o saneamiento.

Aprobado por el Banco Mundial se contó con el Manual Operativo, que sirvió de guía para el cumplimiento
tanto de los procedimientos establecidos para los actores de interrelación (EPAS, EMS) como para la
aplicación de las Guías de Opciones Técnicas.

El Programa en este componente contó con un Cofinanciamiento de inversiones entre Estado Central con el
PRAGUAS que cubrió la preinversión (diseños Integrales), fiscalización y el 50% de las inversiones hasta un
máximo de US$ 350 para agua y de US$ 210 para soluciones individuales de saneamiento por familia
atendida, el Municipio aporto el 20% de las inversiones en efectivo y, las Comunidades el 10% en efectivo y el
20 % en mano de obra. Esta forma de financiamiento se mantuvo, pero se flexibilizó la forma de entregar estos
aportes, por cuanto al inicio se requería que la totalidad de los aportes en efectivo de las municipalidades y
comunidades esté entregada a la firma del contrato de ejecución de obras, y se aceptó que se modifique para
que el 50% de los aportes se den al inicio y el 50% al final, lo cual dinamizó la participación de las
Comunidades, pero genero una sobre demanda, la cual no fue controlada al final de la intervención de la Fase
1.

El Cambio de una política financiera en el sector rural, con cofinanciamiento y buscando una sostenibilidad de
las inversiones con tarifas, demando de la UGP del PRAGUAS un fuerte trabajo en este cambio, y los logros
de ejecución al inicio no cubrían las expectativas de las autoridades del MIDUVI. El convencimiento de las
Comunidades y Municipios se dio al ver que las primeras intervenciones se concretaron y que los sistemas de
agua potable y de saneamiento, eran con conexiones domiciliarias y unidades básicas de saneamiento,
diferentes a los tradicionales grifos comunitarios y letrinas, percibiendo la población rural que se trataba de un
programa que podía cumplir con las demandas de la ciudadanía.

Con la mayor demanda de los Municipios y Comunidades, se pudo sobrepasar las metas del Programa, pero no


                                                      65

se controló esta sobre demanda y condujo a un sobre dimensiónamiento de los compromisos, también no se
inició a tiempo el proceso de trámite para el crédito de la Fase II y poder atender en forma continua la
demanda de las Comunidades.

Se considera importante analizar a detalle cuatro ámbitos en este componentes, aspectos que han sido
revisados por el Banco Mundial e introducidos en el manual Operativo de la Fase II del PRAGUAS y que
servirá para normar las Políticas y Procedimientos, hacia el cumplimiento de las metas trazadas, buscando la
optimización de la asignación de los recursos hacia la generación de mayores impactos en beneficio de los
usuarios demandantes de los servicios.

a) OBSERVACIONES A FASE DE ESTUDIOS Y DISEÑOS:

    · Al ser una forma de intervención integral (Técnico Social), se requiere una mayor experticia de los
        Equipos Municipales de Saneamiento EMS para realizar la revisión y aprobación.

    · Los Equipos Provinciales de Agua y Saneamiento EPAS del MIDUVI tienen mayor experticia que los
        EPAS en lo relacionado a Preinversión y se les debería dar mayor responsabilidad en este campo.

    · La intervención de las CAI con capacitación a los EMS, mejoró los trámites administrativos para los
        procesos de contratación, pero no mejora las experticias en lo relacionado a la revisión y aprobación
        de diseños, por cuanto esto está relacionado a la especialización de los técnicos. La UGP debió
        intensificar la intervención para apoyar a los técnicos del EMS y cumplir con las metas programadas.

    · En cuanto al personal contratado por la UGP para apoyar a los EMS, por el tiempo de disponible para
        ésta tarea, se limitaron a verificar los planos y no se validó en campo.

    · La aplicación de la política tarifaria se dio parcialmente por cuanto se entendió que en este tema,
        también dependía de la demanda de la comunidad, por lo cual se calculaba la tarifa y luego la
        comunidad reducía la misma, confundiéndose con la voluntad de pago.


b) OBSERVACIONES A FASE DE EJECUCION INTEGRAL:

    · Los procesos de contratación de obras requiere de mayor dinamismo por parte de las Municipalidades,
        lo cual se logrará con mayor seguimiento por parte de los EPAS.

    · Los plazos de ejecución de obras, deben ser mejor estimados para establecer en los Documentos
        Precontractuales.

    · En algunos proyectos se produjo a incrementos de volúmenes de obra y consecuentemente de
        reprogramaciones en tiempo y costos, lo cual se deben minimizar.

    · El proceso de fiscalización con Organismos de Intervención Técnico Social OITS, requieren mayor
        reforzamiento en la parte de intervención social.
    · Todos los Procesos de contratación y los productos de consultoría y la documentación de las
        ejecuciones integrales, requieren que sean archivadas adecuadamente en las Municipalidades, en los
        EPAS y en la UGP, lo cual permite con mayor facilidad realizar un seguimiento.

c) OBSERVACIONES AL AMBITO ADMINISTRATIVO FINANCIERO




                                                       66

    · Los trámites de pago de planillas, tuvieron una dinámica acorde a la dada por las Municipalidades y
        los EPAS, por lo que en algunos casos fue muy ágil, en otras normales y en algunos casos lentos. Es
        necesario buscar un mecanismo que haga de este proceso más homogéneo y ágil, lo mas independiente
        posible de las eficiencias de los EMS y EPAS.

    · El Manejo de las cuentas por parte del MIDUVI, demoró el proceso y se recomienda un manejo por
        parte de la UGP para que se gane en agilidad.


COMPONENTE 3.- ASISTENCIA TECNICA

Tiene como finalidad fortalecer la gestión de los servicios de agua potable y alcantarillado mediante la
adopción por parte de las Municipalidades de nuevos modelos de gestión delegada que administren los
servicios con criterios de eficiencia empresarial y la implementación de tarifas reales que le brinden
sostenibilidad a los servicios.

Este componente esta conformado por dos subcomponentes:

3 A) Diseños en Cabeceras Cantonales

      Con este componente se financia la ejecución de estudios y diseños específicos de obras civiles que sean
      requeridos realizar para el mejoramiento de los servicios de agua potable de las Cabeceras Cantonales
      que por su complejidad o envergadura no puedan ser realizados por las Consultoras de Apoyo a la
      Delegación (CADs).

3 B) Inversión en Cabeceras Cantonales

      Brinda apoyo económico a aquellas Municipalidades que han adoptado, implementado nuevos modelos
      de gestión de legada y tarifas que de den sostenibilidad a los servicios, mediante la suscripción de
      convenios de incentivo que considera el tamaño de la población en función al numero de conexiones de
      agua potable, al modelo implementado a la tarifa vigente (Factor de Operación), valores que financian
      hasta el 50% de las inversiones a realizar.

Las metas previstas para este componente en la Fase I del Programa PRAGUAS fueron intervenir en 30
Municipios, que se logre la delegación en 10 y que de estos 5 sean exitosos, a la terminación del PRAGUAS I,
se logró la suscripción de 50 convenios de asistencia Técnica, de los cuales 9 Municipios se retiraron del
Componente por diversos motivos, 4 no presentaron la garantía de fideicomiso, 4 no fueron posibles de iniciar
la Fase I con el PRAGUAS I y 33 adoptaron un nuevo modelo de los cuales 4 están pendientes de implementar
el modelo adoptado, 29 modelos fuero implementados (en un Municipio se implementó primero una Unidad
Delegada y luego una Empresa Municipal con mayoría ciudadana en el Directorio).

Si bien las metas previstas para el Componente se cumplieron sobradamente, no está por demás indicar que
hubieron varios inconvenientes que impidieron que los logros fueran mayores, los cuales se los puede resumir
de la siguiente manera:

    · Falta de decisión política por parte de las Municipalidades al momento de adoptar el nuevo modelo y
      especialmente al establecer la nueva tarifa, por temor a perder espacio con los electores.

    · Demora en los Concejos en la aprobación de la documentación legal para la conformación del nuevo



                                                     67

      operador.

    · Interferencia de funcionarios de rango medio (especialmente de las Direcciones Financieras), por el
      redireccionamiento de los recursos (especialmente ICE) al nuevo Operador, traspaso de activos,
      ejecución de obras, y en el traspaso del personal al nuevo operador.

    · Falta de presupuesto en los Municipios para la ejecución de obras (contraparte para el incentivo).

    · Falta o ninguna capacidad de los Municipios para fiscalizar las consultorías, lo que obligó a que los
      funcionarios de Modelos de Gestión de la SAPSyRS asumieran ese rol.

    · Demora en los procesos de contratación de las CADs.

    · La Demanda de los Municipios rebaso la oferta de CADs, libres para iniciar nuevos procesos (durante el
      2005 16 CADs realizaban intervenciones las demás inscritas a fines del 2003- se disolvieron por razones
      distintas).

El interés de participar en el Componente por parte de los Municipios obedeció a dos razones fundamentales
que señalamos:

La Primera haber desarrollado proyectos pilotos exitosos en la etapa de preparación del PRAGUAS Fase I, lo
cual permitió al Programa presentar experiencias propias del País. La segunda se centro en los eventos
internacionales de experiencias exitosas desarrolladas por el PRAGUAS con un fuerte apoyo del Banco
Mundial, que permitió a todos los Alcaldes, 60 en promedio de asistentes por evento, visualizar nuevos
modelos de gestión posibles de desarrollar en cada una de sus jurisdicciones y se vieron motivados para
ingresar en el PRAGUAS.

En dos años los Modelos de Gestión apoyados por el Programa recibieron del Banco del Estado y GTZ los
premios a las Mejores Practicas Municipales (Echeandía 2004, Cayambe en 2004 y Pedro Moncayo 2006)

COMPONENTE 4. ADMINISTRACION DEL PROYECTO

Mediante Acuerdo No.061 expedido por el Señor Ministro de Desarrollo Urbano y Vivienda el.1 de junio del
2001, se crea la Unidad de Gestión del Programa "PRAGUAS" y se establece su organización, niveles de
administración, funciones y contratación del personal.

Para el mejor desarrollo de las actividades previstas en la ejecución del Programa, se consideró que la UGP
debe coordinar su gestión con la Subsecretaría de Agua Potable y Saneamiento Básico, la Subsecretaría
Regional del Guayas, Los Ríos y El Oro, las direcciones provinciales del MIDUVI, los Equipos Provinciales
de Agua y Saneamiento, EPAS, las municipalidades y sus Equipos Municipales de Saneamiento , EMS.

En la administración de los recursos se debe señalar que el manejo de la Cuenta Especial No 54410000
Denominada "MIDUVI PRAGUAS PTMO BIRF 7035-EC" y de la Cuenta TR..No 01121485, denominada
"CONTRAPARTE GOBIERNO NACIONAL PRAGUAS" ,abiertas en el Banco Central del Ecuador estuvo
bajo la responsabilidad del MIDUVI a través de la Dirección Nacional de Gestión de Recursos Financieros.

La UGP ha manejado durante los primeros dos años, fondos rotativos destinados al pago de determinados
conceptos de gasto; posteriormente se ha trabajado con Programaciones Presupuestarias solicitadas al
MIDUVI. Los fondos han sido depositados por el MIDUVI en la Cuenta TE ( Exclusiva) No 01121689,
denominada "MIDUVI PRAGUAS UGP BIRF 7035-EC" y los recursos relativos a la contraparte local en la



                                                     68

cuenta TR. No 01121487 denominada "MIDUVI PRAGUAS UGP BIRF 7035-EC CL" abiertas también en el
Banco Central del Ecuador.

En la ejecución del Programa y específicamente en el cumplimiento de obligaciones financieras se puede
indicar que las Ordenes de Pago que se realizaban para ser atendidas a través del MIDUVI, han sufrido
retrasos que se explican por la cantidad de trabajo que tiene a su cargo la Dirección de Gestión de Recursos
Financieros. La obtención de espacios presupuestarios dentro del Presupuesto General del Estado, destinados
al Programa, siempre requirió de gestiones especiales y de pérdida de tiempo.

La ejecución del Programa PRAGUAS a través de la Dirección de Gestión de Recursos Financieros del
MIDUVI ha implicado retrasos por diferentes aspectos, entre los principales tenemos:

    · La no disponibilidad inmediata de los recursos de la Cuenta Especial, ya que está a cargo del MIDUVI
        y no de la Unidad de Gestión del Programa.

    · Demora en el inicio de la ejecución del presupuesto de cada uno de los años fiscales, por cuanto el
        MIDUVI antes de proceder a la ejecución del presupuesto de cada ejercicio fiscal vigente, tiene que
        cerrar el ejercicio fiscal anterior y alimentar el presupuesto del nuevo año, lo que ha conllevado
        retrasos en la ejecución del presupuesto al inicio de cada año en promedio de tres meses.

La relación con el Banco Mundial, tanto con el Oficial del Proyecto como con el Departamento de
Desembolsos, se debe indicar que ha sido muy fluida y positiva. Los desembolsos han sido oportunos lo que
ha permitido una buena disponibilidad de recursos.

En cuanto a los recursos de contraparte local se debe señalar que se dispuso en forma oportuna.

Dentro de la ejecución de este Componente se ha contratado el desarrollo e implantación de los siguientes
sistemas:

    · GUBY PROY, sistema financiero que ha permitido el registro contable de todas las operaciones
        realizadas directamente por la UGP o a través de Ordenes de Pago realizadas al MIDUVI.

    · SIC, es un Sistema de Información Gerencial, el cual permite manejar información para                el
        seguimiento de la Ejecución del Programa en inversión rural, modelos de gestión y control financiero,
        obteniendo resúmenes ejecutivos y además acceder a la información por municipio y por provincias, el
        cual no fue alimentado con la información en forma oportuna, por cuanto la información generada en
        las Provincias tenia que ser remitida a la UGP PRAGUAS para que sea alimentada al Sistema, a lo
        señalado se suma que el Sistema no es amigable para el usuario y la información no fue alimentada
        tampoco por los responsables de los componentes en forma ágil.

    · SINSOC, este sistema de información social, que permite el registro de la información de líneas de
        base y diagnósticos comunitarios, tanto al inicio de las intervenciones del Programa que permiten
        medir impactos que se han logrado en la ejecución del Programa, en Agua y Saneamiento en las
        comunidades participantes. El Sistema no fue alimentado con la información de las líneas de bases de
        las Comunidades por las OITS, que eran las que levantaban la información, muchas de las
        informaciónes se remitieron totalizadas y no permitieron tener una mejor información, tampoco se
        introdujo por la UGP en forma rápida por cuanto el Sistema no prestaban estas facilidades, y fue
        necesario contratar con digitadores expertos en sistemas..

Durante la ejecución del Programa PRAGUAS FASE I, la UGP ha funcionado con el Coordinador General, el



                                                     69

Director Técnico, el Director Financiero Administrativo, cinco consultores especialistas,( Coordinador de
Inversión Rural, Coordinador de modelos de Gestión, Consultora Social, Analista Financiero, Contadora: tres
asistentes administrativas y personal de apoyo en servicios. Adicionalmente se contado con el soporte de un
Asesor en Procesos de Contrataciones .

No se contó con el Consultor en Monitoreo y Seguimiento, esta posición fue cambiada para atender
requerimientos del Subsecretario, lo cual fue aprobado por el Banco y el Proyecto careció del especialista en
Monitoreo y Seguimiento que se debió encargar de mantener el sistema SIG y SINSOC operativos, tampoco se
contó con el Coordinador en Fortalecimiento Institucional, encargándose parte de estas funciones al Director
Técnico, no se contrató al Asesor en intervención Social, Estos cambios pudieron ser evitados por el Banco y
las intervenciones del PRAGUAS pudieron ser mejoradas y tener un mayor control..

Esta organización establecida para el PRAGUAS I, para el PRAGUAS FASE II ha sido revisada, a fin de
incorporar un Director encargado fundamentalmente del Seguimiento y Evaluación del Programa y un
Coordinador de Adquisiciones.

La contratación de la firma encargada de realizar la auditoria a los Estados Financieros del Programa
PRAGUAS, estuvo a cago de la Contraloría General del Estado, quien contrató a la firma. BDO Sterm para
el ejercicio fiscal 2001 y la firma Pannell Kerr Forster por los ejercicios fiscales 2002, 2003 y 2004. Con la
firma Bermúdez & Asociados Cia. Ltda., se contrató la auditoria del ejercicio 2005 y 2006. Los Informes
presentados por las firmas han sido satisfactorios y en su momento fueron aprobados por la Contraloría y
enviados al Banco Mundial.

Finalmente hay que señalar que la falta en un control del compromiso presupuestario durante la ejecución del
Programa, ha llevado a que a la fecha de cierre, la UGP mantenga obligaciones con varios municipios por
planillas, que superan el millón de dólares, lo cual se dio por un manejo de Contabilidad no apropiado, en el
año 2004 se cambia al Contador, y se reemplaza por un Consultor con poca experiencia en las tareas de
contabilidad, lo cual fue aprobado por el Banco Mundial.

5. ADQUISICIONES

Se pone en le informe un capitulo sobe Adquisiciones por la importancia de la misma y por considerar que en
este tema se contó con dificultades que retrasaron los procesos y que también tuvieron incidencia en el sierre
del Programa.

Se encontró problemas en los procesos de contratación que fueron realizados mediante Licitación Publica
Nacional, por cuanto se dificultó los dictámenes de Ley que tenían que ser emitidos por la Contraloría General
del Estado, los cuales demoraron tiempos no programados o no fueron solicitadas conforme lo estipula la Ley.

Los procesos de contratación de ejecución de obras realizados por los Municipios, partiendo de un sorteo de la
lista de manifestación de interés que se recepto en la UGP, luego de convocatorias publicas, tubo resistencia de
aplicación de varios Municipios, por lo que se debe buscar un mecanismo de mayor participación y que no
involucre una calificación previa de la UGP.

Es importante señalar que los procesos que desarrollan los Municipios requieren de un mayor control, por lo
que se esta dando en la Fase II, la obligación a los CDF Consultoras de Diseño y Fiscalización la
responsabilidad de la preparación de los documentos de Pedido de Propuesta en base a los documentos
aprobados por el Banco Mundial, y la Capacitación en su manejo a los Equipos Municipales de Saneamiento
EMS y EPAS del MIDUVI. El proceso de veeduría ciudadana se lo encarga a los CIS para que capaciten a las
Comunidades en la revisión de que se de cumplimiento a los PP.

Se detecto también una falta de metodología de archivo de los procesos, tanto en los Municipios como en la
UGP, que dificulta la entrega de información oportuna para realizar el monitoreo interno, por lo cual se a
incorporado en el Manual Operativo del PRAGUAS Fase II una metodología y se señala las responsabilidades,
también se establece un área de Adquisiciones que es más operativa que el Asesoría.
