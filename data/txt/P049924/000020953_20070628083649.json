"Gray cover", "loan_no": "7035;P366", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Rural and Small Towns\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Praguas) in Ecuador\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: 1) The PRAGUAS project\n            validates the viability of the demand-responsive approach to\n            rural water supply to operate at scale at a national level\n            and to deliver significant infrastructure outcomes over a\n            five-year timeframe while involving rural beneficiaries in\n            project selection, planning and operation; 2) The water\n            supply and Sanitation (WSS) sector reform needs to move\n            beyond line ministries and sector agencies to include the\n            Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), since sustainable\n            sector reform requires the development of consistent\n            financial incentives and coherent financial policies; 3) It\n            is important to be realistic and acknowledge the fact that a\n            community-driven project such as PRAGUAS requires more time\n            to get acceptance from the community and start\n            implementation; 4) In unstable country environments, a\n            strong Project Management Unit (PMU) may be essential to\n            project success; 5) The financial scheme of PRAGUAS was\n            proven to be socially acceptable; 6) The on-site sanitation\n            alternative of a basic sanitation unit comprising shower,\n            sink and toilet (UBS) has proven to be an important success;\n            7) The combination of technical assistance and clear,\n            performance-based financial incentives for service\n            delegation were effective in creating autonomous operators\n            in a large number of municipalities; 8) Sustainability can\n            be enhanced by pre-selecting municipalities that have: (i) a\n            technical, social and financial team; (ii) municipal plans\n            that include WSS and watershed protection plans; and (iii) a\n            capable administrative/financial team; 9) Water Boards and\n            communities should be assisted in the formulation of Social\n            Plans that include community planning, tax payment,\n            assessment of natural resources, and management of water\n            sources; and 10) PRAGUAS' Operation Manual for\n            financial and technical operations, administration, social\n            control and auditing, should be disseminated more extensively."}, "docdt": "2007-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
