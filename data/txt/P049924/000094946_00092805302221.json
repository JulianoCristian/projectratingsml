program in Ecuador, through investments\n            in sustainable water, and sanitation services, focused on\n            alleviating the poorest populations in rural communities,\n            and small towns. Furthermore, improved policies will be\n            developed, particularly through the implementation of sector\n            reforms. The components call for: 1) sector reform, and\n            institutional development, supporting a major restructuring\n            of the Sub-Secretaria de Saneamiento Ambiental (SSA), to\n            enable the agency formulate sector policies, and set general\n            regulatory guidelines. Provision of technical assistance,\n            and training to municipalities, and sector institutions,\n            will enable SSA to define increased water, and sanitation\n            coverage, and, set up a sector information system. Further\n            training programs will be financed, which will allow\n            non-governmental organizations, and private providers assume\n            their roles in the new sector structure; 2) implementation\n            of subprojects in rural areas, financing engineering, and\n            infrastructure works in water and sanitation aspects, and,\n            providing management training to the community, as well as\n            health and hygiene education; and, 3) provision of\n            non-refundable grants, to finance engineering studies, and\n            civil works for water, and sanitation subprojects in\n            municipal capitals."}, "docdt": "2000-09-20T00:00:00Z"}
