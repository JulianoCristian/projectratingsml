"The Hadisolb Rehabilitation Project is a\n            major part of the first rehabilitation (Stage I) program of\n            HADISOB's steel making facilities. This Stage I program\n            is expected to raise the production level of the plant from\n            about 0.9 million tons per year (tpy) of liquid steel to\n            about 1.2 million tpy by 1987, mainly by removing technical\n            production bottlenecks but also through substantial\n            improvements in operation/maintenance practices and methods\n            needed for attainment of increased productivity. Under the\n            project, correction of serious deficiencies in present\n            operating practices and production methods is also expected\n            to result in substantial reductions in the cost of\n            production mainly through improved process control, higher\n            metallic yields, and reduced consumption of energy. The\n            equipment package consists of items for all major operating\n            centers and supporting services such as: raw material\n            handling, iron-making, steel-making, continuous casting,\n            rolling and utilities, including replacement of most\n            instruments and weighing equipment, installation of\n            pollution monitoring equipment, acquisition of computer\n            facilities and installation of energy saving equipment."}, "docdt": "1981-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
