including\n            (i) extending the community development process to a greater\n            number of communities and integrating the communal levels\n            into the process, resulting in an increase in the number of\n            community and local development plans; (ii) improving the\n            quality oft he community development process and related\n            activities; (iii) widening eligibility of projects to\n            include more environmental protection and conservation\n            activities; and (iv) increasing monitoring and evaluation\n            activities as well as operating costs and audits to cover\n            the additional implementation period of 19 months. The SSP\n            has been successful in delivering visible results on the\n            ground despite the political instability plaguing the\n            country in recent years. After almost two years of\n            implementation, the project is well on track to meeting its\n            development objectives."}, "docdt": "2006-11-09T00:00:00Z"}
