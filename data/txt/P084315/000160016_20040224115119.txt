A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
1. Country and sector issues
Comoros is emerging from several years o fpolitical turbulence resulting from an unstable
political environment since independence in 1975, a secession attempt by the island o f Anjouan
in 1997, and a string o fcoups d'Etat,including one in 1999. Representatives o fthe three islands
signed the Fomboni reconciliation agreement inFebruary 2001. The Accord provided for a new
Constitution, providing for regional, political and financial autonomy for each o fthe three
islands. Elections were heldto designate one President o fthe renamed "Union o f the Comoros"
and three Presidents at the island level. However, Comoros remainedpolitical crisis over
implementation o fthe accord and constitution. OnDecember 20,2003, a peace agreement
("Accord sur les Dispositions Transitoires aux Comores") was signed between the President o f
the Union o fthe Comoros and the three Presidento fthe autonomous islands. This agreement
came about as a result o f ajoint initiative o fPresidentMbeki o f South Africa, the Prime
Ministers o fMauritius and Madagascar, the acting French Minister for Cooperation, andthe
Secretary General o f the Organisation de la Francophonie all o f whom cosignedthe agreement.
The agreement sets out transitional measures for the division o f competencies between the Union
and the islands, inparticular customs administration andbudget execution.

In2002, percapita incomewas US$414, the same as in 1982making Comoros one o fthe
poorest nations inthe world. The population o fthe country is close to 550,000, with almost
290,000 people inGrand Comore, 230,000 inAnjouan and around 30,000 inMoheli. Poverty
was already pervasivebefore the crisis, with some 47 percent o f households (and more than 50
percent o f the population) livingbelow the poverty line. The economy i s predominantly rural and
foreign exchange earnings stem from exports o f cloves, vanilla, perfume essence (Ylang-ylang),
and remittances from the Comorian Diaspora- although the recipients o f these are mostly the
Grand Comorians. Poor governance and the ensuinginfrastructure constraints have prevented
Comoros from exploiting its economic potential to the full. As a result, living standards and per
capita income have mostly declined inthe past decade. Life expectancy stands at 60 years and
the infant mortality rate i s 76 per 1,000 births.Highrates o fmalnutrition among children, such
as the 43 percent rate o f chronic moderate malnutrition among children less than two years old,
and its effect on resistance to infectious diseases indicate that the mortality rate will continue to
behigh.Access to drinkingwater is still extremely low with continued threat o fcholera and
other diseases. Levels o f education and health are low despite the fact that many Comorians
invest remittance funds inprivate or religious social services.

Social service delivery continues to be dismal and many people depend on remittances to pay for
private sector alternatives. Opportunities to acquire wealth through formal sector activities are
very limited. (Annex 1 contains more information on social indicators).

A povertyperception survey was undertaken bythe Government in2002 on each island. The
table above shows some o fthe key findings, namelythat water, education, health, sanitation are
all perceived as failing the Comorian population, particularly on Moheli and Anjouan.

Entrenchedpoor governance, as a result o frepeated cycles o fpolitical crisis and instability, weak
capacity o fpublic institutions, and limitedscope for public dialogue on policy or participation in
civic life characterize Comoros as a L o w Income Country Under Stress (LICUS) '. InLICUS
countries such as Comoros, conventional channels o f government provision o fbasic social
services have broken down, with bothweak political accountability for policies and performance
as well as technical and institutional weaknesses inpublic service providers. Attemptingto
increase the flow o f finance through these channels is unlikely to be effective, and there is little
immediate prospect o f significant institutional improvement. Insuch situations, the use o f
"altemative" and nongovernmental channels are often the only source for the provision o f much-
needed heath, education, and other basic services inthe short-term. Moreover, they can
demonstrate more effective and efficient service provision as well as buildbottom-up demand
for end-user accountability and increased client "voice."

2. Rationale for Bank involvement
Through a broad-based project to address the most urgent needs, Bank involvement inComoros
seeks to maintain service provision for the population inthe absence o f a functioning
governmental structure and a decrease indonor support. Experience inother countries shows
that the combination o f extreme levels o fpoverty, an institutional vacuum resulting inlack o f
effective action on the part o f the state, and highunemployment make for a precarious situation
and could potentially exacerbate the existing instability.

The Bank is one of the few donors inComoros and coordinates closely with the other
development partners, namely the Agence Franqaise de Dkveloppement (AFD), the European
Union (EU), InternationalFundfor Agricultural Development (IFAD), UnitedNations
Development Programme (UNDP), UnitedNations Children's Fund(UNICEF), UnitedNations
Population Fund(UNFPA), World Health Organization (WHO), and the InternationalMonetary
Fund(IMF). The continuingpolitical instability, institutional fragility, andweak capacity has
greatly affected donor support. All donors are scaling down their support and have agreed to
limit their financial assistance as much aspossible and to systematically exploit synergies
between their respective programs. AFD has scaled back to small grant projects being
implementedby non-governmental agencies. A rural water project i s under preparation which
will target 36 villages inAnjouan, for a total o f 1.5 million Euros ingrant financing from AFD.

basis, primary and secondary education and vocational training. Inprimary and secondary
education, the emphasis would be on training o f teachers, school officials and inspectors. In
addition, the project would finance equipment, books, teaching and leaming materials, furniture
and selective rehabilitation of a few secondary schools. Inthe area o ftechnical and vocational
training, the project would support the creation o f technical streams to provide a qualified labor
force. Capacity buildingwould be provided to enhance the management of the education system
and support the national information system. The EUproject would also support the
Government inupdating the "Carte scolaire". The scope o fthe Services Support Project has been
closely coordinated with the EUto ensure complementarity o f financing and to prevent
duplication o f efforts, especially on rehabilitation and construction o f classrooms, and education
and training sites.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes
InMay 2003, the Government finalized its InterimPovertyReduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP)
and validated it through regional and national workshops. The document describes the political,
social and economic context o f Comoros, and outlines the evolution o fthe country's
macroeconomic policies, the poverty profile, including perceptions o fpoverty by the population
and an analysis of the sectoral dimensions o fpoverty and growth potential. The I-PRSP has five
main strategic objectives for economic growth andpoverty alleviation, namely (i)       creating the
conditions for sustainable economic development; (ii)     fostering private sector development; (iii)
promoting agricultural development; (iv) reinforcing governance, justice and security; and (v)
focusing on social services and social service delivery. However, the I-PRSP was written ina
difficult political context.

The Bank i s currently preparing a Transitional Support Strategy Update (TSSU) for Comoros for
the next 18 to 24 months. Based on the LICUS principles o f engagement and lessons o fthe 2004
World Development Report, the Bank will support the Comoros with a strategy which responds
to the country's difficult institutional and governance environment. Underthe strategy, this
project is the main instrument being proposed for Bank support and i s intended to cover the basic
needs o f the population, who are among the world's poorest andmost vulnerable. The proposed
project therefore tries to address the key needs inComoros that are not being covered by the
Government inits current circumstances or other partners, andwhere the Bank has a
comparative advantage. It aims at addressing urgent service delivery needs and prevention o f
further degradation o fexisting infrastructure.

Insupport ofthe TSSU, the proposedproject also prioritizes upwardpressure for increased
accountability, which will be introducedthrough incorporating community-based development
planning, participatorymonitoring and evaluation, as well as community financing. Select
municipalities will be included incommunity capacity-building initiatives andprovided with
incentives to respond to community needs via pro-citizen and downwardly accountable
processes. Local transparency will also be supported through the use o fthe media and NGOs as
independentmonitors on diverse aspects o fthe project.

InJuly 2003, the Infrastructure, Water andEnvironment (IWE) project was closed as it had
become impossibleto implement inthe current circumstances. However, it was agreed that the




                                                   3

proposedproject support urban water supply in selected areas on Anjouan and Moheli, as the
Comorian authorities deemed this to be critical for the well-being o fthe population.

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. Lendinginstrument
The lendinginstrument for the proposed Services Support Project (SSP) i s an investment credit.
Giventhat the Bank strategy only envisages one lendinginstrumentfor the period o fthe TSSU, a
multi-sectoral investment credit was deemedthe best approach. Moreover, the altemative for the
implementation o f community development activities would be to use the various line ministries
to implement small-scale projects. However, given the weak institutional capacity inthe
execution o f other keyprograms, this would not likely to be successful. Inthe political context
o f the recent years, the existingSocial FundProject is the only one that has continued to be
implementedrelatively well inlarge part due to the autonomy o f the project management entity,
the Fonds d'Appui au De'veloppement Communautaire (FADC). Therefore, working with FADC,
with its proventrack record andexcellent performance, appears to bethe best placed
organization to manage the proposedproject.

The objectives o fthe project are to (i) maintainbasic social and economic infrastructure for a
significant number o f disadvantaged communities and specific vulnerable groups; and (ii)
contribute to buildingthe basic capacity o f communities and local actors to conduct a local
development process. The success ofthe outcome o fthe project interms o f maintainingbasic
social and economic services will be measured by (i)      number o f students who attend school in
new or rehabilitated project schools and classrooms; and (ii) o fpersons insubproject
                                                                  number
areas benefiting from a reduction intransport time and cost. With respect to buildingcapacity,
the project will measure the number o f communities with development plans meeting
participatory process criteria.

Results indicators by component are as follows:

         Community-based Sub-projects: (i)    number o f completedhehabilitated small-scale
         infrastructure project (by island, per type o f sub-project); (ii)
                                                                         numbero fcommunities
         benefiting from at least one subproject; and (iii) numbero fcommunitieswho havenever

    e) Project Monitoringand Evaluation, and Audits: (i)     base-line and annual surveys
        completed and data entered into the information management system; (ii)     participatory
        community-based M&E system created and operational; (iii)       annual technical and
        financial audits undertaken; and (iv) operating costs o fproject do not exceed 15 percent
        of total project.
Details o f the target values for indicators to be used to measure progress under each component
are located inAnnex 3.

Both of these objectives are directly linked to the objectives of the Bank's TSSUnamely, (i)
supporting and maintainingthe delivery o f social services, while fostering accountable local
processes through community-based activities, and (ii)     empowering civil society.

4. Projectcomponents
The proposed credit will support financing for:
1) Community-basedSubprojects:this component would continue to finance small-scale social
and economic sub-projects identifiedby communities, including classrooms and schools, health
posts, small scale water supply and sanitation, and feeder roads.

2) Capacity Building:this component would support capacity buildingand social capital
formation for communities, including information and education campaigns; related strategic
capacity buildingfor civil society; and capacity buildingo f FADC and various stakeholders. By
the end o f the project, it i s expected that targeted communities would have developed a
community-based development plan through participatory planningprocesses.

3) Health Services: The technical capacity o f selected medical personnel in Comoros will be
strengthened through training inspecialized fields and through the acquisition o f critical medical
equipment.

4) UrbanWater Supply: these activities were already identified underthe IWE project and
include rehabilitation and extension o fwater supply inthree towns inAnjouan and two towns in
Moheli. This component would also finance capacity buildingo fwater management committees
and Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns on water management,
sanitation and hygiene.

5) ProjectMonitoring& Evaluation(M&E), andAudits: FADC operating costs and technical
assistance to undertakethe audits are included under this component and it i s expected that the
project will be successfully implementedina cost effective and decentralized manner. In
addition, this component would support M&E activities, including movingbeyond monitoring o f
project outputs to undertake an impact assessment o f the community-based activities over the life
ofthe project. A number o f additional activities will also be supported to promote local
accountability and improved long-term development outcomes: participatory monitoring and
evaluation bybeneficiary communities with facilitation from trained local NGOs, and a program
of external monitoringby the media.

5. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
This project builds on the successful results and lessons learned from the ongoing Social Fund
Project, and other social funds as well as the Bank's operations inComoros. These lessons
include the importance of: (i)  the autonomy o fthe FADC; (ii)    increased decentralizationo fthe
regional offices and strengthening o f their capacity to make decisions; (iii)  coordination with line
ministries and other donor projects; and (iv) continuing to fine-tune participatory and transparent
approaches inall stages o fthe sub-project cycle to improve sustainable impact on vulnerable
groups.

The project also builds on the implementation difficulties experienced by various sectoral
projects, including the recently closed IWE project. Many development projects inComoros
have suffered from the political and institutional changes, particularly the variations in
ministerial set-up between the Union and the three islands. Therefore, a number o fprojects have
been rated unsatisfactory with capacity constraints, institutional instability and poor governance
stated as the causes o fpoor project outcomes. The main lesson learned thus is that the
Government has limitedimplementation capacity and, therefore, a limited ability to get results
on the ground as opposed to entities outside the Government which are more efficient and
dynamic. This is the main impetusfor the project to deal directly with village committees,
community groups, and NGOs.However, even when projects are generally successful in
achieving its development objectives, inthe longrun, there may be reduced impact when service
delivery is left to the public sector. Inthe case o fthe healthproject, where it was marginally
successful inits objectives, there has been little impact on the health o f the population and
especially o f the poor, because o f serious dysfunction inthe public health system (de facto
privatization o fpublic health services, very highcost o fmedicines, bednets and services, as well
as preventive measures for end-users).

Another key lesson is the critical need for targetingpoorer communities, and vulnerable groups
within communities. Linkedto this is the importance o f a strong monitoring and evaluation
system, that is based on participation, reliable sources o f data, and good analysis to ensure that
project activities are analyzed interms o f sustainable impact and adjusted inresponse to
monitoring outcomes.

The ongoing Social Fundproject seems to be one o fthe few projects that has performed
relatively well, mainly because o f its decentralized institutional set-up, including the autonomy
and independence o f the FADC project management unit andrelated implementation entities.
Given the lack o f other fully functioning organizations, the FADC will be used to manage the
SSP, contracting out project activities beyond the scope o fthe project unit to private firms and
other partners.

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The alternative for the implementation o fproject activities would be to use the various line
ministries to implement community small-scale projects. This alternative was rejectedbecause
the Ministries o f Education, Health, and Public Works, among others, are not geared to focus on
community development activities which have the highest impact in Comoros. Inaddition, it
was thought that political and fiscal pressures would have an adverse impact on project
objectives ifone were to judge from the Government's track record inthe execution o f other key



                                                   6

programs, coupled with the fact that civil servants were unmotivated due to the irregular
payment o f salaries with many months inarrears. Communities on the contrary had shown their
commitment, seriousness, and interest intheir development. The recent secession crisis and
subsequentpolitical events have shown that the decision made to work with FADC was a sound
one. Inthe turmoil o f the last few years, the Social FundProject is the only one that has
continued to be implemented relatively well; incontrast, the IWE project could not get o f fthe
ground, in great part because o f the lack o f agreement over the responsibilities o f the various
Ministries at the level o f the Union o fthe Comoros and at the level o fthe Government o f each
island. Therefore, working with FADC, with its proven track record and excellent performance,
appears to be the best approach to managing the proposed project inthis complex environment.

C. IMPLEMENTATION
1. Partnershiparrangements
Giventhe small numbero f donors involved inthe Comoros, the project was developed taking
into account partner activities, including AFD, EU, UNDP, IFAD,UNICEF, etc. The SSP,
through its community-based activities component, will support education related infrastructure.
These will be complemented by the EUfinancing to support the national education sector and
improve the quality o f education inthe Comoros. The project will also coordinate closely with
AFD onwater supply activities.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements
The overall responsibility for monitoring and coordination o fproject activities andmanaging the
credit funds will rest with the Fonds d'Appui au De'veloppement Communautaire (FADC), an
organization with 10years o f experience and an excellent track record, headedby a National
Executive Director. The National Executive Secretariat (Secretariat Exe'cutlfNational - SEN)
andthe three Regional Executive Secretariats (Secretariat Exe'cutifRegionaZ - SER) are the
administrative and executing entities responsible for dealing with the day-to-day operations o f
FADC on the three islands. This National Director will be assisted by three Regional Directors
and four managers respectively incharge o f operations, financial management, monitoring and
evaluation, and capacity buildingand communication. The SENwill be responsible for program
management including: i)coordination and implementation o f the program; ii)consolidation o f
the work programs and budgets; iii)maintenance o f records and accounts for all transactions
relatedto national office; iv) preparation and production o f consolidated annual financial
statements and quarterly financial monitoring reports (FMRs); v) contracting out o furban water
supply activities; vi) management o f disbursements and replenishment applications for the
relevant special accounts; and vii) monitoring and evaluation o f the various activities supported
underthe project. The SER will manage disbursementsfrom the sub-special accounts, maintain
records and accounts for all transactions related to SER, andprepare financial and other basic
information on project management and monitoring as required by the SEN.

Inorder to meet efficiently the challenges ofthenewprogram, the organizational structure and
financial management system o f FADC will be reviewed and strengthened with a view to: i)
improving internal controls; ii)ensuringtimely production o freliable information; iii)
developing an effective planning and monitoring system at all levels to ensure timely delivery o f
information on the project activities, collection o f data, processing o f information and
communication to both central and regional levels; and iv) assisting regional staff indeveloping

their skills. Annex 7 includes a table that provides relevant measures to address main
deficiencies identifiedinthe FADC financial management system. This annex also includes
further details on the financial management and disbursement arrangements. An assessment o f
country procurement regulations and FADC capacity to carry out procurement was also carried
out, the details o f which are contained inAnnex 8. The overall procurement risk assessment is
rated high.Therefore, the capacity o f existing procurement staff will be strengthened to improve
their effectiveness. Moreover, transparency o fprocurement o fgoods and equipment will be
increased by usingUNAgencies, such as IAPSO and UNICEF.

Inaddition to these measures, aninstitutional assessmentwas camed out underthe Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) to detail further recommendations for capacity buildingo fthe FADC
and its partners. The experience built by the previous social fund provides a strong foundation
for the institutional set-up requiredto implement the community-based activities o f the new
project. The strengths and weaknesses o f FADC were evaluated keepinginmindthe necessary
prerequisites to achieve the objectives o f the new project. The results are as follows.

The SEN needs to strengthen its capacity to coordinate, supervise and monitor implementation o f
project activities and ensure adequate financial and procurement management. To do so, the
assessment recommended the creation o f a new operational unit inthe FADC SEN that would be
responsible for (i)  establishing a methodological approach to project preparation and formulation
that meets project objectives, and (ii) introducing a quality control process within the institution.
The unit would also closely coordinate procurement to ensure timely implementation o f
activities. A social and environmental specialist should be recruitedto strengthen the SEN and
SER capabilities inthese areas. A Director o f Finance was recruitedto strengthen the overall
management o f financing and accounting functions. The newly created department for
monitoring and evaluation should also develop the capacity to oversee andproduce evaluation
reports on the overall implementation process.

The SER will have increased operational responsibilities to ensure that the project activities are
developed and implemented according to procedures. They will have an active role in
identifying, mobilizing and reinforcing target communities and groups, as well as inpromoting
andpreparingsub-projects that meet the target groups' needs. As a whole, there will be a small
increase inthe numbero f staff at the SEN level while staff levels at the SER will remain the
same. With respect to the SER, the principal changes pertain to thejob descriptions o f existing
staff. Inthe SEN, one staff memberhas been recruited (Director o f Finance) and two additional
staffmembers will be recruited (operations and social & environment) to develop adequate
managerial and coordination capabilities.

Strengtheningo fthe capacity o fthe SENwill require support in:(i)     establishingthe approach for
the design, preparation and monitoring ofthe sub-projects to incorporate social, economic and
environmental dimensions; (ii)    defining a quality control approach adapted to the needs o f the
SENand the SER; and (iii)     revising andmaking operationalthe software for financing,
procurement, monitoring and evaluation. The SENstaff will be responsible for providing
training and field support to the SER staffto develop their capacity in:implementingthe new
operational approaches, including transparent decision-making and criteria for selecting sub-




                                                   8

projects for support; monitoring and evaluationtasks; and accounting and procurement,
including the use o f the new software.

Finally, the FADC will contract out certain activities, such as the urbanwater supply component,
with FADC acting as a delegated contract manager. All contracts for works and goods will be
procured under Intemational Competitive Bidding (ICB) inaccordance with the Bank's
guidelines, and the recruitment o f consulting firms for studies and supervisionwill be carried out
underthe Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method inaccordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Annex 6 lays out the detailed institutional and implementation arrangements for the
project.

3. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of outcomes/results
General progress o f the project will be measured against a list o fkey indicators and tentative
targets, which are included inthe Results Framework and Monitoring(Annex 3). M&E o f some
o f those indicators will be conducted through specific surveys and beneficiary assessments.
Monitoring procedures and project progress reports will focus on progress in, and impacts o f the
implementation o fthe project, measured against specific targets and actions set inthe detailed
implementationprograms, all o f which will be reviewed andrevised each year throughout the
project life. Project monitoring activities will be overseen by the FADC, and certain elements
may be contracted to NGOs andjournalists. For example, the project will buildthe capacity o f
local NGOsto facilitate a participatory monitoring and evaluation system, inwhich village
committees select the performance and impact indicators that are relevant and important for them
and their sub-projects and then carry out monitoring activities. Data from the participatory M&E
program will feed into FADC's larger process monitoring and evaluation program.

The FADC will prepare work programs and budgets for the next year, to be discussed with IDA
at the annual project implementation review that will take place no later than August 30 o f each
year. As is now beingdone under the ongoing project, the SER inthe three islands will
undertake on-site visits to monitor sub-project progress, including beneficiary contributions,
quality o fworks, impact assessments, and proposedmaintenance arrangements. This
information i s transmitted monthlyto the SEN which compiles the data from all three islands,
reviews it for consistency, and submits it to the Comitb Centrale de Coordination (CCC) and to
IDA. This information is used to improve the efficiency o fproject activities. A midterm review
o fthe Project will be carried out in accordance with terms o f reference and monitoring indicators
acceptable to IDA around 24 months after the effectiveness o f the project.

M&E is one o fthe FADC's weak points identified under the previous project. To help strengthen
the FADC's capacity, a national M&E officer was recruited and participatedina series o f
training events, including on the modalities o f impact evaluation, strengtheningmonitoring
systems and the measurement o f outcomes. To enhance transparency, the project intends to use
external auditors as well as the external monitoring activities mentioned above to assess the
quality and participatory nature o f its relationship with targeted communities. Therefore, the
M&Esub component underthe project is expected to help (i)        strengthen the overall MIS system
o f the project and the capacity o f FADC staff; (ii) promote transparency and community and
NGOparticipationinmonitoring and evaluation activities throughout the project cycle; (iii)
ensure collection o fmore reliable data; and (iv) translate lessons leamed into projects
improvements.

  4. Sustainability
  Sustainability is a significant challenge inthe current country context and inadequate
  institutional conditions. The Services Support Project has beendesigned to provide bridging
  untilComoros achieves a certain level o fpolitical andinstitutional stability. However, despite
  the overall obstacles, the project features a number o f measures to attempt to contribute to both
 the overall institutional sustainability o fproject investments, and the sustainability o fthe sub-
 project.

  Onthe institutional site, recommendations o fthe Quality o f SupervisionReport o fthe on-going
  Social Fundproject (activities o fwhich will be picked up underthe SSP) were the need to (i)
  continue to develop the institutional capacity the FADC to effectively oversee and guide
 community activities, and (ii)   provide continued effective supervisionby the Bank.
  Sustainability depends largely on the ability o f the FADC to maintain the professional and legal
 integrity o f its processes against the threat o f political interference. The overall institutional set-
 upunderthe newproject hasbeen strengthened to ensure autonomy andindependence.
  On the sub-project side, the project will lay the foundation for an inclusive, participatory
  community planning process. The sustainability o f FADC's community sub-projects will be
  achieved by ensuringmaximum community involvement (including financial or in-kind
 contributions) at all stages o fthe project cycle (fi-om identification, to execution o f the works, to
 operations and maintenance). Experience shows that (i)          the higher the community contribution,
 the more compelled the community will feel to ensure proper operation and maintenance due to
 their substantial up-fi-ont investment; (ii) more the beneficiary communities feel accountable
                                              the
  and involved inthe decision-making process (from design to supervision, etc.) the more the
 community feels ownership o f the project, and therefore beneficiaries are more willing to
 contribute actively inmaintaining and sustaining the social infrastructures (school, health
  centers/clinics, water fountains and roads). Inaddition, the project will finance hands-on training
 programs for the village committees and user associations on routine preventive maintenance
  activities. Overall, these subprojects promote the emergence o f accountable processes at the
  local level, and the fostering o f conditions for favorable change inthe governance environment
 which are hoped for inthe long-term. On the urban water supply, user fees will be collected to
 help pay for water services and maintenance. This will also foster partnerships between the water
 management committees involved.




Continuing- and/or new political          IThe Bank    will continue to monitor the political             S
tensions interfere with project            situation and closely supervise implementation o f
implementation.                            project, which must be undertaken inaccordance
                                           with the Manual o fProcedures and the project's
                                           annual operational plans. Project structures have
                                           also been strengthened to ensure autonomy and
                                           external monitoring processes have been added.

                                        Moreover, a phased approach is beingusedfor
                                        various activities, with those activities outside the

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economic and financial analyses
With regard to the community-basedactivities component, since FADC's financing for these
sub-projects is demand-driven, it i s difficult to determine apriori the composition o fFADC's
portfolio, and an estimated rate o fretum has not been estimated. It i s hoped that the cost
effectiveness o f subprojects would increase with the introduction o f direct community
contracting. F A D C will continue to maximize the social rate o f return o f its portfolio through
mechanisms and policies to ensure that the poor are reached, that criteria will be applied to each
sub-project to ensure that the most cost-effective investments are made, andthat FADC's costs
do not exceed 15 percent o fthe Credit amount. FADC will be usingdetailed technical criteria,
standard design and simple economic criteria, such as cost per beneficiary calculations, to
determine sub-project economic viability. A list o f unit costs bytype o f sub-project andby
island will be preparedand will be updated annually (based on actual figures from the previous
year).

For the urban water supply component, the ERRrange from about 20-27 percent inOuani and
Mutsamudu and 5-7 percent inDomoni, Fomboni and Djoezi, assuming that households are
willingto pay 4.5 percent o ftheir income for water. These figures are based on assumptions o f
households' willingness to pay and do not include potential benefits from improved health o f
users, which i s potentially significant given frequent outbreaks o f cholera and typhoid especially
inAnjouan. Improvedwater system management which reduces water losseswill improvewater
resource management overall and delay the need for major new investments inthe sector.

2. Technical
The project i s technically sound. The project's technical design is based on the use o f simple,
appropriate technologies, corresponding to the needs and capabilities (for construction, as well as
operation and maintenance) of the population. It reflects generally accepted technical standards
and operating practices appropriate to the respective sectors. Investment costs for the project are
based on prevailing market unit costs, with appropriate allowance for price andphysical
contingencies. The design o f the community sub-projects will be based on the norms and
standards o f the technical ministries involved. Labor intensive work will be preferred whenever
proven as technically and economically efficient and insofar as it generates employment
opportunities. Innovations, such as community participation and financing, are based on sound
technical, financial and economic considerations.

There has been a number o f rather favorable technical audits o f FADC's operations duringthe



                                                   12

last ten years. The latest one, inAugust 2002, stated that FADC was operating in accordance
with its Manual ofProcedures and that, on the whole, works were o f good quality. It also
confirmed that village committees had been established inalmost all the villages, were familiar
with the FADC approach and had hllownership o fthe sub-projects, critical for their operation
and maintenance. The audit recommended that the Manual o f Procedures be updated and made
some suggestions regarding training and capacity building, quality o fthe works, sub-project
maintenance, etc., all o f which have been taken into account inthe design o f the new operation.
Inparticular, the training ofsmall andmicro enterprises andlocal consultingfirms willbe
pursuedmore aggressively under the proposed project.

3. Fiduciary
The FADC financial management arrangements havebeenreviewed duringthe pre-appraisal
stage inorder to determine whether they are acceptable with regard to IDA requirements. The
project's financial management system does not satisfy the Bank's minimumrequirements and
cannot yet produce FMRs for monitoringproject activities. This review identified a number o f
deficiencies and recommended appropriate corrective actions to address them. The main
measures taken were the following: i)review o f the project organizational structure to establish a
clear definition o f responsibilities, ensure appropriate segregation o f duties, andprovide an
overall framework for planning, coordinating, and controlling project operations; ii)recruitment
of an adequate number o f qualified and trained accounting staff including a Director o f Finance
and four (4) accountants for both central and regional levels; iii)update o f the accounting manual
of procedures to include new organizational structure, descriptions and flowcharts o f the project
accounting and budgetingsystems, chart o f accounts, and operating instructions for proper
record keeping and safeguarding assets; iv) implementation o f an effective budgeting system
tracking variances between actual and plannedcosts and taking appropriate corrective action at
the proper management level; v) review o f the current accounting software to satisfy project
requirements and ensure timely production o f financial statements and FMRs; andvi)
recruitment o f an internal auditor to enhance project internal controls and address areas o f
concern identified duringproject implementation.

The project financial statements will be audited annually by independentand qualified auditors
acceptable to IDA, in accordance with International Standards o f Auditing. The auditors should
be recruited prior to project effectiveness. The audit report will be submitted to IDA not later
than six (6) months after the end o f each fiscal year. The content and formats o f financial
statements and FMRswill be agreed at negotiations. It i s important to mention that no significant
problems have beenencountered interms o f audit covenants: all Bank-financed projects in
Comoros, including FADC, have always submittedtheir audit reports indue time.

The agency capacity assessment for handlingprocurement activity outcome showed that
procurement units for the central and at each regional office level need to be strengthened by
recruiting a chiefprocurement officer and providing specific training addressing new features o f
the manual and frequent questions on bidding document and evaluation report forms.

4. Social
With regardto community-based activities, there are no major social issues. The proposed
project will strengthencommunity development inComoros andprovide infrastructure to benefit



                                                  13

the entire population o fvillages. The cash wages to be paid to temporary labor, and the cash
generated by the operation o fproductive infrastructure, will also have an important social impact
incommunities with limited revenues. This is confirmedbythe results o fa beneficiary
assessment which shows that beneficiaries think very highly o f FADC since it has been able to
deliver things which it had promised. Village committees have expressed an interest inmore
training for the preparation o fbetter project requests, and on project management and
maintenance issues. Project design has taken into account these beneficiary concerns.

Nonetheless, as with all community-driven programs, there is a risk o f elite capture at the local
level. Comoros has little experience and capacity inthe transparent, participatory, and
accountable local development processes which are at the core o f the project. This risk will be
mitigated through a social assessment prior to launching the project which will inform project
design as well as dedicated resources to community capacity building and monitoring and
evaluation, including the incorporation o f external monitoringmechanisms.

The social assessment also showed that, for the urbanwater supplies, cost recovery from water
users will not come easily given that they havebeen usedto unsafewater. Involvingusers in
selecting service levels will be essential to ensure that communities feel ownership of their water
systems. A public information campaign to raise awareness o f the benefits o f clean and
convenient water and the needto pay for the services will also help inconvincing consumers to
accept tariffs.

5. Environment
Underthe existing Social Fundproject, at the recommendation o f a Bank environmental
specialist, the FADC began to include inthe designof sub-projects and related contracts,
measures to mitigate or offset environmental impacts o fthe sub-projects, such as: (i)  for roads:
choice o f the most appropriate alignment; reforestationandprotection o fvegetation next to the
road; and rehabilitation o fborrow pits; (ii) for water supply: safety perimeters and fences around
wells and water pumps; (iii) health centers: training o fpersonnel inthe management o f
                               for
medical waste, and construction o f an incinerator; and (iv) for schools: planting of trees.

Those mitigation measures have been taken into account inthe design o fthe project. Some o f
those measures could be done by the communities themselves, and be counted as their
contribution to the sub-project cost. Inaddition, FADC will continue to take advantage o f the
excellent relations that it has established with village committees and the population to make the
communities aware o f the disastrous consequences o f deforestation and other actions that
contribute to the destruction o f the environment.

The urbanwater supply involves rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and extension o f urban
water works. Contractors will be asked to specify intheir bids their plans to address
environmentalissues during construction, and those plans will be included inthe final contracts.

6. Safeguardpolicies
The project is classified as a B for environmental issues and S2 for safeguard classification.
Interms ofsafeguardpolicies, the Environmental Assessment will betriggered since the project
will support construction and rehabilitation community-based infrastructure through a

participatory project with the potential o f localized environmental and social impacts albeit
minor. Additionally, resettlement may be triggered ifland acquisition i s involved.

As aresult, an Environmental and Social ManagementFramework and aResettlement Policy
Framework have been prepared and were disclosed on December 3,2003. They were also
disseminated in Comoros through a series o fworkshops on each island and be permanently
located instrategic places inComoros where they can be accessedby the interested parties and
beneficiaries. The objectives o f these documents are to (i) the environmental and social
                                                             assess
impacts o fthe expected sub-projects; (ii)  outline environmental management procedure and
provide the requisite tools, including a screening process with sub-project assessment forms and
guidelines for mitigating impacts; and (iii)  integrate environmental considerations into each
phase o fthe sub-project cycle. Both frameworks and their screening processes will be
incorporatedinthe project's manual o fprocedures. More details on these documents are located
inAnnex 10.

Although the Government o f Comoros has limited institutional capacity, the FADC has a proven
track record. Measures are, nonetheless, are being included inthe project to strengthen FADC's
capacity, specifically inenvironmental assessment o fpotential impacts. An environmental and
social specialist will be hiredby the project to ensure that the environmental and social
mitigation measures are actually camed out for individual sub-projects. Moreover, a
comprehensive Awareness BuildingProgramwill be prepared and camed out by the
environmental and social specialist incollaboration with the Department o f Environment and
other relevant governmental institutions.

Workshops and consultations were held on each island duringpre-appraisal to discuss the
potential environmental and social impacts and to outline the importance o f the project
incorporatingmitigating measures into sub-project design. Inaddition, the manual o fprocedures
dictates that stakeholders be consulted duringthe screening process undertakenduringsub-
project identification and selection.

                      Annex 1: Country and Sector or Program Background
                              COMOROS: Services Support Project

The Union o f the Comoros i s made up o fthree islands-Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli.
The population o f the country i s around 550,000, o f which approximately 50 percent live in
Grande Comore, 42 percent inAnjouan, and eight percent inMoheli. Comoros i s one o f the
poorest nation's inthe world-per     capita income i s estimated at $414 in2002, down from about
$520 inthe late 1980s. The Comorian Diaspora comprise 20-25 percent o f the total population,
who mainly live inFrance, and contribute substantially to the economy and society o f Comoros.
The population is almost exclusively Muslim.

Political Context

The islands gained independence in 1975 but has since been entrenched inpolitical turbulence,
and a string o f coups d 'Etats and coup attempts. In 1997,conditions deteriorated further when
the military rulers o f Anjouan attempted to secede from the country, completely isolating their
island. Internal disputes arose inAnjouan causing outbreaks o f violence. Meanwhile,
negotiations and attempts to forcibly re-integrate Anjouan failed. This, inturn, generated
tensions on the island of Grande Comore, leading to the overthrow o fthe central government in
March 1999. InFebruary 2001, a Framework Agreement for National Reconciliationwas signed
inFomboni (Moheli) byrepresentatives ofthe Government and oppositioninall three islands.
This agreement outlined a roadmap for reunification and democratization o f the country, with a
transition period, a referendum on a new constitution, a government o fnational unityand
elections inearly 2002. The new constitution was adopted ina referendum, andpresidents were
elected for the Union o f the Comoros and for each o f the three islands.

The new agreement signed on December 20, 2003 govems the division o f competencies between
the Union and the islands, inparticular customs administration and budget execution, and calls
for legislative elections for the Union and the islands inApril 2004. The agreement calls for a
heavy involvement and support from the donor community to increase the likelihood o f success.
Executive power is barely constrained by a weak and non-independent judiciary and fragmented
political opposition. Due to the failure to reach agreement on the respective powers o f the Union
andIslands, legislative elections have been repeatedlypostponed, andthere are resource
bottlenecks and disputes over civil service competencies. Village and family based loyalties and
traditional power structures (dominated by religious leaders and `notables' who gain their status
through age, wealth, and the grand mariage 'tradition) hold sway over fledgling modem civic
organizations. The relatively few NGOs and civil society organizations face restricted capacity
and independence.

Islands are divided intoprefectures which have no significant power or budget, and on the lower
levels o f administration inGrande Comore's villages, an institutional void faces the strong
traditional power o fthe nobility. The Government plans to set up municipalities (communes) that
would cover several villages and be runby an elected mayor. Communes have been created in
Anjouan, with 30 mayors being elected at commune level in2000, and ina few towns o f Grande
Comore. Inthe latter, ten mayors inurban areas have been appointed by `representative councils7
consisting o f some elected membersplus other representatives o f social groups (`notables ',



                                                  16

women and youth). Many o f these newly established mayors remain largely upwardly
accountable or orientated towards the interests o f traditional local elites.

Governance

Inthe LICUS schema, Comoros displays the characteristics ofentrenched poor governance,
including repeated cycles o fpolitical crisis and instability, limitedscope for public dialogue on
policy or participation incivic life, and weak capacity o fpublic institutions. Comoros qualifies
as a "no voice" country as per the Bank's analysis o f LICUS typologies, falling below IDA
benchmarks on Freedom House civil and political liberties and a composite o f CPIA governance
scores on property rights and governance; and transparency, accountability and corruption in
public sector2. Other indexes show that Comoros compares poorly to the regional average on 5
out o f 6 measures o f governance3.

Economic Background

The economy i s predominantly rural and agricultural with agriculture accounting for 40 percent
o f GDP and beingthe primary source o f a livelihood for around 75 percent o f the population.
Services, mostly commerce and public administration, contribute around 49 percent, while
construction andmanufacturing represents 11percent. The industrial sector i s limitedto the
processingo f agricultural export crops and a few consumer goods supplyingthe domestic
market. Agricultural activities are concentrated on the production o f food crops as well as on the
three main export commodities (vanilla, cloves, ylang-ylang and perfume essence), accounting
for 90 percent o f total export earnings in2002. Comoros imports rice, meat, sugar, wheat
powder, and dairy products. In 2001, import o f food commodities accounted for US$17 million
(28 percent o f total imports), and rice import was 11percent o f total imports. Because o f its
predominance inthe economy, the agricultural sector will likely remain the foundation o f the
Comoros' growth inthe foreseeable future. The continuing political crisis, falling donor support
combined with a deterioration o fterms o ftrade will result inmodest GDP growth at 2.5 percent.

Comoros i s among the leading countries inthe world interms o fremittancesper capita and the
share o f remittances intotal exports. However, remittanceshave not yet been successfully
tapped for income generating activities, andhave mainly fundedprivate housing inan inefficient
manner, and for financing traditional mamage ceremonies (grads mariages).

Since independence, Comoros has experienced growing debt rather than economic growth, even
though most o f the international aid has been on concessional terms. In2002, total external debt
was estimated to have reached about 98 percent o f GDP. Comoros already has large arrears to
multilateral creditors and will have to face a sharp increase o f its debt service payments to IDA
inthe next five years, whenthe grace period, associated with seven Bankprojects, ends.


* Analysisconducted by Phil Keefer as part o f the LICUS Task Force, revised with 2002 data inFebruary 2003 by
'OPCS.
  Governance Research Indicator country (GRIC) 1996 -2002 suggests that Comoros' measures lower than the
regional average on political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule o f law and control of
corruption. Percentile ranking on voice and accountability in Comoros in 2002 was 34.3% compared to a regional
average of 31.O%.


                                                       17

Poverty

Poverty was already pervasive before the crisis, with some 47 percent o f households (and more
than 50 percent o f the population) living below the poverty line. In2002, Comoros had a per
capita income o f US$414, amongst the lowest inthe world. The poverty rates for the three
islands are around 41 percent for Grande Comore, 62 percent for Anjouan, and 52 percent for
Moheli. However, the situation continues to worsen and expectations for social conditions
continue to be poor. Although recent poverty statistics are not available, it i s unlikelythat there
had been any significant changes inthe poverty rates or inwell-being on the three islands. Life
expectancy at birthi s 60 years, the infant mortality rate is 76 per 1,000 births; and malnutrition
rates are around 43 percent for children less than two years old. Moreover, only about 48 percent
o f children under the age o f one are immunized against prevalent childhood diseases. Existing
water infrastructure inAnjouan and Moheli, with limitedcapacity and poor condition due to lack
o f maintenance, has resulted inpoor quality services, highwater losses (on Grande Comore
water losses are estimated as beingas highas 45 percent) and health threats such as cholera
outbreaks. Drinkingwater i s so polluted that users have stopped paying for consumption. Even
national roads are indanger are becoming inaccessible due to lack o f periodic maintenance
which will result inhigher commodity prices inthe long-run.

The widespread incidence o fpoverty is the result o flack o fopportunities and facilities for
development o fproductive activities, and lack o f adequate infrastructure and facilities,
particularly for delivery o f education and health services, which tend to be o f low quality and, at
least inthe case o f health services, poorly utilized. Although budgets may, theoretically, provide
a "safety net" covering primaryeducation and basic health care, requiredsocial expenditures are
usually not made due to persistent public finance difficulties. Successive governments have been
unable to deliver social services to the population, inpart because o f financial constraints and its
inabilityto channel the necessary resources to the social sectors. Only 50 percent o f the
budgeted amounts for education and health were spent, and those paid mostly wages and salaries.
The rate o f execution o fnon-wage`expenditures inthe social sectors is particularly low at around
25-30 percent. The social and general economic climate has deteriorated noticeably in2003, and
the general lack o f government progress on socio-economic development i s deepening
widespread disillusion with the state.

The Role of the Diaspora

WesternUnion has offices on the three islands, the amounts sent to each give the best indication
o f the distribution o f transfers to the different islands. Data from 2002 shows that Grande
Comore has 91 percent o f incoming transfers, versus only seven percent for Anjouan, although
they have roughly equal populations. Ifone considers net transfers, the difference becomes even
starker, because Anjouan has a negative balance o f transfers (56 percent o f transfers were
outbound), whereas Moheli has roughly equal amounts o f in and outgoing transfers and Grand
Comore, a strongly positive balance (79 percent inbound).

The on-going Social Fundproject has enjoyed success particularly at the community level. The
beneficiary assessment for the ongoing project shows that the perception o fthe FADC bythe
population is very positive. The project i s considered to be an efficient mechanismto meet the
population's priorityneeds, andhas made a significant contribution to the improvement o f living
conditions inall three islands. The table below shows some basic information on communities
per island and the achievements o fthe project thus far increating community level committees.

I. RecentlyClosedBank-financedProjects
Four Bank-financed projects were recently completed andor closed.
a) Infrastructure,Water and Environment:this US$11.4 million project was closed at the
request o f the Government inAugust 2003 given the poor performance. Only US$1.5 million
was disbursed, around 12 percent o f the credit. Through a multi-donor financed infrastructure,
water and environment program, the objective o f the project was to improve living conditions
and stimulate economic growth inComoros while protectingthe environment through
investments inbasic infrastructure, including water supply and roadmaintenance. Both the
project's development objective and implementationprogress were ratedunsatisfactory at the
time o fclosing.

b) Agricultural Services Pilot Project:thisproject closed inJune 2003, at which time boththe
project's development objective and implementationprogress were rated satisfactory. The
amount o fthe pilot project was US$1.6 million. The objectives o fthe project were to: (a)
produce replicable research and extension delivery systems; (b) reinforce capacity o f local
communities and Producers Groups; and (c) strengthen government's institutional capacity in
implementing its agricultural strategy. The project financed 58 small productive micro-projects
through grants with 20 percent contribution from beneficiaries.

c) EmergencyEconomic Recovery Credit: this credit o fUS$6 million closed inDecember
2002. The credit's main objective was to support the Comoros inits transition out o f a
secessionist crisis by (i) alleviating distress amongst the poor; (ii)   supporting the institutional
transition to a decentralized state; and (iii) assisting incarrying out the technical dimensions o f
the reconciliation process. An Implementation Completion Report was submittedinJune 2003
which rated the outcomes o f the project as marginally satisfactory, and sustainability as unlikely.

d) Third EducationProject:this project closed on December 31,2003 and credit amount was
US$7 million. The objectives o fthe project were to improve the learningprocess at primary
level, and to establish an effective demand-driven training system to develop skills inthe
workplace. By increasing local participation inschool management and improving input quality
at school level, the project was expected to increase (i)    the effectiveness o f the teaching-learning
process and (ii) the enrolment to primary education. The project contributed to the recovery o f
the public primary education following its collapse due to continuous crisis. At the time the
project closed, implementation progress was cautiously rated satisfactory. Sustainability o f the
Project's outcomes i s uncertain within the complex context o f Comoros.

11.      On-goingBank-financedProjects

a) HealthProject:the closing date o fthe project is June 30,2004. The project amount is US$8.4
million o f which USS6.5 million is disbursed, around 78 percent. The objective o f the project is
to reduce mortality from common diseases, particularly malaria, by: (a) ensuring a better
utilization o fhealth facilities for the delivery o f quality health care to the vast majority o f the
population; and (b) organizing mosquito control activities to reduce the incidence o f malaria.

The development objective remains marginally satisfactory and implementation progress is
currently rated satisfactory.

b) Social FundProject:this project will close inJune 2004 and is expected to meet its
development objectives. The project amount is US$11.5 millionof which US$10.5 million is
disbursed, around 95 percent of the credit. The objective o f this project is to address the
incidence o fpoverty amongst the country's poorer communities through the replenishment of a
social fund designed to support demand-driven initiatives developed by such communities and,
indoing so, to create employment and improve access to basic social services. Implementation
progress is currently rated satisfactory.

 ProjectComponent 1:Community-basedSubprojects-EstimatedCost: US$5.3 million
 equivalent

This component will continue to support small-scale social and economic infrastructure
investments inneedy communities inaccordance with their priorities. Sub-projects will be
identifiedbybeneficiaries and prioritized through localparticipatory community planning
processes, spearheadedby village steering committees. Sub-projects eligible for financing will
have to meet technical, financial, economic, social and environmental criteria set out inthe
Operations Manual.

 Sub projects will consist o f rehabilitation and construction o f schools and classrooms, health
posts, water supply schemes and feeder roads. Sub projects will include measurer for the
protection o fthe environment. Labor intensive works will be preferred whenever proven as
technically and economically efficient and insofar as they generate employment opportunities for
the poor. Ontargeting, there are about 130 communities as well as impoverished urban
neighborhoodsthat have not yet benefited from the Social Fund.The FADC will target these
communities for intensive facilitation, so that by the end o f the project, these would have
operational local committees and a community development plan. For those communities that
have already benefited from FADC inthe past, a small amount o f funds will be reserved to fulfill
matching grant proposals or to fund projects inexceptional cases o fpoverty or social impact, as
per SER decision-making criteria.

An overall envelope for this component over the four years will be allocated to each island on
the basis o f objective and transparent criteria discussed and agreed with the Bank during
preparation o f the project. This criteria will be outlined inthe project's manual o f procedures.

As this component seeks to respond to local demand, there are no allocations to sectoral sub-
projects. However, inthe case o f education and health sub-projects, these will need to be
contained inthe carte scolaire and carte sanitaire before approval o f financing. Inthe event that
they are not included, the communities, together with the project management unit, will need to
receive a waiver from the respective line Ministries.

Inaccordance with the Manual ofProcedures ofFADC, the sub-projects will be supervised by
the local village steering committees. Village committees are also responsible for mobilizing
communities to provide labor, materials, and cash for the sub-projects. A sliding scale o f
community contributions will be usedbased on the sub-project and on location. FADC will
develop and publicize clear and transparent criteria that will be used to select qualifying
proposals for funding. Such criteria could vary among the islands and favor proposals that are
jointly prepared by two or more communities, leverage diaspora or govemment resources, and
best provide sustainable benefits for vulnerable groups. Objective poverty criteria that i s
available would also be used to prioritize proposals for funding.

ProjectComponent2: CapacityBuilding-- EstimatedCost: US$0.6 millionequivalent

A key bottleneck to effectively addressing social sector delivery issues inComoros i s the lack of
institutional capacity at the community level as well as inregional and local government.
Communities lack access to basic information regarding services as well as involvement inthe
decision-making process concerning development activities and service provision. Local
governments have limited financial resources, and there is little accounting, financial planning
and budgeting at the regional and local levels. Comoros has very limited experience and
capacity to implementparticipatory and transparent development processes which are
downwardly accountable.

The overarching objective o f this component i s to build the capacity o fvarious players at the
local level to improve their effectiveness inidentifying, preparing, evaluating and implementing
sub-projects that bring sustainable and broad-based impact to communities. Central to this
objective i s the promotion o f increased stakeholder participation inthe local development
process, such as participatory community planning, monitoring, and expenditure management.
Emphasis will also be placed on certain themes such as the importance o f environmental
mitigation measures and the special needs o f disadvantaged groups. To launch activities under
this component, an intensive stakeholder analysis and social assessment will be camed out and
would include an evaluation o f local decision-making processes and the extent to which they are
participatory and inclusive o f vulnerable groups. This analysis will help formulate appropriately
context-specific processes as well as to identify pilot communities.

The capacity building component would support training ina number o f forms, including
through regional workshops, from specialized consultants or NGOs, and from a specially
prepared program o f study tours. The project would also coordinate closely with other donor-
financed initiatives to ensure complementarity o f activities. Training would be provided to the
following targeted groups: (a) village representatives, including youth village facilitators and
representatives o f village councils, on procedures, the cycle and management o f community sub-
projects, and fiduciary accountability; (b) small contractors, consultants, andworksite
supervisors on the execution o f civil works (for small contractors, training programs will include
management aspects, such as costing andbidpreparation, as well as technical aspects, such as
highlabor intensityworks inthe case o ffeeder roads); and(c) village committees and
communities for the operation and maintenance o f completed sub-projects, and inparticipatory
monitoring and evaluation. Identified municipalities will also be targeted for capacity building
and incorporated into the local development planningprocess to buildtheir capacity to undertake
their functions inaparticipatory and transparent manner. Additional resources for targeted social
accountability training for Comoros' newly established mayors are beingsought through trust
fund applications.

The FADC and its regional offices will also require on-going capacity building, particularly in
the area o f financial management and procurement as project management becomes increasingly
decentralized. Moreover, FADC's expertise inparticipatory community development techniques
needs to be strengthenedand supplemented where necessary to ensure that disadvantaged
communities are properly targeted and to facilitate inclusive processes that build social capital at
the community level. Finally, the FADC will benefit from capacity enhancement focused on the



                                                 27

importance o f information in general inbuildingcapacity for change and improving service
delivery. A twinning program and studytour o f programs inother countries will be encouraged
to help build FADC capacity inthese areas.

ProjectComponent3: HealthServices - EstimatedCost: US$1.2millionequivalent

The objective o f these activities is to strengthen the capacity o f selected medicalpersonnel as
well as key health facilities. Training o f key medical personnel o f the country invery specialized
areas i s on-going and can continue to be supported through this project.

Inaddition, the Government has identifiedurgentneedsinterms ofcriticalhealth equipment
necessary for the continued operation o fhealth installations that hadbeen financed by the Bank-
financed Third Health Sector Project. This equipment would aim to supplementthe priority
needs o furgent care departments which was not covered by the healthproject, nor could be
coveredby other donors.

ProjectComponent4: UrbanWater Supply - EstimatedCost:US$2.1millionequivalent

This component features activities initially financed underthe IWEproject, approved by the
Board inMarch 2001. Dueto poor performance, the Government decided to close this project
with an agreement that the critical activities ofrehabilitation and extension o furbanwater supply
inAnjouan andMoheliwouldbeencompassed intheproposedproject. Activities underthis
component will be implementedby FADC under delegated contract management (maitrise
d'ouvrage dklkguke). The project will support the rehabilitation and extension o f existing urban
water networks (usinga gravity system) inMutsamudu, Domoni and Ouani on Anjouan (about
72,000 inhabitants) and Fomboni and Djoezi on Moheli (about 15,000 inhabitants). These
networks were built inthe 1960sand have greatly deteriorated, resultinginhuge water losses,
andrely on reservoirs that are not properly protected. This has resulted in a serious degradation
inthe quality o fwater, which acts as avector for disease, suchthat households have stopped
paying for water service.

For the management o fthe five networks, water management committees already exist and are
somewhat functional. The project will finance technical assistance, capacity building and key
equipment to restructure these committees to ensure a transparent management o f water-related
resources. Once the infrastructure i s completed, these committees will be expected to finance
100percent o f the cost of their operation and maintenance. Training programs on operations and
maintenance will also be financed for the water management committees to ensure that these
activities are undertaken efficiently, while keeping costs at a minimumby ensuring proper
preventive maintenance. To demonstrate the continued commitment o fthe beneficiaries to
paying user fees, an initial deposit equivalent to six months o f maintenance o f the network will
be made into each committee's account, before the rehabilitation works begin. Information, as
well as sanitary education and communication campaigns will be financed to encourage people

 (a) Monitoring and Evaluation: The objective o f this sub-component would be to (i)      enhance the
project's MIS; (ii) a participatoryM&E system facilitated by local NGOs; (iii)
                     create                                                                support
media monitoring; (iv) strengthenthe FADC's ability to monitor output andprocess indicators;
and (v) analyze the impacts o fthis project on household and/or community welfare.

FADC currently has an integrated management system (MIS)to monitor project activities and
uses the software TECPRO, recently installed by the company TOMATE. However, this has not
worked as well as expected and an evaluation o fthe existing system is being undertaken under
the PPF to provide recommendations for strengtheningand/or complementing the system.

The FADC is also setting up a participatory monitoring and evaluation system on a pilot basis,
with the participation o fvillage committees who would themselves select the performance and
impact indicators that are relevant andimportant for them and their sub-projects. Communities
will be empowered and included inthe M&Eprocesses. To ensure effectiveness o f community
participatory monitoring, not only at the design and implementationphases, but throughout the
project cycle, FADC will contract with local NGOs to facilitate and strengthen beneficiary
community capacity inthis regard. The project will provide capacitybuildingto these local
NGOsto ensure successful implementation and coordination with FADC.

A locally-basedNGOwould be contracted to facilitate on-the-spot monitoring by Comorian
journalists (both press and especially radio) o f all aspects o f the social fund. These journalists
should be representatives o fthe broad range o f existing Comorian media organizations. The
coordinating organization should have a solid understanding o fjournalism inComoros and
journalistic skills, ability to work with a broad range ofjournalists, adequate financial and
program management capacity, broad contacts across the country, and capacity to implement and
monitor activities independently o f FADC.

The project appears to have basic capacity to collect and maintain project information. However,
the quality o f data and its utilization remains low, giventhe overall insufficient capacity for data
analysis. To overcome these problems and to assist project staff inintegrating their data
collection efforts into more coherent strategies for monitoring o fproject impacts, a series o f
training workshops would beheld. These would help project staff to identifybasic objectives for
impact evaluation and linkthis to their internal information management, carry out baseline
surveys, plan and monitor future impact evaluations, as well as successfully incorporate data
from external partners into the information management system. This includes data collected by
the communities and NGOpartnersinthe community monitoring process, issues raisedby the
journalists intheir reporting.

The M&E component would design an evaluation strategy to assess program effects, including
impacts on local management capacity and strengthening transparent and inclusive processes at
the community level (i.e., community planning, budgeting, monitoring); utilization of, access to
and quality o fbasic social infrastructure and services; and targeting performance. Although the
FADC has undertakenbasic M&E work, such as beneficiary assessments and evaluation o f
outputs, little work has been done to monitor project impacts. This can be explained with two
principal shortcomings: first, institutional capacities to carry out impact evaluations is weak.



                                                   29

Therefore project staff will require training on basic impact evaluationmethods and design
issues; secondly, only few projects have established systemic baseline data for impact
evaluations. Inaddition, there is little data readily available at the national level. A household
survey, co-financed by this project, will be undertaken by the Planning Directorate and the
project will capitalize on this exercise to beginto establish a base-line.

This sub component will finance (i)    an assessment o f available data sources for impact
evaluation, (ii) a review o f available data sources on poverty and socio-economic activities to
create a database for baseline and comparator data for impact evaluations, (iii)    training programs
for relevant technicians and decision-makers at the project level; (iv) strengthening of the
existingM&E system; and (v) proposednew M&E activities that support increased
accountability and transparency through external monitoring mechanisms.

(b) FADC Operating Costs: These are estimated at 15 percent o fthe project's total costs. To
date, FADC has been cost-effective with its own operating costs representing a relatively small
fraction o f the costs o f the community sub-projects it has financed. The project will therefore
strive to keep operating costs below 15 percent o f the total cost. For the purpose o f calculating
the operating ratio, the operating and administrative expenses include the salaries and other
employment costs o f all FADC staff, office rental, utilities and communications expenses,
materials and other administrative costs, inter-island travel and per diems, insurance and
maintenance o f vehicles and equipment, but exclude the costs o f any overseas training, financial
and technical audits, special studies or equipment.

(c) Audits: This includes international and national technical for annual technical and financial
audits.

An amount of US$1 million has been unallocated to allow for exchange rate changes and
additional project needs.

                               COMOROS: Services SupportProject

The Fonds d'Appui au Dkveloppement Communautaire (FADC), an "organization inthe public
interest with administrative and financial autonomy" was established on January 6, 1993, by
Presidential Ordinance No. 93-001,and i s operating under PresidentialDecree No.93-068/PR o f
April 13,1993, as modified on October 22,2001 byDecree No. 01-119/CE and on January 28,
2003, by Decree No.03-013/PR inaccordance with the new institutions o fthe Comoros, defines
its organization and management.

The National Executive Secretariat (SecrktariatExkcutifNational - SEN) and the three Regional
Executive Secretariats (Secrktariat ExkcutifRkgional -SER) are the administrative and executing
entities for oversight o f the day-to-day operations o f FADC on the three islands. The positions
o fNational Executive Director, Regional Directors and other higher level staff must be filled at
all times with personnel whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA. Under a
Subsidiary Agreement (referred to as the FADC Convention), IDA funds will be channeled to
FADC on a grant basis. FADC, inturn, will make part of the money available to communities as
grants for small scale social and economic infrastructure. It will use the other part o f the money
to implementthe capacity buildingactivities, basic health activities, urban water supply, and
monitoring and evaluation.

Project Coordinationand Oversight

The Executive Director o f FADC is responsible for the coordination o f activities. The Central
Coordination Committee - CCC (Comitk Central de Coordination) o f FADC acts as a Board o f
Directors setting the overall policies o f FADC. It i s composed o f 14members: six
representatives o fthe Union o f the Comoros ando fthe Administration o f the three islands, and
eight representatives from associations and the private sector. It meets twice a year and its
responsibilities are to formulate FADC's policies, approve the Manual o fProcedures and annual
work programs and budgets, analyze the audit reports, and appoint the National Executive
Director and the Regional Directors. Regional Committees - CR (Comitk Rkgionao are
operational ineach o f the three islands. They are composed o f twelve members: five
representatives from the island's administration, five representatives o f village committees, one
representative o fNGOs/ associations and one representative o f the private sector. Their primary
responsibilities are to approve (through a regional project sub-committee) all grants o f less than
CF 15 million, and submit to the National Executive Director for decision all proposals for grants
equal or greater than CF 15 million.

The project will have different modalities for each component.

1) Community-basedSubprojects

Community proposals are approvedbased on whether they meet criteria defined inthe Manual o f
Procedures, including community planning and participation, environmental and social impact,
sustainability and priorities. The maximum cost o f a sub-project is CF 33.75 million (about
US$75,000 equivalent) and the maximum FADC grant for a sub-project is CF 27 million (about


                                                  32

US$60,000 equivalent), with the exception o frural roads for which the maximum cost o fa sub-
project is CF 62.5 million (about US$137,000 equivalent) and the maximum grant for a sub-
project i s CF 75.0 million (about US$llO,OOO equivalent).

Once the sub-projects are approved, FADC will provide the financing and the village steering
committees will supervise the implementation o fthe sub-projects, with FADC's technical
assistance. The village committees are structured community groups which work with the
Regional Secretariats inidentifying, preparing, and supervising sub-projects. Village
committees, jointly with FADC, will recruit consultants as needed for designand supervision,
and contract with civil works enterprises and suppliers for the execution o f the sub-projects
(however, payments to those consultants, contractors and suppliers were made directly by
FADC). Inaccordance with the contracts that they enter into with FADC, the village committees
are also ultimately responsible for supervision o f the implementation o fthe project that has been
identified through participatory processes. This includes mobilizingcommunities to provide
labor, materials, and cash for the sub-projects. Community groups, NGOs, local contractors and
consulting firms will be FADC's partners inthe on-site supervision and/or implementation o f
works and other activities.

Local Consulting Firms or individual consultants will continue to perform on-site supervision o f
community works to ensure that the work done by the local contractors is inconformity with the
technical specifications inthe biddingdocuments and contracts.

2) Capacity Building Activities

For capacity building, FADC will help the beneficiaries to identifytraining activities financed
under the project and carried out by specialized consultants, institutions, or qualified FADC staff.
With intensive facilitationby FADC, village committees and youth village-based facilitators will
be responsible for the preparation o f community development plans and for ensuring
participation that meets the process criteria. The proposedproject will also continue to
strengthen community participation and capacity inall stages o f the community project cycle,
and to provide training inproject operations, management and maintenance. Simplified standard
biddingdocuments have beenprepared inorder to ensure that local contractors are giventhe
opportunity to submit bids for the small-scale sub-projects. Local contractors have emerged in
recent years, due to the increasingnumber o f invitations to bid and o f contracts under FADC's
increased work program. To further develop the local contracting market, the FADC will
continue to provide training to contractors inmanagement (including bidpreparation and the
organization o fworks) and in adapted construction techniques for civil works (particularly rural
roads) using labor intensive methods. Finally, the existing FADC structure will be strengthened
to ensure its continued ability to implement and supervise project activities.

3) Health Services

Training in specialized health areas has already been identified and is on-going. This project
could support those medical personnel already in training abroad to continue and finish their
studies.




                                                 33

All medical equipment indicated on the list in the Manual o f Procedures will be purchased
through IAPSO and/or the United Nations agencies.

4) Urban Water Supply

The FADC was requested to play the role o f delegated contact manager (convention de maitrise
d'ouvrage dklkguke) by the Ministryo fDevelopment. The roles are defined inthe Manual of
procedures o f the project to ensure the participation o fbeneficiaries and to outline the
responsibilities o fthe various parties. Implementation arrangements for this component are based
on discussions duringproject pre-appraisal and preparationand on implementing arrangements
foreseen inthe IEW project.

The FADC will contract out with civil works enterprises and suppliers the execution o fthe water
supply sub-projects. All contracts for works and goods will beprocured under I C B in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. For technical assistance for the biddingprocess and for
the supervision o f construction and/or rehabilitation o fthe works, FADC is planning to use the
same consulting firm that was recruited by Government for both the technical studies and
supervision, inaccordance with Bank guidelines underthe IWEProject. FADC is negotiating
with the firm the transfer o fthe contract from the Government to FADC. Ifthose negotiations
are not successful, the FADC will recruit a new consulting firm for the biddingprocess and
supervision under the Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) method inaccordance with the
Bank's guidelines. Bids will include environment protection activities and financing.

5) ProjectMonitoringandEvaluation,and Audits

Monitoringand coordination o fproject activities that will be carried out by FADC in
collaboration with the various entities requires experienced individuals with proven management
skills. Periodic reports, such as technical, institutional and financial audits, the monitoring o f
performance indicators, beneficiary assessments and supervision missions would help assess the
effectiveness o fproject management.

Manualof Procedures

An existing Manual of Procedures, adopted by the CCCo fFADC and approved by IDA, defines
the modalities o f financing by FADC and o f implementation by village committees o fthe small-
scale infrastructure sub-projects. This manual contains the criteria and procedures for
identifying,preparing, appraising, selecting and implementingsub-projects. It also includes
models o fbiddingdocuments for works and goods. For schools and health posts, standard
drawings have been developed based on the guidelines o f concerned ministries. For feeder
roads, norms have been established based on the recommendations o f technical audits. Separate
chapters inthe manual deal with the capacity building, health activities, urban water supply and
monitoring and evaluation. Based on experience gained duringthe first 10years o f FADC
operation and the adjustments which have been made to the operating procedures, these
documents havebeen updated and consolidatedinto a revised Manual o f Procedures.

                                COMOROS: Services Support Project

Country Issues

To measure the overall effectiveness, transparency and efficiency o fbothbudgetprocesses and
public financial management systems inComoros eligible for assistance under the Heavily
IndebtedPoor Country initiative, an assessmenthas beencarried out in2002/2003 by a Bank
teamjointly with a Comorian government team composed o f the Director o f Budget and
representatives o f the Finance Ministry, Treasury and main Control Organs. This assessment was
conducted by usingthe 15 benchmarks developed by the Fiscal Affairs Department (IMF) in
collaborationwith the Bank. This review identified serious weaknesses inpublic sector
budgeting, accounting system, reporting and auditing, and concludedthat, at the moment,
Comoros is unable to satisfy 13 o f the 15 benchmarks. Taking into account this high fiduciary
risk, it was agreed that the Services Support Project will be implementedby the FADC, an
independent entity which has extensive experience from previous IDAprojects inimplementing
activities o f this nature. However, as indicated above some corrective actions must be taken to
strengthen its financial management system. Inaddition, project accounts will be audited by
international accounting firms acceptable to IDA to mitigate risks raisedby the weak capacity o f
the Commission de Ve'rijkation des Comptespublics (CVC) and the absence o f an accounting
profession inComoros.

Strengthsand Weaknesses

Inorder to meet efficiently the challenges ofthe newprogram, the organizational structure and

Disbursementfrom the IDA Credit

For the implementation o f the Services Support Project, the followingbank accounts will be
opened inlocal commercial banks under conditions satisfactory to IDA:


    0    Special Account to be managed by the National Executive Secretariat (SEN):
         Denominated inComonan Francs (CF), disbursements from the IDA credit will be
         deposited on this account to: i)finance FADC activities inaccordance with the
         disbursement percentages indicated inthe DCA; ii)replenish sub special accounts
         opened at the regional level. The special account would be replenishedon the basis o f
         documentary evidence provided to IDAby the SEN,justifying the payments o f
         expenditures that are eligible for financing under the credit. All supporting documents
         will be retainedby the SEN andmade available for reviewby periodic Bank supervision
         missions and external auditors. The project implementation and accounting manuals will
         describe in details all procedural aspects regarding financial management (payments,
         replenishment, reporting, internal control).
    0    Sub special Accounts to bemanagedbythe RegionalExecutive Secretariats (SER):
         Denominated inCF, disbursements from special account will be deposited on this

         contractors and suppliers operating inthe regions, inconformity with the disbursement
         percentages indicated inthe DCA.

Underthisprocedure, SENwill advance funds sums coveringno more than 90 days estimated
expenditures to regional accounts, based upon submission o f satisfactory budgetedwork plans.
The SER will submit at least monthly expenditure reports indicating sources and uses o f funds
andjustifying the use o f funds, and accompanied by reconciled bank statements. The SENwill
then aggregate this data, prepare reconciliation statement for the main special account, and
prepare replenishment applications accompanied by the bank statement for the main special
account.

Staffing

To strengthen the finance and accounting functions both at the central and regional levels, the
following accounting staff have beenrecruited: i)a Director o f Finance responsible for overall
supervision o f finance, accounting, budgeting and reporting; and ii)four (4) qualified and
trained accountants for the SEN and the three islands, incharge o f the maintenance o f accounts
and the preparation o f all financial reports for managing and monitoring project activities. These
recruitments were undertaken inconformity with the Bank procedures.

AccountingPolicies and Procedures

The accounting systemoperates on a decentralized basis with three (3) SER. Each SER
maintains separate financial records for all transactions under its responsibility and sends, on a
monthly basis, the balance sheet to the SEN for consolidation. The Director o f Finance, at the
central level, is incharge o f the overall aspect o fthe project financial management including




                                                  37

budgeting, administration of the special account, consolidation and production o fthe project
financial statements and FMR.

The SENand SER will use an accounting system incompliance with generally accepted
accounting standards and IDA requirements. To strengthen the FADC financial management
system it was agreed that a consultant will berecruited to update the project procedures manual
which will describe inter alia the outline o f the project accounting system, the accounting
policies to be followed, the formats o f books and records, the Chart o f accounts, the financial
reporting, and relevant information to facilitate record keepingand maintenance o f proper
control over assets. H e will also provide adequate training to staff to ensure better understanding
and proper applicationby the staff o f all procedures described inthe manual.

The project accounting system will use standard book accounts (journals, ledgers and trial
balances) to enter and summarize transactions and will operate on a double entry accrual
principles. The financial statements will be preparedunderthe historical cost convention. Project
accounts will be maintained inCF.

To ensure timely production o f financial information requiredfor managing and monitoring
project activities, the FADC will use the accounting software usedwithin the context o f the
Services Support Project. However necessary adjustments must be envisaged to meet the project
needs and Bank reporting requirements.

Internal Audit

Due to the complexity of such project and since its organizational structure i s decentralized, an
intemal audit function will be required to ensure efficient use o f funds, consistent application o f
procedures, adequateprotection o f assets and appropriate execution o fworks/activities in
compliance with the terms o f contracts/convention. This internal audit will also focus on capacity
buildingandwill be camed out by an accounting firm acceptable to IDA,which will report
directly to the CCC and the SEN. All issues identified during intemal audit should be addressed
quickly to improve the project performance.

External Audit

The project financial statements will be audited annually by an international private accounting
firmacceptable to IDA, inaccordance with InternationalStandards o fAuditingandthe new
Guidelines describing Audit Policy and Practices for World Bank-financed Activities. The
audited financial statements should reflect the activities supported by the credit. The auditors
may provide a single opinion on the annual financial statements instead o f expressing separate
audit opinions on special accounts and statements o f expenditures (SOEs), provided such
statements reflect the balances and transactions associated with any special accounts and SOEs.
This opinion will state whether the financial statements fairly present the financial transactions
and balances associated with the implementation of the project, and ifthe expenditures financed
by the credit were appropriate. The auditors will be also required to carry out a comprehensive
review o f the internal control procedures and provide a management report outlining any
recommendations for their improvement. The audit report will be submittedto IDA not later than



                                                   38

six months after the end o f each fiscal year. The auditors should be recruitedprior to credit
effectiveness. Since the project is expected to be effective by end-May 2004, a separate audit is
not required for the PPF: amounts disbursed for this purpose will be accounted for inthe first
reporting period o fthe new project. The terms o f reference o f the audit will be reviewed by the
financial management specialist o f the Bank/IDA to ensure the adequacy o f the audit scope,
drawing special attention to particular risk areas identified duringproject preparation or
implementation, that may not be emphasized under a normal audit.

Reporting and Monitoring

To monitor project implementation, the SENwill produce the following reports that should be
prepared incompliance with international accounting standards :


    0   Annualfinancia1statements comprising:

            Summary o f sources and uses o f funds (by components/project activitiedcredit
            category and showing all sources o f funds);
            Project Balance Sheet;
            Special account statement; and
            Statement o f Expenditures showing individual withdrawal applications byreference
            number,date and amount.


    0   Quarterly FMRs

        The FMRsincludes financial reports, physical progress reports and procurement reports
        to facilitate project monitoring. The FMRs should be submittedto IDA within 45 days o f
        the end o fthe reporting period (quarter).

Models o f the FMRs and annual financial statements will be presented inthe project accounting
manual o fprocedures.


Information Systems

The FADC will use an integrated and networked financial management system capable o f
recording and producing ina timely manner all financial reports required for managing and
monitoring project activities. This computerized system would inparticular facilitate: annual
programming o f activities and project resources, record-keeping (general accounting and cost
accounting), financial andbudgetary management, fixed assets management, procurement
management, follow-up o fproject implementation progress, monitoring o f key indicators to
assess the results and impact o fthe project, preparationo f quarterly FMRs as required by the
Bank/IDA.To achieve these objectives the accounting software actually inplaceandusedbythe
FADC within the context o fthe Services Support Project will be reviewed by the manufacturer
to meet the FADC requirements. The terms o f reference for this consultant will be reviewedby
the Bank Financial Management Specialist. The new computerized system will be fully
functional before project implementation begins.

Impactof ProcurementArrangements

The overall procurement risk assessmenti s rated high. Therefore, the procurement unit o fthe
agency will be strengthened by recruiting a chief procurement officer incharge o f managing and
consolidating procurement activity.

DisbursementArrangements

Method of Disbursement:

The SENwould follow the transaction-based disbursements procedures (traditional mode)
outlined inthe Bank's Disbursement Handbook. The use o f report-based disbursements could
bepossiblethereafter ifrequestedby the borrower and ifthe following criteria are met: i)the FM
rating has been maintained at satisfactory level; ii)the timely submission o f quarterly FMRs
consistent with the form and content agreed duringnegotiations, and reliable for purposes o f
disbursement; iii)the submission o fproject audit report by due date. Detailed disbursement
procedures will be described inthe project accountingmanual ofprocedures.

Minimum of Application Size :

The minimumapplication size for direct payments, to be withdrawn directly from the Credit
Account, and special commitments i s 20 percent o f the amount advanced to the special account.

Useof Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) :

Disbursementswould bemade against SOEs for contracts and goods not requiringthe Bank's
prior review. Therefore disbursements for all contracts for:


    0   civil works o f less than US$75,000;
        goods o f less than US$50,000];
    0   consulting services, training by firms and individuals o f less thanUS$50,000 and
        US$20,000 respectively;
    0   and training and all incremental operating expenses;
would be made on the basis o f SOEs and certified by the SEN. SOE statements would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. All SOEs supporting documentation
would be kept therefore by the SENand made available for review by Bank supervision missions
and external auditors.

Special Accounts

Payments from the IDA Credit would be administered by the SEN and deposited ina special
account which would be opened ina commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The special account
would be maintained inComorian Francs and receive an authorized allocation o f CF
400,000,000 covering IDA'Sshare o f4 months o f estimated expenditures; however the initial
allocation will be limited to CF 300,000,000 until the aggregate amount o f withdrawals from the
Credit Account plus the total amount o f all outstanding special commitments entered into the



                                                 40

Bank shall be equal to or exceed SDR 1,500,000. The SENwould be responsible for preparing
disbursement requests. These requests would be submitted at least on a monthly basis but to
allow regular payment o f suppliers and contractors it would be more appropriate to do this more
often (ie: every two weeks). Replenishment o f the Special Accounts would follow Bank
procedures. Disbursements would be made under the authorized signature from a designated
representative o f the Borrower. The Special Accounts would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank.

The sub-special account especially designed for SER will beusedto facilitate the operations o f
the regional offices and to ensureprompt payment of contractors and suppliers operating inthe
regions. Underthis procedure, SEN will makean advance covering no more than 90 days
estimated expenditures (inlocal currency) to SER accounts opened ina commercial bank
acceptable to IDA, based upon submission o f satisfactory, budgetedwork plans. Each SER
would submit two weeks expenditure reports indicating sources and uses o f funds andjustifying
the use o f funds, and accompanied by reconciled bank statements. SEN will then aggregate this
data, preparereconciliation statement for the main special account, andprepare replenishment
applications accompanied by the bank statement for the main special account.

                             COMOROS: Services Support Project

General

N o Country Procurement Assessment Reviewhas been conducted for Comoros. However, a
minicountry assessment review was carried out duringthe preparation oftheproject on October
2003. The outcome showed that no separate Procurement regulations govern the country until a
new code is set up and adopted. Considering these weaknesses, agency capacity needs to be
strengthened and close monitoring will be set up during the first year o f implementation.
Procurement o f goods and works requiredfor the project and to be financed out o f the proceeds
of the credit shall be governed by the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA
Credit" published bythe Bank inJanuary 1995 andrevisedinJanuary and August 1996,
September 1997 and January 1999.Procurement o f consultants' services shall be governed by the
"Guidelines for the Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"
publishedby the Bank inJanuary 1997 and revised in September 1997,inJanuary 1999 and in
M a y 2002. The following tables describe the procurement arrangements under the project.
Community Participation inProcurement would bebased on the Africa Region's Guidelines -
SimplifiedProcurement and Disbursement Procedures for Community-Based Investments.

Advertising

A General Procurement Notice wouldbeprepared andpublishedinthe UnitedNations
Development Business to advertise for major consulting assignments and any International
Competitive Bidding- ICB (above US$200,000 equivalent). It would be updated annually for
any outstanding procurement. Specific procurement notices for goods andworks would be
advertised inthe national press o fwide distribution and internationally for ICB contracts.
Request for expression o f interest would be published inlocal newspapers. Answers to these
expressions would beused to establish list o fNGOs and service providers who would help
communities. Sufficient time would be allowed (minimum o f 30 days) before preparingthe
short list. The related biddingdocuments, as applicable, would not be released - or the short list
for consultant services would not be prepared - before eight weeks after the General Procurement
Notice has been published. Specific procurement notices for goods andworks would be
advertised inthe national press o f wide circulation and internationally for large contracts (ICB).
Sufficient time would be allowed to obtain the biddocuments.

ProcurementMethods

Civil Works. With the exception o fcivil works for urban water (US$l.9million financed by
IDA),all other civil works are included insub-projects and are dealt with undersub-projects.
Civil works include urban water supplies for Anjouan and Moheli. To the extent practicable,
contracts shall be grouped into bidpackages estimated to cost the equivalent o fUS$lOO,OOO or
more and would be procured through I C B procedures. The biddingdocuments shall include a
detailed description o fthe works, including basic specifications, the required completion date,
basic form o f agreement acceptable to IDA and relevant drawings where applicable. The award
would bemade to the contractors who's tender i s assessedon the basis o f lowest evaluated bid,



                                                 44

provided they demonstrate they have the experience and resources to complete the contract
successfully. The use o f standard biddingdocuments editedbythe Bank i s mandatory for ICB.

Goods financed by IDA are estimated at US$l.2 million. They include vehicles, computer
equipment, and office supplies and equipment. To the extent practicable, these contracts shall be
grouped into bidpackages estimated to cost the equivalent o fUS$50,000 or more and would be
procured through ICB. Procurement o f items available locally which cannot be grouped into bid
packages up at least US$50,000 equivalent per contract, would be procured through National
Competitive Bidding(NCB) procedures acceptable to IDA. The procurement o f relatively small
items available locally, such as office supplies, spareparts, gasoline, and other consumable items
that cannot be grouped into bulk procurement or bidpackages o f at least US$30,000 equivalent
percontract would beprocuredthrough national shopping on the basis o f quotations obtained in
writing from at least three qualified local suppliers. Vehicles, computer equipment and health
equipment may be procured through UNAgencies (IAPSO andUNICEF).

Sub-projects under component 1would comprise a broad spectrum o f activities to be
undertaken with direct participation and financial contribution o f the beneficiaries. It is not
possible to determine the exact mix o f goods, small works, and services to beprocured under
these activities due to their demand-drivennature. Therefore, the types o f activities to be
financed under sub-projects andtheir procurement details would depend on the needs identified
bycommunities. The Bank Guidelines for Simplified Procurement and Disbursement for
Community-Based Investments would be used inthe design o fprocurement under this aspect o f
the project. The FADC would be responsible for ensuring compliance with these guidelines, and
ex-post reviews o f random sub-projects would be conductedperiodically by IDA and
independent consultants appointedby the Government

Consulting Services contracts financed by IDA are estimated at US$2.4 million. They would
be: (i) the identification, preparationand implementation o fthe sub-projects under
        for
component 1;(ii) studies, supervision, support o f project implementation, financial
                   for
management and procurement support, financial andprocurement audits; and (iii)        for technical
matters and training. Consultants would be hired based on competition among qualified short-
listed firms through Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) by evaluating the quality o f the
proposals before combining quality and cost evaluationby weighting and adding the quality and
cost scores. Contracts for training costing less than US$50,000 would be procured through
Selection based on consultant's qualification (CQ) method. Technical assistance for the bidding
process and for supervision o f construction and/or rehabilitation o f urban water supplies works
may, with the Association's prior agreement, be procured through single source selection
method. Services requiredfor technical assistance under components 1,2 and 4 and small studies
and staffing under component 5, which can be delivered by individuals, would be selected
through comparison o f qualifications among Individual consultants (IC) expressing interest in
the assignment or approached directly.

Prior review. IDA-financed contracts for goods above the threshold value o fUS$50,000
equivalent andworks the threshold value o f US$75,000, would be subject to IDA'sprior review
procedures inaccordance with appendix 1o f the Guidelines. The use o f IDA'sstandard bidding
documents would considerably expedite the prior review process. For consultant services, Bank



                                                 45

staff would review the selection process for the hiringo f consultants proposedby the Borrower.
Prior IDA review for the selection o fconsultants would include the review o fbudgets, short-
lists, selectionprocedures, requests for proposals, evaluationreports, contract awards, and
negotiated contracts. Prior IDA review would not apply to contracts for the recruitment o f
consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$50,000 and US$20,000
equivalent, respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA reviewwould not apply to the
terms o f reference o f such contracts, regardless o f their value, to single-source hiring, to
assignments o f a critical nature as determinedby IDA, to contracts for FADC key staff, or to
amendments o f contracts raisingthe contract value above the above-mentioned prior review
thresholds. For all consultant contracts subject to prior review (estimated above US$50,000),
opening the financial envelopes would not take place prior to receiving the Bank's no-objection
to the technical evaluation. For contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 and more than
US$30,000, the borrower would notify IDA o f the.results o fthe technical evaluation prior to
opening the financial proposals. Documents related to procurementbelow the prior review
thresholds would be maintained by the borrowers for ex-post review by auditors and by IDA
supervision missions. The Project Unit would submit to IDAperiodic procurement schedules
detailing each procurement package inprogress and completed as part o fthe normal project
reporting exercise.

ProcurementPlan

The procurement plan for the first year o fproject implementation, both for sub-projects and for
goods and services procuredby FADC would be finalized by credit effectiveness, based on
FADC's annual work program. An interimprocurement plan was reviewed duringnegotiations.
For each subsequent year, the procurement plan would be updated and submitted to the Bank for
review and approval at the sametime as FADC's annual work program. These plans would
include relevant information on goods, works and consulting services under the project, as well
as the timing o f each milestone inthe procurement process. These plans would be reviewed by
IDA supervisionmissions.

                              COMOROS: Services Support Project

With regard to the community-basedactivities component, since FADC's financing for these
sub-projects i s demand-driven, it i s difficult to determine apriori the composition o fFADC's
portfolio; thus an estimated rate o f returnhas not beenestimated. Cost-effectiveness analyses
are more appropriate, but these could be conducted only ex-post, after the mid-termreview and
project completion stages. Such analyses would include cost per sub-project and cost
effectiveness indicators for each type sub-project and service completed (e.g., cost per square
foot o f school rehabilitation or construction). Inthe meantime, duringproject implementation,
the FADC will carry out a simple cost-effectiveness analysis for each sub-project proposal
presented by the communities. The analysis will bebased on viable altematives, least-cost
solutions, unit cost estimates from private construction firms, specific circumstances o fthe
community, estimated benefits from the project, number o fbeneficiaries, and other relevant
factors at the micro level. FADC will be using detailed technical criteria, standard design and
simple economic criteria, such as cost perbeneficiary calculations, to determine sub-project
economic viability. A list o f unit costs by type o f sub-project and by island will be prepared and
will be updated annually (based on actual figuresfrom the previous year). The Manualo f
Procedures will provide guidelines for carrying out such analyses.

Itis also hopedthat the cost effectiveness o fthe sub-projects would increase with the
introduction o f direct community financing. FADC will continue to maximize the social rate o f
return o f its portfolio through mechanisms and policies to ensure that the poor are reached and
that FADC's costs do not exceed 15 percent o f disbursements for the sub-projects. Moreover,
specific criteria would be usedto screen sub-project proposals submitted and to eliminate sub-
projects that are not cost-effective. First, the selection o f sub-projects would primarily rely on
demand from the villages and communities, which would normally be required to provide an
upfront financial contribution o f a between 5-20 percent depending on type pfsub-project. As
the selection o fthe sub-projects would primarily rely on demand, it i s likely that the proposed
sub-projects will be economically viable. Feasibility studies will be carried out for each proposed
sub-project. Inaddition to the site surveys and technical/environmental reviews o f the proposed
infrastructure, criteria covering technical, social, economic, and financial aspects will be used for
each type o f infrastructure and service to assess overall economic viability o f the project.

The FADC's M I S would be usedto track the related costs - actual and estimated. The data thus
obtained and recorded inthe M I S would be usedto develop monitorable benchmarks o f cost-
effectiveness. These benchmarks will thenbe inputted into the project's MIS. To help ensure the
cost-effectiveness o f individual sub-projects and to facilitate the introduction o f community
financing, a unit cost database will be established to assess various norms and standards, costs
per labor day o f employment, cost per beneficiary and possible rates o f return for different types
o f sub-projects (such as water supply and schools). Beneficiary impact assessments throughout
the life o fthe project will ascertain the impact o fpilot sub-projects on communities, and will
enable the FADC to gain a better understandingabout who interms o f gender, age, socio-
economic group and vulnerable status i s actually benefiting.

Two analyses o f urbanwater works were carried out under the IEW project, a least-cost analysis
and a cost-benefit analysis. The least-cost analysis, which is based on engineering studies,
confirms that the proposedapproach is the least-cost, technically viable solution for each urban
area. All the designs rely on simple and well-tested technologies to distributewater through
standpipes and house connections.

Economic rates o f returnrange from about 20-27 percent inOuani and Mutsamudu and 5-7
percent inDomoni, Fomboni and Djoezi, assuming that households are willing to pay 4.5 percent
o f their income for water. These figures are based on assumptions o f households' willingness to
pay and do not include potential benefits from improved health o fusers, which is potentially
significant given recent outbreaks o f cholera and typhoid especially inAnjouan. Improved water
system management which reduces water losses will improve water resource management
overall and delay the need for major new investments inthe sector.

                                Annex 10: Safeguard PolicyIssues

                              COMOROS: Services Support Project

1.      Background

The Transition Support Credit is classified as a B for environmental issues and S2 for safeguard
classification. The preparation o f an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was recommendedby the Africa Safeguards Policy
Enhancement Team after review o fthe integrated safeguards data sheet and project concept note.
These instruments are neededbecause the project will support the rehabilitation and construction
o f community-based demand-driveninfrastructure sub-projects, which will include sectors such
as education, health, water and sanitation, and roads. The project will also finance rehabilitation
o furban water supply systems inAnjouan and Moheli. These sub-projects may have the
potential o f some localized environmental and social impacts. The key stakeholders include the
rural and urban community groups, who will participate through their Comitks de PiZotage
instigated by FADC and its regional satellites. FADC and its regional offices work with the
community groups and assist inthe mobilization, participatory planning and decision making,
co-production o f services, implementationo f sub-projects, participatory monitoring and
evaluation, supervision o f contractors, community contribution o f costs, and operational
maintenance.

The ESMF and RPF was disclosed at the Bank's InfoShop on December 3,2002 as well as in-
country. The ESMF consists o f (i) assessment o f the environmental and social impacts o f the
                                     an
anticipated sub-projects as well as environmental and social guidelines, which include an
Environmental Management Plan and check-list for all sub-projects not requiringa separate
environmental assessment; (ii)   a screening process to help determine the environmental and
social impacts o f the proposed sub-projects and how they will be treated; (iii) an assessment o f
the institutional and human resource capacities o f the stakeholder institutions to conduct
environmental management planning and mitigation o f the potential impacts; (iv) a monitoring
planto track potential environmental and social impacts o f the anticipated sub-projects; and (v)
a review o fthe legislative, regulatory and policy frameworks for environmental management in
Comoros.

The FADC and its regional offices as well the department o f Environment have been included in
the environmental assessment and the Resettlement PolicyFramework Studies. Inaddition to
these key institutions, communities benefiting from sub-projects and who are the key
stakeholders will be informed o f the outcome o f the studies and any resultingmonitoring,
mitigation responsibilities, as a condition for sub-project approval.

2.      Main Featuresof the ESMFand the RPF

The ESMF and the RPFwith their screening processes are focused on integrating environmental
and social considerations, procedures and processes directly into the sub-project cycle to ensure
that future similar projects will give attention to safeguarding the environment instead o f treating
environmental matters as an afterthought and a compliance instead o f quality enhancement



                                                  51

aspect. The instruments are also meant to make environmental management easy to understand
and simple to deal with as well as ensuringpositive results on the ground. The screening process
and the resettlement policy framework are adequate and have been introduced inorder to be
integrated inthe sub-project selection and implementationprocess by making sure that each
development stage, namely preparation, planning, implementation and operation take
environmental and social issues into consideration.

Duringproject preparation, allrelevant FADC staffandmembers ofthe Comitt5 depilotage
participated inworkshops inenvironmental and social awareness, sub-project screening,
management and mitigation. As the members o f these groups will be involved insub-project
selectionplanning and implementation, it has been recommendedto further enhance their
awareness on better understanding the linkages between environmental management and
economic development. Breaking the dichotomy between environmental management and
economic development is an uphillbattle and only with awareness buildingare countries able to
achieve this objective.

The planningo f sub-projects will include a screening process, a checklist and a management
plan to ensure that both the site and design o f sub-projects are based on the ESMP. Contractors
must sign the ESMP at the onset o fthe implementation stage as part o f the standard contract and
duringsub-project implementation, contractors must comply with the recommendationso fthe
ESMP. FADC's environmental and social specialist will continually monitor the implementation
o fthe environmental and social management plan as well as contractor adherence to the letters o f
the plan.The specialist will incollaboration with the members o fthe beneficiary groups, monitor
maintenance along with a formal ex-post evaluation, which will review the quality o f
environmental management and when necessary notify FADC o f any shortcomings.

3.      Stakeholder Consultation

The FADC Operational Manual establishes that stakeholders will be consulted duringthe
screening process undertaken during sub-project identification and selection. The screening form
introduced inthe ESMF will help identify the social and environmental issues and the mitigation
and management measures agreed upon for the individual sub-projects. The comitks depilotage
will playkey roles in sub-project implementation and together with the newly recruited
environmental and social specialist, they will be responsible for ensuring that measures are put in
plaice and implemented.

4.      Monitoring and Evaluating the Impact of the Project on the Environment

As part o f the regular procurement process, an environmental and social specialist will be hired
bythe project to ensure that the environmental and social mitigationmeasures are actually
carried out for individual sub-projects. Inaddition, at the end o f each sub-project process, the
ESMF requires the project manager and the environmental and social specialist to ascertain that
the necessary mitigation measures have been completed. At the operational level, this combines
both continual monitoring at the community level and an ex-post evaluation including
environmental and social considerations. After project effectiveness and duringproject
implementation, a comprehensive Awareness BuildingProgram will be prepared and carried out



                                                  52

by the environmental and social specialist incollaboration with the Department o fEnvironment
and other relevant governmental institutions.

5.      Compliancewith ApplicabIe Safeguard Policies

The World Bank's policy on environment Assessment is triggeredby the fact that the SSP will
support construction and rehabilitation community-based infrastructure through a participatory
project with the potential o f localized environmental and social impacts albeit minor. An ESMF
and a RPFwere preparedand disclosed. The objectives o f these documents were to (i) the assess
environmental and social impacts of the expected sub-projects; (ii) outline environmental
management procedure and provide the requisite tools, including a screening process with sub-
project assessment forms and guidelines for mitigating impacts; and (iii) integrate environmental
considerations into each phase of the sub-project cycle. Both frameworks and their screening
processes will be incorporated inthe project's manual o fprocedures.

Recent Evolution o f the Education Sector

1.
6'h grade) inthe primary schools, Lower Secondary Education (7thto lothgrade) inthe Colleges,
        The education systemin Comoros i s organized infour levels: Primary Education (lst    to

Upper Secondary Education(1lth grade) inthe "Lycee" and, Post Secondary Education
                                   to 13'h
provided by a few Vocational Training Centers. In2002, the Comoros education system enrolled
a total o f some 132.8 thousand students, 73 percent o fwhom were inprimary schools. Early
childhood education is provided by Community Koranic Schools and Private Schools. Although
almost all children inthe age group o f 3 to 5 years are attending the Community Koranic
Schools, the latter are not regulated by the Comoros' administration and it is thus not connected
to the education system. The private preschool is still rare inthe country.

2.      Comoros is facing a substantial demand for education due to the highdemographic
growth rate o f about 2.7 percent. Although the Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) inprimary cycle
       ,
was 99' percent, the Net Enrollment Rate (NER) was very low, about 69 percent in2002, and the
net entry rate in 1st grade was 18 percent in 2000. These numbers reveal a unique feature o f the
education sector inComoros: late entry at 1st grade inprimary is very important inComoros.
About 85 percent o fprimary schools students are on average 2 years older than the
corresponding grade. This difference against the normal age increases as the grades increase.

3.      The Education system was affectedby the frequent political crisis inComoros. The
enrollment trends show an important decrease duringthe times o f political crisis, particularly in
1996 and 1998. The Government had a lot o f difficulties to face public education expenditures
and this ledto 19months arrears for teachers' salary payments in2001. Meanwhile, a boom o f
private schools was observed at primary and secondary education levels (11percent o fprimary
education students are enrolled inprivate schools and 52 percent in secondary). This situation
affected the quality and equity o fthe education system; particularly, public school teachers who
without resigning as public servants, deserted public schools inorder to work inprivate schools.



                                                  54

4.      Furtherto the stabilization o fthepolitical situation in2000, the education system has
been improving. The new regulation prohibiting public school teachers to work inprivate
schools as well as the recovery o f a regular school year (160 days) has improved the situation o f
public schools. Despite the agreements concluded between the Government and the Teachers
Union inearly 2003, the situation i s precarious since career promotion i s still frozen and arrears
on salary payments have not yet been solved.

PublicSpendingon Education

5.      Public spending4on Education relative to GDP is higher inComoros compared to other
low-income African countries. Available data shows that on average during the last decade;
Comoros allocated about 4 percent o f its GDP and 30 percent o f its whole public budget on
education. More than halfo f the public education spendingbenefited primary schools.
However, trends show that primary education share is decreasing in favor o f secondary education
during 1999to 2001.

6.      The share o f teachers and administrative staff salary comprises more than 95 percent in
the whole Education budget. Although Education salary expenditures form about 45 percent o f
the entire public staff salary, Education staffhowever, represents about 49 percent o fthe whole
public staff. Inother words, Education staff i s not as well paid as other public servants.
Moreover, although the educationpublic budget was earmarked for teachers' salaries, the
government was not able to pay it regularly. This explains the estimated arrears amounting to
about FC 3.5 billions on teacher's salary payment.

Efficiencyof the EducationSystem

7.      Regardingthe primary completion rate, the Comoros education system is still far from
the objective o f 100percent since the survival rate i s only about 41 percent at primary level.


 Without investmentspendingwhich is hndedby donors.


                                                     55

Only 26 percent go to lower secondary and 11percent to upper secondary. The education
system inComoros is very inefficient with a repetitionrate o f about 30 percent. Inaddition, the
education system i s wasting a lot o fresources by allowing students to repeat each grade twice. In
2001, the school life expectancy was estimated to 3.33 years and the student flow efficiency was
about 53 percent inAnjouan, 38 percent inMoheli and 46 percent inGrande Comore.
Therefore, inAnjouan 1.9 times more than the normal situation i s consumed, 2.2 inGrande
Comore and 2.6 inMoheli.

Equity

8.      Onthe equity side, the Comoros education system shows gender and regional disparities.
Inprimary and lower secondary education, girls show lower enrollment rates compared to boys.
The opposite is observed at upper secondary level. At primary level, in2001 the girls' GER was
90 percent compared to boys' GER of 104percent. Gender disparity i s more acute inAnjouan.

9.      Disparities in school access between rural andurban areas do not exist at the primary
level. Pupils inrural areas have access to primary schools since there are public primary schools
ineachvillage inComoros. However, particularly at the upper secondary level, enrollment in
urban area i s much higher than inrural areas.

10.     Since (i) unitcost isvery highat secondary level and, (ii) primary education i s very
inefficient, public spendingi s infavor o f those who reach upper grades. As a result, 10 percent
o fbest-educated people received 58 percent o fthe public spending in2002. However, interms
o fhousehold income, except in Grande Comore, public spendingbenefits more the poorest
population quintiles than the richest ones. This can be explained by the highenrollment o f
richest student in secondary private schools.

11.     Quantitatively, the Comoros primary education shows a good andhopeful trend
compared to other low-income countries. The ratio o f students per teacher o f 38 i s low. Taking
into account this low ratio, it can be concluded that there i s still room for the Comoros to face the
education demand. However, there is a need to review teachers deployment since wide
disparities were observed across areas in each island. Based on the current ratio studentper
teacher, it i s calculated that 47 percent o f urban primary schools and 21 percent o f rural primary
schools are over-staffed.

12.     Inadditionto disparities onteacher allocation, it hasbeennotedthat the creahn o f
schools at each village led (i)   to disparities on class size and, (ii) a great number o f unqualified
                                                                         to
teachers. A number o f teachers are incharge o f small classes, thereby increasing the unit cost.



                                                        57

About 23 percent o fclasses in Comoros have less than 30 students. To face the social demand
for education, the government was forced to recruit teachers among unqualified people (43
percent o f teachers are under-qualified inAnjouan, 31percent inMoheli and 66 percent in
Grande Comore).

13.      Regarding other education inputs, the Education Sector inComoros improved
significantly with the support o fthe Education I11Project and the FADC (both are fundedby
IDA): (1) 15 inspectors were trained with an objective o fone inspectorperpedagogicalzone, (2)
textbooks were delivered at a rate o f one textbook per student inthe 3 main subjects and (3) the
number o f classrooms increased by 25 percent.

14.      Consideringthat schools are providing two class rotations per day, there are overall
enough classrooms at primary public education (1,489), compared to the number o f classes
(2,587). Inreality, wide disparities have been observed betweenschools. During2002, about 13
percent o fpublic primary schools presented a shortfall whereas 46 percent were over-endowed.
For the coming years, the numbero f new classrooms needed for about 40 schools is estimated at
about 68 ,as illustrated intable 6. The calculation i s done by taking into account: (i)   the
situation per school, (ii)growth rate for the 6-11years age group population about 1percent.

15.      As part o f classroom construction, school environment inComoros needs to be improved.
The availability o f latrines at schools is a key factor for girl's enrolment. Ten percent o fpublic
primary schools do not provide such a facility. Forty percent ofprimary public schools have
only one latrine and therefore do not meet the standard objective o f having separated latrines for
boys and girls. For the remaining 50 percent primary public schools, although they have two
latrines, the number o f latrines per school still needs to be increased since the ratio student-
latrine is still very high. Access to water is also a very important issue inprimary public schools
since 80 percent o fthem do not have access to potable water.


Conclusion

16.      Inorderto meet demand for educationinComoros, the educationsystemfaces four
challenges: (i)   reducing late entry at primary level, (ii) increasing efficiency, (iii)
                                                                                       streamlining
the school map to ensure economies o f scale and, (iv) enhancing communities' contribution and
support to school development. To reduce late entry at primary level, it would be necessary to
review the Community Koranic Schools and tum them into a preparation for Primary Education,
thus eliminating aparallel education system. The low enrolment inprimary education is also due
to the important number o frepeaters at this level. Inaddition to the objective o fbetter enrolment


                                                   58

rates, increasing the efficiency o f the system will reduce investment costs in education
(classroom construction and teachers' recruitment). Savings are also possible inthe Comoros'
Education system by harmonizing the number o f studentsper teacher per school and the number
of students per class. To that end, the current school map needs to be reviewed.

17.      Obviously, the Education sector will still lack public resources for the coming years.
Mobilizing other channels to support education development i s therefore essential, particularly
that o f communities' support to schools. School committees havebeen created at all primary
public schools. However, they still need capacity buildinginorder to be fully able to play their
role efficiently.
