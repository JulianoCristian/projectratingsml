                         (i) increase access to short-term employment in food-insecure areas (new objective);
                         (ii) increase access to basic social services in poor communities (reformulated objective); and
                         (iii) contribute to building the capacity of communities to plan their development (reformulated objective)

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has continued to improve thanks to FADC's strong follow-up on the recommendations of successive implementation support missions. In particular, the

                         In terms of objectives:

                         1. The new US$1 million cash-for-work component introduced into the Project as part of the Restructuring and Co-Financing from GFRP in late 2009 is being implemented very
                         successfully: 30,000 person-days of employment have been created until June 15, 2010 benefitting 1,200 persons of whom over half are women,

                         2. There is a noticeable improvement in the fiduciary aspects of the Project (Procurement and Financial Management),

                         3. Environmental concerns related to a sub-project inOutsa on the island of Anjouan have been proactively addressed by FADC and the island Government,
