aims to maintain basic social and economic infrastructure\n            for a significant number of disadvantaged communities and\n            specific vulnerable groups; and contribute to building the\n            basic capacity of communities and local actors to conduct a\n            local development process. The success of the outcome of the\n            project in terms of maintaining basic social and economic\n            services will be measured by (i) number of students who\n            attend school in new or rehabilitated project schools and\n            classrooms; and (ii) number of persons in subproject areas\n            benefiting from a reduction in transport time and cost. With\n            respect to building capacity, the project will measure the\n            number of communities with development plans meeting\n            participatory process criteria. There are four main project\n            components along with one for project monitoring and\n            evaluation. 1) The Community-based Subprojects component\n            finances small-scale social and economic sub-projects\n            identified by communities, including classrooms and schools,\n            health posts, small scale water supply and sanitation, and\n            feeder roads. 2) The Capacity Building component supports\n            capacity building and social capital formation for\n            communities, related strategic capacity building for civil\n            society; and capacity building of the Fund to Support\n            Community Development (FADC) and various stakeholders. 3)\n            The Health Services component strengthens the technical\n            capacity of selected medical personnel through training in\n            specialized fields and through acquisition of critical\n            medical equipment. 4) The Urban Water Supply component\n            includes rehabilitation and extension of water supply in\n            five towns, finances capacity building of water management\n            committees, and launches information, education and\n            communication (IEC) campaigns on water management,\n            sanitation and hygiene."}, "docdt": "2004-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
