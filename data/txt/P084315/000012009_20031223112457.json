Credit Project has\n            the potential to make a significant contribution to\n            Comoros' policy to protect the natural resources base,\n            which the country's population depends on for their\n            livelihood, while also reducing poverty in rural areas.\n            Although it is still difficult to predict the overall\n            environmental and social impacts of the project, given these\n            are demand driven, considering however, the susceptibility\n            of the country's ecological system, and the potential\n            needs of the rural population, it is likely that: rural\n            livelihoods vis-\ufffd-vis the environment will have an adverse\n            impact; the weak human, and institutional capacity may\n            constrain the implementation of environmental and social\n            screening of subprojects; the differential impacts of\n            training, and level of investment may result in some\n            vulnerable groups relying on unsustainable use of natural\n            resources; new land tenure systems, and of governance vs.\n            traditional or religious systems, may conflict management\n            practices of unsustainable agricultural, and natural\n            resources, which for a fragile ecosystem may impact severely\n            on the environment; and, the rising population pressures, a\n            deteriorating resource base, climate change and agricultural\n            extension practices, may increase adversity. Mitigation\n            measures are suggested as follows. To prevent soil erosion,\n            landslides, contamination from wastes, and from excavation,\n            construction works should be implemented during the dry\n            season, protective fences should be installed on site\n            perimeters, surface areas and materials regularly sprayed,\n            adequate waste disposal, including chemicals and hazardous\n            materials, should be practices. Water resources conservation\n            practices should focus on drainage maintenance, alternative\n            alignments and retention ponds to prevent soil erosion; a\n            safe distance from wells, and sewage systems for latrines\n            sites. Construction schedules shall be restricted to limited\n            hours to prevent noise disturbances. Loss of natural\n            vegetation should be minimized, through alternative site\n            selection as possible, and re-vegetative practices."}, "docdt": "2003-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
