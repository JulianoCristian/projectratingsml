F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the project were to (i) maintain basic social and economic infrastructure
for a significant number of disadvantaged communities and specific vulnerable groups;
and (ii) contribute to building the basic capacity of communities and local actors to
conduct a local development process.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
A Co-financing and Restructuring was approved in July 2009 and revised the PDOs as
follows: (i) increase access to short term employment in food-insecure areas (new);
(ii) increase access to basic social services in poor communities (reformulated); and (iii)
contribute to building capacity of communities to plan their development (reformulated).

  Given the demand-driven nature of the Project target indicators could not be estimated a priori at the
Project’s Restructuring. The actual values at completion represent beneficiary community preferences.

  This indicator was revised to improve the ease of measurement; however, the 2011 economic assessment
of the Project included an evaluation of reduced transport time and cost resulting from these sub-projects.

                                    The original objectives also were
                                    reformulated, although the Project
                                    retained essentially the same focus and
                                    goals.

                                    The revision of the first original
                                    objective from maintaining social
                                    services in disadvantaged communities
                                    and specific vulnerable groups to
                                    increasing basic social services in poor
                                    communities did not substantially
                                    change the intended outcome to
                                    provide basic social services to
                                    beneficiary communities.

                                    The second original objective was
                                    reformulated from contribute to
                                    building the basic capacity of
                                    communities and local actors to
                                    conduct a local development process
                                    to contribute to building the capacity
                                    of communities to plan their
                                    development due to delays in the
                                    implementation of the Government’s
                                    decentralization strategy, including the
                                    creation of communes.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal and Restructuring

1.      The Union of the Comoros is a small post-conflict island country (population 680,000),
which consists of three islands (Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli) with a challenging
political situation. Since gaining independence from France in 1975, Comoros has suffered from
more than 20 coups and secession attempts and the resulting political instability has eroded
Government accountability and capacity. The 2001 Constitution, known as the Fomboni
Accords, was specifically tailored to put an end to these cycles of violence. However, in 2007
and 2008, another secession attempt by the island government of Anjouan resulted in an
international embargo of Anjouan and military action by the country’s Union government and
the African Union. Moreover, the Fomboni Accords created an unduly complex government
administration that expanded the size of the civil service and left few resources available for
health, education, and poverty alleviation.

2.      The country’s development is also constrained by physical isolation, limited resource
endowments, a small domestic market, a narrow export base (its main exports are cloves, vanilla,
and ylang-ylang, a perfume essence), and poor macroeconomic management. The economy of
the Union of the Comoros remains dependent on food imports and remittances and thus is
particularly susceptible to international shocks. Approximately half of the country’s food
consumption is imported (mostly rice, meat, and cooking oil) and remittances represent about
one-fifth of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). The 2008 international economic
slowdown and food price crisis substantially increased the vulnerabilities of the poorest
Comorians. The prices of rice, vegetable oil, and meat increased by over 50 percent in 2008 and
the prices of dairy products (mostly dried milk) doubled. Moreover, having consumed or
otherwise disposed of their few assets to cope with the crisis, households were increasingly
vulnerable to future shocks.

3.     The country’s ongoing political crises and limited economic growth have contributed to
decreasing per capita incomes and relatively poor standards of living. The country’s per capita
income, which was USD 412 in 1980, had fallen to USD 365 by 2003 at Project preparation.
Although limited data exist in Comoros regarding the country’s human development indicators,
the few analyses that have been conducted in the past decade reveal universally poor results. In
2002, the Government conducted a poverty perception study that highlighted people’s
perceptions of the overall inaccessibility of basic social services, as detailed in Table 1 below. A
2005 household survey, which was conducted by the Government and UNDP, revealed a
national poverty rate of 36.9 percent and a rural poverty rate of 41.1 percent. In 2008, UNICEF
commissioned a study that showed that approximately one third of children under five years of
age were chronically malnourished.

Perception of adequate access to:            Average        Grande Comore         Anjouan        Mohéli

Safe drinking water                              23.3%              39.0%             9.1%         14.1%

4.      The Government’s inability to provide access to basic social services justified the
adoption of non-traditional service delivery mechanisms to address this shortcoming. Based on
the 2002 poverty perceptions survey, less than 50 percent of the Comorian population thought
that they had adequate access to primary education, safe drinking water, or sanitation. Moreover,
recent IDA-financed projects in the health and water sectors highlighted the Government’s weak
implementation capacity and were rated Unsatisfactory at closure. By contrast, the autonomous
Fonds d’Appui au Développement Communautaire (FADC) constructed 161 community
infrastructures across Comoros’ three islands under the Social Fund Project (IDA Credit 3011-
COM). This is a significant achievement given that, through these activities, FADC reached
nearly half of the total 331 communities in Comoros (as based on the country’s 2003 census).

5.      The World Bank’s involvement in Comoros sought to improve the provision of basic
services for the population given the absence of a functioning governmental structure. At Project
preparation, the Bank was developing a two-year Transitional Support Strategy Update (TSSU)
for Comoros that, based on the lessons of the 2004 World Development Report (WDR),
emphasized the delivery of services through non-traditional channels and increased
accountability through community involvement. Through the Services Support Project (SSP),
the TSSU aimed to leverage the country’s limited IDA allocation by continuing previously
successful efforts by the FADC to increase standards of living through improved access to social
services. In further support of this, the Project emphasized increased accountability through
community-based development planning and community contributions. Moreover, given the
relative capacity of the FADC, the Bank also designed the SSP to continue its support for
improved access to health and water services. The SSP was the only Bank lending operation
under the TSSU.

6.      Given the country’s continuing political instability, institutional fragility, and weak
capacity, other donors also focused on streamlining their support with efforts to systematically
exploit synergies between their respective programs. At appraisal, there were a limited number
of donors operating in Comoros. The Agence Française de Développement (AFD), a major
development partner, had scaled-back its intervention to small grant projects being implemented
by non-governmental agencies. The European Union (EU) was developing projects on
decentralization and the education sector. During Project preparation, the World Bank
coordinated closely with the AFD and the EU to ensure complementary of financing in these
areas and to prevent the duplication of efforts, especially concerning the construction and
rehabilitation of classrooms. No donors were active in the health or water sectors at the time of
Project preparation.

1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The SSP was approved on March 11, 2004 and became effective on September 29, 2004
(IDA Credit 3868-COM). Its original PDOs were to (i) maintain basic social and economic
infrastructure for a significant number of disadvantaged communities and specific vulnerable
groups and (ii) contribute to building the basic capacity of communities and local actors to
conduct a local development process. The key indicators of the original PDOs were:
       (1) Number of students in FADC built/rehabilitated schools/classrooms;
       (2) Number of persons in sub-project area benefiting from a reduction in transport time
           and cost; and
                                               2
         (3) Number of communities with development plans meeting participatory criteria.
1.3. Revised PDO and Key Indicators

8.     The Project’s Additional Financing in the amount of USD 5.0 million (SDR 3.4 million)
increased the total SSP allocation to USD 18.3 million (SDR 12.4 million). It was approved on
December 21, 2006 and became effective on May 22, 2007 (IDA Grant H265-COM). The
Additional Financing maintained the original PDO and key indicators, while scaling up activities
for community-based sub-projects and capacity building and also providing incremental
resources for Project M&E and audits.

9.       The Project’s Co-financing and Restructuring provided USD 1 million from the Global
Food Price Crisis Response (GFPCR) Trust Fund. It was approved on July 2, 2009 and became
effective on December 22, 2009 (TF094537).9 The Restructuring revised the PDOs as follows:
(i) increase access to short-term employment in food-insecure areas (new); (ii) increase access to
basic social services in poor communities (reformulated); and (iii) contribute to building the
capacity of communities to plan their development (reformulated). This was a Level One
Restructuring. The key indicators were revised as follows:
         (1) Number of beneficiaries of cash-for-work program;
         (2.1) Number of students enrolled in FADC built/rehabilitated schools or classrooms;
         (2.2) Number of people in project areas with access to improved water source;
         (2.3) Number of people in project areas benefiting from improved roads; and
         (3) Number of local development plans completed.

10.    In response to the 2008 food price crisis, the adaptive Restructuring introduced a new
PDO corresponding to the new safety net activities financed by the GFPCR Trust Fund. The
new SSP objective aimed to mitigate the negative impact of increasing food prices through the
introduction of a cash-for-work program.

11.     Although the original objectives were reformulated, the Project retained essentially the
same focus and goals as evidenced by the similarity between the key outcome indicators before
and after the Restructuring. The revision of the first original objective from maintaining social
services in disadvantaged communities and specific vulnerable groups to, after the
Restructuring, increasing basic social services in poor communities did not substantially change
the intended outcome to provide basic social services to beneficiary communities, the targeting
of which remained based on relative poverty, remoteness, primary school enrollment rates, and
existing access to basic social services. No vulnerable groups identified under the original PDO
were excluded from the Project following the Restructuring. The original second objective was
reformulated from contribute to building the basic capacity of communities and local actors to
conduct a local development process to, after the Restructuring, contribute to building the
capacity of communities to plan their development. The political instability resulting from the
secession attempt by Anjouan in 2007 and 2008 delayed the Government’s decentralization
reforms and the establishment of local government structures (termed ‘communes’ in Comoros),

which were the intended beneficiary of the capacity building to local actors specified in the
original objective.



12.    The closing date was extended to June 30, 2010 under the Additional Financing and to
June 30, 2011 under the Co-financing and Restructuring.

1.4. Main Beneficiaries

13.     The SSP benefited participating communities that were targeted based on the poverty
rates, remoteness, inaccessibility, school enrollment rates, and the lack of basic social services.
The Project used these criteria to target disadvantaged, poor, and food insecure communities and,
within these communities, also targeted specific vulnerable groups. The Project originally aimed
to target around 30 percent of the country’s communities; this was increased to approximately 50
percent at the Project’s Restructuring.

14.    The Project also originally envisioned benefiting local government actors; however, as
noted above, the Government’s decentralization policy was delayed and local government
communes have not yet been established. This activity was removed at the Project’s
Restructuring.

1.5. Original Components

15.      The original Credit provided financing for:

      a) Community-based sub-projects (USD 5.3 million): this component financed small-
         scale social and economic sub-projects identified by communities, such as classrooms
         and schools, health posts, small-scale water supply and sanitation, and feeder roads. This
         included both the rehabilitation and new construction of infrastructures. This component
         correlates with the Project’s first original PDO to maintain basic social and economic
         infrastructures, specifically the key indicators relating to the number of students in FADC
         built/rehabilitated schools and classrooms and the number of persons benefiting from
         reduced transport time and cost.

      b) Capacity building (USD 600,000): this component supported capacity building and
         social capital formation for communities, including information and education
         campaigns, related strategic capacity building for civil society, and capacity building of
         the FADC and various stakeholders. This component correlates with the Project’s second
         original PDO to build local capacity to conduct development processes, specifically the
         key indicator regarding the number of communities with development plans meeting
         participatory criteria.

      c) Health services (USD 1.2 million): the technical capacity of selected medical personnel
         in Comoros was to be strengthened through training in specialized fields and through the
         acquisition of critical medical equipment. This component correlates with the Project’s
         first original PDO to maintain basic social and economic infrastructures.


                                                  4
   d) Urban water supply (USD 2.1 million): these activities included rehabilitation and
      extension of water supply in three towns in Anjouan and two towns in Mohéli. This
      component also financed capacity building of water management committees and
      education campaigns on water management, sanitation, and hygiene. This component
      correlates with the Project’s first original PDO to maintain basic social and economic
      infrastructures.

   e) Project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and audits (USD 3.1 million): FADC
      operating costs and technical assistance to undertake the audits were included in this
      component. In addition, this component supported M&E activities and an impact
      evaluation of the community-based activities. Additional activities also aimed to
      promote local accountability and improved long-term development outcomes:
      participatory monitoring and evaluation by beneficiary communities and external
      monitoring by the media.

1.6. Revised Components

16.    The Co-financing and Restructuring revised the project components, adding a new cash-
for-work program and combining the original first and second components into one
comprehensive community-driven basic infrastructure activity.

   a)                                        Social safety net (cash-for-work) (USD 850,000
        from the GFPCR Trust Fund): this component financed a cash-for-work program to
        increase short-term employment in food-insecure areas to raise incomes and thus improve
        food consumption, particularly of vulnerable groups. This component correlates with the
        revised PDO to increase access to short-term employment in food-insecure areas,
        specifically the key indicator regarding the number of beneficiaries of the cash-for-work
        program.

   b)                                        Community-driven basic infrastructure (USD 6.8
        million from the original Credit and USD 3.6 million from the Additional Financing):
        under the Co-financing and Restructuring, this component merged the first two of the
        original components and therefore consisted of two interrelated activities, the financing
        of small-scale social and economic infrastructures identified by the community and
        capacity building for communities and related capacity building for civil society and
        various stakeholders. This component correlates with the revised second and third PDOs
        to increase access to basic social services in poor communities and to contribute to
        building the capacity of communities to plan their development. The related key
        indicators are (i) the number of students enrolled in FADC built or rehabilitated schools
        or classrooms, (ii) the number of people in the project area with access to an improved
        water source, (iii) the number of people benefiting from improved roads, and (iv) the
        number of local development plans completed.

   c)                                      Health services (USD 900,000 from the Original
        Credit): this component was not amended by the Co-financing and Restructuring.




                                                5
    d)                                  Urban water supply (USD 2.7 million from the
         Original Credit): this component was not amended by the Co-financing and
         Restructuring.

    e)                                        Project management, M&E, and audit (USD 2.9
         from the Original Credit, USD1.4 million from the Addition Financing, and USD
         150,000 from the GFPCR Trust Fund): under the Co-financing and Restructuring,
         additional resources were allocated to this component for the operating, M&E, and audit
         costs of the newly added social safety net component.

1.7. Other significant changes
17.     There were also two Reallocations of the original Credit during implementation, as
detailed in Table 2 below. The first Reallocation, in February 2006, increased budgetary
allocations for (i) Works to benefit the urban water supply component, (ii) Training to benefit the
FADC staff and community trainings as well as for medical scholarships, and (iii) Incremental
Operating Costs. It was approved by the Regional Vice President. The second Reallocation, in
October 2009, increased the allocations for (i) Grants for Sub-project given increased costs due
to currency fluctuations and increased import prices, (ii) Works given higher than expected costs
of the rehabilitations under the urban water supply component, and (iii) a minimal increase in the
allocation to Training. It was approved by the Country Director. Overall, the Project realized
lower than expected costs for Goods and Vehicles as well as Consultants’ Services under the
original Credit. No reallocations were processed for the Additional Financing (IDA Grant H265-
COM) or Co-financing (TF094537).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18.     The Project design was aligned with the Government of Comoros Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), which was in draft during Project preparation, the World
Bank TSSU, and international best practices. The fifth pillar of the draft I-PRSP focused on
social services and social service delivery. In support of the Government’s development
objectives, the 2004 TSSU reoriented the existing portfolio toward service delivery through
                                             6
community structures and identified the SSP as the main instrument of Bank support to
Comoros. As noted above, under the TSSU, the SSP was the Bank’s only lending operation in
Comoros due to the Government’s limited implementation capacity. International best practices
supported this approach. The Low Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) principles
emphasize the provision of basic services by nongovernmental actors in countries, such as
Comoros, where conventional channels of social service delivery have broken down. Such
contexts are typically characterized by both weak political accountability for policies and
performance as well as technical and institutional weaknesses of public service providers. The
lessons of the 2004 World Development Report also emphasized the delivery of services through
non-traditional channels and increased accountability through community involvement.

19.     Given the relative capacity of the FADC and the TSSU’s identification of the SSP as the
Bank’s sole lending operation, the SSP’s preparation included health and water supply activities
that had been supported under two previous IDA-financed projects that experienced
implementation challenges. In continuance of the objectives of the World Bank’s Health Project
(IDA Credit 3043-COM), which closed June 30, 2004, the SSP undertook the maintenance and
procurement of equipment for public health facilities and also financed the continuing
international education of Comorian medical students identified under the Health Project. The
SSP also undertook to improve water delivery services in urban areas. These activities were
previously supported through the Infrastructure, Water, and Environment Project (IDA Credit
3468-COM), which closed July 31, 2003. The Health Project and the Infrastructure, Water, and
Environment Project were rated Unsatisfactory at closure.

20.     At appraisal, the SSP’s overall risk rating was Substantial in recognition of the
challenging and unstable operating environment. Despite the 2001 Fomboni Accords, the risk of
political instability remained high, as did the potential for this instability to interfere with the
Project’s implementation. Moreover, the sustainability of SSP-financed sub-projects was at risk
given the limited capacity of both the Government (such as its inability to finance teachers) and
the beneficiary communities (who would become responsible for ongoing maintenance). The
Project also identified risk mitigation measures regarding the FADC’s ability to adopt and
implement the participatory methods reinforced under the Project’s design, in particular technical
assistance from a World Bank Senior Social Protection Specialist. This rating was maintained at
the Project’s Restructuring.

21.    No Quality at Entry review was conducted by the Quality Assurance Group.

2.2. Implementation

22.     Project implementation was punctuated by the Additional Financing, approved in
December 2006, and the Co-financing and Restructuring, approved in July 2009. The Additional
Financing was informed by the Project’s Mid-term Review (MTR), which was conducted in
September 2006 and reflected the outcomes of the 2005 technical audit of the Project. The MTR
found that the Project was Satisfactory and reconfirmed the relevance of the PDOs; however, it
did provide recommendations for the strengthening of community and stakeholder trainings,
environmental protection measures, and M&E. These lessons were incorporated into the
Additional Financing, the Project Operation Manual, and the Administrative and Accounting
Procedures Manual. In addition, the Additional Financing included three communal sub-projects
pilots; however, the Co-financing and Restructuring removed the three pilots, as these activities
                                               7
were closely tied to the implementation of the Government’s decentralization plan, including the
creation of local government communes, which experienced delays following the political
instability due to the 2007/2008 secession attempt by Anjouan.

23.    The Co-financing and Restructuring included a new cash-for-work component to mitigate
the negative impacts of the 2008 food price crisis, streamlined the Project’s original components,
and focused on overcoming implementation challenges that surfaced in 2007 and 2008. In April
2007, the deterioration of Project management was first formally raised by the World Bank to the
Ministry of Finance in an aide memoire transmittal letter. The Project was referred to INT in
October 2007 and the Project Management rating was downgraded to Unsatisfactory after the
subsequent supervision mission. A preliminary review of Project performance suggested that the
root causes of the weaknesses observed in procurement, financial management, and safeguards
performance were due to serious failures in Project management. In April 2009, the National
Executive Director of the FADC resigned and was replaced by the Regional Director for
Anjouan. This change in personnel was accompanied by an institutional audit to outline
necessary reforms within the FADC. Both actions corresponded with the steady increase in
management performance. In December 2009, project implementation was upgraded to
Moderately Satisfactory, as a result of the FADC’s reorganization and adherence to the
recommendations of the institutional audit. The INT Final Investigation Report was issued in
September 2010; its findings showed that these issues did not have an impact on the achievement
of the Project’s outcomes. Moreover, these management challenges did not impact progress
toward the PDO, which remained Moderately Satisfactory or Satisfactory throughout the Project.

24.     At the national level, although the Project was designed with specific attention to the lack
of Government capacity throughout Comoros, the country’s broader institutional environment
affected the SSP. The 2007/2008 political crisis, following the island of Anjouan’s attempt to
secede from the Union of Comoros, resulted in an international embargo against the island and
created delays in the construction of the sub-projects being implemented there during that period.
As noted above, the instability resulting from this crisis contributed to the Government’s delayed
progress toward decentralization, which prevented the Project from providing capacity building
to the local government communes. Moreover, during Project implementation, the Union of
Comoros was suspended from IDA on five occasions, resulting from the Government’s delayed
loan payments.10 These suspensions prevented the FADC and beneficiary communities from
making timely payments to contractors and consultants thus impeding sub-project completion.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
25.     The M&E design reflected the low capacity context in which the Project was
implemented. Given the limited data available in Comoros, the Project supported the
Government’s and UNDP’s undertaking of a household survey, completed in 2005. This
information was used to help target beneficiary communities based on relative poverty levels,
remoteness, and existing access to social services. Moreover, although the M&E framework was
largely output-based to reflect the low capacity context, the design emphasized building the
FADC’s M&E capacity and included various studies that served to augment the data available on
Project outputs and outcomes. By the Project’s close, the FADC had commissioned a

10
 These five IDA suspensions were from March 1 to 14, 2008; August 28 to September 8, 2008; November 18 to
December 17, 2008; April 2 to 30, 2009; and July 31 to September 16, 2009.
                                                     8
beneficiary assessment (2007), an economic analysis (2011), an institutional audit (2009), an
initial assessment of the cash-for-work activities (2010), and two technical audits (2005 and
2010).

26.      Throughout Project implementation, there was a strong commitment from the FADC to
improve and institutionalize its M&E capacity. By the MTR in September 2006, the FADC had
established a computerized, integrated system for monitoring as well as a simplified method for
data collection. Both the Additional Financing and Co-financing and Restructuring revised the
Project’s M&E framework, the former based on findings of the MTR and the latter on the 2009
institutional audit. At the time of the 2009 audit, weaknesses in M&E were recorded due to
prolonged absences of key personnel and the M&E rating was Unsatisfactory from June to
September 2009. The situation improved following the appointment of an interim director of
M&E in April 2009 and the recruitment of a permanent director in October 2009, following the
lifting of an IDA suspension. Overall, the FADC was able to adapt to these modifications and
maintained a strong database of information on Project outputs and outcomes. The Bank
received regular and timely implementation reports throughout the Project.

27.    The FADC used the information and lessons learned through its M&E system and
various reports to improve Project activities as well as the overall functioning of the
organization. The 2005 technical audit, which was based on the FADC’s M&E data, was used to
improve the technical quality of the SSP sub-projects. The 2009 institutional audit guided the
reorganization of the FADC following its period of mismanagement. In 2009, the FADC also
began the recruitment of Bureaux d’études to provide technical support for sub-project
construction based on lessons learned. The 2010 audit noted the utility of these external agencies
to ensure the quality of the infrastructures constructed by the Project.

28.     Under the original Credit, the Project M&E and audits component outlined that the
Project would incorporate external monitoring by the media. This activity was not realized given
the low capacity of the media in Comoros and was removed under the Co-financing and
Restructuring.

2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     At closing, the Project’s safeguard and fiduciary compliance was rated Satisfactory. The
original Project Appraisal Document (PAD) noted the need for continued capacity building
within the FADC. Steady improvements in performance were witnessed in the beginning of the
Project and the Task Team worked to institutionalize the FADC’s compliance. However,
between 2008 and 2009, compliance deteriorated significantly, in parallel with the overall
decline of the FADC’s management performance. Key staff were absent for extended periods of
time without adequate back-up; the annual reports and budgets were submitted late and in poor
quality. In June 2009, the ratings for financial management, procurement, and safeguard
compliance were downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory. This coincided with the
appointment of a new National Executive Director at the FADC, after which the Project again
began realizing increased capacity. Among other changes, the Internal Auditor function was
reinforced and revised. By September 2009, financial management was upgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory, safeguard compliance was upgraded in December 2009, and procurement was
upgraded in June 2010.

                                                9
30.     Environmental and social safeguards. The Project Environmental Category was rated B,
requiring a partial assessment, since the SSP supported construction and rehabilitation of
community-based infrastructures with the potential of environmental and social impacts. The
Project also triggered OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement. The Integrated Safeguards Data
Sheet was originally disclosed on January 5, 2004; it was updated and re-disclosed on October
31, 2006 and June 9, 2009 during the preparation of the Additional Financing and Co-financing
and Restructuring, respectively. Under the previous FADC-implemented Social Fund Project, an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF) had been prepared and were disclosed on December 3, 2003. As part of the
Co-financing and Restructuring, the ESMF was revised and re-disclosed on March 23, 2010. No
safeguard audits were conducted under the Project.

31.     Safeguard compliance was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory from June to December
2009. In June 2009, a supervision mission identified that the ESMF and RPF were not
systematically applied by the FADC or the communities. Mitigation measures implemented at
sub-project sites also were found to be insufficient, particularly in regards to environmental
degradation. In response, the FADC hired a full-time safeguard specialist. The mission held a
training on the FADC safeguard manuals and recommended the widespread dissemination of
these manuals in the local language, which was undertaken in July and August 2009. By the
following mission in November 2009, the Task Team witnessed marked improvements,
particularly resulting from the recruitment of a new safeguard specialist by FADC in August
2009. The safeguard compliance rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in December
2009 and to Satisfactory in October 2010. There were no cases throughout the Project in which
people were displaced by sub-project construction, although strips of land were acquired along
the edges of some road sub-projects.

32.     Financial management and procurement.              Overall, financial management and
procurement compliance were satisfactory and ongoing capacity building allowed the FADC to
steadily improve its performance. The MTR noted progress to correct early delays in the
recruitment of an Internal Auditor and improvements in the quality of the financial reports.
However, in April 2009, a mission outlined several shortcomings within the FADC’s financial
management capacity, which resulted in a rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory. A subsequent
financial management review of the FADC was conducted in September 2009 and found that the
majority of recommendations from the April mission had been implemented. Specifically, the
review highlighted the submission of a budget to the World Bank through June 30, 2011 (the
Project’s closing date), the ongoing recruitment of an external auditor, and the timely preparation
of Project IFRs. The FADC also had begun the processes of updating its financial management
software. In 2010, trainings for the FADC’s financial management team further improved
general bookkeeping. The rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory by September 2009
and rated Satisfactory as of October 2010.

33.     Procurement was rated Unsatisfactory from June 2009 to June 2010. A procurement post
review conducted in April 2009 found weaknesses in all procurement areas, including
managerial organization, controls and potential conflicts of interest, procurement processes,
management of contracts, and filing systems. Two contracts, totaling KMF 1,733,000
(approximately USD 4,840), were found to be ineligible expenditures under the SSP. Of this
total, KMF 975,000 had already been disbursed and was subsequently reimbursed; FADC had

                                                10
not yet disbursed the remaining KMF 785,000. Under new leadership, the FADC quickly
implemented the recommendations of the April 2009 mission and the institutional audit,
including more clearly defining the responsibilities of procurement staff as well as hiring
additional personnel. By the November 2009 mission, the Task Team witnessed improvements
in the quality of procurement submissions. Procurement training was conducted by a World
Bank consultant in April 2010 and the procurement rating was upgraded to Moderately
Satisfactory following another procurement post review in the first half of 2010. By the
Project’s close, the Procurement rating was Satisfactory.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

34.      In keeping with the objectives of the SSP, the World Bank has provided financing to the
Government for the FADC to continue its support for increased access to short-term employment
opportunities through cash-for-work activities and to basic social services through community-
driven development processes. The Emergency Food Security and Unemployment Support
through Cash-for-Work Program (TF097191) provides USD 2.366 million to cash-for-work
activities through the Japan Social Development Fund and the Emergency Crises Response
Project (H572-KM) provides SDR 3.5 million to cash-for-work and community-driven
development activities. Both Projects were approved in June 2010. In addition, the Coastal
Resources Co-management for Sustainable Livelihood Project received approval for financing
from the Japanese Social Development Fund in April 2011 and includes USD 1.18 million for
activities to be implemented by the FADC that aim to support capacity building and the
construction of basic infrastructures within communities of fishermen.

35.     The Emergency Crises Response Project includes activities to continue supporting
capacity building of communities to manage and oversee their own development processes;
however, the social infrastructures supported under the SSP are intended to be maintained by the
beneficiary communities themselves. Given the small size of the country, the FADC allows for
multiple sub-projects to be completed in one community. It is thus possible that some of the SSP
beneficiary communities will receive further training through the ongoing Projects; however, no
specific mechanisms have been established to ensure continued support to SSP beneficiary
communities. As detailed in Section 4 below, limitations in the ability of these communities to
maintain the SSP-financed community sub-projects have already appeared.

36.     In the health and water sectors, other donor partners are currently financing and providing
technical assistance in continuance of activities that the SSP supported. In regards to the SSP
health component, the AFD Projet d’Appui au Secteur de la Santé aux Comores (PASCO),
which closes December 31, 2014, includes support for the institutionalization of maintenance
capacity for critical medical equipment, although this activity remains under preparation. For the
urban water component, the African Development Bank (AfDB), through its Projet
d’Alimentation en Eau Potable et d’Assainissement that began in late 2010, will continue to
support capacity building efforts for the water users associations and will undertake additional
structural rehabilitations necessary to further improve water delivery in the two locations where
the SSP was involved. At Project preparation, no such donor financing was available and the
SSP, critically, prevented a lapse in donor support to these key sectors.



                                                11
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory
37.      The Project’s objectives, design, and implementation remain relevant. At preparation,
the Government supported the Project objectives to maintain social and economic infrastructures
while building local capacity in development processes. When the Government of Comoros
submitted its final I-PRSP to the World Bank in May 2006, the Project remained relevant within
this development strategy. The SSP activities aligned with three of the seven core strategic axes
of the I-PRSP, including economic growth through infrastructure development, improving health
conditions, and promoting education. The Project retained its relevant under the Government’s
first full Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Paper (PRGSP), adopted in September 2009,
which included the objective of improving human development outcomes through better social
service delivery. The Project’s indictors, including the number of people benefiting from
improved roads and the number of students attending FADC constructed or rehabilitated schools,
were relevant to the strategic objectives of both the I-PRSP and the PRGSP.

38.      The Project’s design reflected the absence of functioning Government structures capable
of providing basic services to the population. The Project leveraged the FADC’s capacity not
only to work with communities to prioritize and realize their development needs but also to
provide continuing support for the health and water sectors despite the Government’s limited
capacity in these areas. While the addition of the health and urban water components rendered
the Project design complex, particularly with the LICUS context, their inclusion was justified not
only given the Government’s weak capacity in the provision of these services but also the lack of
other donors active in the health and water sectors at Project preparation. The M&E design also
reflected the low capacity context in which the Project was operating. As noted above, very little
national household data exists in Comoros and the SSP therefore contributed resources to a
household survey conducted by the Government and UNDP (completed in 2005). This survey
helped the FADC to more accurately target poor communities. The M&E system within the
organization remained largely based on administrative data; however, the FADC supported a
beneficiary assessment (2007), an economic analysis (2011), an institutional audit (2009), an
initial assessment of the cash-for-work activities (2010), and two technical audits (2005 and
2010) to augment its information regarding the Project’s outputs and outcomes.

39.      The Additional Financing and Co-financing and Restructuring responded to the country’s
ongoing and evolving needs while recognizing the continuing relevance of the SSP design and
implementation arrangements. In 2006, Comoros remained categorized as a LICUS and the
continued use of non-traditional social services providers, such as the FADC, remained relevant.
That year, the SSP MTR also confirmed the Project’s design and implementation. The Bank,
therefore, allocated an additional USD 5 million from IDA for the expansion of the SSP
activities. In 2009, the Co-financing and Restructuring responded to mitigate the negative
impacts of the 2008 international food price crisis within food insecure households by adding the
cash-for-work component to the SSP. It also streamlined the original community-based sub-
project and capacity-building components into a single component that focused comprehensively
on community development through both infrastructure construction and capacity building. The
Restructuring, however, maintained two independent development objectives related to these
activities. The first objective was not substantially revised and continued to reflect the Project’s
                                                 12
ongoing aim to provide basic social services to beneficiary communities. As noted above,
beneficiary targeting remained unchanged. Under the second objective, the Project’s envisioned
support for local government communes, which had yet to be established, was removed to reflect
delays in the Government’s decentralization process, in part due to the secession attempt by
Anjouan and resulting political instability. The key indicators also remained relevant and
included the addition of one indicator regarding the number of beneficiaries of the cash-for-work
component and another regarding access to improved water sources relating to both the
community infrastructure and urban water components.

40.     Various World Bank analyses have continued to support the relevance of the Project’s
objectives, design, and implementation. The World Bank Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Fiscal
Year 2010-2012 reconfirmed the SSP and related follow-on interventions as key responses to its
first objective of reducing social vulnerability through increased access to basic social and
economic services and temporary employment opportunities. The ISN also noted the
appropriateness of the FADC as “the only institution in Comoros with the management, staffing,
administrative capacity, and decentralized structure to be able to effectively implement projects
on all three islands under emergency conditions.” The Project’s ongoing relevance is further
reinforced by the 2010 Comoros Quick Assessment of the Global Context and of the Bank ISN,
which found “obviously huge needs for community type development. Given (i) the lack of
experienced operators, (ii) the extremely low overall capacity in the country, (iii) the very low
disbursement rates on most donor projects, (iv) the broadly satisfactory progress enjoyed by the
FADC project, and (v) the significant management and technical capacity of the project unit,
continued support for this operation is fully justified.” The Note also highlighted the utility of
leveraging additional resources to respond to the 2008 food price crisis and the relevance of this
intervention even after prices normalized internationally, given the lingering effects of the food
price increases in Comoros.

41.    The rating of Satisfactory is applied for before and after the Project’s Restructuring, as
the primary objectives to provide access to basic social services and build capacity within
beneficiary communities were maintained and remain a critical component of Government and
World Bank development strategies in Comoros. Moreover, the addition of the cash-for-work
component highlights the Project’s ability to respond to the evolving country context.

3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

42.     The achievement of the Project Development Objectives is rated Satisfactory given the
Project’s performance against its key outcome indicators. The 2007 beneficiary assessment and
2011 economic analysis highlight the linkages between these indicators and the positive
outcomes within beneficiary communities related to the provision of basic social services and the
building of community capacity. A 2010 initial assessment of the cash-for-work component also
offers anecdotal evidence of the outcomes within beneficiary communities related to the increase
in access to short-term employment.

3.2.1. Original PDO


                                               13
Specific Objective 1: maintain basic social and economic infrastructure for a significant number
of disadvantaged communities and specific vulnerable groups.

43.     The Project’s achievement of the objective to maintain basic social infrastructures is
evidenced by the significant progress toward the corresponding outcome and intermediate
indicators made prior to the Restructuring. The maintenance of basic social infrastructures was
measured by (i) the number of students in FADC built or rehabilitated schools or classrooms and
(ii) the number of people benefiting from a reduction in transport time and cost. By the
Restructuring in 2009, 3,520 students were enrolled in Project-supported schools, well above the
target of 980 students, and 25,695 people had access to improved roads, again above the target of
22,800 people.11 Sixty one sub-projects had been completed and were benefiting 91
communities, in comparison with the respective targets of 70 sub-projects and 78 communities.
These 91 communities benefiting from the SSP represent 27 percent of the total 331
communities in Comoros. Moreover, 89 percent of beneficiary communities had met the
established deadlines regarding their contributions to the sub-projects and 93 percent reported
conducting maintenance on the completed sub-projects, compared with targets of 90 percent and
70 percent respectively.12

44.      Sampling 30 sub-projects completed before and after the Restructuring, the 2011
economic analysis of the SSP highlights the positive impact of this increased access to basic
social and economic infrastructures on the quality of life within beneficiary communities. Rural
road sub-projects helped facilitate better movement of goods and people, improved commerce,
and a reduction of prices of basic household goods. Specifically, in the six rural road sub-
projects sampled, there was an average increase of seven taxi or truck drivers and 10 market
sellers per beneficiary community following the road rehabilitation. In two of these
communities, the economic analysis also found a 50 percent and 25 percent reduction in the
prices of soap and cooking oil, respectively. The economic analysis, however, did not consider
factors exogenous to the road sub-projects that could have contributed to these outcomes. The
proximity of improved water sources afforded a significant time savings to community members,
particularly women and girls, based on the research of the 2011 economic analysis. In the five
sampled communities with improved water sources, people reported savings of 30 minutes to 3.5
hours per day searching for water due to the SSP intervention. Sampled communities also self-
reported fewer cases of diseases associated with poor drinking water and unsanitary living
conditions, such as diarrhea, malaria, cholera, and typhoid linked to these improved water
sources and the sanitation sub-projects. Regarding the classroom constructions, in one
community, the addition of the three classrooms financed by the Project allowed the school to
offer classes for the fifth and sixth grade. In addition, one of the two sampled communities
where the SSP financed the construction of small dikes was able to reclaim arable land as a result
of this intervention.

45.    The SSP health component contributed to the maintenance of basic social infrastructures
and had achieved the corresponding intermediate indicators by the Project’s 2009 Restructuring.
The Project financed international scholarships for 22 medical personnel, with a range of

11
   The FADC measured this indicator (the number of people benefiting from a reduction in transport time and cost)
by the number of people with access to improved roads.
12
   The indicators reported in this paragraph are based on the FADC’s administrative data.

                                                       14
specialties including cardiology, pediatrics, and hospital administration.           Before the
Restructuring, 95 percent of these students had returned to Comoros to work in the health sector,
as compared with a target of 90 percent. The retention of these additional qualified personnel is
particularly important in the context of the low overall capacity of this sector. Moreover, the
SSP had financed the maintenance or rehabilitation of 41 pieces of medical equipment in five
hospitals across the country’s three islands, two in Grande Comore, two in Anjouan, and one in
Mohéli. Seventy six percent of this equipment was operational and maintained in a satisfactory
manner, although no target was specified against which to compare this percentage. The Project
also supported the purchase of medical equipment in three health centers (two on Grande
Comore and one on Anjouan) and consumables such as pharmaceuticals and other medical
supplies for a health center in Anjouan.

46.     In addition, the urban water component reinforced the Project objective to maintain basic
social services through its provision of drinking water within 100 meters to 93 percent of the
population in the project intervention area. This surpassed the component’s intermediate
indicator target of 75 percent of households.13 However, the number of beneficiary communities
was reduced during Project implementation when the costs of constructing five water supply
systems were realized to exceed the urban water component’s budgetary allocation. The
Government decided to focus on constructing two systems, one in the capital city of Mohéli
(Fomboni) and the other in the capital city of Anjouan (Mutsamudu). Prior to the Restructuring,
although the FADC had progressed in recruiting a contractor to conduct public awareness
campaigns on water management, hygiene, and sanitation, the contract was delayed due to IDA
suspensions. Therefore, the Project had not met the target that 50 percent of the population with
access to drinking water from the Project intervention was knowledgeable about water use and
management. The Project also was unable to measure the percent of the population within the
Project intervention area that paid for water.

47.     The community-based sub-project and capacity building components were successful in
targeting disadvantaged communities and specific vulnerable groups.               Disadvantaged
communities were targeted based on their poverty rate, their remoteness, and their existing
access to basic services. The availability of such data in Comoros is very limited; therefore, the
SSP provided support for a household survey, finalized in February 2005, that was conducted by
the Government’s Commissariat Général au Plan and UNDP. The FADC used this data
throughout Project implementation to compare poverty rates, remoteness, primary school
enrollment rates, and accessibility to basic social services of communities. The 2011 economic
analysis included data regarding the poverty rates of 60 percent of the 30 sampled communities.
On average, the poverty rate in these communities was 57.4 percent, well above the national
poverty rate of 34.9 percent. Only one of these eighteen communities was below the national
average with a poverty rate of 25.9 percent, while the majority was above the national average
rural poverty rate, which is 41.1 percent. Regarding the inclusion of vulnerable groups, in the
2007 beneficiary assessment, communities noted that the SSP-initiated planning processes were
inclusive of typically marginalized groups, notably youth and the elderly. Moreover, women
comprised 33 percent of participants in the community trainings and 50 percent of participants in
the community development committees.


13
  The Project’s Additional Financing amended this intermediate indicator from 75 percent of the population within
the Project intervention area has access to drinking water within 1 kilometer to within 100 meters.
                                                       15
48.     The health and urban water supply components did not specifically target disadvantaged
communities or vulnerable groups. Both components focused on increasing access to social
services through the strengthening of relatively large-scale infrastructures that serve a broad
cross-section of the population. It, therefore, was not possible to track the demographic
characteristics of the end users of these systems.

Specific Objective 2: contribute to building the basic capacity of communities and local actors to
conduct a local development process.

49.     The SSP had made significant progress toward its objective of building community
capacity before the Project’s Restructuring as evidenced by the outcome and intermediate
indicators related to this PDO. Through trainings provided under the Project, 136 communities
had completed local development plans, surpassing the original target of 90.14 One hundred
percent of these local development plans had been validated by the community, surpassing the
target of 90 percent and, on average, 45 percent of the population of beneficiary communities
had participated in the local development plan creation process, as compared with a target of 60
percent. The SSP significantly surpassed the target, introduced under the Additional Financing,
that 40 communities would execute activities in their local development plan without funding
from the SSP, with 101 communities doing so prior to the Restructuring. These figures highlight
the capacity of the communities to organize and work successfully toward local development. In
particular, the independent use of the local development plans by communities suggests the
Project helped build the capacity of communities to be more proactive in their development
processes. The increased capacity of SSP beneficiary communities was confirmed by the
Government and donor partners, including AFD, during the ICR mission.

50.     The 2007 beneficiary assessment further reinforces the Project’s contribution of building
capacity within beneficiary communities. Communities were proud of the development plans
created under the FADC’s participatory approach and that this planning process allowed them to
adopt a longer-term vision for their futures. Of the 43 sampled communities, 42 reported that the
local development plan would be a future priority. Moreover, 60 percent of communities
reported that the local development plans helped improve the functioning of community
structures, 56 percent reported better circulation of information, and 63 percent reported an
improved relationship between the community and local officials. However, at least half of the
communities sampled in Grande Comore and Anjouan reported that they required additional
training in project management and M&E (although all five communities sampled in Mohéli
reported that they had received satisfactory training). The assessment also found that
communities tended to include only sub-projects that were eligible for FADC funding, rather
than outlining all their priorities. The FADC was proactive in responding to this finding and, as
noted above, 101 communities had completed projects specified in their local development plan
independently from the FADC by the Project’s Restructuring in 2009.

51.     The local government communes originally envisioned as beneficiaries of these activities
have not been established by Government through its decentralization processes. The political
instability resulting from the secession attempt by the island of Anjouan, which began in 2007,


14
   The SSP-supported local development plans are developed at the community level by the communities
themselves. They are not developed by local government communes, which have yet to be established.
                                                16
contributed to the delay of this reform. The SSP, therefore, was unable to provide capacity
building support to actors outside of the communities.
3.2.2. Revised PDO
Specific Objective 1: increase access to short-term employment in food-insecure areas.

52.     The Project surpassed its targets regarding the increase of access to short-term
employment in food-insecure areas. The Project increased access to short-term employment by
engaging 4,343 beneficiaries in 87 cash-for-work sub-projects (above the target of 3,500
beneficiaries in 75 sub-projects) and creating 108,425 days of employment (as compared with a
target of 90,000). This component provided each beneficiary with 25 days of work at a daily
wage of KMF 2,300 (approximately USD 6). This income represents 18.5 percent of the most
recent World Bank estimate of the country’s per capita income (2009) of USD 810. The total
cash transfer realized through the public works component was KMF 248,678,300
(approximately USD 695,000). Fifty seven percent of beneficiaries were women, exceeding the
target of 50 percent.

53.     The Project targeted food insecure areas based on communities’ respective poverty
levels, remoteness, and inaccessibility.15 This data was taken from the 2005 household survey
supported by the Project. Numerical values were assigned to each criterion and communities
were prioritized on this basis. An initial assessment of the cash-for-work component was
conducted in 2010 and suggested that this methodology may have been overly complex. Still,
given the reliance on relevant data from the 2005 household survey, it seems likely that the
short-term employment opportunities were targeted toward food insecure areas.

54.     The initial evaluation of the cash-for-work component also highlighted the positive social
and economic impacts of short-term employment opportunities. In one community, beneficiaries
self-reported that they spent approximately 80 percent of cash-for-work wages on food
expenditures and the remaining 20 percent was allocated primarily to health and education
expenses. In another, beneficiary households noted being able to supplement their standard diet
of cassava and plantains with fish and meat. Respondents also highlighted that the public works
undertaken through this component facilitated the movement of goods to market and people to
existing social services, as well as minimizing the time spent finding potable water.
Communities reported that they benefited from learning the labor intensive techniques applied by
the sub-projects and that this learning would be of use in future community works. However, the
findings of this initial assessment are anecdotal and based on the self-reporting of only four
communities on two of the Union’s three islands.

55.    At Project closure, the activities related to this PDO, which included the cash-for-work
component, represented approximately five percent of total Project disbursements (USD
904,137).
Specific Objective 2: increase access to basic social services in poor communities.
56.    The Project has achieved its goal regarding the increased access of poor communities to
basic social services. As noted above, the revision of the first original objective from

15
  Funding allocations between the three islands were in accordance with the 2001 Fomboni Accords. Targeting
also considered population size.
                                                      17
maintaining social services in disadvantaged communities and specific vulnerable groups to
increasing basic social services in poor communities did not substantially change the intended
outcome to provide basic social services to beneficiary communities. Community targeting
remained based on relative poverty, remoteness, primary school enrollment rates, and existing
access to basic social services.

57.    The success in achieving increased access to basic social services is based on the revised
key indicators, which include the number of students enrolled in FADC built or rehabilitated
schools or classrooms and the number of people benefitting from improved water sources or
roads in FADC beneficiary communities.16 At Project completion, 6,025 students were enrolled
in schools built or rehabilitated under the Project, an estimated 27,061 people were benefiting
from improved roads, and 55,443 people had access to an improved water source within 100
meters of their house. Given the demand-driven nature of the Project target indicators could not
be estimated a priori at the Project’s Restructuring; the actual values at completion represent
beneficiary community preferences.

58.     The Project surpassed its intermediate indicators regarding the increase in access to basic
social services. One hundred and two sub-projects were constructed and in use by communities
at Project closure, as compared with a target of 100. The 102 communities in which these sub-
projects were completed represent 31 percent of the total number of communities in Comoros.
These sub-projects included 97 classrooms built or rehabilitated, 38.19 kilometers of
rehabilitated roads, and 14 improved community water points as well as the urban water systems
rehabilitated in Mutsamudu and Fomboni. Ninety six percent of the community infrastructures
were properly maintained one year after completion, above the target of 90 percent. Moreover,
the final student who received a SSP-financed scholarship returned to Comoros in late 2009 and,
to date, 95 percent of these medical professionals remain in the public health sector in Comoros,
again above the target of 90 percent. In addition, the FADC estimates that 96 percent of people
with access to the improved water sources under the urban water component are knowledgeable
about water management, hygiene, and sanitation, as compared to a target of 50 percent.17

59.    As detailed in Section 3.2.1 above, these outputs translate into tangible quality of life
improvements for community beneficiaries. The 2011 economic analysis found that beneficiary
communities self-reported that the increased access to basic social services resulting from the
Project correlated with decreased household expenditures, increased economic activity, and
decreased prevalence of water-borne diseases within the Project intervention areas. Section 3.6
and Annex 5 provide additional information regarding the SSP’s beneficiary assessments.

60.    The targeting of poor communities was not revised following the Project’s Restructuring
and appears to have been successful. As noted above in Section 3.2.1, the 2011 economic
analysis found an average poverty rate of 57.4 percent, well above the national poverty rate of
34.9 percent and the national rural poverty rate of 41.1 percent, in the 18 communities for which
it compiled this data.

16
   The Restructuring added a key outcome indicator regarding increased access to water, which was an intermediate
indicator under the original M&E framework. It also revised the language of the two original outcome indicators
related to this PDO regarding enrollment in Project financed classrooms and access to improved roads.
17
   The indicators reported in this paragraph and the previous paragraph are based on the FADC’s administrative
data.
                                                       18
61.     At Project closure, the activities relating to this PDO, which include the community
infrastructure component, excluding the community capacity building activities, the health
component, and the urban water component, represented approximately 65 percent of total
Project disbursements (USD 12,561,088).
Specific Objective 3: contribute to building the capacity of communities to plan their
development.
62.    The Project has achieved its target regarding the building of community capacity to drive
local development processes. The target of 156 local development plans was achieved and
represents the involvement of 47 percent of all communities in Comoros in these activities.
Women represented 50 percent of the community management committees that wrote these
development plans. By the end of the Project, 6,809 people had received training from the
FADC, of whom 36 percent were women. The trainings included participatory approaches,
community management, financial and procurement management, M&E, maintenance,
environmental safeguards, and the creation of local development plans.

63.    By the end of the Project, over half of beneficiary communities (86) were successful in
using this training and their local development plans to attract funding from other donors,
including the Government, UNICEF, the European Union, and the Comorian Diaspora, to
complete additional sub-projects. These sub-projects, which ranged from the construction of
classrooms and roads to village electrification, allowed communities to increase further their
access to basic social services. The Government and donor partners working in Comoros
confirmed the utility of these development plans in allowing communities to drive their own
development processes by raising additional financing for community needs.

64.    Moreover, as outlined in Section 3.2.1, the 2007 beneficiary assessment highlighted the
increased capacity that beneficiary communities reported as resulting from their drafting and
adopting local development plans through support from the Project.

65.     At Project closure, the capacity building activities under the community-drive basic
infrastructure component, which relate to this PDO, represented approximately 6 percent of total
Project disbursements (USD 1,236,104).

3.3. Efficiency

Rating: Satisfactory

66.     The overall efficiency of the Project is Satisfactory based on the efficiency of (i) the
community-based sub-projects, (ii) the cash-for-work sub-projects, (iii) the health component,
(iv) the urban water systems, and (x) the FADC’s implementation of these activities.

67.     The Economic Rates of Return (ERR) of the community-driven basic infrastructure
component, which represents about half of the disbursements, are very high.18 Finalized in June
2011, an economic analysis of this component derived high ERR for several types of sub-
projects including rural roads, water supply systems, sanitation, and small dikes. As detailed

18
  At Project closure, the community-driven basic infrastructure component represented 52 percent of total
disbursements (USD 9,986,692).
                                                        19
below in Table 3, the ERRs are high for all types of sub-projects, including 86 percent for dikes,
about 50 percent for sanitation sub-projects and rural roads, and 28 percent for sub-projects
aiming to improve access to water. The economic analysis made the following assumption: a 10-
year life span of the sub-projects, attribution of half the observed economic gains to the sub-
projects (the other half being attributed to outside factors including economic growth), and a
discount rate of 4.5 percent (in line with the real cost of borrowing). The economic analysis
sampled 30 sub-projects, representing 29 percent of the sub-projects completed under this
component. Further information about the methodology is included in Annex 3.

Table 3. Average Economic Rates of Return by Sub-project Type
                      Sub-project type                                          Average ERR (Percentage)

Source: Rakotomanana, 2011.
68.     The economic analysis further outlines the efficiency of this component by noting the
economic and social gains realized within beneficiary communities. These findings are self-
reported and represent the feedback received from individual interviews held within the 30
sampled communities. As noted in Section 3.2 above, these included increased economic
opportunities through improved transportation, greater access to market, and cultivable land,
improved health conditions through access to potable water and cleaner public areas, reductions
in household time spent finding potable water, and cost savings on market goods, which
reportedly decreased resulting from improved market access. The ERR of the dike sub-projects
are particularly high given the prevention that this infrastructure provides against loss of life.

69.     The economic analysis also found positive economic returns to beneficiary households
correlated with the school sub-projects under the community infrastructure component. As noted
above, the classroom constructions corresponded to improved ease of access to education,
particularly time savings regarding the distances walked by students to reach their classrooms.
Moreover, the Ministry of Education (MOE) confirmed that the FADC was the only organization
that turned over fully operational schools or classrooms to the communities. In particular, the
MOE noted the importance of the environmental safeguards, health considerations (water
sources and latrines), and the inclusion of necessary school furnishing (desks, chairs, and
blackboards) included in the FADC classrooms. Given that there are very few actors in Comoros
that build classrooms, particularly of the same quality as FADC, it is difficult to conduct an
accurate cost analysis of these SSP infrastructures. Also, the economic analysis could not
estimate the specific ERR of classroom construction given the lack of data regarding the future
returns to these investments, such as the future earnings of students.

70.     The cash-for-work activities efficiently transferred a substantial portion of the financing
for this component to beneficiaries.19 The component’s labor intensity (the share of funding
allocated to beneficiary wages as compared to total expenditures) was approximately 75 percent,
which is high by international standards. Other public works programs show rates of around 60
percent in India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, 70 percent in Korea’s public

19
     At Project closure, the cash-for-work component represented five percent (USD 904,137) of total disbursements.
                                                          20
works program, 85 percent in Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program, 40-50 percent in
Argentina’s Trabajar Program, and 60-70 percent in Bangladesh’s food-for-work program.

71.     The management by the FADC was designed to encourage the efficiency and economy of
the Project’s health and urban water supply components. 20 The FADC was responsible for the
recruitment and oversight of contractors to carry out the main activities under these two
components. These contractors were procured through International Competitive Bidding to
secure the least cost options for these components. For the health component, 21 of the 22 health
specialists who received scholarships through the SSP currently work in Comorian health
centers, which is particularly important given the low capacity of this sector. Their training
allows them to save lives with incommensurable benefits to the population. For the urban water
component, the original PAD estimated the ERR at 20 to 27 percent for Mutsamudu and 5 to 7
percent for Fomboni, including the assumption that households would be willing to pay 4.5
percent of their income for water. While not specifically including the urban water component,
the 2011 economic analysis estimated an ERR for the water sub-projects under the community
infrastructure component of 27.6 percent, without any cost recovery mechanisms. This ERR
highlights the importance of the health and economic returns of the improved water sources and
suggests that the impact of these variables, irrespective of the cost recovery, may have resulted in
economic returns in keeping with the original estimates of the urban water component. Because
of the limited number of actors in the health and water sectors in Comoros, a cost analysis of
these two components is not possible.21

72.     Under the program management, M&E, and audit component, the Project’s operating
ratio was 17 percent, within the revised target of 18 percent, although above the original target of
less than 15 percent. As defined in the Project’s M&E framework, the operating ratio includes
the remuneration of all FADC staff, who are consultants hired under the World Bank’s
Consultants’ Guidelines, and operating costs.22 This ratio is justified by the country’s
challenging operating environment and FADC’s decentralized structure, which includes a
national office and three regional island offices to ensure that all activities are effectively
implemented and monitored. The FADC staff salaries represent approximately 70 percent of the
operating ratio. The World Bank reviewed and rationalized the FADC pay scale as part of the
Project’s 2009 institutional audit, at which time the organization also was downsized and
streamlined to increase efficiency. The Project’s operating costs, as defined in the legal
documents, represent approximately 5 percent of total Project disbursements.23


20
   At Project closure, the health and urban water components represented five percent (USD 890,543) and 15 percent
(USD 2,919,579) of total disbursements, respectively.
21
   The support of AFD and AfBD in these two sectors cannot yet serve as an adequate comparison. Although the
AFD’s PASCO foresees medical equipment maintenance, this activity is still under preparation. In the water sector,
the AfBD’s support began in late 2010 and feasibility and technical studies remain ongoing.
22
   The Project indicator defines the operating ratio as the ratio of the sum of cumulative operating costs (travel
expenditures and other travel-allowances, equipment rental and maintenance, vehicle operation, maintenance and
repair, office rental and maintenance, materials and supplies, and utilities) and cumulative consultant fees of
FADC’s employees since the beginning of the Project divided by cumulative disbursements since the beginning of
the Project. The Restructuring revised this target slightly upward to reflect the impact of the challenges brought
about by the FADC’s management issues in 2008 and early 2009.
23
   The operating costs, as detailed in the Project’s legal documents, are distinct from the Project’s operating ratio,
which is an intermediate indicator of the Project. The operating costs are defined as the incremental operating
expenses under the Project, incurred by the Recipient of FADC, on account of Project implementation, management,
                                                         21
73.     The rating of Satisfactory is applied for before and after the Project’s Restructuring. The
economic analysis was finalized in June 2011 and assessed sub-projects undertaken before and
after the PDO revision. Moreover, the Restructuring did not impact the Project’s health and
urban water supply components and only slightly increased the allocation for the program
management, M&E, and audit component (USD 150,000) to support the new cash-for-work
component. Although the cash-for-work component was added under the Restructuring, it
represents only five percent of the Project’s total disbursements. Additional information is
provided in Annex 3.

3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory
                                               Original PDO Rating                   Restructured PDO Rating

Overall Outcome Rating                             Satisfactory                            Satisfactory

74.     Overall, the Project is rated Satisfactory. The Project’s relevance, efficacy, and
efficiency helped bring about tangible improvements within beneficiary communities and did so
despite the country’s challenging implementing environment. The SSP has remained relevant to
the Government and World Bank development strategies as they have evolved since the Project’s
preparation. The Government’s current planning documents identify infrastructure development
and access to social services as key drivers of human development and economic growth. Under
FADC implementation, the Project achieved or surpassed the majority of its PDO indicators and
these outcome indicators are linked to tangible improvements within beneficiary communities.
Moreover, political instability and overall low national capacity did not have a significant impact
on the achievements of the Project’s outcomes. Lastly, the Project’s economic analysis revealed
high rates of economic return within its sampling of sub-projects.

3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

75.     As detailed throughout Section 3, the Project’s 2007 beneficiary assessment and 2011
economic analysis, as well as the 2010 initial assessment of the cash-for-work component,
highlight the positive social and economic impact of the SSP within beneficiary communities.
The 2007 beneficiary assessment, which focused on the local development plans and community
trainings, underscored the impact reported by the sampled communities of these activities to
improve the functioning of community structures. The 2011 economic analysis of the
community-driven basic infrastructure component emphasized economic, health, and educational
outcomes resulting from the increased access to basic services. Moreover, the 2010 initial
assessment of the cash-for-work component highlighted the positive returns of these activities to

management and monitoring, including operation and maintenance costs of office, vehicles and office equipment,
water and electricity utilities, telephone, office supplies, bank charges additional staff costs, travel and supervision
costs, per diem, but excluding the salaries of officials and public servants of the Recipient’s civil service.
                                                           22
both direct beneficiaries and their communities. Given the use of the 2005 household survey
data under this component, it is likely that the transfer of approximately USD 695,000 to
beneficiaries was targeted toward food insecure households. However, the data available in
Comoros is insufficient to calculate accurately the impact of the Project on overall poverty and
the SSP assessments did not evaluate the overall impacts of its activities on these poverty rates.

76.       As noted above, the Project integrated gender into its design. Women represented 57
percent of the cash-for-work beneficiaries, exceeding the targeted 50 percent. Under the
community driven development component, 36 percent of participants in the community
trainings and 50 percent of participants in the community development committees were women.
Moreover, the FADC sought to create processes within these community structures that
promoted women’s active participation, such as the creation of initial local development plans
that were drafted in single-gender groups. In the 2011 economic analysis, communities self-
reported that the construction of improved water sources also directly impacted women and girls.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
77.      During the Project, the FADC evolved beyond its original strengths in community and
infrastructure development to an organization that can respond, through participatory practices,
to chronic and shock-induced community needs. The capacity building objective of the SSP
focused on community ownership of the development processes; however, particularly in a low-
capacity context such as Comoros, the institutional development of the implementing partner
itself should also be emphasized. The SSP design reflected the previous successes of the FADC
and its relative capacity within the country to delivery basic services to poor and remote
communities. The FADC is recognized throughout the country by communities, the
Government, and donor partners as the leading actor in community development. Its efforts
supporting the local development plans are highlighted as a key tool to empower communities to
access additional development opportunities. Although FADC has developed standard design
plans for its sub-projects, no such designs exist at a national level. At the request of the MOE,
the FADC is now positioned to assist in efforts to create national standardized designs for public
schools. The FADC is also known as an organization that develops the capacity and technical
competencies of its staff. Indeed the former President of Anjouan worked for the FADC before
his election.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
78.     Anecdotal evidence was offered by donor partners and the FADC staff that the addition
of the cash-for-work component has raised community expectations to be paid for working on
public sector projects. For example, communities are required to contribute 10 percent (cash or
in-kind) toward the overall sub-project cost under the community-driven development
component of the SSP. This often includes labor from the community, labor for which
beneficiaries of the cash-for-work component are compensated. Programmatically the
distinction between these two components is that one emphasizes spending to create social
infrastructures while the other emphasizes spending to transfer cash directly to households. Still,
this concern merits further attention as the difference in the objectives of these activities appears
to remain unclear to certain stakeholders.

3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
79.     A beneficiary assessment, conducted in 2007 and updated in 2011 as a component of the
Project’s economic analysis, found positive responses from beneficiaries about the SSP
community infrastructure development activities. The 2007 assessment sampled 43 communities
that had benefitted from the SSP and conducted 15-person focus groups to understand
community perceptions regarding the participatory processes and trainings of the Project. As
noted above, of these 43 communities, all but one reported that the local development plan
would be a future priority. Communities also reported that the development planning processes
helped improve the functioning of community structures, although some highlighted the need for
additional training in sub-project maintenance. The assessment also revealed that communities
tended to include only sub-projects that would elicit FADC funding, rather than outlining all
their priorities and, in some cases, excluding small projects that could be undertaken by the
communities without external assistance. After the assessment, the FADC began focusing on
this shortcoming and, by the Project’s close, 54 percent of communities with development plans
had solicited funding from other sources, including the Government, the European Union,
UNICEF, and private Diaspora donors.

80.     In the 2011 economic analysis, the majority of respondents in the sampled beneficiary
communities were satisfied or moderately satisfied with the SSP-financed infrastructure and the
community management committee, as well as that these sub-projects had positively impacted
their quality of life. As outlined above, beneficiaries self-reported improved health indicators,
increased economic activities, reduced prices of common goods, and the reclamation of
previously flooded agricultural land. Moreover, of the 30 communities sampled, only two
examples existed where the majority of respondents were unsatisfied with the community
management committees. This was due to a lack of maintenance of the community’s sub-
project. Indeed, despite the high levels of beneficiary satisfaction, most communities reported
that, following sub-project completion, the management committees met only in response to
specific maintenance needs. The main findings of these assessments are presented in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

81.     The risk to the development outcomes stems primarily from the limited capacity and
willingness of communities and Government authorities to raise the revenues necessary to
support the ongoing maintenance of the infrastructures built or rehabilitated under the SSP. As
part of the 2011 economic analysis, communities mostly reported that maintenance is
satisfactory and that they have in place measures for cleaning and simple maintenance.
However, this same analysis also noted that community management communities do not meet
regularly or have ongoing maintenance plans and that many lack the means through which to
raise revenues for larger repairs that require external inputs. Of 30 communities sampled, three
committees were able to raise revenues to complete necessary maintenance, including hiring
workers and buying tools. Two of these reported having established regular monetary
contributions to a maintenance fund. Three other committees reported having access to
community savings for maintenance of the community sub-project. These limitations raise
concerns about the longer-term sustainability of the Project-financed sub-projects. Furthermore,
the lack of Governmental capacity, particularly at the local level, limits external support that
                                               24
communities are likely to receive regarding maintenance or coordinated social service delivery,
particularly in the areas of health, water, and education.

82.     Comoros also experiences regular teacher strikes which further puts into question the
long-term achievement of the Project’s objectives. The FADC and the MOE have a formal
agreement that publically salaried teachers will be supplied by the Ministry to teach in
classrooms constructed or rehabilitated under FADC sub-projects. However, according to the
MOE, teacher strikes have occurred regularly since 2005 given the relatively low and irregular
receipt of salaries. At present, a teacher strike has been ongoing since the 2010/2011 school year
and delayed the commencement of the 2011/2012 school year.

83.     Although Government capacity in the health and water sectors remains weak, the SSP
provided a critical bridge between the closure of the World Bank’s earlier Health and
Infrastructure, Water, and Environment projects and the provision of support from other donor
partners in these two areas. At Project closure, the Government did not have the capacity to
continue the activities under the health services component. However, as noted above, the AFD
has become the lead donor in the health sector providing support to the Government through the
PASCO, providing EUR 10 million in financing between 2007 and 2014. This project includes
efforts begun under the SSP to establish national maintenance workshops to institutionalize the
repairs of necessary medical equipment, although these activities have yet to begin.

84.     In late 2010, the AfDB launched a project to continue strengthening the water supply
systems supported under the SSP. The need for further rehabilitation of the Mutsamudu and
Fomboni water systems and additional management capacity has contributed to ongoing
difficulties with the recovery of user fees. In Fomboni, service delivery has witnessed some
improvements and an increased average cost recovery from private users of the urban water
supply project from 42.6 percent in 2009 to 65 percent in 2010. However, ongoing service
delivery challenges in Mutsamudu help explain the decreasing rate of cost recovery, which was
13.8 percent in 2009 and fell to 8.8 percent in 2010. To date, the Government itself also has
proven unwilling to pay for water usage in these two locations. The AfDB Projet d’Alimentation
en Eau provides approximately EUR 12 million in support over three years to undertake further
rehabilitation of the water delivery systems and a range of capacity building efforts.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

85.     The Project was developed at the Government’s request and was aligned with both the
country’s I-PRSP, in draft during the SSP preparation, and the World Bank’s TSSU. The Project
design reflected the need for improved social service delivery while considering the limited
implementation capacity. International best practices highlighted the effectiveness of alternative
service delivery systems in contexts with limited Government capacity. The FADC was chosen
as the implementing partner based on its previous successes implementing World Bank-funded
projects aimed at providing basic social services outside of traditional Government institutions.
                                               25
As noted above, the service delivery design and implementation mechanisms adopted by the SSP
have been reconfirmed within the 2010 Comoros Quick Assessment of the Global Context and of
the Bank ISN.

86.      Under the TSSU, the SSP was identified as the Bank’s only lending instrument and the
Project’s preparation facilitated the continuing support of earlier IDA-financed activities. In
particular, the SSP was identified to continue key activities of the previous Health and
Infrastructure, Water, and Environment projects given the weak implementation capacity in these
sectors. This approach appears to have been appropriate to encourage the sustainability of these
activities, particularly given that other donor partners assumed the lead role in these sectors
following the SSP-financed interventions.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

87.     The World Bank Task Team conducted 20 supervision missions between July 2004 and
May 2011. The SSP was implemented under challenging circumstances, including political
unrest in Anjouan, multiple IDA suspensions unrelated to the Project, as well as the above-
mentioned INT investigation of the Project. The Task Team responded proactively to the
deterioration of the quality of Project management in 2008 and early 2009, supporting various
personnel changes, staff training, and an institutional audit, which helped ensure that the
development objectives were not unduly affected. When the Task Team downgraded the
safeguard and fiduciary ratings to Moderately Unsatisfactory in June 2009, they responded
quickly with missions by the financial management, procurement, and safeguard specialists to
address the identified problems. The FADC staff confirms that the competency of the World
Bank’s technical and managerial supervision allowed for the organization’s effective
restructuring in 2009. The assessments, audits, and missions that the World Bank supported
during this period allowed the FADC to realize where changes were necessary in order to
improve its effectiveness. The Task Team also was proactive in referring the Project to INT
when the necessity arose.

88.    The Task Team leveraged additional trust fund resources for the Project to respond to the
2008 global food price crisis and restructured the Project to respond to the evolving country
context. The approval of this USD 1 million Co-financing coincided with the implementation
challenges experienced within FADC. The World Bank Task Team postponed the original
Board date by nearly six months to conduct the due diligence necessary to ensure that the
FADC’s capacity had improved to manage properly these additional resources and undertake the
new social safety net component to help mitigate the impact of increased food prices in
Comoros.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

89.    Overall, the World Bank supervision of the SSP was Satisfactory. During the Project’s
preparation, the Task Team proactively engaged with Government, the Country Management
Unit, and other donor partners to ensure that the Project’s objectives were aligned with the
country’s development strategies and well coordinated with ongoing development interventions.
                                               26
During Project implementation, a multi-sectoral Task Team conducted missions a minimum of
twice per year. The missions included regular support from safeguard, financial management,
and procurement staff, as well as community-driven development and social protection
specialists and an engineer who focused on the urban water supply component, allowing for
effective management throughout the Project. Moreover, the Project benefited from the
consistency and stability of having only two Task Team Leaders throughout implementation.

5.2. Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.      Although the SSP was designed to be implemented outside of traditional Government
structures, the Government’s ongoing commitment to the FADC was critical to the Project’s
success. The Project experienced some initial interference from the Commissariat Général au
Plan who replaced the National Executive Director in non-conformity with the FADC
operational procedures. The situation was resolved quickly following the Task Team’s first
supervision mission in July 2004 with confirmation by the Government of the independent
oversight role of the FADC Board of Directors. Since then, the Government has respected the
autonomy of the FADC, which has been critical to the implementation of its activities and its
ability to prioritize the demands of beneficiary communities over any undue external influences.
The Minister of Finance did support the replacement of the National Executive Director in 2009
following the evidence of mismanagement within the FADC.

91.    However, outside of its relationship with the FADC, the Government’s action negatively
impacted the Project on a number of key issues. First, five IDA suspensions occurred during
Project implementation due to delayed repayment of the Government’s past credits. The last
suspension was lifted in September 2009; however, prior to this, suspensions occurred regularly
and resulted in payments arrears to Project contractors given the FADC’s inability to withdraw
necessary Project financing. Second, the Government’s decentralization plan has proceeded
slower than expected and the Project, therefore, removed its aim to support local government
communes, which have not yet been established. Third, the Government’s inability to resolve
the country’s recurrent teacher strikes has rendered many of the SSP-financed classrooms vacant
at some point. And, fourth, although the AfDB has committed to providing additional capacity
building support to the urban water supply systems in Mutsamudu and Fomboni, the
Government’s has proven unwilling to pay for its water usage in these areas to date.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

92.    The FADC is the leading agency in Comoros working with communities to improve their
standards of living. Established by the Government of Comoros in 1993, the FADC is an
autonomous public agency governed by a Board of Directors that consists of six Government
representatives and eight representatives from the private sector and non-governmental
organizations. The FADC’s successful management and implementation of the SSP allowed for
the achievement of the PDOs both before and after the Project’s Restructuring. The FADC’s
                                              27
interventions have engendered positive social and economic impacts within beneficiary
communities and empowered communities to become more proactive in their own development
processes. The World Bank’s 2010-2012 ISN reconfirmed the selection of the FADC as the
Project’s implementing agency for community development.

93.      As noted above, the FADC experienced a period of organizational mismanagement
during the Project’s implementation; however, under the leadership of its Board of Directors, the
FADC prevented these challenges from impacting the Project’s achievements. In April 2007, the
Task Team raised the deterioration of the FADC’s management performance with the
Government and the resulting delays in sub-project completion. The Project was referred to INT
in October 2007 and the Project Management rating was downgraded to Unsatisfactory in June
2008. By April 2009, the FADC National Executive Director had resigned. Simultaneously, an
institutional audit was conducted and found that the organization’s structure and personnel were
overly complex and, in some instances, duplicative. The action by the FADC Board of
Directors, which resulted in this change of leadership and the organizational restructuring
following the audit recommendations, corresponded with the steady improvement in the
performance of the implementing agency. The Project also benefited from the appointment of
new staff throughout the FADC and intensive trainings where needed. Under the tenure of the
new National Executive Director, the FADC was successful in achieving the SSP development
objectives despite these implementation setbacks.

94.      The FADC emphasized the involvement of beneficiary communities throughout the
Project. The SSP design reinforced the community-driven development approach toward the
construction and rehabilitation of basic social services and required the rapid expansion of the
FADC’s capacity in this regard. At the Co-financing and Restructuring, the FADC successfully
undertook a second expansion of its capacity with the addition of the social safety net
component, which employed community consultations as part of beneficiary targeting. As noted
above, the 2007 beneficiary assessment, the 2010 initial assessment of the cash-for-work
activities, and the 2011 economic analysis reveal largely positive community feedback.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

95.     Overall, the Borrower’s performance improved throughout the implementation of the
SSP. The Project design reflected the low capacity context in which it would be implemented
and therefore included significant measures aimed at mitigating this risk. The FADC remained
an autonomous agency capable of working directly with communities to improve access to social
safety nets and social services. The depth of capacity within the FADC allowed the SSP to
achieve its development objectives and the Government’s ongoing commitment to the Project
was critical in effecting the necessary changes within the FADC to ensure this success.

6. Lessons Learned

•   The Project confirms the effectiveness of non-traditional structures to deliver social
    services in countries with weak Governmental capacity. A project implementation unit,
    such as the FADC, can successfully deliver social services to populations that would
    otherwise be left underserved by traditional state structures. The FADC benefited from its
                                               28
    deconcentrated structure that allowed for the regular interaction of its staff with even the
    most remote beneficiary communities. Moreover, the FADC’s organizational capacity
    allowed for the quick introduction of a new cash-for-work component to mitigate the
    negative impact of rising food prices on beneficiary households.

•   Financing mechanisms and intensive community training for the maintenance of
    community-driven infrastructure development need to be included in sub-project design.
    The SSP community trainings included information on sub-project maintenance; however,
    some communities surveyed expressed their desire for additional training in this area and
    only in a few cases did communities establish maintenance funds. Especially in countries
    with weak or non-existent local government, projects could benefit from the initial
    assumption that communities will be responsible for all eventual maintenance and could
    include activities to reflect this reality.

•   The cash-for-work activities introduced under the SSP could provide a framework through
    which to begin a broader dialogue on social protection with the Government. The FADC
    is perceived among some stakeholders as primarily an organization that constructs social
    infrastructures. The outputs of these activities are concrete sub-projects, whereas the
    outcomes of the more recently introduced cash-for-work activities are often less tangible. As
    the organization evolves and likely increases its focus on social safety nets, it is important to
    undertake an ongoing policy dialogue with the Government regarding the development of
    social protection or safety net systems. In the short-term, the FADC should focus on
    undertaking impact evaluations that analyze the benefits, particularly regarding poverty
    alleviation, realized by households that participate in these activities. In the medium- and
    long-term, the World Bank should engage the Government on the importance of having a
    national policy to guide the social protection sector.

•   In low capacity contexts where funding resources are limited, development programming
    could leverage synergies between donors and implementing agencies. Comoros provides a
    relatively successful case of donor coordination, with different organizations acting as lead
    agencies across the social sectors; however, exploiting synergies between projects would
    help amplify their impacts. For example, the human development objectives of the FADC
    cash-for-work activities could be increased by adding trainings, such as in land management
    and water usage, already implemented by other international agencies and local NGOs. This
    is currently being piloted.

•   Projects in low capacity contexts require intensive supervision. The FADC made steady
    progress toward the SSP PDOs throughout Project implementation; however, serious
    mismanagement challenges arose that required intensive World Bank supervision. Low
    capacity countries are particularly susceptible to such developments given the lack of
    domestic monitoring by a strong judiciary institutions or civil society actors.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Based on a sample of 30 sub-projects, the economic analysis of the Services Support Project
(SSP) shows the achievement of significant economic and social gains resulting from the
construction of SSP infrastructures. The analysis sample included communities on all three
islands and consisted of 6 rural road sub-projects, 5 water supply infrastructures, 10 schools, 7
sanitation works, and 2 dikes. The implementation of the study included three consecutive
phases: the preparatory phase (research and drafting questionnaires), the implementation phase
(field work in June 2011), and the analytical and reporting phase.

The key objectives of the analysis were to estimate the added value of the sub-projects; to
analyze the economic profitability and highlight the economic rate of return on investments on
the basis of references such as the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal Rate of Return
(IRR); to analyze the increase in terms of trade and flow of goods and services generated by the
sub-projects; and to assess the impact on household incomes and job creation. The results of the
study confirm that the core indicators adopted by the project are generally achieved.

Methodology
The specific methodology used for the economic evaluation of productive infrastructure focused
on the collection and analysis of economic and financial efficiency indicators to lead to a
quantified economic assessment of the SSP sub-projects. Qualitative issues were also taken into
account. The indicators include economic efficiency, financial profitability, economic benefits
to economic agents involved in the sub-projects, and the developments in the local economy
linked to FADC subprojects. Three indicators are used to assess the cost efficiency of productive
infrastructures:
    • The NPV is a measure of the given sub-project’s added or created value. It is calculated
        as the difference between the current market value of the investment and the total cost
        incurred for the investment. The discount rate used is 4.5 percent, in line with the real
        cost of borrowing.
    • The IRR is the discount rate for which the sub-project’s NPV is zero. The IRR is used to
        estimate the overall economic efficiency of the investment and compares the total cost
        incurred in the construction or rehabilitation and the management and maintenance of the
        infrastructure to the potential economic gains generated by its construction.
    • The return on investment estimates the period after which the amount invested in the
        construction is considered recovered.

As far as education is concerned, some methods recommend the calculation of economic returns
of education by comparing the sum of the gains of the direct and social advantages of education
to the sum of the direct opportunity costs. This approach is not feasible here due to the
insufficient data available. Thus, the study of the school sub-projects focused on the more
immediate impact on households.

Method for calculating the profitability and return on investment period

The economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated from solving the following equation:



                                               37
Where:
i: rate of return
n: life of the sub-project, in our case fixed to 10 years
year 0: year of investment
INV: investment amount
Rk: revenue linked to the project for the economic agent
Dk: expenses linked to the project for the economic agent (operating expenses)
Rk - Dk: surplus of the economic agent in year k

The analysis assumed a 10-year life span of the sub-projects and attributed half of the observed
economic gains to the sub-projects, with the remaining gains being attributed to factors
exogenous to the Project.

Rural roads
The increase of the product flows and people movements, the creation of new economic
activities within the communities served by roads, and the development of the key economic
agents’ activities that are operating in these localities explain the positive economic rate of return
of the rural roads sub-projects. The local economic development was reflected in the influx of
traders in the relevant localities, the creation of direct jobs and jobs induced by sub-project
construction, as well as the impacts on the availability and prices of commodities. The
construction of rural roads is in line with the transport sector policy, which aims to ensure the
opening up of productive rural areas.

The economic rates of returns are positive for the road infrastructures on Grande Comore, with
61.6 percent for Hambou and 51.1 percent for Itsandra. The return on the investment period is
35 months for Hambou and 40 months for Itsandra. On Anjouan, the Mramani sub-project
appears to be the most profitable, with an economic rate of return of 63.3 percent as compared to
56.5 percent for the town of Domoni and 46.5 percent for Vouani. This is explained by the more
intensive use of the road by merchants and carriers operating in Mramani. The returns on
investments follow the same pattern, which is 33 months for Mramani, 37 months for Vouani,
and 53 months for Domoni. For the Dargoubé rural road on Mohéli, economic performance is
slightly lower compared to the infrastructures on the two other islands, with an economic rate of
return of 42.9 percent. This is due to the relatively limited number of users.

The institutional arrangements for the management of rural roads do not allow for the calculation
of financial return because the authorities have no plans for tax or toll collection devices in the
use of these infrastructures. This can also be related to the weaknesses in the road care and
maintenance system. Local communities have insufficient regular funding to guarantee regular
maintenance and rely on occasional contributions from the community.

Water supply infrastructures
Comoros is characterized by insufficient and limited access to drinking water supplies, as
compared to both other African countries and international standards. This situation has had a
negative impact on hygiene and health of local community members. The economic and social
                                             38
benefits arising from the construction of water infrastructures has been assessed against the
economic value of the impact on health, including the reduction of health care costs associated
with the use of unsafe water and the reduction of the time spent on fetching water.

The study results from Grande Comore confirmed the positive economic rate of return for
Nzdouani and Djongoué with 13 percent and 25.4 percent, respectively. The returns on
investments are 82 months for Nzdouani and 52 months for Djongoué. The quantity of consumed
water is estimated to 7.9 liters per person per day. Although this represents an increase in
consumption following the completion of the infrastructure, this quantity is still below
international standards. Infrastructures put in place in Shirove and Hantsahi on Anjouan had
economic rates of return amounting 27.5 percent and 44.7 percent. The visible advantages are
materialized by the time savings related to water fetching and the savings in water consumption
expenditures. In these two towns, time savings that can be spent on other activities averaged 3.5
hours per day and households saved an average of KMF 5000 week on the cost of water after the
construction. The development of new economic activities is also observed, such as a perfume
plant distillery in Hantsahi. For water supply infrastructure in Mohéli, specifically in Hoani
where the construction of a water tank was completed, the economic rate of return is 27.4
percent. The economic benefits are mainly apparent through the significant reduction of health
care expenditures. It is important to keep in mind that local residents were previously frequent
victims of the diseases such as diarrhea and typhoid.

In terms of infrastructure management, management committees are formally set up in most
cases and the committee members have received training in the management of infrastructures.
However, cost recovery systems are not always operational, which creates difficulties in
maintenance and water treatment.

Sanitation facilities
The documents related to the social conditions in Comoros show significant weaknesses in the
hygiene and sanitation sector, highlighted by the growth of unplanned settlements and the
proliferation of precarious housing. The characteristics of many cities on the three islands has led
FADC to begin constructing gutters and road surfaces with the aim of improving the living and
sanitary conditions in disadvantaged communities.

The completed constructions in Mitsoudjé, Djmoishongo Hambou, and Sada Oichili on the
island of Grande Comore have contributed to improving the movement of goods and people in
poor neighborhoods. Specifically in Djmoishongo Hambou, a net increase in the use of vehicles,
including taxis and trucks for the social and economic needs of local people, has been noticed.
The economic rate of return for the Mitsoudjé infrastructure is 62.4 percent and the period of the
return on investment is 33 months. Regarding Djmoishongo Hambou, the economic rate of rate
is 52.5 percent and the period of the return on investment is 31 months. The rate of return of 45.8
percent for Sada Oichili is relatively lower. In the towns of Mnadji and Nounga on the island of
Anjouan, improving sanitation conditions and health status within beneficiary communities are
widely recognized. The satisfaction of social needs, mainly the increased facilities for evacuating
households is also noted. The economic rates of return are respectively 56.6 percent and 43.1
percent. In Kopera and Mouzdalifat on the island of Mohéli, which benefited from the
concreting of streets and sidewalks to drain unsanitary water and waste, socio-economic impacts
include a reduced prevalence of diseases related to poor hygiene, a better capacity for waste
                                                39
removal, and a greater fluidity of people movement. The economic rates of return for these
infrastructures are 53.6 percent for Mouzdalifat and 44.6 percent for Kopera.

Dikes
In a geographical context marked by recurrent flooding risks, protecting people and property
through the construction of dikes has particular economic importance. The sampled dike
constructions in Hasimpao and in Mromhouli have enormous utility for farmers and fishermen in
the two communities, which have experienced the destruction of property and the risk of the loss
of life. The economic rates of return calculated on the basis of the statistical value of human life
are very high, with a rate of 102.7 percent for Hasimpao and a rate of 68.4 percent for
Mromhouli. The construction of the Hasimpao dike also resulted in the increased productive
capacity of farmers who were able to reclaim previously flooded arable lands.

Schools
The SSP-financed classrooms represent 4.3 percent of all classrooms built in the Comoros. The
donation of school furniture that accompanied the majority of constructions has helped to
increase further the supply of education in the three islands. The impacts on households are
realized mainly by the reduction of time students spent walking time to reach school.
Specifically, in one community, the addition of the three classrooms financed by the Project
allowed the school to offer classes for fifth and sixth grade students. However, it should be
noted that the performance and motivation of parents are in some cases altered by exogenous
factors such as prolonged strikes of teachers.

Organizationally, school boards were established and mobilized for the implementation of
infrastructures and officials have benefited from the capacity building sessions to enhance their
efficiency. It appears, however, that these local structures are not always operational, especially
for the ongoing management of infrastructures.

Conclusion and recommendations
The study confirmed that the sampled sub-projects have led to positive economic rates of return
in all sectors. This is supported by the development of key economic agent activities and
potential gains in household income resulting from the implementation of infrastructures. The
increased access to basic social services by the poor and correlating improvements in the quality
of life also are notable.

Despite these advantages, the results highlight some weaknesses that should be addressed with a
view to improving future activities:
       The sub-projects do not have sufficient mechanisms for the collection of tax revenue,
       which could ultimately jeopardize their financial viability;
       Despite the dynamism of local management structures, they lack financial means to
       ensure adequate ongoing maintenance of infrastructure; and
       The synergy and collaboration between local and regional stakeholders (local authorities,
       decentralized departments, project managers) still have deficits, which contribute to
       inefficient cost recovery.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The Project’s beneficiary assessments, one conducted in 2007 and another in 2011 as part of the
Project’s economic analysis, found positive responses from beneficiaries about the SSP
community infrastructure development activities. The 2007 assessment focused primarily on the
perceptions of communities toward the participatory processes instituted by the FADC as well as
the trainings that the communities received. The 2011 economic assessment included a
beneficiary assessment in order to better understand the perceptions of the communities toward
the quality and utility of the infrastructures constructed, as well as about the efficacy of the
community development committees that are responsible for the management and maintenance
of these infrastructures. The following summary is thus organized around these two themes.

Perceptions of the participatory processes and community trainings

The 2007 assessment sampled 43 communities that had benefited from the SSP and emphasized
community perceptions regarding the participatory processes and trainings of the Project. In
each community, the research team conducted 15-person focus groups that included members of
the community management committees, local leaders, the village development agents, other
community members, and the sub-project contractor. Discussions were guided by a
questionnaire developed by the research team based on its review of relevant FADC project
documents. Communities were proud of the development plans created under the FADC’s
participatory approach and that this planning process allowed them to adopt a longer-term vision
for their futures. Only one community reported that the local development plan would not be a
future priority. The focus groups also reported that the planning processes were inclusive of
typically marginalized groups, such as youth and the elderly. However, communities tended to
include only sub-projects that were eligible for FADC funding, rather than outlining all their
priorities and, in some cases, excluding small projects that could be undertaken by the
communities without external assistance. After the assessment, FADC began focusing on this
shortcoming and, by the Project’s close, 55 percent of communities with development plans had
solicited funding from another source. The tables here present a summary of the community
perceptions toward the impacts of the local development plans (PDL).

Overall, the project management training was well received within the sampled communities. Of
the sampled 43 communities, 39 held elections to determine who would serve on the
                                             44
management committees, in keeping with the training received. And, contrary to the planning
processes, some communities reported that the management training helped them to facilitate the
undertaking of various other community projects. At least half of the communities sampled in
Grande Comore and Anjouan, however, reported that they required additional training in project
management and M&E (although all five communities sampled in Mohéli reported that they had
received satisfactory training). Moreover, the assessment stressed that the most commonly
reported difficulty during implementation concerned the slowness and inaccessibility of the
FADC staff. None of the 43 sampled communities had developed a maintenance plan and all
reported that they did not receive adequate support from FADC in this regard.

Perceptions of the infrastructures and the community management committees

As part of the 2011 economic analysis, the majority of respondents in beneficiary communities
were satisfied or moderately satisfied with the quality of the SSP-financed infrastructure. In
particular, the communities considered the school sub-projects to be in good condition, except
the latrines and water source constructed with one school sub-project in Grand Comores. The
rate of satisfaction with the two sampled dike sub-projects was 92 percent. Concerning the
sanitation and hygiene sub-projects, approximately 85 percent of the beneficiaries sampled were
satisfied with the sub-project’s quality. The following charts present specific community
satisfaction data concerning the rural road sub-projects sampled and show that, in five of the six
sampled road sub-projects, all respondents were either satisfied or moderately satisfied with the
quality of these constructions.

Community satisfaction with the quality and maintenance of the road sub-projects in Mohéli




Regarding the quality of the infrastructures constructed, the most commonly cited problem was
with the water sub-projects. In particular, Grande Comore is a volcanic island with very limited
water resources. Even after the construction of the improved water sources, one community
sampled only had 1.2 liters of water available per person per day. In this location, 98 percent of
beneficiaries surveyed were unsatisfied with the quantity of water.

The majority of respondents were satisfied or moderately satisfied with the performance of the
community management committee responsible for its construction and maintenance. Of the 30
communities sampled, only two examples existed where the majority of respondents were
dissatisfied with the community management committees. This dissatisfaction was correlated
with a lack of maintenance of the community’s sub-project. Indeed, despite the high levels of
beneficiary satisfaction, most communities reported that, following sub-project completion, the
management committees held no regular meetings to plan ongoing maintenance but rather met
only in response to specific maintenance needs.

Communities also responded positively regarding the impact of the various sub-projects on their
quality of life. The rural road sub-projects were reported to facilitate better movement of goods
and people, improved commerce as indicated by an increase in taxi drivers and market sellers in
each beneficiary community, and an overall reduction of prices of basic household goods, such
as soap and cooking oil. Decreased household expenditures on water were also reported due to
improved access to such services. The proximity of the water sources allowed community
members, particularly women and girls, to reallocate time previously devoted to finding potable
water toward more productive economic activities and education. Sampled communities self-
reported fewer cases of diseases associated with poor drinking water and unsanitary living
conditions,       such       as      diarrhea,     malaria,       cholera,       and     typhoid.

        A. INTRODUCTION

        Le Projet de Soutien aux Services ou PSS financé sous un financement initial d’un montant de
9.000.000 DTS soit 13.300.000 US$ équivalents (crédit 3868-COM28) et dont la mise en vigueur en date
du 29/09/2004 a été conçu comme palliatif en attendant que les Comores atteignent un certain niveau de
stabilité politique et institutionnelle. Il a donc comme objectif global de satisfaire aux besoins urgents de
prestations de service et de prémunir d’une dégradation des infrastructures existantes dans le pays qui
venait de sortir d’une crise sociopolitique à l’issue de laquelle les structures publiques n’étaient pas
opérationnelles et que l’appui des bailleurs de fonds était en baisse notamment les projets financés par la
Banque Mondiale soit achevés et non renouvelés (projet éducation III, projet santé III) soit clôturé (Projet
infrastructure eau et environnement IEE).

        Lors de la Conférence des Bailleurs de Fonds tenue a Maurice en décembre 2005 au profit de
l’Union des Comores pour accompagner le processus de réconciliation nationale, la Banque Mondiale a
annoncé son appui par un financement additionnel à hauteur de 3.400.000 DTS (Don No H-265-COM29)
soit 5 millions US$ équivalents pour le Projet de Soutien aux Services (PSS) dont la date de mise en
vigueur en date du 22/05/2007 au profit des populations les plus défavorisées. Compte tenu de la réussite
du projet et surtout du processus de développement communautaire et de son approche, le financement
additionnel est conçu pour étendre l’envergure et la couverture du Projet afin d’approfondir les impacts et
les résultats du projet à un plus grand nombre de bénéficiaires
        En 2009, L’Union des Comores, avec l’appui de la Banque Mondiale, a préparé un nouveau Don
de 1 million USD (Don TF 09453730) en réponse à la crise alimentaire mondiale pour cofinancer le PSS et
dont la mise en vigueur en date de Septembre 2009. Le Projet de Soutien aux Services a été alors
restructuré et la date d’achèvement est fixée au 30 juin 2011.
         Le Projet de Soutien aux Services (PSS) est géré par le Fonds d’Appui au Développement
Communautaire (FADC) qui est une institution créée en 1993, régie par des textes juridiques et
statutaires.31

        Le FADC joue le rôle d’un organisme de financement d’intérêt public, doté de l’autonomie
administrative et financière et jouissant de la personnalité morale. Son siège est à Moroni, la capitale, et
intervient sur trois îles de l’Union des Comores : Anjouan, Ngazidja et Mohéli.

        A.1 La structure organisationnelle et mode de fonctionnement du FADC :

A.1.1. Structure organisationnelle :

La structure organisationnelle du FADC comprend deux niveaux :

          Un niveau central composé d’un organe délibératif qui est le Comité Central de Coordination
          (CCC), et d’un organe exécutif et de supervision qui est le Secrétariat Exécutif National (SEN).
          Le CCC fait office de conseil d’administration, qui trace la politique générale du FADC, tandis
          que le SEN est chargé de la gestion administrative et financière et de la coordination des activités
          du Projet.

   Ordonnance n°93-001/PR du 06/01/93 et décret n°93-068/PR du 13/04/93 portant création, organisation et fonctionnement du
FADC, modifié par les décrets n°01-119/CE du 22 octobre 2001 et n°03-13/PR du 28 janvier 2003 pour prendre en compte les
nouvelles institutions organisationnelles de l’Union des Comores.

         Un niveau régional composé d’un Comité Régional (CR) et d’un Secrétariat Exécutif Régional
         (SER), opérant sur chacune des trois îles. Le CR assume les fonctions de supervision et de
         contrôle, alors que le SER constitue l’organe administratif et d’exécution qui assure la gestion
         quotidienne des opérations au niveau des îles.

A.1.2. Mode de fonctionnement du FADC :

         A la base, ce sont les comités de pilotage (CP) qui assurent le rôle d’organes intermédiaires entre
la population et le FADC. Chaque CP constitue la cellule de base responsable de l'exécution des sous-
projets au niveau de la communauté.

       Les modalités de fonctionnement et de gestion du FADC sont régies par les Manuels de
Procédures et le Manuel Administratif et Financier qui ont été élaborés durant la phase préparatoire et
approuvés par le CCC et l’IDA puis en 2009 pour ce qui est du Manuel en Protection Sociale.

        Les Manuels de Procédures présentent le cadre général, la structure organisationnelle, définissent
les conditions de financement, d’éligibilité et de sélection des sous-projets, ainsi que les procédures de
soumission, d’évaluation, d’approbation et d’exécution ainsi que celles la passation des marchés, la
gestion financière et comptable, le suivi et l’évaluation à postériori des sous-projets.

       Le Manuel Administratif et Financier a fait l’objet d’une révision en septembre 2009. Les
amendements proposés visent à prendre en compte les recommandations des diverses missions de la
Banque, des auditeurs externes et de l’audit institutionnel.

        Le cadre de gestion environnementale et sociale et le cadre de politique de réinstallation ont été
diffusés à la banque et dans le pays et le Manuel de gestion environnementale et sociale a été révisé.

         Conformément aux termes des accords juridiques, le FADC a été soumis à un audit financier
annuellement effectué par des Cabinets indépendants approuvés par l’IDA32. Ces cabinets d’audit ont été
chargés d’examiner les comptes financiers et d’évaluer les performances du projet. En outre, 2 audits
techniques ont été également effectués par des Consultants indépendants, pour vérifier si les
infrastructures financées ont été construites selon les normes techniques et les standards établis par les
autorités comoriennes et aussi vérifier si les procédures de mise en œuvre opérationnelle et de passation
de marchés sont respectées.

        Enfin, les Chargés du Projet à la Banque mondiale ont assuré une supervision générale et
permanente du déroulement du projet en particulier grâce à des visites périodiques associant des
spécialistes et des consultants de la Banque selon les besoins.

         Une évaluation des bénéficiaires33 a été menée en 2006 dont l’objectif est (i) d’apprécier
l’efficacité des procédures et approches du FADC III, notamment celles qui ont un impact au niveau des
communautés bénéficiaires, (ii) évaluer le degré de perception et de satisfaction des populations des
communautés bénéficiaires par rapport aux appuis fournis par le FADC et (iii) évaluer l’opérationnalité et
la pérennité des Comités de pilotage (CP) en tant que structures de développement communautaire, les
capacités de gestion des CP et des Comités de gestion (CG) et le degré d’implication des agents villageois
de développement (AVD) dans les activités de développement communautaire. Les résultats de cette

évaluation montrent que globalement, le FADC de par ses approches, ses procédures et les résultats
enregistrés a obtenu une appréciation positive de la part des bénéficiaires cibles du Projet.

        B. OBJECTIFS ET DESCRIPTION DU PROJET :

Lors de la mise en place du don TF094537 provenant du FPCR [Food Price Crisis Response34], il a été
convenu avec les autorités que l'opération d'urgence proposée vise à soutenir la réponse du gouvernement
à la crise alimentaire en finançant un programme d’Argent Contre Travail (ACT - Cash for Work) dans
les zones d’insécurité alimentaire.

En conséquence, cette opération avait conduit à réviser les Objectifs de Développement du Projet
(Project Development Outcomes ou PDO) et les indicateurs liés afin de refléter au mieux les activités
soutenues au titre du crédit initial et le premier financement additionnel, après intégration des fonds
supplémentaires provenant du don relatif au FPCR.

Les Objectifs de Développement du Projet (Project Development Outcomes ou PDO) ont été ainsi révisés
et reformulés comme suit:
        (i)     accroître l'accès à court terme emploi dans les zones d'insécurité alimentaire (nouvel
                objectif),
        (ii)    accroître l'accès aux services sociaux de base dans les communautés pauvres (objectif
                reformulé), et
        (iii)   contribuer au renforcement de la capacité des les collectivités à planifier leur
                développement (objectif reformulé)

         Contribuer au renforcement des capacités des
                                                                Reformulation : Contribuer à renforcer la capacité des
  3      communautés base et les acteurs locaux à mener
                                                                collectivités à planifier leur développement.
         un processus de développement local.

         La principale différence entre les Objectifs de Développement du Projet initiaux et révisés est
l'introduction d'un nouvel objectif correspondant à la nouvelle activité « filet de protection sociale »
financée par le don provenant du FPCR.

         Par ailleurs, les deux autres objectifs initiaux ont été reformulés afin de mieux refléter les
activités effectivement menées par le Projet.

         Le premier objectif initial a été modifié qu’au lieu de « maintenir services sociaux de base dans
         les communautés défavorisées et groupes vulnérables spécifiques » (qui reflète ce que le projet
         n'a pratiquement effectué comme il finance de nouveaux sous-projets) celui-ci a été reformulé
         comme « l'accroissement de l’accès aux services sociaux base dans des communautés pauvres »
         (qui est le groupe cible du projet).
34
   Le FPCR est un fonds fiduciaire pour octroyer des dons aux pays fragiles soutenus par l’IDA (International Development
Association). Le FPCR est une des facilités offertes par le GFRP [Global Food Crisis Response Program] de la Banque
Mondiale qui fournit un cadre global pour apporter un soutien rapide par la Banque une réponse globale à la crise alimentaire.
                                                             53
        Le deuxième objectif initial a été reformulé pour exclure le renforcement des capacités des
        acteurs locaux (gouvernements locaux ou communes), étant donné que ces communes n'ont pas
        encore été créées.

       Aux termes de l’Accord de Crédit 3868-COM, de l’Accord de Financement H-265-COM, de
l’Accord de Don FPCR N° TF 094537 et de la restructuration, les différentes Composantes du Projet
sont :

    a. Composante 1: Filet de Protection Sociale (Argent Contre Travail) - US$ 850.000 provenant
       du Cofinancement - FPCR)

Cette composante a servi à financer un programme d’Argent Contre Travail pour accroître l’accès à des
emplois temporaires dans des zones d’insécurité alimentaire. Par la création d’emplois, cette composante
augmentera les revenus disponibles des groupes vulnérables et augmentant ainsi leur consommation
alimentaire, dont les femmes.
Le mécanisme de ciblage est basé sur un processus comportant trois étapes : (i) allocation de fonds à
travers les îles suivant la formule convenue entre le FADC et les autorités approuvée par l’IDA
relativement à la composante 2; (ii) identification des communautés les plus touchées par la crise
alimentaire générée par l’augmentation des prix à travers un processus transparent concerté avec les
autorités locales; et (iii) sélection par les communautés elles-mêmes des ménages les plus touchées par la
crise du prix des denrées alimentaires .

    b. Composante 2 : Infrastructures de base, gérées par les Communautés - US$10.4 millions
       incluant : (i) US$6.8 millions déjà décaissés et provenant du crédit initial et (ii) US$3.6 millions
       provenant du Financement additionnel (dans lesquels US$ 3.1 millions n’ont pas été décaissés au
       31/12/2008).

Cette composante a servi à financer le renforcement de capacité et la formation du capital social dans les
communautés défavorisées. Le projet a contribué à l’élaboration par les communautés des Plans de
Développement Locaux ou PDL dont l’objectif est que, suivant un processus participatif, la communauté
s’accorde sur une liste prioritaire de développement et sur les sous-projets y afférents. Cette composante a
financé par la suite des sous-projets d’infrastructures communautaires afin d’accroître l’accès aux services
sociaux et économiques parmi les communautés participantes. Elle consistait en la réhabilitation et la
reconstruction de sous-projets d’infrastructure communautaire de petite envergure identifiés par les
communautés, dont les salles de classe et écoles, adduction d’eau et assainissement à petite échelle, voies
de desserte et activités de prévention de l’érosion du sol. Les communautés affectées par les crises
politiques et économiques sont aussi ciblées. En vertu de la restructuration du projet, cette composante
inclurait les deux premiers volets du projet original: la composante communautaire de sous-projets et du
composant renforcement des capacités.

    c. Composante 3 : Services de Santé – US$ 0.9 million à partir du Crédit initial.

Cette composante a servi à financer le renforcement des capacités techniques du personnel médical bien
sélectionné à travers la formation dans des domaines spécialisés identifiés comme faisant partie d'un
projet de santé financé par l'IDA fermé en Juin 2004) et la maintenance et l’acquisition d’équipements
médicaux. Ces activités ont été complétées avec succès au titre du crédit initial. En conséquence, ni le
premier financement additionnel, ni le cofinancement ne financent pas cette composante.



                                                    54
      d. Composante 4 : Approvisionnement en Eau en milieu Urbain – US$ 2,7 millions financés par
         le Crédit Initial.

La composante hydraulique urbaine (dont les activités avaient été identifiées dans le cadre du projet
Infrastructure Eau et Environnement, financé par l'IDA et fermé en août 2003) prévoyait la réhabilitation
et l'extension de l'approvisionnement en eau dans les capitales d'Anjouan (Mutsamudu) et de Mohéli
(Fomboni). Cette composante a également financé le renforcement des capacités des comités de gestion
de l'eau et campagne d'information, éducation et communication (IEC) sur la gestion de l'eau,
l'assainissement et l’hygiène. Ces 3 activités ont été menées à terme au titre du crédit initial, ni le
premier financement additionnel ni le cofinancement ne financent pas cette composante.

      e. Composante 5: Gestion de projet, Suivi et Evaluation, et Audit - US$ 4,5 millions dont: (i)
         US$ 2,9 millions de dollars du crédit initial, (ii) US$ 1,4 millions du premier financement
         additionnel auquel US$ 1,0 million était encore à décaisser à compter du 31 Décembre 2008 et,
         (iii) US$ 150 000 provenant du don FPCR pour couvrir les coûts d'exploitation additionnels liés
         à la gestion, le suivi et l'évaluation et l’Audit de la composante en espèces contre travail.

Cette composante a financé les coûts de fonctionnement du FADC et l’assistance technique pour les
audits afin d’assurer que le projet soit exécuté avec succès, de manière rentable et décentralisée. En outre,
cette composante a appuyé les activités de Suivi et Evaluation, en allant même au-delà du suivi des
résultats du projet pour évaluer l’impact des activités basées dans la collectivité sur la vie du projet. Cette
composante a soutenu aussi des activités additionnelles en vue de promouvoir la responsabilité locale et
améliorer les résultats du développement à long terme tels les suivis - évaluation participatifs par les
communautés bénéficiaires.


          C. EVALUATION RETROSPECTIVE DE LA PREPARATION ET DE L’EXECUTION
             DU PROJET

      Points forts internes :

    Faisant suite aux 2 projets FADC I et FADC II dont l’approche est basée sur le concept Community
Driven Development (CDD)35 laquelle consiste à cibler toute intervention en fonction des demandes
émanant des populations elles-mêmes par le biais de leurs comités de pilotage juridiquement constitués et
mandatés par l’ensemble de la communauté, le FADC III (PSS) cherche à cibler les communautés les plus
défavorisées et pauvres susceptibles d’être fragilisés par les divers chocs économiques internes (instabilité
politico-institutionnelle) ou externe (crise financière mondiale et augmentation des prix des denrées
alimentaires et du pétrole).

      Cette approche a mis en place un processus transparent pour :

                    (i) aider les communautés à identifier leurs besoins clés,
                    (ii) renforcer les capacités des communautés et leur donner les outils pour planifier,
                         préparer les propositions de sous projets pour financement aux bailleurs de fonds,
                    (iii) superviser l’exécution des sous projets et assurer l’entretien,
                    (iv) introduire le suivi et l’évaluation participative et le financement direct des
                         communautés. L’approche a initié l’intégration dans la conception des sous-projets et


35
     Connu aussi sous le sigle DDP ou Développement Décentralisé Participatif.
                                                              55
                           marchés connexes des mesures visant à alléger ou corriger l’impact environnemental
                           et social négatif.

            a. Ressources humaines / expertise : les expériences acquises lors de la réalisation des deux
               autres fonds sociaux précédents (FADC I et FADC II) ont constitué une masse significative
               d’expertise constituée de cadres opérationnels et compétents en réalisation de sous projets.

            b. Décaissement : le rythme de décaissement et la qualité de la gestion financière du FADC ont
               fait que d’une part, aucun problème majeur n’est survenu au cours de la réalisation du Projet
               et que d’autre part, tous les audits financiers externes réalisés n’ont pas fait l’objet de réserves
               tels que requis par les Accords de Financement.

            c. Organisationnelle : La présence d’unités décentralisées dans chaque île (Secrétariats
               Exécutifs Régionaux ou SER) a permis une bonne couverture nationale ayant permis un taux
               élevé de pénétration même au niveau de zones très enclavées.

            d. Flexibilité opérationnelle : Les diverses modifications dictées par les réalités vécues par le
               pays telles le financement additionnel en 2006 et la mise en place d’une nouvelle composante
               (Protection Sociale) en 2009-2010 ainsi que la restructuration qui s’ensuivit n’ont pas influé
               l’opérationnalité du Projet. Toutefois, il faut noter que le départ de quelques cadres
               opérationnels après la restructuration et l’intégration des nouvelles recrues a plus ou moins
               ralenti l’intensité des opérations durant un délai assez raisonnable.

            e. Du point de vue procédurier : La disponibilité d’une procédure opérationnelle suffisamment
               précise mais souple ainsi que le système d’information comptable et de suivi évaluation
               adapté a permis une aisance opérationnelle pour l’atteinte des objectifs.

            f.   Mémoire institutionnelle : Depuis le début de ses activités en 1993, le FADC a engrangé
                 une masse importante d’informations relatives au développement local dont les PDL, les
                 Evaluations spécifiques et études diverses qui peuvent être mis à la disposition de tous les
                 acteurs (gouvernement, bailleurs, organismes de développement) pour une meilleure vision
                 de la politique de développement des Comores. Cette masse d’information mérite d’être
                 valorisée au mieux et le pays surtout en cette période où le processus de décentralisation est
                 en cours.

       Points forts Externes :

       a. Notoriété de l’institution vis-à-vis des autorités (gouvernement, administration, élus) :

            Les autorités tant nationales (gouvernement) que locales (administration, élus communaux) ont
            toujours manifesté une appréciation très positive du FADC. Dernièrement, dans le cadre des
            réponses aux menaces des diverses crises (crises internes, alimentaire mondiale et économique
            internationale), le FADC vient d’être choisi comme agence d’exécution des Projets PURC et
            PUSA.

            De par ses statuts, le FADC est sous la tutelle du Commissariat Général du Plan et sous la tutelle
            de la Présidence de l’Union des Comores36. Toutefois, cette dernière, dans le cadre des Manuels
            de Procédures laisse le champ libre au FADC dans la gestion quotidienne et les décisions
            opérationnelles mettant ainsi le FADC à l’abri des trafics d’influence politique diverses.

36
     Auparavant, il a été sous la tutelle du Ministère des Finances
                                                                 56
    b. Confiance des bénéficiaires :

Les bénéficiaires ont toujours gardé à travers le FADC l’image de « l’engagement tenu ». En effet, le
FADC a toujours tenu ses engagements pour la réalisation des requêtes des bénéficiaires dès qu’il s’est
prononcé à les réaliser.

    c. Qualité des réalisations :

D’une manière générale, la qualité des infrastructures réalisées par le FADC est appréciée par les
bénéficiaires/utilisateurs et autant pour les institutions de tutelle. Particulièrement, les Ecoles réalisées par
le FADC sont très appréciées par le Ministère de L‘Education de par la qualité des réalisations et la
fonctionnalité immédiate des écoles construites (table bancs, latrines, point d’eau) avec le respect des
mesures de sauvegarde environnementale.

    d. Disponibilité d’un réseau fiable de partenaires sociaux et techniques (AVD, CP, CP, ENEX).

Les cycles de renforcement de capacités mis en œuvre par le FADC pendant tout le cycle de projet dès
l’initiation, passant par la mise en œuvre jusqu’à la livraison des sous projets ont mis à la disposition du
FADC un réseau fiable de partenaires sociaux qui peuvent soutenir les activités de développement social
et communautaire.

    e. Création d’emplois temporaires ou permanents très significative pendant la durée de vie du
       Projet. Cette création d’emploi s’est matérialisée par la naissance d’entreprises de BTP et de
       bureaux d’études techniques ainsi que les emplois générés par les chantiers de Protection
       Sociale.

    Points faibles internes :

        Un problème sur le management du Projet a été constaté en 2008. De manière concertée, le
         Gouvernement et la Banque Mondiale ont pu faire les redressements nécessaires ce qui a conduit
         au départ du Directeur en 2009 et à la restructuration du Projet.
        Difficulté et retard dans la mise en place d’un système informatisé de suivi évaluation.
        Insuffisance de formation du personnel à l’extérieur.

    Points faibles externes :

        Dans la mise en cohérence avec les programmations sectorielles des sous projets approuvées par
        le FADC sur la base de requêtes communautaires, cette coordination aurait souffert de la lenteur
        administrative, de la carence en communication entre les centres de décisions ministériels et leurs
        services déconcentrés.

        Toujours du point de vue externe, la soutenabilité des réalisations a des fois souffert de la non
        appropriation par quelques bénéficiaires des réalisations ce qui compromet la pérennisation des
        acquis.

        Enfin, il mérite des cas de réalisation tardive des apports bénéficiaires dans les régions très
        pauvres.

           D. ANALYSE DES PRINCIPAUX FACTEURS AYANT AFFECTE L’EXECUTION ET
              LES RESULTATS

     La rigueur et le professionnalisme qui ont prévalu dans l’exécution des activités par le FADC ont affecté
     de manière favorable à l’atteinte des résultats. Ceci est dû d’une part à la qualité professionnelle et la
     motivation de ses agents mais aussi et surtout la disposition de manuels de travail (manuels de
     procédures et manuels d’exécution) clairs et très pertinents d’autre part.
     Toutefois, les différentes perturbations externes, dues aux crises qu’a traversées le pays avaient eu des
     impacts plus ou moins négatifs pour une bonne marche des activités (suspension des décaissements....)

           E. DESCRIPTION DES REALISATIONS DU PROJET, ET UNE EVALUATION DES
              RESULTATS ET IMPACTS DU PROJET

         Sur un ensemble de 331 communautés villageoises existantes (identifiées lors du RGPH37 2003),
dans le cadre de ses programmes annuels de la période de 2004 à juin 2011, le FADC a identifié à
apporter un appui technique et financière à 156 communautés pour la création ou restructuration de 156
Comités de Pilotage (CP), 156 Comité de Gestion (CG) et 312 agents villageois de développement
(AVD) dont la moitié sont des femmes. Les 156 communautés ont bénéficié d’un appui technique et
financier pour l’élaboration et la validation de 156 PDL dont 102 ont eu un financement pour la
réalisation d’un sous projet programmé.

Sur l’ensemble de 331 communautés villageoises, 87 ont été sélectionnées pour bénéficier d’un sous
projet argent contre travail.

Sur la base du budget annuel, du Programme de travail annuel et du plan de passation des marchés, le
Projet avait prévu de réaliser pendant la période de 2004 à 2011 incluant des périodes suspensions de
décaissements :

            75 sous projets « Argent contre travail » bénéficiant à 3 500 personnes
            100 sous projets IDB
            156 PDL
            22 médecins et para médicaux boursiers formés,
            Le plateau technique des centres hospitaliers (national et régionaux) équipés et entretenus,
            Les adductions d’eau de Mutsamudu à Anjouan et Fomboni à Mohéli réhabilitées.

               En 2011, le FADC a mis en œuvre et achevés 87 sous projets « Argent contre travail » pour un coût
        total de 331 267 799 KMF dont 248 678 300 KMF au titre de rémunération de 4 343 individus dont
        2 457 femmes (57%) répartis dans 87 communautés bénéficiaires.

        Au total, 108 425 personnes / jours ont été créés.

         F. ANALYSE DE LA PERENNITE DES ACQUIS ET RESULTATS DU PROJET

          Les principaux résultats obtenus par le Projet s’articulent ainsi autour de trois thèmes principaux :

          La mise en place d’infrastructures pour la fourniture des services socio-économiques de base dans
          les zones généralement pauvres,
          Les activités de renforcement de capacité des communautés de base à travers ses représentants
          (AVG, CP, CG),
          La création d’emplois temporaires générant des revenus supplémentaires aux couches de la
          population vulnérable pour faire face à l’insécurité alimentaire.

Les réalisations à travers ces trois domaines sus-évoqués ont servi substantiellement à constituer des actifs
au bénéfice et du pays et aux bénéficiaires directs tant en infrastructures de base qu’en accroissement de
revenus à travers les chantiers de protection sociale. A ce titre, l’étude économique faite en début 201138 a
révélé l’obtention d’importants acquis économiques et sociaux au marché national, induits par les
constructions d’infrastructures.

         Quant aux mesures qui méritent d’être retenues afin d’assurer la pérennité des réalisations du
projet, celles-ci devraient s’articuler principalement sur l’institutionnalisation de la culture d’entretien
initiée et mise en place lors de la réalisation des infrastructures à travers les Manuels d’Exploitation remis
aux Comités de Gestion39.

         Le manque de moyens est toujours évoqué comme un blocage substantiel pour l’atteinte de ces
objectifs mais avec le processus de décentralisation et déconcentration en marche, l’espoir est permis
pour une meilleure gestion et entretien du patrimoine communautaire en terme d’infrastructures de base.

    Enfin, la valorisation des acquis par les entités bénéficiaires qui ont collaboré avec le Projet est aussi
un point qui ne saurait être négligé. En effet, les formations et encadrements fournis aux bénéficiaires
méritent d’être poursuivis et renforcés au mieux lors de la mise en œuvre des activités actuelles et futures
du FADC.

         G. ANALYSE DES PERFORMANCES DES DIFFERENTES PARTIES PRENANTES :

         Les différentes parties prenantes du Projet sont principalement : l’agence d’exécution (FADC) qui
est, les communautés bénéficiaires représentées par les structures de base impliquées dans le projet, la
Banque Mondiale, le Gouvernement ;

     a) Le FADC :


38
   Cf. Analyse économique d’un échantillon de Projets de soutien aux Services mise en œuvre par le Fond d’appui au
Développement Communautaire – FADC 3ème PHASE par Eric Rakotomanana,
39
   Dans le moyen et le long terme, cette action devrait être appuyée et relayée par les entités déconcentrées des départements
techniques officiels concernés dans leurs secteurs respectifs avec la collaboration des bénéficiaires et les gouvernements locaux.
                                                               63
                    Le FADC, en tant qu’agence d’exécution du Projet a toujours mené sa mission telle que celle-ci a
           été définie dans les accords légaux sous la supervision du Comité Central de Coordination 40(CCC) qui
           fait office de Conseil d’Administration. En termes de performance, du point de vue gestion de Projet, les
           audits tant financiers que techniques ont toujours mentionné une conformité de la situation managériale
           du Projet par rapport aux accords passés, les manuels de procédures et la qualité des interventions.

                   Toutefois, dans des cas précis, l’on peut dire que le Projet a laissé une empreinte non négligeable
           en ayant façonné une visibilité très objective du développement local surtout au niveau des communautés
           de base par la mise en place des PDL.

                  b) Les communautés bénéficiaires et ses structures d’accompagnement :

                         Dans la majorité des cas, les attentes communautés dans le cadre de la réalisation du Projet
           ont été satisfaites.      En effet, la participation de ces bénéficiaires directs dès la conception de leurs
           sous projets, passant par les apports requis et à travers l’appropriation par la mise en œuvre des plans
           d’entretien a toujours été citée comme exemplaire.

                        Toutefois, dans certains cas, l’on a constaté une appropriation moins dynamique des
           réalisations avec une négligence sur les activités d’entretien. Cependant, cet état de fait ne saurait être
           considéré comme une contre performance de ces entités mais appelle à une revue des renforcements de
           capacités qui s’y rapportent à l’endroit des bénéficiaires en particulier ces Comités de Gestion (CG).

                  c)         La Banque Mondiale

                       La Banque Mondiale n’a pas été uniquement un bailleur de fonds pour le Projet. Dans le
           cadre de relations cordiales et constructives surtout à travers les missions de supervision régulières et son
           appui technique, elle a été un partenaire technique à part entière qui a permis la bonne performance du
           Projet en général et du FADC en particulier.

                  d)         Le Gouvernement

                       Lors de sa création en 1993, les statuts du FADC le mettent sous la tutelle du Ministère des
           Finances à travers le Commissariat Général du Plan qui, dernièrement est rattaché directement à la
           Présidence de l’Union. Dans la préparation comme dans l’exécution des programme qui se sont succédés,
           dont le PSS, le FADC a bénéficié d’un fort soutien de ce dernier en particulier, et du gouvernement en
           général, pour le prémunir de toute capture politique néfaste qui pourrait nuire à l’atteinte des objectifs de
           développement du programme.

                      I.     LES PRINCIPALES LEÇONS APPRISES DE L’EXPERIENCE DU PROJET.

                  a) Durant la mise en œuvre du Projet de Soutien aux Services, il a été mis en place un Système
                     informatisé de suivi évaluation (SISE) en plus du Système Intégré de Gestion informatisée


           41
                Cf. Section B.
                                                                             65
        utilisant un progiciel multisite appelé TOMPRO, agréé par la Banque Mondiale. Ce SISE a
        permis :
        (i)      d’harmoniser le système de suivi des IDB par les Opérations et par les AVD,
        (ii)     le suivi des phases menant à la validation d’un PDL,
        (iii)    le suivi des phases des formations menant à la gestion efficace des ouvrages par les CG,
        (iv)     suivi des résultats de renforcement des capacités des CP et CG.

        Cependant ces deux systèmes présentent des difficultés puisqu’il n’y a pas passerelles entre le
        SIG et le SISE ne permettant un transfert automatique des données financières dans le SISE. Par
        ailleurs la configuration du SISE n’a pas encore permis d’intégrer le suivi des sous projets de
        Protection Sociale.

    b) La dimension environnementale qui a été intégrée dans le processus de mise en œuvre des sous
       projets a été un des points qui mérite d’être mentionné étant donné qu’elle a permis d’incrémenter
       la qualité des réalisations.

    c) La mise en phase des activités du Projet par rapport aux politiques sectorielles gagnerait à
       être plus développée afin de créer plus de synergie avec les autres Projets / Programmes financés
       par d’autres bailleurs ou autres acteurs de développement (Union Européenne, AFD, Nations
       Unies,...) et partant de créer une valeur ajoutée substantielle à l’endroit des populations cibles.

    d) Le design des sous projets en adduction d’eau potable mérite d’être revu compte tenu des
       lacunes constatées en post projet (système d’exploitation, recouvrement des redevances, entretien
       et pérennisation).


       J.   CONCLUSION :

        La mise en œuvre du Projet de Soutien aux Services (ou FADC III) a marqué un point important
dans le processus de développement local qui peut soutenir une bonne effectivité de la politique de
décentralisation aux Comores.

        En effet, le Programme a objectivement jeté les bases d’un développement harmonieux émanant
des véritables aspirations des communautés de base et partant d’une participation citoyenne significative.

        De par les impacts des activités du Programme, le gouvernement a ainsi à sa disposition à l’heure
actuelle d’un terrain suffisamment « défriché » sur lequel se développera sûrement la politique de
décentralisation qui est en cours de mise en œuvre.

        Par ailleurs, la mise en œuvre du Projet de Soutien aux Services a contribué à
l’amélioration des conditions de vie et du bien-être socio-économique des ménages pauvres, en
conformité au Document de Stratégie de Croissance et de Réduction de la Pauvreté.
