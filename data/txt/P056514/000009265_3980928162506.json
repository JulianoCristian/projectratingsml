The project\n            consists of four main components. First, restructuring of\n            the MOT and independence of Transport State Agencies will\n            support technical services in the following aspects: i)\n            reorganize the MOT around the new functions needed in a\n            market economy; ii) review and redraft the statutes of the\n            MOT, and draft new statutes for transport state agencies\n            guaranteeing their independent and increasing their\n            accountability ; iii) determine proper information flows\n            within the transport sector; and iv) institutionalize\n            recruitment and promotion procedures in the MOT. Second,\n            information technology for the MOT will include the\n            provision of office technology to support the new MOT\n            organization. Third, refurbishment of the MOT building will\n            cover part of the MOT building to be used by the new\n            ministry. Fourth, training of MOT staff and Georgian\n            decision-makers will provide a training program with\n            international lecturers."}, "docdt": "1998-09-02T00:00:00Z"}
