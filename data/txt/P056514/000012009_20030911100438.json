substantial. Some aspects that emerged\n            from this project deserve special mention, in particular the\n            careful selection of an appropriate consultant, who was not\n            only skilled in drafting legislation, in presenting new\n            organizational structures, and defining staff positions, but\n            in addition to the technical skills, was also capable to\n            communicate, and persuade for acceptance of new concepts.\n            Restructuring issues suggest flexibility in the content of\n            the terms of reference (TOR), phasing and sequencing of\n            actions and decisions, and for the time frame needed to\n            implement Government agreements, and actions; however, most\n            importantly, restructuring of institutions requires a\n            different type of consulting concept - process consulting -\n            which is a way to manage change. This entails a\n            consultant's ability to structure the relationship with\n            the client, such that the help provided is genuinely\n            relevant to the client's needs. In Georgia, problems in\n            government organizations are so complex, and the information\n            relevant to their diagnosis is so concealed, that meaningful\n            changes can only be achieved if the client is fully involved\n            in the diagnosis, and study processes. And, while the\n            implementation of the restructuring of the Ministry of\n            Transport and Communications had to overcome many obstacles,\n            it nevertheless met less resistance than would a reform\n            designed to overhaul the entire governmental structure."}, "docdt": "2003-09-09T00:00:00Z"}
