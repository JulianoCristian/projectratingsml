(b) improvement of\n            management information systems of the Directorate General of\n            Water Resources Development; (c) training and support for\n            water users and their associations; (d) expansion of\n            DGWRD's basic hydrological data network; (e) and\n            studies for development of the Cisanggarung River Basin and\n            detailed design of the Jatigede Dam. The project will create\n            a demand for some 21 million man-days of labor over the\n            construction period, and will increase rice production by\n            about 36,000 tons/year by 1990. The main risk facing the\n            project is that, in the Sitiung II component, agricultural\n            benefits might build up slower than projected; however,\n            sensitivity analysis indicates that this risk lies within\n            tolerable limits. Other project components, including\n            designs and studies of future projects and assistance to\n            DGWRD for institution building, bear low risk."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
