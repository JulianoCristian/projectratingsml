SUMMARY
Per Presidential Decree N.66, dated 9 February, 2011, the Ministry of Labor, Health, and
Social Affairs (MOLHSA)’s Health and Social Projects Implementation Center,
(HSPIC), which served as the Project Coordination Unit (PIU), was abolished and the
MOLHSA’s D. Sakvarelidze National Center for Disease Control and Public Health
(NCDC&PH) was designated as its successor.

As a result, the NCDC&PH is now the unit within the MOLHSA that is legally
responsible for managing project implementation. Consequently, a number of
amendments are proposed to the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement (Credit
No. 3702-GE) for the above-referenced Project, dated May 20, 2009 between Georgia
(the Recipient) and the International Development Association (the Association) as
amended (the Financing Agreement).


PROJECT STATUS
Progress observed towards the achievement of the project development objectives is rated
as satisfactory as measured by the project performance indicators. Project implementation
is also progressing satisfactorily.


PROPOSED CHANGES
The Financing Agreement (Credit No. 3702-GE) is proposed to be amended to replace
HSPIC with NCDC&PH as the designated unit responsible to assist MOLHSA in the
management, coordination, and monitoring of the Project.
