This restructuring paper seeks approval to extend\n            the current Closing Date by 6 months from December 31, 2011\n            to June 30, 2012. This will be the fourth extension of the\n            Credit. As explained below, previous extensions were due in\n            large part to external events that affected project\n            implementation. The Government of Georgia (GoG) is seeking\n            the extension to enable satisfactory completion of ongoing\n            technical assistance activities and small investments needed\n            for the development of the Ministry of Labor, Health and\n            Social Affairs (MOLHSA)'s social information management\n            system (SIMS).
