:
Short list of consultants for    services, 
estimated to cost less than 
$100,000
equivalent per contract, may comprise entirely of 
national consultants in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant 
Guidelines. 
 
3.  Any Other Special Selection Arrangements: 
 
I. In additional to the methods mentioned above 
“Service Delivery Contractors”
 could be used as a 
method for hiring of large numbers of individuals who deliver services on a contract basis (for 
example, social workers, such as nurses and paramedics). The job descriptions, minimum 
qualifications, selection procedures, and terms of employment, shall be furnished to the Bank for its 
review and “no objection”. No advertisement is required. The extent of Bank review of these 
procedures and documents shall be described in the Procurement Plan approved by the Bank.  
 
II. Consultants Guidelines “Least-cost Selection” (with simplified approach and some elements due to 
specifics of re-training of medical personnel in Tbilisi and regions as described below)
 
could be used 
for selection of local firms (Family Medicine Training Centers) to conduct re-training of medical 
personnel in Tbilisi and regions.  
 
The reason for this is an accreditation of Family Medicine Training Centers recently conducted in the 
country based on the Ministerial Decree, #135/N 08.04.2009. Each firm that had been willing to 
Page  7
participate in the re-training of medical personnel as well as their personnel was assessed according 
the technical requirements wanted for this assignment. As results of this comprehensive assessment, 
there are fifteen local firms (see enclosed the list) successfully passed accreditation to train medical 
personnel. All fifteen firms (i) meet the minimum required qualification and experience wanted for 
this typical assignment and (ii) are eligible candidates (Consultants' Guidelines (CGL) Para.1.11) and 
(iii) there is no conflict of interest with the consultants' previous assignments (CGL Para. 1.9).  
 
Based on the above mentioned 
clarifications the “Least-cost Selection” (with simplified approach and 
some elements)
 
has been chosen for the case with re-training assignment in Kutaisi (Y2009 and 
Y2010) to avoid two steps of the LCS, like advertisement and creation of a shortlist, since there is a 
specified number of firms which are allowed to participate in the competition; and these firms are 
already evaluated by the State Regulatory Agency for Medical Activities to the minimum wanted 
requirements, while methodology is unified for all participants. The extent of Bank review of these 
procedures and documents shall be described in the Procurement Plan approved by the Bank. 
Candidates will be asked to submit combined Technical and Financial proposal. Proposals, to be 
submitted in two envelopes, are invited from a short list. Technical proposals are opened first and 
evaluated. A
 
“minimum” qualifying mark for the “quality” is 75. The financial proposals are opened in 
public. The firm with the lowest price shall then be selected. The other procedures are as in typical 
LCS.  
 
As per the similar re-training assignment in Tbilisi (Y2010), the advertisement will be used to create 
shortlists per packages allowing certified firms with different capacities to participate in the 
competition and select desired package.
