                         The project is in its last month of implementation. Disbursement is over 95%, 5% is committed and all activities will be finalized by June 30, 2012. Although most of the activities had
                         been finalized, with good results, by 2011, a final extension was granted to the project with the objective to finalize the Health management information system activities. Due to
                         exchange rate change gains, the project has adequate funding left to finalize these activities. Thanks to this last extension the project has been able to finalize the development and
                         the testing of the Social Management Information System (SIMS) which assisted the government with the implementation of its policy decision to improve and monitor access and
                         quality to health services in Georgia. The Implementation rating is satisfactory, as all indicators have been achieved and several exceeded their targets. The Development objective

                         rating is marginally satisfactory as it reflects the overall achievements on health outcomes, which have stagnating in Georgia over the last 2 decades. Although the project did
                         contribute to many improvements in the health sector, more is needed to improve actual health outcomes such as life expectancy and financial protection from catastrophic health
                         spending.
