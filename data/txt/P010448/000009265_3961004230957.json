AND BAGASSE PAPER", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Forestry Research Education and\n            Extension Project will initiate a long-term process to\n            strengthen India's forestry research system, improve\n            the system of forestry education, and facilitate the\n            extension of research findings, thus contributing to growth\n            in the forestry sector that is consistent with priorities\n            for conservation and the sustainable use of forest\n            resources. The project includes five components. The first\n            component, research management, based on the development the\n            Indian Council for Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE),\n            will improve the management and coordination of forestry\n            research and extension through staff training, studies and\n            consultancies to develop priority setting methodologies and\n            a management information system, and provision of a\n            headquarters building and equipment. The second component,\n            research program support, will provide necessary\n            infrastructure, equipment and operating expenses for\n            selected research programs in ICFRE institutes, establish a\n            research grant fund to commission research by public and\n            private sector agencies, take measures to improve the\n            quality of planting stock, human resource development\n            through staff training, scientific review of institutes and\n            programs, and improve the library and information systems\n            and statistical services. The third component, forestry\n            education, involves the development and validation of\n            forestry curricula in formal education through provision of\n            funds for review and revision work, and development of the\n            Deemed Forestry University at Dehra Dun, primarily by\n            financing post-graduate research awards. The fourth\n            component, forestry policy and preparation, will strengthen\n            capabilities within the Ministry of Forests and Environment\n            (MOEF) for the analysis of forest policies and preparation\n            of future forestry projects through staff training and\n            provision for studies and consultancies. The fifth\n            component, conservation of biodiversity, will support\n            development of programs for ecodevelopment around two\n            protected areas, by involving communities in the planning\n            and implementation of programs for creation of alternative\n            natural or social resources or for income generation.\n            Concurrent improvements in the planning and management of\n            the protected areas will also be financed."}, "docdt": "1994-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
