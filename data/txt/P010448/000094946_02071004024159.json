impact\n            as substantial, Bank performance as satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance as satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            from the project include: 1) Openness to proposed extension\n            of closing dates by Bank management can be desirable. 2) The\n            provision of adequate Bank supervision budget was essential\n            to the success of the project. 3) Design of a project\n            involving multiple implementing agencies should not rely on\n            overall coordination by a national ministry, unless that\n            ministry has already demonstrated its capacity for such\n            coordination. 4) Good financial management requires the\n            active involvement of a financial management specialist\n            throughout the project cycle, the full participation of\n            financial officers of all implementing agencies as well as\n            the project-wide coordination entity in cost estimation and\n            budget preparation and processing, ongoing arrangements for\n            training and handover as needed to accommodate staff\n            turnover, and attention to and accountability for quality\n            financial management by government throughout implementation."}, "docdt": "2002-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
