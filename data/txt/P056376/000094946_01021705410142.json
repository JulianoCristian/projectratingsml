satisfactory with likely sustainability and a satisfactory\n            performance by both the Bank and the Government. The\n            projects demonstrate the synergy between macroeconomic\n            stabilization and structural reforms. Also, careful and\n            extensive preparation is a necessary but not sufficient\n            condition for execution of complex adjustment. Fiscal\n            restructuring and civil services reform should begin with a\n            fundamental reconsideration of the role of government\n            undertake at the political level. While protecting pro-poor\n            fiscal outlays may prevent further deterioration of\n            services, it cannot address deep-seated problems of equity,\n            efficiency, and quality of public health and education The\n            willingness of private domestic or foreign enterprises to\n            invest in privatized state enterprises in a small poor\n            country lacking an established record of good management\n            cannot be taken for granted."}, "docdt": "2000-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
