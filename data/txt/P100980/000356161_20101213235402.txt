   SUDAN, [MDTF-SS Grant NoTF 57684], P100980 will be extended from December
   31, 2010 until May 31, 2011.

Project implementation performance is assessed as satisfactory while the rating against
PDO is moderately satisfactory. The project expenditure increased to 86% by end of
October 2010. Around 98% of the project amount is committed and 80% of the project
activities have been completed. The following are the main achievements of the
CABIHRD Project to date:
    · Electronic archiving system installed in the Ministry of Cabinet Affairs. 4049
         official documents archived.
    · GoSS website installed with total visits amounting to over 542,482 since its
         launch in October 2009.
    · Medium Term Framework Developed following the Conduct of Functional
         Management Reviews in five (5) GoSS Ministries and two (2) state governments.
    · Public Information Centre constructed, equipped and furnished.
    · 1220 public servants trained in GoSS and the States in six public sector
         management programs.
    · 972 persons trained in Vocational Skills at Juba, Wau and Malakal VTCs;
         Vocational Training Policy developed and pilot tested; Labour Bill formulated;
         Juba, Wau and Malakal VTC's rehabilitated and Aluakluak Womens VTC built.
    · State Labour Offices reactivated in Bor, Torit, Yambio, Bentiu and renovated and
         reactivated in Juba, Wau and Malakal.

2.     The proposed no cost extension is necessary to ensure that one sub component
from the rehabilitation of the Juba VTC and the incomplete sub components related to the
Ministry of Postal and Telecommunication Services can be completed. The activities
proposed to be completed in the extended period are listed below:

·     Completion of the construction of the Juba MTC Wall at SDG 934,755.48
·     Supply and Installation of VSAT equipment at USD 572,029.00
·     Supply and Installation of Video Conferencing equipment USD 66,000.00

All the contracts are in place for the incomplete interventions. Completion of contracts
was delayed due to a variety of reasons, including the delays in export of Information and
Communications Technology from the USA to Sudan. However implementation is now
on track and all the interventions will be completed within the extended date.

3.      This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension of the project
was from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2011. The total period of extensions is
less than two years.
