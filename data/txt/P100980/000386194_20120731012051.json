BUILDING,\n            INSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT IN SOUT", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Capacity Building\n            Institutional and Human Resource Development Project for\n            Sudan were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was high; Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory; and grantee\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: there are a number of lessons to be learnt\n            from this project which is specific to the project itself.\n            These are set out below. Project outputs should not be\n            linked to the outputs of other projects since non completion\n            or delay in the linked projects can adversely affect project\n            outputs. This is particularly true in fragile environments\n            where there is a frequent change in the priorities of\n            government, the administrative processes are not\n            institutionalized and the regulatory framework is unclear.\n            'high tech' interventions in fragile states such\n            as Information and Communication Technology (ICT) need to\n            have a sustained program of support spanning at least five\n            to seven years with adequate 'contracting in' of\n            capacity provided for in the project itself. Qualified human\n            resources to support the intervention are not easily\n            attracted to work in the public sector even if they are\n            available. The project relied on the confidence of the\n            government that they would be in a position to recruit and\n            appoint qualified staff to manage the interstate\n            telecommunication links, the Video Conferencing\n            infrastructure and the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS)\n            email. Significant thought needs to be given to engagements\n            which require 'counterpart' funding of running\n            costs over the short to medium term. A number of\n            interventions have suffered due to basic running costs,\n            intended to be met by government not eventually being\n            provided for in budget disbursements. Whilst it might be\n            feasible to solicit covenants from governments relating to\n            these at the outset of the project, it is clear that in a\n            fragile environment it is difficult to make these binding.\n            Project interventions and resultant outputs and outcomes\n            must be imbedded in policy documents, legislation or\n            regulations of the recipient if they are to be implemented\n            in a short project period of three years."}, "docdt": "2011-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
