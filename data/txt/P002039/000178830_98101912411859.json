reversing\n            the present decline of Nigeria's forestry sector\n            through an expansion of its national plantation development\n            program and strenghthening of its forestry management and\n            planning capabilitites at both state and federal levels. The\n            project would establish 22,600 ha of state-owned commercial\n            Gmelina plantations in Ondo and Ogun States and 1,600 ha of\n            pine and eucalyptus trials in Anambra State, and strenghthen\n            the state and federal forestry services. It would cover five\n            years of a long-term plantation development program, and\n            would increase roundwood production for utility grade\n            timber; provide short-fiber pulpwood for the pulp and paper\n            industry; assess the viability of supplying locally-grown\n            long-fiber pulpwood to the pulp and paper industry; improve\n            forest plantation management and planning; improve the\n            living and working conditions for approximately 1,500\n            forestry workers and their families, and increase food\n            production in the rural areas."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
