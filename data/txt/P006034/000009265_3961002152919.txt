MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXUVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA
FOR A SECOND TAX ADMINISTRATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Argentina for the equivalent of US$20 million to help finance a project for the
strengthening of tax administration. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 17 years, including S years of grace.
2.    Backgrnd. In the last few decades, economic conditions in Argentina deteriorated and economic
growth became erratic; in the 1980s, real economic growth averaged a negative 0.78 percent. At the same
time, increased government spending and continued expansion of the public sector led to burgeoning
fiscal deficits, which together with rigid price, credit and interest rate controls, further depressed and
distorted economic development. The tax system was unable to provide an increase in revenues
corresponding to the increase in expenditures, in part because of inflation and in part because of the
deterioration of the tax administration. Erosion of revenues generally continued until 1989.
3.    Since the 1980s, the Government has made numerous attempts to control the fiscal deficit and
to reduce inflation, which averaged 710 percent annually during the last decade. These programs - based
on various combinations of tight fiscal and monetary policies - went only part way in altering the
fundamental distortions in the economy and were not sustainable. The latest program, initiated in early
1991 after the most recent outbreak of high inflation, has so far succeeded in reducing inflation to less
than one percent per month. This program goes to the heart of the economic problems facing Argentina
and includes measures to reduce the size of the state, deregulate the economy and restore incentives.
Nevertheless, public finances remain weak and measures to raise revenues have heretofore been
transitory.
4.    An essential part of the Government's present economic reform program is to increase tax
collections and to eliminate distortions in the tax system. Tax evasion and fraud had become rampant in
Argentina as the general public lost confidence in the ability of authorities to use funds effectively, and
the public sector lost its capacity to administer the tax system equitably. Much had already been done
under previous programs to simplify the system, and to broaden the value-added tax base; inflationary
adjustments were redefined to eliminate in large part the Tanzi effect and measures were taken to avoid
using the tax system to provide promotional incentives to industry. Under the Public Sector Management
Technical Assistance Loan (PSMTAL, 2712-AR), a unified taxpayer identification number was
introduced, and a new structure and organization for the General Tax Directorate ("Direcci6n General
Impositiva', DGI) was defined. In June 1991 the Presidential Decree necessary for the change in structure
was given, and the new organization is being implemented. Under the first Tax Administration Loan
(TATAL, 3015-AR) 600 taxpayer auditors were hired, DGI personnel received training, and a new
computerized collection system for large taxpayers was developed and is being introduced in the 37
largest DGI agencies (it is operational in 17 to date); also, administrative and monitoring systems are
being developed for use at headquarters. Based on the success of these efforts, DGI has prepared a
strategy of decentralization and overall improvement of tax administration, which includes strengthening
some 150 agencies nationwide and linking them to headquarters through a telecommunications network,
simplifying the legal framework for taxes, providing more assistance to the taxpayer, and continuing to
improve its collection and taxpayer auditing systems. A mid-project review of the organization and



-2 -
functions of DOI will be carried out to take into account the introduction of new systems and technology
during the first two years of project implementation.
5.    The Goverrnent is now embarked on a series of far-reaching structural reforms, in part to extend
and deepen what had been done previously, and in part to break new ground. Bank support for this
program is being provided through the Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL, 3394-AR) which lays out the
policy framework for revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization and the accompanying TA loan
(PSRTAL, 3362-AR) which strengthens the Government's capacity to implement the planned reforms.
Particular support is being provided under 3362-AR for improvements to customs administration which
accounts for 13 percent of collected revenues. The proposed loan addresses the strengthening of tax
administration, building on the measures already provided for under Loan 3015-AR. These two loans
together deal comprehensively with the needs of the DGI.
6.    Prject QbiectiveT. 'Meproposed project aims to: (a) increase tax revenues without increasing
tax rates by enhancing the efficiency of the tax administration system; (b) ensure the continuity and
sustainability of the revenue increases; and (c) facilitate voluntary compliance through increasing popular
perception of fairness and equitable distribution of the tax burden in the population. The project would
address four major issues contributing to the inefficiency of the present tax administration system: (a) the
multiplicity and frequent contradiction of procedural laws and regulations on tax administration; (b)
weakness and excessive centralization of existing administrative systems and procedures; (c) poor service
to the public; and (d) inefficiency in collection and taxpayer auditing.
7.    EWj§9 D;2escKipeion. The project will finance consulting services, training, office refurbishing,
equipment and software required by the DGI to: (a) review and codify procedural tax laws and
regulations to simplify and make coherent existing legislation, develop a legislative database (hardware
and softwae) ad train DGI legal staff (2 percent of total costs); (b) expand automated accounting,
personnd and other administrative systens developed through 3015-AR in aHl DGI agencies nationwide,
acquire microcomputers and train staff in their use (18 percent of total costs); (c) carry out taxpayer
surveys, implement manual and automated systems, and train staff to improve the taxpayer services
offered by the DOI (6 percent of total costs); (d) install in all agencies the new automated collection
systems for Large and Small Taxpayers developed through 3015-AR, acquire equipment, train staff and
refurbish and link through telecommunications DGI offices nationwide (64 percent of total costs); (e)
collect internal and external information, develop methodologies and automated tools for fraud detection
and train taxpayer auditors in their use (4 percent of total costs); and (t) project administration and
audtidng (6 percent of total costs). The project therefore consists of five components aimed at improving:
(a) the Legal Framework; (b) Administration; (c) Taxpayer Services; (d) Collection Systems; and (e)
Taxpayer Auditing.
8.    .oject   l)ementation. DGI will be the executing agency for this project; it will also be
responsible for providing counterpart funds. Two other agencies are involved, both under the Secretariat
for Public Revenue, as is the DGI. These are the National Tax Directorate, with which DGI will work
on producing the simplified tax law set ("texto ordenado' - 2 percent of project costs), and the National
Tax Court, which will be strengthened in coordination with DGI (I percent of project costs). A Project
Implementation Unit (Pll) has been set up in the DGI, based on a core of DGI personnel and consultants
at present coordinaing the implementation of the first Tax Adminison Loan. The PI will report
directly to the DOI Director General and meet monthly with senior management ("the Planning
Committee") to keep them apprised of progress and receive guidance in the managers' respective areas.
Members of the PI and consultants hired for specific tasks must be satisfactory to the Bank. The PIU



-3-
wi also continue to coordinate the on-going first Tax Administration Loan until its scheduled completion
at end of 1992. To ensure continuity the Government agreed at negotiations to maintain the composition
of the PIU during the execution of the project.
9.    The project is estimated to take four years to implement, at a total cost of US$30 million
equivalent, of which the Bank would finance US$20 million equivalent or 67 percent of the total cost of
the project and the C vernment would finance US$10 million equivalent, or 33 percent of the total cost.
Local costs amount to US$16.8 million equivaleat (56 percent of total costs); the foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$13.2 million equivalent (44 percent of total costs). Project base costs are
based on similar COStS for on-going project 3015-AR. A PPF advance in the amount of US$1.5 million
equivalent has been set up to support project preparation and start-up activities and will be refinanced
under the Loan. Sixty percent of project costs consist of information technology equipment, which in the
past 20 years has decreased in price yearly. It is reasonable to assume that this decrease will continue;
therefore, any unforeseen circumstances necessitating additional sums would be met from the difference
between the present cost esdmates and future decreases. Thus, no separate contingency allocation has
been prepared. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of the Bank Group operations in Argentina
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, dated March 10, 1992, is
being distributed separately.
10.   Leons from Previous Bank Experience. Previous Bank involvement in public sector management
projects indicate that projects in this area need (a) strong commitment at all levels (political, managerial
and technical); (b) a clear focus and limited scope; (c) detailed project preparation with small proportions
of unallocated fiuds; (d) transparency in fimding and selection of personnel during implementation; and
(e) monitorable performance indicators for the project and the agency.
11.   This project benefits from very strong commitment by the very highest political levels and by
DOI management and staff. It has well defined goals and concentrates on only one agency, the DGI, with
only 3 percent of project funding affecting other agencies (National Tax Directorate, National Tax Court
and the Provincial Tax Authorities, and Social Security). Project preparation is very detailed, and every
project activity is defined and activity performance measures determined for each one; project
perfomance indicators have been defined to measure overall progress and assist in project supervision.
Finally, project suswtainability is addressed specifically by the introduction of new functions, procedures
and systems in all major areas of the organization and in all agencies, together with a training program
that closely follows these modifications and is tied to the DGI incentive system, which itself is tied to the
yearly increase in revenue collection. Furthermore, DGI has successfully used its own staff in the
implementation of 3015-AR for project leadership and execution in addition to consultants where needed,
thus creating a sense of participation and ownership of the project.
12.   Ratone-for Bank Involye. Supporting public sector reform is a fundamental Bank objective
in Argentina. 'Me proposed project would strengthen the administrative and technical capabilities of the
DGI, a vital activity in support of Government's reform program. The project is designed based on
previous Bank findings and recommendations and complements activities carried out under the Bank's
1986 Public Sector Management Technical Assistance Loan (2712-AR) and the 1988 first Tax
Administration Loan (3015-AR), which is being executed successfully and is slated for completion in
1992. The proposed operation would consolidate, extend, and deepen key aspects of the previous



-4 -
technical assistance efforts to increase revenues and provide sustainability, while addressing the neglected
Issue of increasing voluntary compliance.
13.   Continuous interaction between the Bank and DOI since 1986 has modified the initial, marginal
role of the Bank in Argentine tax administration and resulted in full Bank participation in the development
of DGI's strategy. The Bank's participation would have a catalytic role in ensuring the continuity of an
essential insdtutional development effort, as well as in support of activities that fall outside DGI's
jurisdiction, such as tax law simplification and support of the National Tax Court. In addition, the
procurement of the required computer hardware, software, and technical assistance for the new system
is technically complex for DGI; thus DGI would benefit from the Bank's experience in supervising similar
procurement as well as by its transparent evaluation methodologies.
14.   Seed Acio. The following agreements were obtained at negotiations: (a) DOI will re-view
the organization and functions recently implemented by carrying out an additional study of its personnel
policies and procedures, in light of the changes resulting from the implementation of the new project, no
later than two years after effectiveness; the resulting action plan would be implemented no later than three
years after effectiveness; Q) the Government will maintain a Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
including a Project Manager and appropriate staff, whose organization and staffing is acceptable to the
Bank, for the duration of the project; (c) DGI will agree to the timely execution of the Project
Implementation Plan; (d) a comprehensive mid-term review will be carried out two years after
effectiveness, after the new organizational study is finished; (e) the PIU will provide semiannual project
implementation reports in May and November of every year, measure quantitative and qualitative
objectives achieved, review and update project implementation schedules, and, upon project completion,
prepare the Project Completion Report; (f) DGI will implement a staff training plan satisfactory to the
Bank; (g) loan financing of Individual Consultancies (except the Project Implementation Unit) will be
limited to 18 percent of the cost of consulting services, with all others to be carried out by consulting
firms or other entities; (h) before installing the Large Taxpayer Collection System in an agency, DOI
should have entered into a contractual agreement with a bank to set up a bank counter in this agency (11
such contracts have already been signed). For effectiveness, DGI will have signed a Management Service
Agreement Contract with an acceptable procurement agency to assist it in project implementation, and
presented to the Bank a manual detailing administrative procedures and defining reports to be used by
DO! staff and the Bank for project supervision.
15.   Envirommental Aspects. As this is a public sector management project and does not have explicit
environmental components or effects, it is classified as a Type C Project.
16-     ect Benefits. The principal bencfits of the proposed project will be: (a) a decrease in tax fraud
and an increase in collection revenues, estimated very conservatively at better than US$175 million per
year, resulting from the modernization of the collection system and procedures and taxpayer auditing
mechanisms; (b) a more efficient DGI operating in a modem and participatory manner through the
introduction of administrative and monitoring systems and the modification of the operating culture of
the organization; and (c) increased voluntary compliance by the population as a result of an improved
perception of a more just and equitable distribution of the tax administration burden through the impartial
and evenhanded application of simplified laws to the full universe of taxpayers.
17.   Proje Risks. The major risks to project implementation are possible changes in leadership which
affect project strategy and implementation, and overloading the capacity of DGI to absorb change. To
minimize the effect of changes in senior management or political leadership, the continuity of a



-5-
satisfactory Project Implementation Unit is assured under the Loan Agreement. Disruptions ir DGI
opeaions is being minmized already under 3015-AR by introducing proven new technology and
procedures through the development of pilots in selected agencies, and their subsequent extension to all
agencie:; this practice would be continued under the proposed project.
18.   RenMMdgio. I am satisfied that te proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors aprrove the proposed loan.
