The components\n            are: 1) to provide program management, through planning and\n            monitoring at the national level, of habitats and\n            ecosystems, and, support actions on legal aspects, and\n            regional cooperation, through training, and ecological\n            monitoring; 2) to support natural resources conservation at\n            the Pendjari National Park, through adequate management of\n            the park and cynegetic areas, thus, enabling tourism, and\n            hunting practices, and, includes community participation, at\n            the local level, in the development of the Siri area, and,\n            the Tanguieta - Porga/Batia axes; and, 3) to support\n            conservation of the W National Park, also, through\n            appropriate management of its park and cynegetic areas, and\n            community involvement. While the global environmental\n            objective, will ensure long-term conservation of the\n            country's bio-diversity, operational objectives will\n            ensure increased managerial capacity of partnerships, and\n            local communities, and, institutional capacity building will\n            be supported through the Global Environmental Facility."}, "docdt": "2000-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
