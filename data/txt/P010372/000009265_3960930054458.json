(b) strengthen the capability\n            of the implementing agencies; (c) enhance farmer\n            participation through stronger Water Users Associations\n            (WUA); and (d) reduce government financial obligations\n            through improved cost recovery programs.  The project will\n            provide civil works, equipment, technical assistance,\n            training, and supervision and administration.  Civil works\n            include the renovation about 7,700 watercourses, precision\n            leveling of 55,000 ha, and construction of 500 water storage\n            tanks in the irrigated areas in the four provinces, the\n            Federally Administrated Tribal Areas and the Northern Areas."}, "docdt": "1991-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
