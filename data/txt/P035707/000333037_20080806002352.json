Investment\n            Loan Project for Tunisia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the outputs of this project are\n            significant and exceed expectations. Yet it is not possible\n            to show that those investments generated their intended\n            benefits because the objectives and results indicators do\n            not reflect the activities that absorbed the greatest share\n            of the funding. And the objectives that the project did have\n            are too imprecisely defined to be useful to stimulate better\n            integration, knowledge sharing and institutional change and\n            as such represent a missed opportunity. This imprecision\n            allowed those managing the project to focus on the component\n            outputs rather than the overall strategic objective. Greater\n            attention should have been given to social aspects in the\n            design and implementation of the project which would\n            probably have helped to improve the performance of certain\n            investments. For example, the demand for individual\n            household water supply connections should have better\n            estimated. Also, the complexity of socio-economic issues\n            should have been better addressed in the context of water\n            resource management issues. Reducing consumption of\n            groundwater is essentially an exercise in changing\n            incentives to farmers and thus the groundwater management\n            components would have benefited from the advice of a rural\n            sociologist. Similarly, technical assistance supporting the\n            associations of farmers managing irrigation schemes and of\n            households managing rural water supply would have benefited\n            from support from qualified sociologist."}, "docdt": "2008-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
