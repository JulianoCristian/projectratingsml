ensuring the capacity of the government,\n            WUAs, and private operators to efficiently manage resources;\n            and facilitating real time management of surface and\n            groundwater. The second objective was to promote\n            conservation of water resources and environmental\n            protection. In 2000, the Government of Tunisia's goals\n            in the sector were to further reduce vulnerability to\n            irregular rainfall and droughts, manage demand in order to\n            avoid water shortages in the future, and expand access to\n            drinking water for the rural population. An action plan\n            produced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Hydraulic\n            Resources identified five priority areas: management of\n            water demand; integrated water resource management;\n            completion of the water resource mobilization program;\n            development of non-conventional water resources; and\n            preservation and protection of water resources. As the first\n            of two consecutive projects, the Water Sector Investment\n            Project I (implemented from 2001 to 2007) was designed to\n            assist with the first phase of this action plan."}, "docdt": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
