Institutional,\n            and legal measures include staff training in environmental,\n            and social assessment requirements, regarding irrigation\n            development, groundwater management, and rural water supply,\n            as well as a review of contracting environmental clauses.\n            Specific measures will: design, and protect terraces to\n            minimize surface erosion; avoid water logging, and improve\n            drainage to periodically flush spoils; prod cultivation of\n            salinity tolerance crops; ensure quality of waste water used\n            in irrigation; protect soil surfaces with mulch; establish\n            adequate drainage channels, and re-vegetate eroded surfaces;\n            include precautionary measures to collect, and recycle\n            lubricants to prevent accidental spillage; and, waste, and\n            sediments will be disposed of in accordance to environmental measures."}, "docdt": "2000-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
