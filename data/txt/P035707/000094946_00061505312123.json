    Tunisia aims to promote effective integrated water resource\n            management; and to promote water resources conservation and\n            environmental protection. There are five project components.\n            The first helps create small, tubewell-based, irrigation\n            perimeters; modernizes and rehabilitates existing\n            perimeters; drains installations on irrigated perimeters;\n            electrifies water sources and tubewells for potable water\n            and/or irrigation in order to reduce energy and maintenance\n            costs; creates water points in the southern arid zone; and\n            works towards flood water management. The second component\n            helps drill exploratory wells and piezometers, protects and\n            rehabilitates existing ones; develops infrastructure for\n            artificial groundwater recharge from available surface\n            water; and pilots participatory management approaches. The\n            third component monitors the quality and quantity of water\n            resources; and protects the water resource base and soils.\n            The fourth component provides potable water to rural\n            dwellers. The fifth component helps develop new skills\n            mainly oriented toward planning and demand management in the\n            water sector while strengthening the agricultural\n            ministry's (MOA) capacity regulation control and\n            strategic planning. This component also finances a\n            capacity-building effort for water user associations,\n            nongovernmental organizations, and private entrepreneurs in\n            the water sector."}, "docdt": "2000-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
