improve school quality\n            and system efficiency; b) establish a sustainable,\n            cost-effective and better managed education system; and c)\n            ensure universal coverage and equitable access to quality\n            primary schooling.  The first project components --\n            improving school quality and system efficiency -- will\n            provide teacher development and school cluster based\n            training; improve curriculum; and strengthen national\n            institutions to ensure quality primary education and teacher\n            training.  The second component -- strengthening\n            institutional capacity and management -- will be done at\n            central, district, thana, and school levels.  Activities\n            will focus on strengthening management skills and improving\n            information systems.  The third component -- increasing\n            equitable access -- will include construction of new schools\n            and additional classrooms in under-served areas for\n            hard-to-reach children; block grants to schools to support\n            the provision of stationery to the poorest students; and\n            social mobilization."}, "docdt": "1998-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
