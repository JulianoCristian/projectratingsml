WESTERN NIGERIA
APPRAISAL OF A ROAD PROJECT
Summary
i.        Through the Federal Government, the Government of Western Nigeria
has asked the Bank to help in financing a road project consisting of (i) the
reconstruction of 95 miles of regional trunk roads; (ii) consultants' ser-
vices for (a) the supervision of construction of the roads under (i) above;
(b) the final engineering of about 300 miles of highest priority roads which
will be identified by, and their preliminary engineering carried out under,
a U.N. Special Fund highway study that is now underway; (c) tecinical assist-
ance in reorganizing the road maintenance organization and its operations;
and (iii) the procurement of additional maintenance equipment and spare parts.
ii.       Total cost of the project, based on final engineering of the roads
already carried out by consultants, has been estimated at US$21.0 million, of
which US$l)4.5 million represents the foreign exchange cost, and will be pro-
vided by the proposed Bank loan. The local cost (E 2.35 million) will be
provided by the Government of Western Nigeria by yearly allocations from its
Development Budget over the expected 3½-year construction period.
iii.      The Roads and Bridges Division within the Mdnistry of Works and
Transport will be responsible for the execution of the project, using consul-
tants for supervision of the field work. Consultants will also be retained
for final engineering of 300 miles of other roads for which preliminary
engineering will be completed under a general road study financed by the
U.N. Special Fund.
iv.       The Roads and Bridges Division's maintenance operation will be reor-
ganized and strengthened according to an already existing plan. New sub-
districts will be created which will require additional personnel and supple-
mentary maintenance equipment.
V.        The contracts for the reconstruction of the roads included in the
project will be awarded to prequalified foreign and/or local contractors on
the basis of international competitive bidding.
vi.       The three roads included in the project carry today a traffic between
700 and 1,000 vehicles per day. Their one-lane paved carriageways, with poor
alignments and short sight distances are hazardous and inadequate to the traffic.
Surfaces and shoulders are deteriorating to an extent that cannot be tacen care
of by normal repair. Reconstruction of the three roads to modern standards has
become urgent.
vii.      The roads are important to the economy of the Region. An average
return of 13% on the investment, based on road-users' saving alone, makes the
roads economically justified.
viii.     The project is technically sound, economically justified and suit-
able for a loan of US$14 5 million equivalent.  A 25-year term, including a
5-year period of grace, would be appropriate.



WESTERN NIGERIA: APPRAISAL O? A RCAD PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        Through the Federal Government, the Government of Western Nigeria has
approached the Bank for a loan of US$14.5 million equivalent to finance the
foreign oxchange costs of (i) the reconstruction of 95 miles of regional trunk
roads; (ii) consultants' services for (a) the supervision of construction of
the roads under (i) above; (b) the final engineering of about 300 miles of
highest priority roads which will be identified by, and their preliminary
engineering carried out under, a U.N. Special Fund highway study that is now
underway; (c) technical assistance in reorganizing the road maintenance organi-
zation and its operations; and (iii) the procurement of additional maintenance
equipment and spare parts. The total cost of the project has been estimated at
US$21 million equivalent.
2.        This report is based on information obtained from the Roads and
Bridges Division of the Western Nigeria Ministry of Works and Transport by a
Bank Mission, composed of A. Ber7an, Highway Engineer and T. frog-, Transporta-
tion Economist, which visited the Re-ion in ::. 1965, and on final surveys, -
designs and cost estimates of the project roads which have been prepared by a
foreign consulting firm.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
3.        The Federal Republic of Nigeria is bounded to the west and north by
the Republics of Dahomey and Niger, to the east by the Republics of Chad and
the Cameroon and to the south by the Gulf of Guinea. It has a land area of
about 357,000 sq. miles, or 3 times that of the U.K. and 30% greater than the
State of Texas, made up as follows:
Sq. miles
Northern Nigeria                           281,800
Wlestern Nigeria                            30,100
Eastern Nigeria                             29,500
Mid-Wlestern Nigeria                        15,300
Federal Territory (Lagos)                       30
4.        Although Western Nigeria is only one-tenth the size of Northern
Nigeria it has a population of 10 million as compared with 30 million, accord-
ing to the last official census. Unlike the remainder of Nigeria and most of
Africa the people of Western Nigeria have a long history of urban settlement.
There are numerous towns of over 25,000 people, many of whom farm on a seasonal
or commuter basis. The Region's main economic activity is agriculture, with
cocoa, palm kernels and timber being significant exports. Manufacturing
industry is at an early stage but significant centers have been established and
are growing at Ikeja (near Lagos), Abeokuta and Ibadan.
B. The Regional Road System
-5.        Western Nigeria has some 8,600 miles of roads at present, made up



-2-
as follows:
(miles)
Paved        Unpaved         Total
Trunk Roads "A"              608                          608
Trunk Roads "B"              723             32           755
Provincial Roads             775            -             775
District Roads               833          5,633         6,466
Total     2,939           5,665         8,604
6.        Trunk roads "A" provide links between the Federal and Regional
capitals, the ports and their hinterlands and between Nigeria and her neigh-
bors. Their costs of construction and maintenance are borne by the Federal
Government with the Regional Governments' Ministries of Works acting as executin4
agents for their actual maintenance. Roads designated as Trunk "B" are built
and maintained by the Regional Governments (in Western Nigeria, the Roads and
Bridges Division of the Ministry of Works and Transport). Their main function
is to connect provincial and district headquarters, other large towns and im-
portant areas of trade and population with each other, with a railhead or
river port and with the Trunk road "A" system.  Capital funds for their cons-
truction or improvement are currently provided for out of the Region's 1962-68
Development Budget that is part of the national plan.  Maintenance funds are
provided out of the Region's annual recurrent budget. The Provincial and
District roads are built and maintained by the local councils concerned. The
paving of these roads, however, has generally been borne by the Regional
Government. The Provincial roads, which are sub-divided into "A", "B" and "C"
categories receive small annual grants-in-aid from the Regional Government for
their maintenance.
7.        Both types of Trunk roads were built originally to standards that are
too low for present and future traffic requirements. Feasibility studies for
the upgrading of important "A" roads are expected to be undertaken shortly.
The majority of the Trunk "B" roads have one-lane surfaced carriageways. Shoul-
ders are generally narrow, ditches are of inferior design and since location of
the roads has evolved from footpaths to tracks and to gravel roads without
major realignments, they display deficient design features. Because of inade-
quate base and sub-bases, growing traffic volumes and, recently, inadequate
maintenance, their pavements are breaking up. While the consequences have
not yet begun to show themselves in increased trucking costs, there is no doubt
that these will rise as congestion on the roads grows and surface conditions
deteriorate. The Bank's experience suggests that a difference of 15-20% in
vehicle operating costs may follow from trucking over low quality and low
design standard bituminous roads as compared with modern higher types.
8.        A systematic program for the upgrading and improvement of these "B"
roads has become urgent, not only to remedy the existing situation, but also
to avoid larger and costlier rehabilitation expenditures. The first important
step in this direction is the road survey and feasibility study that is
about to be undertaken by consultants and which is being financed by a United



-3-
Nations Special Fund grant, with the Bank acting as executing agent. The
study, which includes the preliminary engineering of 300 miles of priority
roads, will serve as a valuable guide to the Government in preparing further
road programs by establishing the relative economic importance of each road
and indicating the order in which improvements should be made.
C. Motor Vehicle Growth
9.        Since 1958 Nigeria's motor vehicle population has been growing at
about 12% p.a. (14% for private cars and 7.5% for commercial vehicles). By
1963, of the 65,0oo vehicles licensed in the country, some 21,000 were Jicensed
in Western Nigeria (Table 1). The licensing or registration of a vehicle in
one Region in Nigeria, however, is not necessarily that in which it will
mainly operate (Table 2). Therefore, the figures in Table 1 give only an
approximate guide to regional usage or traffic growth. Gasoline consumption
in Nigeria has been increasing at 6% p.a. and diesel oil at 16% p.a. average
over the period since 1958. Wqhile road user tax rates have beeiVincreased,
total user revenues in Nigeria, including those of Western Nligeria
over the past 6 years have increased by over .150%. The cocoa crop of Western
Nigeria, all of which is transported by road, has doubled in the same period.
All the indicators, therefore, suggest a continuing and high rate of traffic
growth in Western Nigeria despite the economic and political difficulties the
Region has passed through since 1962.
D. Ministry of Works and Transport
10.       The Roads and Bridges Division is one of five Divisions within the
Ministry of Works and Transport of the Western Region. It is responsible for
the construction and maintenance of all Trunk roads "B"; the maintenance of
Trunk roads "A" and the giving of technical advice to the local authorities.
The other four divisions of the Ministry deal with water supply, mechanical
and electrical installations, buildings and administration. The Ministry is
headed by a Permanent Secretary who is responsible for policy, personnel and
routine administration, and a Controller of Works who is the senior professional
officer in the Ministry. Both posts are held by permanent civil servants.
11.       The Roads and Bridges Division is administered by a Chief Civil
Engineer who is assisted in the headquarters by Senior Civil Engineers for
maintenance, design, planning, materials and contracts, The Division does
only very minor construction works with its own forces. In the field there
are three superintending engineers, each with the rank of a senior civil engi-
neer, who are assisted by various lower grades of engineers. Each superintend-
ing engineer is responsible for all construction work and road maintenance in
his area.
12.       Due to the departure of expatriate staff, since 1960, and the
creation in 1963 of the Mid-Western Region of Nigeria out of the former Westevr
Nigeria, only 26 out of 44 established positions in the Division are filled.
13.       The Government and the Ministry, therefore, realize the need for
consultants not only to supervise the work in the field but also to carry out
the survey and design of major road projects. To this end they have established



- 4 -
a close working relationship with the foreign consulting firm that has prepared
the project under review and which has been engaged for the UNSF road survey.
E. Design Standards and Contract Forms
14.       To overcome the design deficiencies mentioned in paragraph 7 above,
new design standards have been adopted for all new Trunk "B" roads including
the roads in the project (Table 3). The embanlaaent width of 34 ft., with a
two-lane carriageway of 24 ft. and 5 ft. shoulders, reflects the adoption of
modern trunk road standards. The carriageway will receive a permanent pavement
of 2½" hot concrete-asphalt because traffic on the roads will soon exceed 1,000
vehicles per day. The standards for design speed, maximum grade, rinimum curves
and sight distance as indicated in the table are acceptable to the Bank.
15.       The type of contract used for road works by the Wlestern Nigeria
Government is acceptable to the Bank.    A 10% performance guiarantee
is    required and retention money (l0Op) from each monthly statement is
accumulated until half of the work has been completed. Completion of the work
is followed by a 12-month maintenance period by the contractor, at the beginrnng
of which half of the accumulated retention money is released to him. Contracts
are generally awarded on the basis of competitive bidding from a long list of
prequalified local and foreign contractors registered with the iinistry.
F. Road Construction in the Past
16.       Capital expenditures for road construction by the 'lestern Nigeria
Goverrment over the last 5 years have declined rapidly, from I 3.5 million in
1961/62 to E 0.4 million in 1963/64. The following Table shows the actual
expenditures for road construction and maintenance over the period 1959 to 196h,
as compared with road user revenues received by the Western Nigeria Governmnent
(see also Table 4).

1/ Includes new construction reconstruction and bituminous surfacing.
2/ Provisional.
3/ Reduced, because of creation of the new mid-Western Region.



17.       The tapering off of construction activity in the Region from 1961/62
on is due to a number of factors; lack of planning, run-down of technical
staff as a result of independence and the creation of the Mid-West state;
political upheavals in the regional government and weak fiscal position follow-
ing the decline in cocoa prices - the region's main export crop. The only
major work in hand today is the bridge of Sapele which, although situated in
Mid-West Nigeria, is being controlled by the Western Roads and Bridges Division
in Ibadan because it was initiated before the creation of the Mid-West state.
The work is being financed on a deferred payments scheme by a U.K. contractor.
The main Federal expenditure on roads in Western Nigeria has been the opening
of the new short route from Lagos to Benin and Eastern Nigeria via Shagamu and
Ijebu-Ode. The Federal road construction program throughout Nigeria has been
increasing as part of the current (1962-68) Development Plan.
G. Road Maintenance
18.       As pointed out earlier, maintenance of the regional trunk road "B"
and the Federal trunk road "A" is the responsibility of the Roads and Bridges
Division of the Ministry of Works and Transport. It is reimbursed by the
Federal Government for the actual maintenance expenses incurred on the "A"
roads and in addition receives a small agency fee to cover its overheads.
19.       Despite a strenuous technical effort by the Roads and Bridges Divi-
sion the trunk roads are not being adequately maintained because of the inferior
standards to which the roads were originally built, a shortage of funds and a
running down of the maintenance organization. In the face of growing road
traffic, a gradual and systematic reconstruction of the roads to modern stand-
ards and the rebuilding of the maintenance organization are necessary in order
to preserve the existing investment in roads and to justify further investments.
The existing work shops are well constructed and equipped, but most need re-
staffing with senior and experienced engineers for their effective operation.
20.       In addition to its current problem of adequately maintaining the
trunk roads, the Roads and Bridges Division will soon be faced with the task of
taking over the maintenance of some 450 miles of provincial roads so as to
prevent their pavements from breaking up. The maintenance of these provincial
roads is at present under the jurisdiction of the local government councils.
While many of the local councils were adequately staffed and had sufficient
equipment, supplemented by technical advice from the Roads and Bridges Division,
to maintain their roads fairly well when design standards were relatively
simple and traffic volumes were low, they are not now technically and finan-
cially up to the task. As a result, many of the provincial roads are hardly
maintained at all.
o1.       The Roads and Bridges Division has prepared a detailed and realistic
plan for the improvement and strengthening of its maintenance operation in
order to meet this challenge. Broadly, it is proposed to reorganize the field
operations by dividing the present three districts into 12 maintenance sub,
Aistricts with each sub-district being properly staffed with engineers and tech-
nicians. To execute this plan will require additional maintenance funds for
buildings, equipment and spare parts as well as additional staff. The ministry
recognizes that to a great extent senior supervisory engineers will have to be



- 6 -
obtained from abroad. The government has given an assurance that the
revised maintenance operation plan will be implemented, and that sufficient
local funds will be made available to construct workshops and recruit staff,
and that consultants will be engaged to give technical advice.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Description
22.        The project consists of road construction works, consulting services
and the procurement of equipment, as follows:
(a)    Road construction
The reconstruction and improvement of the following roads:
(i) Ijebu-Ode - Idi-Ayunre (33 miles)
(ii) Ife-Ondo (38 miles)
(iii) Ondo-Ore (24 miles)
(b)    Consulting services
The employment of consultants for (i) the supervision of
constructing the roads under (a) above; (ii) for the final
engineering of 300 miles of priority roads for which preliminary
surveys and engineering are being financed by a grant-aided
United Nations Special Fund highway feasibility study; and (iii)
to assist the Roads and Bridges Division within the Ministry of
Works in reorganizing maintenance operations with particular
reference to the preparation of a road inventory.
(c)    Equipment
The procurement of additional maintenance equipment and spare
parts.
23.        The Idi-Ayunre - Ijebu-Ode road extends 33 miles from its northern
junction with the Lagos-Ibadan Trunk Road "A" some 12 miles south of Ibadan
to Ijebu-Ode, which lies 19 miles east of Shagamu on a new 2-lane modern high-
way to Benin and, via a new bridge being built over the River Niger at Onitsha,
to Eastern Nigeria.   It is advantageously located between two of the country's
main highways, which together connect Lagos, the Federal capital, with all the
Regional capitals and other main towns.
24.        The present road has a 12-feet wide bituminous surface, carrying
some 700 vehicles per day.   Although the road can carry this volume, it is
necessary to use the poorly maintained shoulders when passing or overtaking
trucks, which is dangerous.   The vertical alignment on the whole is not very
good, particularly through valleys and over crests.  The horizontal alignmencb
is generally inadequate on bridge approaches. The wearing course of the road is



- 7 -
in a very poor state with frequent exposed patches of base. In places the
base seems adequate, but elsewhere there is evidence of complete failure.
25.       The Ife-Ondo and Ondo-Ore roads form two parts of a Y-shaped complex -
the third, Ondo-Akure, was originally proposed as part of the project but
because of its still serviceable condition its reconstruction is being delayed
on the mission's recommendation. The section Ife-Ondo has a bituminous surface
varying in wiidth between 11 and 14 feet. The horizontal alignment has many
sharp curves due to excessive winding and meandering. For about half the
length of the road the vertical alignment is very poor with the road tending to
rise and fall with the contours of the landscape. The edge of the pavement is
eroded in many parts. The shoulders are narrow and in most cases poorly main-
tained. Traffic census figures show approximately 1,000 vehicles per day use
the road, of which 68% are commercial vehicles. From the traffic analysis it
was found that about 30% of the vehicles are heavy trucks with high axle load-
ings, particularly those carrying logs to the saw mills in Ife. Since the road
is a Provincial road and not designed to withstand such heavy axle loads, the
increase in traffic may cause the complete break-up of an appreciable part of
the road, if adequate corrective steps are not taken. On its reconstruction
the road will be upgraded to a Trunk "B" highway, and maintained by the Regional
Government.
26.       The Ondo-Ore section is not coping adequately with its traffic flow of
some 800 vehicles per day because of its very poor condition. The pavement is
riddled with pot-holes and surface cracks. Thick vegetation growing on both
sides of the narrow road (20 feet width with a 12-feet wide pavement) causes
surface cracking as roots create variations in the moisture content of the
subgrade. Surface water is not draining into proper ditches and as a result,
torrent water tends to erode the shoulders, forming sharp serrated road edges
that are dangerous for overtaking and passing vehicles. This, together with
short-sighted curves that frequently run into single-lane bridges, and the
large volume of vehicles carrying logs for export, make the road extremely
hazardous.
27.       The cost per mile (E 49-66,o00) of the three project roads is above
average for Nigeria and other parts of tropical Africa. This is explainable,
for two of the roads, by the hilly tropical forested terrain through which they
pass. Substantial cuts and fills, tree clearance and grubbing, and extensive
drainage facilities to cope with the heavy tropical rains will be necessary.
The third road, the most expensive, runs through a forest area that is inter-
sected by numerous streams which require bridging. The generally poor alignlrent
of all three roads requires considerable relocation. The lack of suitable road
building materials (sand, gravel and crushed rock) near two of the roads means
that the materials will have to be hauled long distances. All these factors
tend to increase construction costs. For this reason the design standards and
the amount of relocation have been kept to a minimum consistent with safety
and adequate service.
28.       Because the Roads and Bridges Division is understaffed, the consul-
tants who prepared the project will be engaged to supervise the work in the
field. To help the Government of Western NTigeria prepare a future road program
based on final engineering, the Bank has proposed to include in the project



- 8 -
the final survey and design of about 300 miles of roads, for which preliminary
engineering will now be undertaken by consultants in the highway study (feasi-
bility study) financed by the United Nations Special Fund. The same consultants
undertaking the preliminary engineering under the Special Fund contract, will
prepare final survey and design of the same roads.
29.       Also included in the project is provision for the use of consultants
for special tasks in connection with the reorganization and strengthening of
the maintenance operation. For example, they will assist the Roads and Bridgec
Division in preparing an inventory of the present roads, their condition,
maintenance needs, etc., as the necessary first step for the developing of a
maintenance program.
30.       Finally, the project includes the procurement of the additional main-
tenance equipment needed in connection with the reorganization and strengthening
of the maintenance organizat-ion as indicated in paragraph 21. A preliminary
list of equipment to be purchased has already been presented and agreed upon
during the loan negotiations.
31.       Because the new equipment is related to the new plan for maintenance
operation, assurance has been obtained during loan negotiations that the
Government of Western Nigeria will take the necessary steps to create a new
maintenance organization and will provide sufficient funds for operation of the
new equipment and for additional staff.
B. The Cost of the Project
32.       Final survey and design of the three roads included in the project
have been prepared by consultants. The estimated cost of construction, which is
based on final quantities and expected unit prices, can be regarded as reasonabi*
accurate. A 15% contingency is added to cover possible variations in price and
quantities during construction.
33.       The following table summarizes the cost of the project (for details
see Table 5).
Total cost Local cost     Foreign cost in
in 000 Z    in 000 t      in million US$

of 95 miles of roads (inclu-
ding a 15% contingency)            6,100      2,140           1.10
b) Consultants' fees for super-
vision of roads under (a)            480        168           0.90

(US$ 21.0 million) (US$ 6.6 million)



- 9 -
34.       The consultants' fees are actual fees which have been quoted by the
consulting firm that was in charge of the engineering of the project, and
would be engaged for the supervision of construction and for the final engineer-
ing of the 300 miles of roads for the next road project.
35.       The foreign exchange component of 65% for the road construction has
been estimated by the consultants in preparing the project and is identical
with that used for the road Credit for Northern Nigeria, 73-UNI. It includes
the depreciation of all machinery and equipment, the procurement of spare parts
and tires, import of necessary materials and the foreign contractors overhead
and profit. Import of road equipment is duty free. For the reasons indicated
in paragraph 37 below, it is assumed that the work will be executed by foreign
contractors.
36.       The consultants indicate 65% as the foreign exchange component of
their fees, which is reasonable and acceptable.
C. The Execution of the Project
37.       The-project will be divided into 3 separate contracts, one for each
road.  The size of each contract varies from S 1.6 million to E 2.1 million
and should be attractive to foreign contractors. The awarding will be on the
basis of international competitive bidding among prequalified contractors.
Because local contractors still lack enough experience in such work, it is
likely that the execution will be by foreign contractors, a representative
selection of which is already operating in Nigeria. The contracts are of the
type in which each contractor offers his unit prices based on given quantities.
38.       The procurement of maintenance equipment will be on the basis of
international competitive bidding, with technical specifications prepared for
each type of equipment.
39.       The construction time for each of the 3 roads is estimated at 3
years taking into account that during the rainy season (June to October) the
tempo of the work will slow down.
D. Disbursement Schedule and Local Financing
40.       Over a 3½-year construction period required for the execution of the
project, the expected disbursement could be as follows:
Total cost   Local cost Foreign cost in
in 000 E     in 000       million US$
First year                           1,700          540           3,30
Second year                          3,000          960           5.76

h1.       Given the yield of road user taxes in the Region the local currency
required should not be burdensome. The funds required will be made available
from the Development Budget of the Western Region. Assurance has been given
by the Government during loan negotiations that adequate fuinds will be made
available.
IV. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. General
420       Western Nigeria's economy., like that of Nigeria as a whole., is
mainly agricultural. Two out of every five people in the Region are directly
engaged in agriculture wh-ile indir-ectly agriculture supports another large
segment of the population in various allied trade and services. Subject to
one or two exceptions, agricultural production can be broadly divided into two
separate categories: production of' export crops and productio-n of locally
consumed food crops. The main export crops of the Region are cocoa., pal-m
kernels, oil palm, timber and some rubber. Yams, cassava, maize, rice and
cocoyams are the most imiportant food crops produced in the Region. Agriculture
accounts for over 50 per cent of the Region's "gross domestic product". It
also accounts for all its exports. Whi-le for Nigeria as a whole, export crops
make up about 20 per cent of total agricultural production, in Western Nigeria
export crops are more significant., accounting for 40 per cent of the value of
agricultural production.
43.       Although Nigeria is more or less self-supporting in food supplies,
no one Region can be so regarded. There is, therefore, considerable inter-
regional movement of food crops and livestock. While the Western Region
supplies the Northern and Eastern Regions with some of the palm oil, gari,
kolanuts and fresh fruits they require, it depends on them, and in particular
on the Northern Region, for supplies of maize, rice, beans., onions, cattle and
dried fish to supplement p3roduction within the Region. Even within the Region
there is a great movement of food crops from one part to the other. Cn the
one hand., some areas such as Ibadan., Ilesha, Ondo, Ife, Abeokuta, and parts of
Ijebu and Oyo Divisions, tend to specialize mainly in the production of cocoa.
They are, therefore, unable to produce all the food they require f"or consump-
tion. On the other hand, there are surplus food tDroducing areas like Okitipupa
Division and Ijebu'Province (for Gari -and Oil Paim), Ekiti and Oyo Divisions
(for Yam, Maize and Gari) and Badagry and Epe Divisions (for fresh and dried
fish). These, together with the surplus producing areas of the other Regions,
supply the cocoa producing areas with the foodstuffs they require.
44.       Apart from the above reasons for the giowth of intra- and inter-
regional trade in food crops, there are other factors which not only promote
but also accelerate this internal trade. The people of the Western Region are
mostly town dwellers, with over half of the Region's population living in
townships of 5,000 or more people. Lagos, the Federal capital, draws much of
its food supply from Western Nigeria also. The rapid economic and social
development taking place has resulted in greater urbanization in Lagos and
Western Nigeria generally and has accelerated the emergence of a sector of the
population which does not own or cultivate any land. These people also depend



on the surplus producing areas for their food supply. The imporbance of cheap
and adequate transport facilities in fostering this intra- as well as inter-
regional trade, in stimulating the growth of a market economy, in increasing
the national product, and in keeping the cost of living low and stable cannot,
therefore, be over-emphasized.
45.       While for Nigeria as a whole the value of food crops is over four
times the value of export crops, the latter occupy a most strategic position
in the economy. Export crops earn the foreign exchange required to buy foreign
capital and consumption goods. They are also a major source of revenue through
export duties and produce sales taxes. Nigeria's most important traditional
exports are palm kernels, palm oil, groundnuts, cocoa, cotton, rubber, bananas
and timber. The Western Region is preeminent in the production of cocoa
(producing over 90 per cent of Nigeria's total), of palm kernels (producing
just over 50 per cent of the country's total). These crops are produced by a
large number of peasant farmers. As a supplier of these crops, the Western
Nigeria Marketing Board has to face very keen competition in the world markets
from other primary producing countries. If, therefore, the Region's export
crops are to be able to withstand competition in the world market every means
of reducing their cost of production and supply must be found. Since they
are produced on widely dispersed small farms the unit costs of collecting and
exporting are very high and improvements in the transport sector could play a
very important part in reducing these costs. In determining the price paid to
producers the Marketing Board has to deduct the costs of internal transport.
Road improvements, by permitting lower transpdrt costs, make it possible for
the Board to soften some of the impact on producers of falling or low world
market prices for primary products. Equally the movement of domestic food crops
at reasonable cost from areas of production to consumption points depends also
on the provision of adequate transport facilities.
46.       While it is generally realized that the Region's prosperity for mary
years to come will depend mainly on agriculture, attempts are being made to
diversify its economy by the establishment of secondary and tertiary industries.
These industries, many of which are import substitutes, tend to generate new
transport distribution patterns within the country, or alter the existing
pattern.   The success of this industrialization policy depends inevitably on
the expansion of internal trade and this, in turn, will be greatly facilitated
by the provision of cheap and adequate transport facilities. Apart from eco-
nomic factors, there is also social and political justification for the pro-
vision of adequate transport facilities. All weather and low cost transport
plays a most important part not only in stimulating economic growth by encour-
aging trade and thereby widening the range of demand and furthering specializa-
tion, but also in stimulating the mingling of peoples with different customs,
language and ideas, in promoting the growth of knowledge, and in helping
contribute to social cohesion.
47.       Within the general transport situation of Western Nigeria, roads arnd
road transport are of special significance. The Nigerian railway has no
importance to the Region as a freight carrier, being little more than a
conduit to Northern Nigeria from where it draws the bulk of its traffic and



- 12 -
revenues. During World War II the Government deliberately encouraged the
transport of cocoa and palm kernels in Western Nigeria by road in order to
permit the railway to concentrate on other traffic. Since then they have
continued to move by road. With the increasing efficiency of trucking, the
improvement of roads and the development of cocoa production in new areas away
from the railway, roads have become the most economical means of transport.
River transport is non-existent in the Region, which is separated from the
river Niger by Mid-Western Nigeria. To use the river would necessitate cir-
cuitous and uneconomic movements. There is a significant canoe and small
craft traffic on the inland creeks running east-west parallel with the coast,
but with the exception of logs, it can be regarded as local feeder traffic
to the main system. The project roads are located in areas where there is no
economic alternative to road transport. Issues of transport coordination are,
therefore, unimportant in Western Nigeria.
B. The Project Roads
1. Idi-Ayunre - Ijebu-Ode Road
a) Importance of the Ijebu-Ode area
48.       Although accurate figures are not available, the consultants who
studied the economic feasibility of the project estimate that the service
area of the road produces some 5% of the locally consumed crops and 15% of
the export crops grown in Western Nigeria. In value termns this is over US$30
million equivalent. The area produces about 10% of the Region's cocoa exports,
20% of its palm products and 20% ofV its timber exports, the taxes on all of
which contribute some US$2 million to the regional revenues. Products grown
in the area for local consumption include cassava, maize, rice, beans, yams
and kolanuts. Significant volumes of the latter, in particular, are trucked
to NIorthern Nigeria.
49.       The area served has a total of 20 towns with an aggregate population
of around 200,000 people.  In the area there are 41 businesses with 10 or
more employees , 5 important agriculture projects, 35 petrol stations, 22
major markets, 7 hotels and rest houses and over 370 schools of all types.
b)  Importance of the road
50.       The project road, together with the new road to Benin, constitute a
50-mile short-cut between Ibadan, the capital of Western Nigeria and one of
the largest African cities in the continent of Africa, and the Mid-Western
and Eastern Regions. It is expected that all through traffic that now uses
the old route through Ife, Akure and Owo will use the new and shorter route
on completion of the project road. In addition to serving many villages and
the large trading center of Ijebu-Ode, the road connects to Epe, an important
creek port.
51.       As pointed out in paragraph 24 above the present 12 feet wide sur-
face is structurally inadequate, its alignment is poor and is dangerous,
particularly at peak traffic periods. It now carries an average of about 700
vehicles per day, 65% of which are trucks and buses. Taking into account the



- 13 -
projected increase in population in the area, the planned increases in business
and institutions in the service area, a projected increase in motor vehicle
traffic in Western Nigeria of 10% p.a. up to 1969-70, as well as the diversion
of about 300 vehicles per day from the existing longer route to Benin via Ife
and Akure to this 50-mile shorter route, the tota' daily traffic is forecast
by the consultants to reach about 1,500 vehicles daily.
52.       The Bank's "Report on the Economic Development of Nigeria" (1955)
recommended the upgrading of this road to a two-lane standard with improved
visibility, grades, sub-base, etc., since it was one of those routes designated
by the Mission as a "heavy traffic artery".
c) Benefits resulting from reconstruction
53.       With the realignment and reconstruct-on of the road, there will be
considerable and immediate savings to vehicLe owners in the form of lower
direct operating costs, reduced maintenance and depreciation. In addition,
there will be large savings to the traffic diverting from the 50-mile longer
and much poorer alternative route to and from Benin and the East. Discounted
over the 20-year assumed economic life of the road, the benefits to 1970
traffic, together with those accruing to traffic which is conservatively assumed
to grow at 5% p.a. after 1970, give a rate of return of just under 20% (see
Note on Economic Benefits).
54.       These savings are of considerable benefit to the economy in that
because of competition in road transport a large part is likely to be passed
on to farmers in the form of lower transport costs, thus permitting higher
realized farm prices. They have a multiplier effect in that the redistribu-
tion of income involved to the rural areas will permit greater consumption
and/or savings for reinvestment. The above rate of return excludes any net
benefits resulting from a reduction in traffic accidents which are a particu-
lar problem in Nigeria. One estimate, for example, is that the reported acci-
dent rate per million vehicle miles is about 8 times greater than in the U.K.
2. Ife-Ondo and Ondo-Ore roads
a) Importance of the Roads
55.       These two roads bisect Ondo Province, the agricultural output of
which is estimated to be about 40% of the Region's gross domestic product.  The
Province accounts for approximately 34% of the Region's cocoa, 2.5% of its
palm products and 40% of its timber, the taxes of which now yield some $4.2
million equivalent annually to the Government. The products grown for local
consumption are cassava (gari), maize, plantain, yam, kolanuts and citrus
fruits. The Ondo division of the Province specializes in cocoa and is supplied
with food from neighboring areas to its north and south. Of the Province's
population of over 1 million, some 200,000 live within 21 towns. There are 46
regional agricultural projects in the broad service area of the road, 6 major
forest reserves, 125 produce-buying stores, 51 schools, 8 motor parks, and 56
businesses employing 10 or more employees.



56.       Dn addition to connecting the timber producing areas of Ekiti and Ondo
with the sawmills arid creek ports of Okitipupa Division, the most important
function of the road, with the opening up of the Shagamu-Benin road, is the
evacuation to Lagos of the above-mentioned exports. The opening of the latter
road has also shortened the distance between Ife and Benin by 35 miles.  Con-
sequently, traffic from Northern Nigeria, and from the northwestern part of
Western Nigeria, to and from the Mid-West is being attracted to the route.
When the project route is rebuilt it is expected that at least another 100
vehicles per day, 70% of which would be commercial vehicles, will divert to it.
As pointed out in paragraphs 25 and 26 above, the present condition of the
route is poor. This, together with the large present volume of traffic now
carried, inhibits the transfer of many vehicles to the new route to Benin.
57.       Traffic on the northern part of the route (Ife-Ondo) is now some
1,000 vehicles per day of which about two-thirds are commercial vehicles.
Taking into account a projected 12% increase in the area's population up to
1970, the amount of traffic being attracted by the opening of the new Sbagamu-
Benin road, the forecasts of agricultural exports from the area, and a 10% p.a.
over-all increase in traffic in the Region, the Ministry of Works estimates
that by the year of the opening of the road it would be carrying 1,600 vehicles
per day. This clearly exceeds the capacity of the present one-lane road. The
Ondo-Ore section carries less traffic (800 vehicles per day) than the northern
section, but the proportion of very heavy log-carrying vehicles increases.
Traffic on this section is expected to increase to 1,000 vehicles per day when
the road is reconstructed and widened.
b) Benefits from their reconstruction
58.       As in the case of the Ijebu-Ode - Idi-Ayunre road, substantial
savings in present and future road user costs will result from the projected
improvements. On the assumlption of a long-term traffic growth rate of 5% p.a,
the benefits discounted over the assumed 20-year economic life of the roads
are sufficient to give rates of return of 10% on the Ife-Ondo section and 9%
on the Ondo-Ore section. These lower rates of return than in the previous case
above are due to the higher construction costs involved (see paragraph 27),
Should traffic grow faster than assumed, or more vehicles divert than antici-
pated, the returns would be higher. Again these returns exclude any benefits
accruing from a reduction in the accident rate. They also understate the real
advantages of the project in that they make no allowance for the saving in
future road maintenance costs that would have to be incurred in the face of
growing traffic if the roads were not rebuilt.
V. CONTCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
59.       Final survey and design of the roads included in the project have
been prepared by consultants and the cost estimate can be regarded as reason-
ably accurate.
60.       The roads are important to the economy of the Region; collectively
they will raise the standards of the Region's road network. They give accept-
able rates of return (a weighted average of 13% for the whole project).

61.       The project is technically sound and economically justified and
provides a suitable basis for a Banl loan of $t4.5 million equivalent. An
appropriate term for the loan would be 25 years, including a 5-year period of
grace.

d/  The fall in 1963 in truck licenses is partly a consequence of the political
and economic upsets in Western Nigeria. While total figures for 1964 were
not available, the figures for imports and new registrations suggest a return
to trend. The decline in Northern licenses is disguised by the greatly
increased use of large trucks, many of which, on long hauls, operated with
locally made trailers attached. Based on import figures and recent replacement
rates, the Mission estimates that total increases in 1965 will be over 24,000.

WES IERN NIC-ERITA
FIRST ROAD PROJECT
NOTE ON TIE ECONOMIC BENEFITS
1.        The consultants who investigated the feasibility of the project founa
that the total annual costs (excluding profits) of operating the typical truck
in Western Nigeria was £ 2,750. This is equivalent to 22 pence per vehicle
mile (inclusive of taxes) for a vehicle rumning 30,000 miles per annum - an
average figure confirmed by published studies.   The consultants' investigationri
led them to conclude that as a result of the reconstruction of the project roa.
the total costs would fall by £ 500, or equivalent to 4 pence per vehicle mile.
2.        The Ilission was fortunately in possession of other very detailed
information relating to the costs of operating the typical 5 and 7 ton trucks
found in Nigeria in 1961.   This information (which covered fuel costs, servicin,
costs, tires and tubes, repair, depreciation, insurance, wages, license and
testing fees, garaging, interest on capital (10%) and overhead expenses) showeC'
the following range of costs:
(Pence per vehicle mile)
Miles per year                5 ton truck                   7 ton tuck
Petrol        Diesel           Petrol       Diesel
15,000                  22.4          22.4            2h.4         23.2
25,COO                 18.7           18.6            20.5         19.3
35,000                 18.0           17.8            19.8         18.4
45,000                  17.6          17.3            19.3         18.0
3.        Since 1961 gross trucking costs have risen because of increased
import duties on vehicles and fuel and by wage increases. The effect of these
increases is to bring the above costs in line with those found by the con-
sultants. Current freight rates in the Region of 6 to 8 pence per ton mile
according to load factors substantiate the estimated vehicle operating costs.
After allowing for the tax element in costs the Mission reduced the savings
per truck mile to 3 pence, a figure consistent with the results of investiga-
tions carried out on similar improvements elsewhere in former British Africa
and the Bank's observations elsewhere. The same saving was applied to buses.
For private automobiles a reduction of 1 penny per vehicle was assumed.
4.        Future annual routine maintenance costs per mile are assumed to be
£ 400, with a further cost of £ 2,850 per mile for resealing the surface of the
roads every fifth year.
