1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1. This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) describes the results of a
series of three programmatic lending operations, the Programmatic Support for Institution
Building I to III (PSIB) spanning over four years. The contributions of the first operation
were already discussed in a simplified ICR (Report No. 33000) and rated as follows:

         Outcome:                                      Satisfactory
         Sustainability:                               Likely
         Institutional Development Impact:             Substantial
         Bank Performance:                             Satisfactory
         Borrower Performance:                         Satisfactory

2. The World Bank Operations Evaluation Department (OED) reviewed the Simplified
ICR and agreed with all ratings but one. The criterion on Sustainability was assessed as
non-evaluable. It was expressed that at the time of the simplified ICR it was not possible
to assess whether benefits of this operation and of the program as whole would be
sustainable. In particular, it was argued that sustainability remains uncertain as long as
security does not improve in all parts of the country.

3. The results of the first operation will be briefly discussed in this document in the
context of describing the program results. This full ICR accordingly rates the
contributions of PSIB II and PSIB III.


1.1 Context at Appraisal

4. The first operation was appraised in June 2004 at the time when there was great
optimism and increasing confidence in the country's economic future. This was
attributable to the successful process of political normalization which started with the fall
of the Taliban regime in late 2001. Progress on a road map for creating a peaceful and
democratic state, known as the Bonn process1, was encouraging. On January 26, 2004
Afghanistan's first Constitution in three decades was ratified and the first democratic
presidential elections were anticipated in October 2004 (originally set for July 2004). As
a result many Afghan refugees, mainly living in the neighboring countries of Pakistan
and Iran, began to return to Afghanistan. The Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) of the
Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan (TISA) undertook several actions to establish
security and rule of law, including the formation of an Afghan National Army (ANA) and
Afghan National Police (ANP) and the implementation of the Disarmament,
Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) program. Overall the security situation was
relatively calm, but remained unpredictable with the occasional kidnapping (and release)
of United Nations staff members.




1The political agreement was reached in Bonn in December 2001.




                                                      1

5. The Government of Afghanistan (GOA) showed strong ownership and
accountability in formulating a national development strategy. It was committed to
take the first National Development Framework (NDF) from April 2002 further towards a
comprehensive             development       strategy      for    Afghanistan,         reflected     in     Securing
Afghanistan's Future presented to the donors in March 2004. This strategy was endorsed
by the World Bank. Donors played a significant role delivering humanitarian relief to
vulnerable Afghan people and in the immediate reconstruction effort. The provision of
public services by the government was very limited, especially outside of Kabul. The
multi-donor Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), administered by the World
Bank was set up in 2002 to finance parts of the government's recurrent budget, but also
increasingly funded priority investments in the GOA's National Priority Programs based
on the NDF.

6. The economy started to recover strongly, but from a very low base. In 2002/03
real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (excluding opium) was estimated to have grown
about 30 percent and in 2003/04 at 16 percent (Table 1). Growth was largely due to a
recovery in agriculture -Afghanistan's dominant economic activity-- including opium
production. However, it is highly dependent on weather conditions. Construction and
services were other rapidly expanding sectors, especially in urban areas.                                    Opium
production emerged as one of the foremost challenges for the authorities and recovered
dramatically after the Taliban ban of 2000. Production was estimated to have reached
3,400 tons in 2002/03 and increased further in 2004. Opium export and its derivatives
also became the largest source of export earnings from domestic sources. Following the
successful completion of the currency conversion in January 2003 prices came down
from a very high level and inflation initially eased off.

7. Recovery was driven by sizable donor assistance, but supported by sound
macroeconomic and monetary policies of the new Afghan leadership. This was
reflected in a stable exchange rate for the new currency, moderating inflation and
adherence to strict fiscal discipline. For example, in the financial sector rebuilding of the
Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) as an independent Central Bank was initiated and a number
of new banks were licensed, supported by the recently adopted DAB Law and Banking
Law (2003). In March 2004 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) initiated a Staff-
Monitored Program (SMP).

8. Establishing a proper budget process was key for the budget progressively
becoming a tool to implement the NDF and coordinate donors' assistance. The first
operating budget2 of 2002/03 was an initial step for setting domestic revenue target,
prioritizing operating expenditure and establishing the government's macroeconomic
credibility. Although domestic revenues exceeded expectations, a significant financing
requirement needed to be filled with donor assistance. The second and third budget
cycles of 2003/04 and 2004/05 demonstrated increased levels of sophistication. In
2004/05 the government adopted for the first time a core budget to improve coordination



2The operating budget consists of current expenditures in the form of wages and salaries and some capital expenditure
(i.e. basic office refurbishment). The government's development budget covers reconstruction projects and some
donor-funded recurrent costs.

economy by using UNODC annual opium report data. GDP data from CSO and IMF is not identical. Trade balances and
Balance of Payments data are compiled by IMF. Many Ministry of Finance (MOF) documents (like the Medium-Term
Fiscal Framework, MTFF) refer to IMF data.

and control over donor flows.3 However, external budget grants (financed and executed
by donors directly) comprised the largest part of public expenditures.

9. Reform efforts were underway to overcome a civil service system that lacked
professional capacity and suffered from patronage. The government enacted in 2003
the Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) program for reforming the most critical
functions of government with an elevated pay scale in exchange for organizational
restructuring. This was an attempt to address the inability of the current pay and grade
system to attract, retain and motivate skilled civil servants.

10. Social indicators for Afghanistan showed signs of improvement after the return
of peace and broader economic activity. Most of all, school enrollment increased and
progress was made in food security. Public health campaigns included vaccination
programs, but infant and maternal mortality were still among the lowest in the world
(Table 2). In 2003 the first National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) was
conducted in Afghanistan with the main objective to better understand the livelihoods of
the rural population.4 Data suggests that 48 percent of the surveyed population fell below
the per capita food expenditure threshold, i.e. the cost of purchasing 2,100 calories/day of
the typical food basket consumed by the poorest households. Households associated with
opium production had significantly lower poverty rates. The survey also revealed that
about 40 percent of the sampled households perceived that welfare had improved over the
last 12 months.

3The core budget consolidates the operating budget with development expenditures channeled through the treasury's
accounts. The external budget refers to fiscal operations implemented directly by donors.
4The NRVA was carried out in July-September 2003 and surveyed 11,200 households in 1,850 villages, however, it
was not a statistically representative survey for rural Afghanistan nor did it capture seasonality.



                                                                    4

11. Despite these laudable immediate reconstruction and stabilization efforts,
enormous development challenges remained. Many of these challenges related to the
limited administrative capacity in the new institutions of the Afghan state and the lack of
cohesion in the newly set-up systems. For example, budget execution remained at a low
level and most of the external assistance disbursed went not through the Treasury. Also,
if administrative capacity was still weak at the center, it was even more limited at the
sub-national level, i.e. in the provinces. In order to address key challenges in institution
and capacity building the government requested from the Bank multi-year financial
support to its budget, that would support recurrent costs, as well as priority development
projects that were not yet fully financed by donors. This was envisioned under the
objective to deepen and broaden reforms in the areas of public administration and fiscal
management. With its request the government sought to support an important subset of its
medium-term development strategy while other donors supported other reform areas.

12. The first PSIB operation built on reforms that were already initiated with
International Development Association (IDA) support. This included, for example,
the Emergency Public Administration Project. Also, it focused on areas for which the
authorities had demonstrated strong ownership and had built a good track record of
reforms. Raising fiduciary standards was a key objective of this operation and it hoped to
function as a catalyst for other donors' continued support, including through the ARTF.
PSIB I was in alignment with the Bank's second Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for
Afghanistan from March 2003, which described the support to the country, covering a
period of 18 months to two years. The Board of Executive Directors approved the first
PSIB in July 2004 with the initial plan to be followed by at least a second operation the
following year, where the key objectives were to remain the same for the program period.
The first PSIB was a Development Policy Credit in the amount of US$80 million. The
second and third PSIB were Development Policy Grants, each in the amount of US$80
million. PSIB II was approved by the Board in December 2005, PSIB III in May 2007,
based on the performance and progress on implementation of agreed actions in the policy
matrix.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

13. The purpose of this series was to deepen and sustain the reforms underway in
the areas of public administration and fiscal management. The success of these
reforms was seen as essential for building an accountable and effective state and critical
for successful poverty reduction. The PSIBs were a component of an overall package of
operations that aimed at building the financial management of the state, raising fiduciary
standards, and supporting public administration reform (PAR). It complemented separate
investment and technical assistance operations that, together, supported the
implementation of comprehensive sectoral reforms. By strengthening institutions, the
implementation of these reforms was expected to lead to a more efficient allocation of
fiscal resources to priority activities in the areas of human development and private sector
development. The series was coordinated with other donors' support.

14. Key outcome indicators for each operation are presented in the data sheet and
Table 3. These indicators included high-level impact indicators like, annual GDP growth



                                                5

and external assistance on budget as a proportion of total external assistance.                                                                                                                      To
summarize the program baseline in comparison to the end-of program achievements, key
outcome indicators also included a set of indicators on fiscal and budget management,
including the revenue to GDP ratio, budget implementation ratio and indicators that
would assess the quality of the budget process, fiduciary standards and the quality of the
regulatory process for budget and financial management. This also included the public
access of key documents. A third set of indicators focused on measuring the efficiency of
public administration with indicators like the number of senior merit-based appointments,
size of civil service and the quality of the regulatory framework for civil service.
Progress in these indicators is reported in Table 3. Key policy areas supported by the
operations are detailed in section 1.4.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

15. The PDO or key indicators were not revised during the implementation of PSIB
II and III. The first PSIB had a simple monitoring and evaluation framework, mostly
focused on process and input indicators. This was mainly due to the scarcity of data and
monitoring capacity of the government. Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) was
emphasized as an area of improvement in the ICR for the PSIB I. During the preparation
of the PSIB II a new methodology to monitor and evaluate the reform supported agenda



                                                                                                     6

was developed. However, it struggled with the same underlying conditions of PSIB I, i.e.
(i) limited data availability, (ii) poor data quality, and (iii) little monitoring capacity of
the authorities. These limitations were also noted in the Implementation Status and
Results Reports (ISR) for both operations. The monitoring and evaluation framework did
not contain any indicators on human development, since this area became less of a focus
during PSIB II and III (1.5 Revised Policy Areas).

16. The Program Documents for PSIB II and III indicated that the evaluation of the
operations would largely focus on progress and input indicators, which could be
linked to medium-term outcomes. The framework also included indicators on impacts
and outcomes that were outside of the government's control, but considered important in
order to evaluate the impact of the reform program. During the PSIB II and III
supervision a subset of 11 key indicators was followed (Table 3). For each indicator a
baseline was provided for 2003/04 and a target set for 2007/08.


1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program

17. The first PSIB was prepared before the first democratic elections under the AIA
of the TISA. It supported a broad reform program with four main pillars: (A.)
Maintaining macroeconomic stability, (B.) Strengthening budget management and public
administration, (C.) Ensuring human development, and (D.) Promoting private sector
development. After a break of 15 months the second PSIB supported the newly elected
Afghan administration with a reform program based on the following pillars: (A.)
Developing a development strategy, (B.) Promoting security and rule of law, (C.)
Maintaining macroeconomic stability, (D.) Strengthening public administration and fiscal
management, (E.) Enhancing human development, and (F.) Promoting private sector
development. While PSIB II wished to address Afghanistan's upcoming key challenges,
i.e., the need to finalize the government's development strategy and the first signs of a
deteriorating security situation, the reform program supported by PSIB II became more
focused on strengthening PAR, raising fiduciary standards and promoting financial sector
development. This led to less emphasis on the pillar of human development and private
sector development. PSIB III followed this direction and concentrated on deepening and
sustaining reforms in public administration and fiscal management.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

18. The policy areas were not substantially revised, but the program evolved over
time, consistent with the concept of a programmatic series. Over the course of the
PSIB II and III operations the reform program supported became more focused on
strengthening public administration and fiscal management and the policy area of human
development became less prominent. This was reflected in the Government Policy Matrix
under PSIB II and III. In PSIB I prior actions related to human development comprised
higher budget allocation for these areas. However, it appeared that the main limitations
were not the amount of resources available, but the limited absorptive capacity. Decisive
bottlenecks were in budget formulation and implementation and Public Financial
Management (PFM), due to sub-optimal processes and the very limited capacity of civil
servants. For these reasons there was a slight shift with PSIB II toward deepening and


                                              7

sustaining reforms in the PFM and PAR. This was also in the interest of guaranteeing an
adequate fiduciary environment for ARTF resources, which were channeled through the
government core budget. For example, in 2003/04 the ARTF financed about 40 percent
of the budget, in 2004/05 about 35 percent. For these reasons the monitoring and
evaluation framework did not contain any indicators on human development, since it was
only used starting with PSIB II (1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification).

1.6 Other significant changes

19. PSIB I was a Development Policy Credit, while PSIB II and III were
Development Policy Grants. For IDA, debt sustainability started to form the basis for
grant allocation with IDA14 (July 2005-June2008). Otherwise no significant changes
were introduced to the operation.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

20. Implementation of the reform program since the start of the PSIB series has
been mostly balanced. There were times of slower progress toward the end of PSIB I
and the first half of PSIB II. Stepped up supervision and dialogue brought the reform
program back on track and led to an improved performance under PSIB III. Overall
progress over the four years was commendable, given the difficult country circumstances.
Due to the initial absence of a coherent national development strategy, the change in
political leadership in the second half of the first operation and overall limited
government capacity the performance in the first half of PSIB II was uneven. The
incumbent President formed a new Cabinet in late December 2004, shortly after the first
PSIB was approved in July 2004. The new government needed some time to take
ownership of the program leading to slower than expected progress in public
administration and civil service reform. However, performance improved markedly
toward PSIB III and throughout PSIB III implementation progress was satisfactory. This
is reflected in the results for the key outcome indicators in Table 3 (as a sub-set of the
evaluation and monitoring framework).

21. All agreed prior actions for PSIB II and III were completed before Board
approval of each operation (Table 4). There was satisfactory progress in achieving
defined prior actions, triggers and key outcome indicators for the series.

22. Program performance was rated satisfactory in two ISRs and one Simplified
ICR. The Simplified ICR for the PSIB I rated the achievement of the outcomes under
the main objectives, strengthening public administration and fiscal management,
satisfactory. Overall, the reforms supported under PSIB I were expected to have
substantial institutional development impact in the areas of macroeconomic stability,
public administration and fiscal management. The ISR for PSIB II (August 09, 2006)
evaluated the progress toward achievement of Program Development Objective (PDO)
and overall program implementation as moderately satisfactory. This period followed


                                             8

immediately the first democratic Parliamentary (and Provincial Council) elections in
September 2005. Also at this time the authorities were largely occupied with the
preparation of the development strategy (Interim ANDS) and the first Afghan budget
approved by Parliament. It was assessed that the there were satisfactory plans in place
and solid commitment to move toward fulfillment of triggers for PSIB III. Two ISRs
prepared for the PSIB III (September 18, 2007 and April 25, 2008) rated the overall
development objective rating and implementation progress as satisfactory. Progress
gained momentum between October 2006 and April 2007, with all prior actions for PSIB
III having been reached and most triggers having been either fulfilled as specified or
largely fulfilled with sufficient progress. The government demonstrated continued effort
towards fulfillment of all outcome indicators. At the time of the last ISR in April 2008,
10 out of 11 actions were assessed as being fulfilled or likely to be fulfilled by the end of
the Afghan solar year 1386 (ending in March 2008).5

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

23. The design of the programmatic series itself proved to be very beneficial in the
more volatile environment of Afghanistan. The PSIB series provided rolling support
for the government's development strategy, with each operation specifying a set of
triggers which, when met, provided the basis for proceeding with the next operation.
This reinforced government ownership, allowed for predictability of resources for the
government and thus sustained motivation to focus on the implementation of the reform
program. It also allowed the Bank team to exercise a certain level of flexibility in
adjusting the reform program over time and accurately reflecting the substantial reform
agenda and effort of the government.

24. Political support and government commitment to core areas of the supported
reform program allowed following through with an ambitious reform agenda. The
Minister of Finance and the Deputy Minister of Finance were actively involved in
facilitating the implementation of major reform steps, notably in the areas of
macroeconomic policy and fiscal management. Throughout the PSIB series supported
reforms were regarded as priority by the MOF. There was genuine interest and effort by
the counterpart team for advancing the reform agenda in a difficult environment with
very limited capacity. In a few supported reform areas, there was clearly less reform
commitment or government-wide policy agreement, for example on private sector
development.       In other areas, a longer than anticipated political consensus-building
process was needed, in particular in public administration reform. Government inter-
agency and inter-ministerial coordination could be improved to better align reform efforts
in areas that require contributions from various agencies.

25. Regularity of a candid dialogue with the Bank team and GOA created a
constructive and effective work atmosphere.                     This included swift responses to
clarification questions and additional technical support requests by the authorities. This
was also supported by a transparent information exchange, which helped to ensure
credibility and predictability of the Bank financing. The close cooperation of the Bank
team with the GOA during the PSIB implementation also enabled the continued
engagement on policy dialogue. Continuity of the core counterpart team throughout
much of the series of operations allowed the Bank team to build a successful working
relationship.      Since the Finance Minister under the first democratically elected
government took office in December 2004, the GOA counterpart team remained of high
capacity, which made it possible to interact effectively, follow-up without major delays
and contribute to capacity-building.

26. The PSIB series complemented Bank's investment and technical assistance
operations. These included the areas of financial management, procurement, public
administration, and financial and private sector development, energy, and human



                                                  11

development. The design of the reform program with focus on areas with strong
analytical underpinning allowed the identification of critical areas of concern and actions.
The PSIB series ensured adequate fiduciary standards for other donors that channeled
funds through the government core budget, in particular the significant ARTF resources
to the recurrent budget.

27. Close cooperation and links with other donor initiatives and their technical
teams helped to prioritize efforts and use synergies in areas of mutual concern.
Examples are the IMF SMP and Poverty and Growth Facility (PRGF), and parts of the
Department for International Development (DFID), United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) programs.
With the IMF, the adequateness of the macro framework and of the reform program in
revenue mobilization was ensured.         With DFID, capacity building in the Budget
Department and the Fiscal Policy Unit was supported. With ADB, efforts to improve
statistical capacity at the CSO and institutional capacity at the MOF were encouraged.
USAID's projects for creating a private sector legal framework, building capacity in audit
and strengthening supervision capacity at the Central Bank were supported.

28. The volatile security situation diverted a large share of government attention
and resources to security-related measures. This was in particular true in the run-up to
the elections at the beginning of the series (end 2004) and since late 2006 when the
overall security situation started to deteriorate. It also forced the focus of state-building
on the central government in Kabul, rather than the extension of reform efforts to sub-
national levels.

29. The absence of a comprehensive government strategy at the outset of the PSIB
series led to the design of a very broad reform program and government policy
matrix. For that reason the series needed to be gradually focused over time to address
identified areas of reform priority. Priority areas emerged largely through the presence of
individual champions in specific government departments or sectors. The ANDS was
only finalized in April 2008, after the PSIB series ended.

30. The scarcity of core skills and competencies required to build an effective
administration were more persistent than expected.             This was aggravated by the
continued competition for qualified staff by Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) and
aid agencies. The impact of this was felt in all areas of the supported reform program and
the anticipated speed of reforms, but in particular in the area of public administration
reform. In hindsight, expectations for the PAR agenda were overly ambitious and did not
adequately reflect the long term nature of capacity building. Not considered earlier but
now increasingly recognized, is that the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil
Service Commission (IARCSC) has neither the political nor technical credibility to
implement reforms in all ministries. So a more appropriate role for the IARCSC is to
guide and oversee ministries' implementation, while allowing those ministries to take
responsibility for their own respective reforms. In the area of capacity building, a review
of the Afghan Expatriates Program found that filling the capacity gap was successful
where the objective of technical assistance was clear and focused, and this change was
introduced in the successor program's (Management Capacity Program) design.




                                              12

31. The general lack of statistical data and monitoring capacity on the government
side first delayed and then complicated the compilation of an M&E framework. For
this reason there was no comprehensive set of outcome indicators that could be followed
throughout the series.    This led also to the focus on process and input indicators,
including selected indicators on outcome and impacts that were beyond the government's
control.

32. The risk of the program was considered as significant before the first PSIB and
was validated by the implementation experience.            Main country risks (political,
security and macroeconomic) -the mitigation of which was outside of the scope of the
program-- remained present.       Especially the impact of the deteriorating security
environment cannot be underestimated. Security concerns and related issues are
continuing to dominate the attention of high-level political decision-makers and to
influence their policy choices. This is particularly apparent in regard to budgetary
pressures from the security sector. Although implementation capacity improved slowly
over the program series it remained heavily dependent on international technical
assistance. However, other high risk factors were very successfully mitigated through an
adequate program design and adjustment of the reform program over the course of the
series, and close supervision and continued dialogue with the authorities during program
implementation. For example, fiduciary and implementation risks were successfully
mitigated partly due to progress in fiduciary standards and budget implementation under
the reform program supported by the series itself. These improvements also contributed
to higher fiduciary standards for other government transactions and the entire IDA
portfolio. This contributed to the assessment of high perceived benefits from the
successful PSIB series. The high benefits of the PSIB series justified the initial approach
of development policy lending in the high risk environment of Afghanistan.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

33. The M&E framework was overall robust, but also revealed some design
weaknesses. Generally it was successful in assisting the GOA and Bank team during
operation supervision to track key indicators and to identify issues that would need to be
addressed in the implementation of the reform program. The M&E framework evolved
from the first to the second operation. For PSIB I it included 19 indicators in five core
areas of reform support: PFM, transparency of PFM, budget formulation, budget
execution and external audit. All but two were qualitative indicators.          The M&E
framework for PSIB II and III included 60 indicators, and there was the effort to include
more easily verifiable quantitative indicators. However, the list of indicators was too long
to monitor regularly and some indicators on impacts and outcomes were outside of the
government's control (e.g. proportion of donor assistance on core budget as percentage of
external assistance). For each indicator a baseline was provided for 2003/04 and a target
set for 2007/08.

34. Throughout the series, the Bank project team provided assistance to the
government counterpart in monitoring and evaluating the program. Government
counterparts facilitated access to key data sources for the indicators. Information on
indicators was reported in the aide memoires and the ISRs. This arrangement worked



                                            13

well in an environment where the monitoring capacity of the government counterpart was
very limited. During the implementation period, the official data for baseline data
estimates for the M&E framework, as well as the official data estimates collected during
supervision missions, were continuously revised. Thus, the latest public data on 2003/04
are not necessarily coinciding with the baseline data defined in 2005. Similar, data
estimates collected and reported in the ISRs were subject to later revisions and might not
coincide with data recorded in this ICR. There is a long delay between the end of the
Afghan fiscal year (March 20) and the first data available for that fiscal year. Data
reconciliation can take up to a year. This ICR used the latest available data for 2007/08 ­
as available during the ICR completion mission.

35. The M&E framework for PSIB I was largely based on process indicators
requiring a qualitative assessment of progress. The improved M&E framework for
PSIB II and III tried to incorporate more quantitative indicators to make the assessment
of progress more straightforward. However, this M&E framework included a large
number of indicators (60), some of which were difficult to track over the life of an
operation. A smaller sub-set of key outcome indicators from this framework was thus
used for regular monitoring. This list consisted of eleven indicators, which were tracked
in the ISRs for PSIB II and III. While the M&E framework itself was deemed adequate,
the basic data and monitoring constraints in the Afghan country environment limited the
utilization of the M&E framework.          Important data limitations were noted in the
Simplified ICR for PSIB I and the ISRs for PSIB II and III. Due to the process nature of
several outcome indicators it was at times difficult to summarize and assess the results in
these categories. Similarly, the significant lag period between the end of the Afghan
fiscal year and the availability of first reliable data estimates for that fiscal year
obstructed a clear and timely assessment of indicators over the program lifetime. Indeed,
often pre-estimates turned out to be more optimistic than the final end-year data.
However, overall the M&E framework was a valuable attempt to track progress on the
program implementation and provide a link to medium-term outcomes. Statistical data
capacity building could have been a more prominent part of the PSIB series itself, in
order to mitigate this problem.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

36. Following the good progress under the PSIB series, the government requested
that the World Bank continue to be engaged in budget support. The Afghanistan
Strengthening Institutions Development Policy Grant was approved by the Board of
Executive Directors in June 2009. Given the need for continued reform support through
the government core budget and in view of the political uncertainty in the run-up for the
elections in August 2009, the new development policy grant is a stand-alone operation
with targeted reforms in MOF to preserve reform gains of the most successful
components of the PSIB series. The grant is providing US$35 million in budget support,
assisting the government with crucial discretionary funds to address expenditure
pressures. Recently revenue under-performance and spending pressures (as a result of
external shocks, e.g. global food or fuel price increases, as well as the deteriorating
security situation) resulted in a significant reduction in cash balances that forced GOA to
adjust medium-term spending downward starting with the SY1388 budget. Beside the


                                              14

wish to address important financing needs of the GOA, the main function of the
development policy grant is to strengthen the macroeconomic and fiduciary environment
for donor assistance going through the core government budget of Afghanistan.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37. The PSIBs' objectives were at the core of the government's goal to build the
institutions of an accountable and effective state and are critical for poverty
reduction. Public administration and fiscal management reforms were very relevant in
the post-conflict setting of Afghanistan and a central part of the GOA's medium-term
development strategy within the context of a secure environment and a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework. At the outset of the series, the administrative capacity of the
Government to formulate and implement policies was very limited and there was no
systematic mechanism to adopt and coordinate policies across a large number of
ministries with overlapping functions. Also, the ministries' capacity to develop and
implement policies was limited.

38. The Bank's analytical work supported the main reform areas of GOA's strategy
and has been used for the design and prioritization of the reform program
supported by the PSIB series. This resulted in an appropriate design that was based on
sound analytical underpinnings and with a focus on areas with sufficient knowledge base.
The Bank's Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) provided significant support in the
area of public administration and fiscal management. Technical assistance had been
continuously provided for fiduciary areas and civil service reform. In the area of private
sector development, Afghanistan: Financial Sector Reforms (March 2003), an Investment
Climate Assessment (December 2005) provided the analytical underpinning for the PSIB
series.

39. However, a shortcoming to the design was the too broad scope of the supported
reform program in a country-setting with limited implementation capacity. This was
reflected in an overly broad design of the supported government policy matrix. In two
areas, private sector and public administration reform, the design was subject to an
overestimated readiness to implement reforms. While the choice of public administration
reform was justified at the time, because of expected synergies with other PAR related
IDA projects and the wish to provide additional leverage through policy dialogue, these
reforms turned out to be more complex than expected. The difficult political economy
surrounding this topic was underestimated and led to an unrealistic expectation on the
possible timeline to implement these reforms successfully. In the area of private sector
reforms, the need for strong government leadership was not acknowledged appropriately,
although there was good analytical work underpinning expected reforms in this area.
Both reform areas suffered from the overall lack of capacity. To the credit of the Bank
team these shortcomings were addressed over the course of the series where possible, in
particular making use of the flexibility that the design of a programmatic series allowed.
This was reflected in the adaptations of the program design over the course of the series



                                             15

with: (i) decreasing focus on private sector reforms, and (ii) more realistic reform
expectations in relation to PAR.

40. The Bank support for the PSIB reforms was anchored in the Interim Strategy
Note (ISN)6, which envisaged continued provision of single-tranche budget support.
The ISN summarized lessons from the implementation of the TSS and noted that
reconstruction is not only about infrastructure, but also about rebuilding the state itself.
As such, the process of reconstruction takes time, reinforcing the need for programmatic
support to building institutions. The PSIB series appropriately addressed the core
objective of the strategy: to build the capacity of the state and its accountability to its
citizens and to promote growth of the rural economy and of a formal, modern, and
competitive private sector.             Through their impact on budget management, fiduciary
standards, and capacity building, they also supported the entire portfolio. Their design
also maximized the synergies with other instruments (investment lending, analytical work,
and administration of the ARTF).


3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

41. The achievement of the overall PDO to deepen and sustain the reforms
underway in the areas of public administration and fiscal management were
satisfactory. Institution-building was at the core of the objectives of the PSIBs and
significant progress has been made under PSIB I-III The outcome/output indicators for
the series of operations presented in Table 3 and the data sheet indicate good program
performance.


(A.) Developing a development strategy: Satisfactory

42. There was satisfactory progress in developing Afghanistan's national
development strategy.               Shortly after approval of PSIB II, in January 2006, the
Government completed its Interim ANDS and presented it, together with the Afghanistan
Compact, to the international community. The Interim ANDS strategy served as the
country's interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It was structured around
three pillars: (i) security, (ii) governance, rule of law and human rights, and (iii)
economic and social development.                     The Compact guided the program for Afghan
development and cooperation of government and international community after the
formal conclusion of the Bonn process with the inauguration of the National Assembly in
December 2005. The Compact set specific goals and benchmarks in security, governance,
economic and social development, and counter-narcotics to evaluate performance over
the five-year period 2006-11.                The PSIB III aimed at supporting the government's
medium-term development strategy, the Interim ANDS and specifically incorporated
many of the Compact benchmarks into the government policy matrix. The government
embarked immediately following on a process of analytical work, sector strategy



6The country assistance strategy related to these operations was provided in the Bank's ISN (FY06-07), discussed by
the IDA Board of Executive Directors in May 2006, and the two TSS covering the 2002-06 period.




                                                          16

formulation, and consultations to develop the Interim ANDS into a full ANDS. The
ANDS covering the five-year period from 2008 to 2013, was approved by President
Hamid Karzai and his Cabinet on April 21 2008, and submitted to the IMF and World
Bank as Afghanistan's PRSP. While the ANDS provides a general development
                                         7

framework, it still lacks clear priorities and strategic guidance for implementation.


(B.) Promoting security and rule of law: Unsatisfactory

43. Progress in promoting security and rule of law has been unsatisfactory. For the
implementation of the reform program supported by the PSIB series and the
macroeconomic framework that underpinned them, an adequate security environment
was a critical element. In recognition of the critical role of security, the Government
adopted a special Millennium Development Goal on enhancing security. While progress
has been made in rebuilding state institutions and stimulating economic growth in Kabul
and some other cities, adverse security conditions have prevented such progress in other
regions. As a result, the reconstruction process has been affected and the GOA has
difficulties imposing its presence outside of Kabul and exerting countrywide leadership.
Inadequate security remains the main country risk to achieving key national goals for
economic growth, political normalization and social development. The security challenge
has been compounded by the lack of overall coordination between military/political and
development actors. While important assistance is delivered through the U.S. and
International Security Assistance Force­led Provincial Reconstruction Teams this
resulted in a "provincialization" of aid and potentially pulled resources away from
national programs. An important lesson for the World Bank in this regard is that
measures are needed to ensure that these military-led development efforts support more
national programs, like the National Solidarity Program, Rural Access Roads and
Irrigation Rehabilitation.

44. Over the period of PSIB II insecurity did not present a strategic threat to the
government, but since the end of 2006 and during the last PSIB operation the
security situation continued to deteriorate. The government followed a Security
Sector Reform (SSR) strategy, which included the build up and training of the ANA, the
ANP and the implementation of the DDR process. The DDR initiative was completed in
June 2006 and a follow-up program initiated (the Disbandment of Illegal Armed Groups
Program). The implementation of the SSR framework led in some regions to an improved
security situation. However, in the south and east where anti-Government and narcotics
elements were more active, security started to deteriorate. While the capacity of the
ANA increased, the police and justice system remained weak; lack of security still
hindered private investment, reconstruction, and especially public service delivery
outside Kabul.         Sources of insecurity are complex, including increased insurgency
(particularly in the southern and eastern regions), criminality, drug-related activity, and



7The PRSP and the Joint Staff Advisory Note (Islamic Republic of Afghanistan: Joint Staff Advisory Note of the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association (IDA) and the
IMF, May 15, 2008 [Report No. 43431-AF]) were discussed by the IMF Board on June 2, 2008 and IDA Board on June
3, 2008.




                                                         17

terrorism (including explosions and suicide bombings in urban areas). Managing the
fiscal costs of increasing security expenditures also became more challenging.
Implementing the National Drug Control Strategy remained difficult, exacerbated by the
increase in opium poppy cultivation in 2006 and 2007. Finally, reform of the justice
system continued to suffer from problems in the institutional set-up, such as the lack of
independence of judges and concentration of power and functions in the Supreme Court.
The overall legal framework remained inadequate as did the number and quality of
correctional facilities. There is a lack of human capacity in criminal justice and internal
security forces are perceived as unreliable and corrupt.


(C.) Maintaining macroeconomic stability: Satisfactory

45. Measures to maintain macroeconomic stability have achieved satisfactory
outcomes. Over the course of the PSIB series the GOA successfully maintained a stable
macroeconomic framework as evidenced by the successful completion of seven quarterly
reviews under the IMF Staff-Monitored Program (SMP), which was initiated in March
2004 and the successful completion of four reviews under the IMF PRGF between June
2006 and July 2008.       During PSIB II growth recovered to 16 percent in 2005/06,
following a rebound in agricultural production due to better precipitation and growth
prospects remained good. Inflation eased off and the nominal exchange rate remained
stable. In support of the Government's objective to strengthen the budget process, PSIB
II had as important triggers the adoption of the PFEM Law and the MTFF. In June 2005,
the Public Finance and Expenditure Management (PFEM) Law was gazetted and a Fiscal
Policy Unit created in the MOF. In October 2005, the Government adopted an MTFF
that outlined the key fiscal policies for the next three years. Progress in increasing
revenues was an important trigger for PSIB III. Revenues rose in 2006/07 to 7.5 percent
of GDP, increasing in that year by 28 percent over 2005/06. This was due to a number of
measures taken in 2005/06: road tolls were introduced, new tax manual and associated
forms were made available, and an appeal system was installed. The import tariff
structure was reformed, introducing two higher tariff bands on certain goods, partly in
lieu of excises. The Large Taxpayer Office was further strengthened and the Automated
System for Customs Data, ASYCUDA, was installed on the country's two major transit
routes.

46. During the last quarter before PSIB III closed initial gains from the reform
efforts outlined in this ICR became increasingly under threat due to a variety of
factors. While the revenue performance during the first half of 2007/08 was satisfactory,
revenue collection in the third quarter fell somewhat short of the IMF PRGF indicative
target for December 2007; the third and fourth review of the PRGF were completed
successfully by a waiver for this performance criterion. Nevertheless, the revised annual
GDP growth and revenue ratio still fulfilled the target set for the PSIB series and were in
2007/08 comfortably above the set target of 8 percent and 6 percent respectively.


(D.) Strengthening public administration and fiscal management: Satisfactory

47. Under PSIB II progress in the area of PFM was satisfactory, but for public
administration reform progress was uneven, albeit positive. Prior actions under PSIB



                                             18

II continued to support progress in establishing a legal framework for PAR, in particular
the gazetting of the Civil Service Law (adopted by Cabinet in August 2005). The
enactment of the Civil Servants (Employee) Law in June 2008 indeed strengthened the
overall legal framework for civil service management in Afghanistan and included
provisions to implement a new pay and grading structure across the non-military civil
service. However, in the PRR implementation weaknesses emerged and the program
slowed down. There were questions in regard to the sustainability, both fiscal and
political given the asymmetric approach and slow implementation; the effectiveness in
restructuring ministries and attracting skilled staff; and governance in recruitment
processes. In retrospect, the asymmetrical nature of the program was more in line with
developed countries' practices, where discipline is more ingrained. The Government in
2005 adopted a revised PAR strategy, to shift the focus away from previous asymmetric
and department-centered reforms toward comprehensive reforms involving whole
ministries.     Throughout PSIB III, there was continued progress in merit-based
recruitment, and the Independent Appointment Board (IAB) has appointed since its
inception in September 2003, 2,304 candidates for senior grade 2 and above and
monitored 13,461 appointments at grade 3 and below. However, some vulnerabilities of
the IAB's conduct of merit-based recruitment were identified in early 2007, and a
progress review was made in November 2007, reflecting concerns about the technical
capacity of the IAB and the level of political interference in new appointments to the IAB.

48. Under PSIB II and III, achievements in PFM continued to build the credibility
of the budget as a policy instrument. Progress has been satisfactory, particularly in
budget execution elements of control, accounting, reporting and audit as evidenced by the
improvements for several indicators in the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment between June 2005 and December 2007. Development
budget execution ­a key outcome indicator-- reached 56 percent in 2006/07 over-
fulfilling the target of 50 percent. There was a significant improvement in the total ratio
of total expenditures eligible for reimbursement under the ARTF recurrent cost window
over the years. This was despite the fact that Monitoring & Evaluation of the eligibility
ratios became over the lifetime of the PSIB series much more stringent. PSIB also
supported the adoption and gazetting of the PFEM Law in June 2005. These
achievements contributed to an increase in the implementation ratio of the budget and
tighter fiduciary standards. Monthly financial reports are posted on the MOF website,
and government's accounts have been audited by the Controller and Audit Office
(external auditor). For the first time, the 2005/06 budget was audited and the audit report
was sent to Parliament in a timely manner. As another prior action for PSIB II, the
Procurement Law was enacted in 2005. With the establishment of a modern Procurement
Law, reforms in procurement picked up with a capacity development program throughout
Government, and a system to monitor and disclose procurement activities. In November
2006, the centralized Procurement Policy Unit received ISO 9001 certification.

49. Despite the major improvements achieved under the PISB II and III, most of the
development aid for Afghanistan is still off-budget. Also, a large share of civil
servants is paid with donors funds through the core budget. This high level of aid
dependency, combined with a lack of government control over large donor resources
remain key issues. While this does not diminish the successes of the PSIB series, it does
put those successes in perspective.


                                              19

50. While the PISBs saw immense progress in PFM, there remain concerns about
the sustainability of some of these achievements. After closing of the program series
in July 2008 a Procurement Law which overrode the 2005 Law was enacted, with mixed
implications. Proposed amendments made an upward revision of the threshold limits for
first grade award authorities, allowing faster processing of procurement documentation.
But several revised Articles caused concern, in particular in regard to low value
procurement. This diluted the transparency of the procurement process and together with
other changes weakened the fiduciary environment, including compromising the
eligibility of government's Operation & Maintenance expenditures for reimbursement
from the ARTF recurrent cost window. The GOA committed to address these concerns
swiftly.


(E.) Enhancing human development: Satisfactory

51. Progress in the health and education sector has continued through PSIB II and
PSIB III and can be assessed as significant. In the health sector the increased Basic
Package of Health Services (BPHS) coverage became one of the success stories for the
government, and led to increased use of services, progress in outputs that start to be
reflected in improved outcome indicators.         Latest available data from the Health
Management Information System indicates that skilled birth attendance increased from 3
percent in 2003/04 to 37% in 2007/08, DPT3 vaccination coverage increased from 21 to
over 90 percent and out-patient visits reached nearly one per year. The third-party quality
assessment indicated that patient satisfaction is high and overall perceived quality of care
is at 75 percent (with convenience to travel to facility rated lowest). In education
progress was also substantial and new leadership in this sector led to the development of
a comprehensive five-year strategic plan. Also, there has been remarkable progress in
increasing rates of female participation both among students and teachers. In 2003, there
were 4 million children in school (about 25% were girls) and 3,053 female teachers. In
2007/08, there were 5.79 million children in school (34.9% of these are girls) and 30,460
female teachers (females representing now 28% of the teaching force).

52. There are national programs, which served effectively and successfully as socio-
economic programs supporting communities, households and individuals. But apart
from the public pension program for survivors of martyrs and combat-related disabled,
existing programs do not target well the poorest and vulnerable who are left largely to
humanitarian assistance. The government started important diagnostic work in this area,
completing the 2005 NRVA and preparing in March 2007, with IDA support, the first
poverty diagnostic (a trigger for PSIB III). Since then, the CSO launched and completed
the much improved NRVA 2007/08 with IDA support.


(F.) Promoting private sector development: Moderately unsatisfactory

53. Progress in private sector development stagnated because reforms in this area
lacked strong government ownership and commitment. PSIB II and III supported
improvements in the legal and regulatory framework for establishing, operating, and
ceasing business organizations. Although some key business organization laws became
law through Presidential Decree on January 18, 2007 (and are thus in force), they still



                                             20

awaited ratification from Parliament and implementation by the time of closure of the
operation. The situation regarding several DAB sponsored laws remained largely
unresolved. In the non-banking financial sector, amendments to the Insurance Law have
been gazetted, regulations drafted, and a new Insurance Committee was established as
part of the MOF. The limited progress in this area is reflected in the consistently low
Doing Business indicators for Afghanistan. Afghanistan remained at or near the bottom
for each indicator over the last three years. Between the Doing Business Reports of 2007
and 2008 there was only one reform reported and Afghanistan slid by 3 ranks in the
overall rating. Between the Doing Business Reports of 2008 and 2009 no new reforms
were reported and Afghanistan ranked 162nd place out of 181 countries. Overall the
private sector remains impeded by bureaucratic red-tape and a lack of transparent rules.
This is aggravated by high perception of corruption, as demonstrated in the low ranking
of Afghanistan in the Transparency International ratings: Afghanistan dropped from
117th out of 159 countries surveyed in 2005 to 172nd of 180 countries in 2007 and
subsequently to 176th out of 180 countries in 2008 (i.e. fifth-worst in the world).

54. The financial sector is still lacking a comprehensive strategy to reduce key
vulnerabilities and to extend financial intermediation. There has been considerable
effort to rebuild the financial sector in terms of its institutional and legal framework,
which has led to an increased number of private commercial banks operating in
Afghanistan and an increase in the amount of loans and deposits. However, there has
been a weak banking supervision capacity in the Central Bank, and underdeveloped
financial infrastructure, which continues to exposes the banking sector to potential
systemic risks.    Although there was some progress in building the Central Bank
supervision capacity the rapid growth of the banking system and range of available
banking services poses still considerable challenges for the supervisory authority,
especially in enforcement. A weak financial sector still remains one of the major binding
constraints to private sector development in Afghanistan. Currently, the sector does not
meet the financial needs of industries and individuals. Most businesses still have neither
bank accounts nor access to formal financial services, but rely on the informal fund
transfer system, hawala. In the most recent Doing Business (2009) rankings for "Getting
Credit", a measure of credit information sharing and legal rights of borrowers and lenders,
Afghanistan ranked 178th out of 181 countries. There are two critical challenges which
remain: (i) ensuring that the financial regulator, i.e., Central Bank has the proper
institutional capacity to adequately carry out its core functions, especially supervision of
a rapidly growing banking sector and thereby properly manage systemic risk issues; and
(ii) finding ways of establishing effective property rights and information that the
financial sector can rely on for the purposes of extending credit.

55. Divestment of SOEs was progressing satisfactory despite controversial public
and political debates, thanks to a very energetic team in the MOF. As of March 2008,
the Cabinet approved 19 divestiture proposals, leading to successful auctions of movable
and immovable SOE and former banks assets. Assets in the amount of US$9.6 million
were transferred to the private sector. Of the total estimated 14,000 SOE employees,
1,050 have obtained severance payments and 208 received re-training. Measures to
improve the financial reporting of SOEs were initiated at the end of PSIB III. The SOE
department established a Financial Monitoring Section and started to review financial
reporting practices. It confirmed that only few SOEs submitted balance sheets for


                                             21

2005/06 and the existing reporting format does not provide enough substance for
privatization or taxation, and contains no financial information or any annual plan, report
or audit.

56. Supported reforms in the power sector increased the average tariff to bring it
closer to the medium-term cost of supply, but progress in improving governance in
this sector was slow. In 2006, external assistance to procure fuel for power generation in
Kabul and three other smaller cities in the South was discontinued and the GOA had to
identify alternative financing. To reduce the fiscal burden of the high level of power tariff
subsidization (notably in Kabul, the country's largest demand center), it increased the
electricity tariffs in Kabul effective September 2006. As indicated in the Program
Document, given the weak statistical base, the poverty impact of the tariff increase is
difficult to assess. Nevertheless, this ICR attempted an impact assessment with newly
available data from the NRVA 2007 (Annex 2. Beneficiary Survey Results). Evidence
from household survey data analysis concludes that electricity tariff increase would have
little negative impacts on welfare of Afghan households. A key first step to improve
governance in the sector is the corporatization the power utility and progress was made in
2007/08 with support from IDA's Power Rehabilitation Project. However, by the closure
of the operation regular reporting by the utility was still pending.


3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: Satisfactory for both PSIB II and PSIB III.

57. Achievements in the key areas of the reform program supported by PSIB II and
III were satisfactory. Macroeconomic stability was attained and progress in the focus
areas of fiscal management and public administration was satisfactory. While the
government was successful in developing its national development strategy, the
implementation in the area of security and rule of law was unsuccessful. However, since
improvement in the area of human development was satisfactory, as underpinned by
recent new data sources, it appears that service delivery improvements are not the
predominant factor in security enhancement. Similarly, other key components of the
PSIB operations, PAR and PFM, did not have the desired impact on the security situation.
Overall the program and its outcome indicator framework had five main cross-cutting
areas of focus. The following is a summary of main achievements of PSIB II and III in
these five areas:

58. First, the PSIBs supported successfully improvements in the legal framework.
These included: the PEFM Law, Procurement Law, Civil Service and Civil Servant Law,
the key Business Organization Laws, and regulations for several of these and other laws.
All of the legislative pieces were signed into law over the course of the series and
represented prior actions or triggers for the operation. The PEFM Law established (i) a
sound budget preparation framework, with comprehensive and transparent documentation,
(ii) requirements for accounting and regular reporting in line with international standards,
and (iii) an independent review of the annual financial statements for presentation to the
National Assembly. The Procurement Law established (i) transparent and competitive
procurement procedures with contestable mechanisms based on objective and verifiable
selection and award criteria and (ii) the responsibilities of government officials involved


                                              22

in procurement.     The Civil Service Law and Civil Servant Law established (i) the
principle of open competition and merit for all civil service appointments; (ii) the
IARCSC, including independent appointment and appeal boards); (iii) the Administrative
Reform Secretariat as the focal point for public administration reform; (iv) detailed terms
of references for civil servants; (v) the Pay & Grading framework of the new civil
service; and (vi) the base for a number of regulations and procedures to be developed
(including human resource regulations and appointments procedures). The business
organization laws (the Partnership and Corporation Laws) and two complementary laws
(the Arbitration and Mediation Law) laid out important rules for (i) starting a business
and obtaining licenses; (ii) closing a business; and (ii) protecting investors. These legal
changes have been gazetted, a prerequisite for implementation and they were critical for
the institution building agenda supported by the PSIB series.

59. Second, the PSIBs supported effectively improvements in budget management
processes. Budget preparation improved and became timelier over the PSIB series. For
example, the adoption by Cabinet of the 2004/05 and 2007/08 budgets were prior actions
for PSIB I and PSIB III respectively. The program also supported the institutionalization
of the mid-year review as a mechanism to transparently adjust allocations based on
performance and inform the following year's budget - a prior action for PSIB II and the
2005/06 budget. The PSIBs prior actions in particular supported the introduction and
gradual refinement of a MTFF, which includes (i) a fiscal table with 4-year projections of
revenues, expenditures, fiscal deficit and sources of financing, and (ii) a description of
the policy actions which sustain the projections. On the execution side, the program
supported a number of improvements that have led to an increase in fiduciary standards
(i.e. trigger on eligible expenditures for ARTF reimbursement). This includes the
achievement of regular annual audit reports of the core budgets financial statements by
the Control and Audit Office and their submission to the National Assembly within 6
months from the end of the fiscal year. Budget execution for the development budget (as
a proportion of the original budget) ­ a key outcome indicator - increased by the end of
the PSIB series to 55 percent (from 29 percent in 2004/05).

60. Third, the PSIBs supported with some success improvements in civil service
efficiency. Notably, over the course of PSIB the PRR reform plan was approved by an
inter-ministerial committee for a number of departments and, under this scheme, more
than 43,000 positions have been placed on an elevated pay scale. Under open and merit-
based recruitment for these positions the IAB made almost 2,304 merit-based
appointments for senior positions. Overall the size of civil service (excluding uniformed
employees and teachers) was successfully contained, and, as measured by another key
outcome indicator declined slightly yearly.

61. Fourth, the PSIBs supported the further development of a stronger monitoring
framework. Two important triggers for PSIB II were the development of information
systems in health and education, both of which were created. The PSIB series also
supported the analysis of the 2005 NRVA, based on which poverty diagnostics was
produced, and the preparation of an implementation plan to produce indicators to monitor
the ANDS. The monitoring framework of the PSIB series itself was successful in
focusing the GOA on critical outcome indicators of their reforms.




                                            23

62. At the closure of the PSIB series the main outcomes were achieved, in most cases
fulfilling the targets set for the program. The first PSIB was rated satisfactory in the
Simplified ICR. The second and third PSIB are rated satisfactory, recognizing the
difficult environment in which the GOA was overall successful in implementing this
comprehensive reform program as reflected in Table 3. By strengthening institutions, the
implementation of these reforms will in turn facilitate more efficient allocation of fiscal
resources to priority areas of the ANDS. The PSIB series, together with the ARTF and
IMF programs, has reinforced the importance and credibility of the budget and the MTFF.
Expenditure systems have been strengthened and some capacity has been built to
implement the budget and development programs in an accountable manner.


3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

63. Most supported reform steps of PISB II and III did not have any first-level
poverty impact. However, the PSIB supported NRVA 2005 analysis and preparation of
a poverty diagnosis, which is expected to lead in the future to better targeting
mechanisms for programs that seek to support the poor.                  Similarly, a stable
macroeconomic framework ultimately creates an environment that is more conductive to
poverty-reduction measures of other programs. Also, it is expected that the supported
formulation of the national development strategy, the ANDS and its future alignment
with the improved budget and MTFF will lead to better resource allocations that
potentially benefit the poor. Through the PSIB pillar on human development and the
private sector development indirectly poverty might have been affected positively.

64. One prior action ­the electricity tariff increase in Kabul in 2006 to reduce the
fiscal burden of the high level power tariff subsidization-- had the potential of a
direct adverse effect on the poor. At the time the potential distributional impact was
reviewed in the Program Document for PSIB III. It was concluded that while it was
difficult to assess the poverty impact due to the scarcity of data, it was likely to be limited
due to the severe supply constraint and low level of consumption that are typical for the
poor. This ICR (see section 3.5 and Annex 2. Beneficiary Survey Results) assessed the
potential poverty impact with an analysis of recently available data from the NRVA 2007.
Evidence from this household survey data analysis concludes that electricity tariff
increase is likely to have marginal if any negative impacts on welfare of Afghan
households.

65. The operation supported both women and men. In the PSIB pillar of public
administration reform, gender imbalance in the civil service was addressed with the
preparation of a policy note to enhance the role of women in the civil service. Monitoring
of the representation of women in the civil service is ongoing and is expected to lead to
the development of policy options that improve it. PSIB support in the areas of human
development most likely indirectly resulted in reduced gender imbalances in the
provision of health and education services.

66. Social development, including support for reform measures in health, education
and social protection were one pillar of the PSIB series. However, over time the focus
of the series shifted more to public financial management and public administration


                                             24

reform, since policy reforms in health and education were progressing satisfactorily
through the support of other IDA projects. PSIB I supported the health and education
sectors with a prior action on increased budget allocations for the BPHS and the Ministry
of Education. PSIB II supported the health sector with a prior action on the baseline
evaluation of health service delivery performance and the completion of the teacher
census.    Improvements in government budget process, medium-term fiscal planning
(MTFF) and accelerated implementation of the ANDS ­ all supported by the PSIB series
will indirectly foster social development goals.


(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

67. Institutional change and strengthening was at the heart of the PSIB series and is
considered substantial. In the aftermath of the armed conflict state-building became the
focus of the GOA's strategy and the focus of reform effort by many donors. The PSIB
operation was instrumental in establishing the legal framework for key institutions and
functions in public financial management, the financial and private sector. Key laws
supported by the PSIBs included the PFEM Law, Procurement Law, Banking Law,
Insurance Law, Corporation and Partnership Law. PSIB supported the establishment of
new structures in the MOF, notably the Budget Department, the Fiscal Policy Unit, the
Large Taxpayer Office, the Procurement Policy Unit and Internal Audit Unit and was
also closely engaged in improving capacity in these institutions. In the financial sector
the operation supported the rebuilding of the Central Bank and its supervision function
and the liquidation of non-licensed and the restructuring of the licensed state-owned
banks. PSIB also supported the liquidation of non-viable SOEs and the privatization of
other SOEs that had profitability potential.

68. The PSIB series laid some key building blocks for a modern civil service, notably
through building key PAR organizations (the Administrative Reform Secretariat, the
Independent Appointments Board), and adopting a modern Civil Service Law. However,
both the overall PAR program and the PRR have struggled with implementation
problems (Para 47). In the medium and long-term it remains to be seen how the further
PAR roll-out, including the Pay & Grading, will sustain leadership, mobilize the
necessary technical and financial resources, and lead to tangible impact in the delivery of
key government services. Implementation of pay and grading reform is challenging in
any environment, but in Afghanistan the risks of failure and corruption will be heightened
without high level political commitment across government, strong leadership of the
reform, and attention to implementation risks and strategies. There is concern about the
capacity of the GOA to implement this complex reform. The overall medium term fiscal
costs remain unclear in the context of ad hoc decisions on specific staffing groups and
uncertainty over staffing numbers, and the implementation strategy and capacity has yet
to be fully defined. All reform areas benefited from on-going technical assistance, e.g. in
the MOF Budget Department (UNDP and DFID), Central Bank (USAID), the IARCSC
(EC) etc. Developing in-house capacity remains a critical challenge for the government.
In this context there are concerns that these achievements will not be sustained without
large scale international technical assistance.

69. Reforms undertaken under the PSIB series did not have their full impact
because most development funds continue to flow off the budget. This remains a key


                                             25

development constraint for the GOA. It also underlines the need to intensify donor
coordination efforts. The World Bank continues to work closely with other donors,
emphasizing the importance of using the improved PFM systems and channeling more
aid through the budget.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

70. The PSIB series with its M&E framework and transparency-increasing
measures contributed to the beginning of a monitoring and evaluation culture in
Afghanistan. The broad supported reform program made the PSIB series a flagship
operation series for the GOA's MOF. This initiated much public discussion of some areas
covered by the PSIB, including the SOE reforms.

71. The pay and grading reform as part of the overall public administration reform
could be in the future reasonably associated with increased fiscal risk. It will remain
to be seen of the Pay and Grading implementation will be successful in: (i) moving the
human resource management system adequate to recruit, retain and motivate skilled staff,
and (ii) maintaining the cost of its implementation at a fiscally sustainable level.


3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

72. There has been no comprehensive beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop
on the PSIB series as such. However, in the one supported reform area of PSIB III ­the
increase in the electricity tariff--where adverse poverty and social impacts could follow,
the potential poverty impact was assessed with an analysis of recently available data from
the NRVA 2007 in this ICR (Annex             2. Beneficiary Survey Results), including a
comparison of the connection to grid supply for lower income quintiles in summer 2005
and spring 2007. The analysis focuses on impacts that could occur to households and
provides distributional analysis of electric tariff reform on well-being of various groups
of households in Afghanistan. The analysis shows that electricity tariff increase is likely
to have little impact on Afghan households, including the poor.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Ratings: Significant for both PSIB II and PSIB III.

73. The risk to the development outcomes of the PSIB II and III is rated as
significant. These risks are related mainly to factors outside of the operation, and
unrelated to its design or suitability for the Afghan environment.                Significant
uncertainties for the sustainability of the operation's development outcomes are expected
due to the prevailing volatile security situation. Also, the second round of democratic
elections (for Presidency and for Parliament) are expected in late 2009 and 2010,
respectively and might lead to a less certain political situation in the transition period.
The risk of the program was considered as significant for the first PSIB, due to the
substantial country risk (political, security and macroeconomic). The mitigation of these
risks was assessed to be outside of the scope of the program. For the simplified ICR of
PSIB I the World Bank OED proposed for the criterion on Sustainability the assessment



                                              26

of non-evaluable. It was expressed that at the time of the simplified ICR it was not
possible to assess whether benefits of this operation and of the program as a whole would
be sustainable. In particular, it was argued that sustainability remains uncertain as long as
security does not improve in all parts of the country. This assessment of uncertain
sustainability remains valid for the achievements under PSIB II and III, since the security
situation did not improve, and arguably deteriorated further since then. Thus, the main
country risks remained not only significant throughout the series, but might also threaten
the sustainability of the achieved results.

74. Uncertainties arising from the possibility of rolling back institutional and legal
changes remain significant. While PSIB II and III were successful in strengthening
government's core institutions and key functions, for example, progress in fiduciary
standards for government transactions and the achievement of a timely budget process,
the lack of capacity to implement comprehensive legal and institutional reforms is
apparent. Additionally, governance concerns remain prominent and it remained difficult
to assess the quality of institutional changes, given the high level of international
technical assistance still facilitates many reform efforts.       Nevertheless, government
ownership of key components of the PSIB reform program was high, with the
government successfully building a good track-record of reforms during the
implementation of the PSIB series. Also, it is important to note that fiduciary and
implementation risks for PSIB II and II were successfully mitigated partly due to reform
program supported by the series itself. These improvements contributed to higher
fiduciary standards for the entire IDA portfolio and the ARTF resources channeled
through the government core budget. These significant achievements contributed to the
high perceived benefits from the PSIB series.

75. During the information gathering for this ICR it was concluded that the
instrument of a programmatic support worked very well in the country's high risk
environment. While the program design allowed for flexibility and adjustments of the
reform program over the course of the series, the rolling support and continued dialogue
with the authorities on key areas of reform greatly facilitated success in many of the
covered areas. The instrument itself was seen by PSIB team members from different
sectors as the catalyst for policy reforms that would in turn enable progress in the areas of
Bank engagement, e.g. specific investment projects. In this regard the PSIB itself was
able - as a series - to sustain the risk to its development outcomes over several years and
the sustainability of the development outcomes would likely benefit from a successor
program and future development policy lending.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Ratings: Satisfactory for both PSIB II and PSIB III.

76. The quality at entry for the PSIB II and III is rated as satisfactory. The Bank
team collaborated closely with the MOF and actively involved the government in the
program design through regular policy dialogue and intensive missions. The team's


                                                27

consistent engagement and proactive role allowed a seamless progress from PSIB I to
PSIB II, despite the fact that there was a change in government leadership during the
PSIB I operation following elections. Over the course of PSIB II and PSIB III the
continued responsiveness and close involvement of the Bank team further strengthened
the good relationship with the government.

77. The design of the reform program was appropriate and provided the necessary
flexibility in the Afghan context. It was based on technically sound diagnostics. For
example, the first economic report on Afghanistan ­ Afghanistan: State Building,
Sustaining Growth, and Reducing Poverty, (2004) a Financial Sector Report (2004) and
numerous sectoral reports, such as the report: Mining as a Source of Growth (2003)
helped to guide policy choices put forward by the PSIB series. Over the course of the
series other Bank AAA like the Public Finance Management Review (combining a Public
Expenditure Review, a Country Financial Accountability Assessment and a Country
Procurement Assessment Review, 2006), and the Investment Climate Assessment (2005)
continued to provide technical background for the adjustments in the reform programs for
the PSIB series.

78. The Bank team properly assessed the risks and the timing of prior actions
included in the program, the fulfillment of which could be easily measured by the
government and the Bank team. In order to manage the high country risks the Bank
team did not seek permission for appraisal and negotiation for both operations until the
vast majority of prior actions were fulfilled. This allowed for high quality at entry and the
nearly seamless meeting of all prior actions for PSIB II and III and quick processing of
both operations. The PSIB series was well integrated with the Bank's strategy and
provided important synergies with other Bank operations in Afghanistan. The careful
alignment of the reform program with the GOA medium-term development vision and
strategy also contributed to the success of the series.


(b) Quality of Supervision
Ratings: Satisfactory for both PSIB II and PSIB III.

79. The quality of supervision is rated as satisfactory for the PSIB operations II and
III. One of the key factors contributing to the success of the series was the intensive and
frequent supervision of progress in the reform program. The team was able to establish a
very close working relationship with staff from all levels of the Afghan counterpart. The
M&E framework of the PSIB series was instrumental in assessing progress throughout
the series, but due to severe capacity constraints on the government side the monitoring
function largely remained on the side of the Bank team. However, team members
recognized that supervision presented an important opportunity to build capacity and
adjusted their work program accordingly.             The aide memoires and follow-up
communication with the government identified key issues and suggested actions clearly
and were regarded as important working documents by the counterparts. In the short
periods between the successive operations the Bank team remained in close contact with
the government and effectively continued supervision and the monitoring of progress in
key government reform areas.




                                              28

80. The Bank team closely coordination with the programs of other donors, in
particular with the IMF, DFID and ADB, who together with the Bank played a major role
in assisting the government to achieve tangible results in the area of public financial
management and public administration.           This successful collaboration established
excellent working relations between the teams of these organizations, which were
maintained, even when staff moved on. Based on the dialogue between these donors on
PSIB related reforms, a frank exchange of ideas and advice in regard to other topics
developed over time, which is still reflected in mutual peer-reviewing of projects.

81. Throughout the supervision period the Bank task team had representatives from
all featured sectors who were regularly consulted and provided in-depth sector
knowledge. When possible the team included experts based in the country office to draw
on their country familiarity and to allow for easy follow-up. Throughout the operation,
the team brought in additional internal or external expertise when necessary.
Unfortunately, due to security constraints, it was not possible for the team to travel
outside of Kabul over the course of the PSIB series and assess the situation in sectors
first-hand on the sub-national level.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory for both PSIB II and PSIB III.

82. The combined rating of satisfactory in ensuring quality at entry with a
satisfactory rating of the quality in supervision leads to the overall satisfactory
rating of the Bank performance for PSIB II and III. The design of the program
continued to adequately reflect the main priorities of the government's development
vision and strategy and was anchored in the Bank's country strategy and its main
underlying objective to build state capacity.       Collaboration with other donors was
exceptional, in particular in regard to public finance reforms and served the country's
need for improved donor coordination in this area. The main stronghold of the PSIB II
and III was its good integration into the Bank investment and AAA portfolio. This
enabled it to complement other Bank activities with a very valuable channel of
communication with the government on policy level issues. Another decisive contributor
to the success of the series was the deep engagement of an enthusiastic team, which
resulted in them being very proactive and making use of the flexibility of the instrument
when it was needed.


5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory for both PSIB II and PSIB III.

83. The performance of the GOA was moderately satisfactory. Overall the PSIB
series was considered a flagship operation for the Afghan government with much
attention focused on it. But issues of continuity, leadership, and capacity remained,
despite the progress in meeting important prior actions and triggers. In particular, towards
the closure of the operation signs of weakening reform ownership appeared. The
formulation of economic policy became more fragmented. This raises questions of
sustainability for the reform outcomes achieved up to date. On the macroeconomic side,


                                              29

the government steadily implemented the IMF SMP and following that completed three
reviews of the IMF PRGF program successfully. However, shortly after the PSIB series
ended (in July 2008) the IMF PRGF program started to become under pressure, mainly
due to a deteriorating revenue performance in customs. The reasons here were slower
than expected administrative reforms and enforcement deficits.

84. The capacity of the government remained low throughout the series and
remained heavily dependent on international technical assistance. Issues of limited
implementation capacity were in particular reflected in the minor delays that occurred in
the fulfillment of triggers that relied on actions to taken by government institutions other
than the main implementation agency, the MOF, e.g. in the pillar of private sector
development. While the M&E capacity of the government improved over the course of
the series, it altogether remained weak and the government had to a large extend delegate
this function to the World Bank task team.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory for both PSIB II and PSIB III.

85. The performance of the implementing agency, the MOF was satisfactory. The
particular staff delegated as the focal point for the PSIB operations, to participate in the
design and implementation of the program had adequate seniority, qualification and
dedication. Over the period of engagement on the PSIB series the capacity at the
implementation agency slowly increased and slightly consolidated on many
administrative levels. This was also reflected in the increased ownership of the M&E
framework over the course of the series. The overall success of the PSIB series is
attributable to the strong commitment of the Minister of Finance and his core team. The
Ministers keen interest to keep the program on track ultimately provided the necessary
leadership to push ahead many difficult reform issues. He and his team were diligent in
taking responsibility for advancing reforms in many areas that were outside his
immediate influence realm, but that were part of the overall supported reform program.
Since one main objective of the PSIB series was improvements in fiduciary standards and
public financial management many reforms supported by the series led to tangible
improvements in the main functions of the implementation agency itself. These reforms
turned out to be in regard to state and institution building the most successful of the PSIB
series. Over the course of the series it is fair to say that the MOF -in view of its capacity
and level of institutional operation-- became a model ministry within the Afghans
government.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory for both PSIB II and PSIB III.

86. The overall Borrower's performance is assessed as satisfactory.               The PSIB
operations and its supported reforms were a central focus of the government and were
given particular attention as part of the Bank's portfolio. Signs of waning government
ownership and commitment appeared only towards the closure of the operation and some
of its result materialized after the program closed. Nevertheless, the ICR considered this
an important indication for the possible sustainability of the results achieved under the
PSIB series. Over most of the time covered by the PSIB II and III the performance of the


                                              30

implementation agency was satisfactory. The MOF as the direct counterpart and
implementation agent was the main driver of the reform process and the Minister and his
team were instrumental in guaranteeing the success of the series. His leadership and
commitment allowed for significant improvements in the public finance framework of the
country, which provides the ARTF donors with assurance to channel large resources
through the government's core budget. While the overall capacity of the government
remained weak and highly dependent on international technical assistance, areas within
the MOF emerged, e.g. revenue, budget, treasury, and audit, where considerable national
capacity was established. The modeling of the MOF into a good practice ministry
contributed to its ability to attract qualified and motivated staff.


6. Lessons Learned

87. For the PSIB II and III, the Bank team made good use of both facets of the
development policy instrument. It followed through with important reform steps in
core state-building areas, such as PFM, PAR, etc., but also used the flexibility of the
instrument to condense and adjust the focus of each series based on the political realities.
For example, health and education initially played a more central role, but over the course
of the series additional policy level support was deemed not necessary due to strong
emerging ministerial leadership. On the other hand, acknowledging the multiple ­ and
sometimes overwhelming-- challenges for creating a better business environment
combined with its political inertia in this area, the private sector development reform
agenda was narrowed down and focused more on the regulatory framework and ring-
fencing fiscal liabilities.

88. The PSIB's experience emphasized the opportunity to maximize synergies with
other Bank instruments and other donor programs. In particular, the PSIB series was
successful in leveraging important policy dialogue which complemented Bank's
investment projects. The series benefited from including sector specialists in the task
team at all stages of the operations. As described in other sections, the PSIB design built
very much on combined efforts with the Bank's analytical work and investment
operations, as well as with the IMF's PRGF, the ADB's program loans, DFID's technical
assistance and the ARTF. This was a key ingredient to the success of the series. However,
the Bank will need to continue to work closely with other donors to emphasize the
importance of using the improved government PFM systems for channeling more aid
through the budget.

89. It is vital to carefully assess the political economy in each reform area as well as
ground development policy lending in high quality AAA work. While the PSIB series
was underpinned by a strong program of analytical work, the political environment of
individual reform areas was initially underestimated and turned out to be more complex,
e.g. PAR and private sector development.

90. The PSIB series succeeded in strengthening institution building and important
parts of the legal regulatory framework, but capacity development will be a long-
term undertaking. While the PSIBs were successful in supporting the enactment of key
laws and the creation of some modern organizational structures in the government
administration these fundamental institutional changes need time to establish them and to


                                                31

show desired impacts. In regard to PAR or civil service reform implementation,
expectations within development lending operations have to be managed cautiously. One
important lesson cited by the Afghan authorities is that the policy reforms in form of
legislative activities did not yet produce expected outcomes. It appears that capacity
constraints led to delays in the implementation of some of these laws. Careful planning
should realistically anticipate time lags while designing future reform programs and
development lending operations in order to avoid disappointment in progress and lack of
results on the ground. In a low-capacity environment like Afghanistan development
policy lending should exert a high level of reform prioritization to continuously capture
the focus of the government on key reform areas.

91. The outcomes for the PSIB series confirmed that a results-based approach can
work in a conflict-ridden and low-capacity environment. As mentioned above,
however, it needs to be acknowledged that low capacity acts as a barrier to the best
designed programs and can often lead to implementation delays. In regard to program
monitoring and evaluation, the government policy matrix and the M&E framework need
to be straightforward and reflect the limited capacity endowment in these countries. It
was expressed that the PSIB government policy matrix was too complex and at times
confused the government as to which were priority areas and actions as compared to just
monitored reform milestones in the overall reform program. A more simplified matrix
and M&E framework, preferably combined, would seem more adequate for future
operations.

                  Electricity tariff reform and poverty in Afghanistan

Reform in Afghanistan's electricity sector is an important policy that GOA took to
improve efficiency, eliminate economic distortion in its power sector; and prioritizing
public spending. It also resulted in an increase in electricity tariff, supported by a prior
action of PSIB III. Despite the benefit of the reform, poverty and social impacts could
follow. This note focuses on impacts that could occur to households and provides
distributional analysis of electric tariff reform on well-being of various groups of
households in Afghanistan.

The analysis shows that electricity tariff increase is likely to have little impact on Afghan
households. Survey data shows that few households have electricity connection, and they
tend to be in urban areas, which tend to be better off than their rural counter parts. Some
concerns could be said about the less well off population in urban areas, who may be
affected. Investigating the energy consumption pattern in urban areas reveals that, even in
urban areas where connection rate is high, either rich or poor households do not use much
electricity. Households in urban Afghanistan mainly use electricity for lighting purposes
and rarely for other purposes such as cooking or heating. Data from 2005 reported that
two-thirds of urban households use electricity as their main source of lighting, while only
16 percent use it as their main source of cooking. Since the amount of energy used for
lighting is small, households generally spend a very small fraction of their income on
electricity.

Due to data limitation, this note only attempts to analyze the likely groups that would be
affected by the reform and extent that it may affect these groups. This note also focuses
on the likely direction of the impacts, not on the magnitude. In an ideal situation, one
would have a specialized data that allow us to track aspects of energy use and well as
welfare of households, both before and after the tariff increase. In the absence of recent
household data, the exercise extrapolates from the available evidence, rather than
measures the impact of changing prices on consumption and welfare.

The note is organized as follows. First, it provides background information on tariff
increase structure, and on data and methodology of the analysis. The analysis, then, starts
with the identification of likely affected groups, by comparing access and consumption.
We then compare welfare of each group to discern the distributional impact, and
conclude the analysis.

Structure of electricity tariff increase
During the PSIB series, the electricity tariff was increased (as a prior action) in urban
areas. In the North, electricity is purchased from abroad at cost-recovery prices and
diesel-based tariffs can be found. On February 26, 2007 prices were increased in Balkh
province as shown in the table. Kabul has a formal tariff system based on hydropower. In
Kabul, the electricity tariff was increased as effective from September 23, 2006. Structure
of former and current tariffs is presented in Table A.1.

Data sources and methodology
This note attempts to assess effects of electricity tariff increases ­ ones that have already
occurred­ on households particularly the poor households, using data from household
surveys.       Tariff increase could affect households in two dimensions: increase in
expenditures by households and reduction of electricity consumption. It is important to
realize that the data reflects consumption patterns of households before the electricity
tariff increases. Furthermore, the note will not account for the indirect effects of
electricity tariff, if any, on the prices of other goods. In spite of all the caveats outlined,
this exercise lends useful insights into the nature and distribution of impact of electricity
tariff increases.

The NRVA 2005 is the appropriate data because it provides estimates of access, usage,
and expenditures on energy and electricity, as well as ranking of households by a widely
accepted welfare measure (per capita consumption expenditure). Moreover, the NRVA
2005 has large sample size, which allows us to disaggregate indicators by relevant
groups. In order to provide a crude trend in electricity connection before an after the
reform, this study is also supplemented with the NRVA spring 2007, a small household
survey conducted during the spring of 2007.8




8The 2007 survey was a much smaller survey with a few questions on energy consumption and electricity connection.
The analysis of trend only focuses on the electricity connection, which is less likely to change because of seasonality
because the 2007 survey was conducted in spring, around April and May of 2007The smaller sample size prevents us to
disaggregate the results in the same manner as the analysis using NRVA 2005.

Identification of affected groups
We identify groups that are likely to be affected by the electricity reform by looking at
access    and     consumption           pattern       of    electricity.       Table 2: Households connected
Households that are connected to electricity are most                          to public grid in 2005 (%)

power. We, then focus on electricity use. Although we                           Urban                         66

lighting and other purposes.

Overall, the potential impact is expected to be relatively low because few people use
electricity.   The NRVA 2005 data (Table A.2) reveals that only 14 percent of all
households in Afghanistan have access to grid electricity, thus, only a small fraction of
households in Afghanistan are likely to be affected by this reform. Electricity tariff hike
would affect urban population more than rural. Electricity connection is markedly higher
in urban than in rural areas. Percentage of households with grid connection is at 59
percent in Kabul city and as high as 74 percent in other urban areas outside Kabul.9

Affected groups and welfare distribution
The       affected         groups--urban
dwellers--are generally not poor.                    Table A.3: Grid connection by consumption quintiles

Even among poor households in urban areas, many are connected to grid electricity.
Table A.3 shows percentage of grid connection across consumption quintile by different
areas. Connection to grid is widespread across income distribution in urban areas and the
distribution is quite even in Kabul city. The electricity tariff increase may also affect the
urban poor. Examining the usage of electricity and energy further explain the extent of
impacts.




9Those who do not connect to grid, particularly in urban areas, may use electricity from other sources such as private
or community generators.

Extent of impact: Usage of electricity
Looking at electricity expenditure reveals the extent of potential effects of electricity
tariff increase on households. We will look at the role of electricity in household
functions such as lighting, cooking, and heating. The data only capture major usages of
energy but not others such as electrical appliances. Note that this electricity expenditure
includes all sources of electricity, not just from public grid.

Table A.4 shows that even with high level of connectivity, urban households rely on
electricity mainly for lighting. About 65 percent of urban households use electricity as the
main source of lighting, but usage in other functions such as cooking or heating is
relatively low. This results in small electricity expenditure, even among urban households.
Overall, electricity expenditure accounts for 3% in Kabul city and 4% in other urban
areas. The data also shows that households spend far more money on other types of
energy.

To gauge the impact of a rise in electricity tariff on the urban poor, it is relevant to focus
on the bottom two quintiles of the population. NRVA 2005 data reveals that the urban
poor, on average, incur very little expenditure on electricity. Poor households in urban
areas rarely use electricity in activities beyond lighting and spend similar fraction of their
expenditure on electricity as their better off peers in urban areas. In conjunction with
larger households size among the poor10, effective electricity expenditure per person is
even lower among the poor. Therefore, the poor do not appear to bear overwhelming
burden from the tariff increase.




10In urban areas, the NRVA 2005 shows that the average household size of the poor is about 8 persons per household,
while non-poor household tend to have about 6.5 persons.

bottom three quintiles households showed increasing trends in grid connection. It should
be noted that the trend shown here is crude; it does not account for usage from different
season nor if households limit their electricity consumption due to higher tariff.

Conclusion
Evidence from household survey data analysis concludes that electricity tariff increase
would have little negative impacts on welfare of Afghan households. The NRVA 2005
data shows that few households have electricity connection, mostly in urban areas which
tend to be better off to begin with. Analyzing consumption pattern in urban areas reveals
that, even in urban areas where connection rate is high, neither rich nor poor households
use much electricity. Electricity is mainly used for lighting; therefore, households
generally spend a very small fraction of their income on electricity. The trends also show
that tariff increase did not seem to discourage connection to grid supply.

This note provides a short and simple analysis of the effects of tariff increases. The
method and depth is suitable for the available data. More complex studies can be done
when we have more recent data. The ongoing NRVA 2007/08 is a likely source of data
that can be used to rigorously investigate impact of electricity tariff increase due to the
reform. It will allow comparison of elasticity and energy use during the same season.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


The following is a summary of the implementation Completion Report prepared by the
Government of Afghanistan for the PSIB II and III. (The full report is attached.)

I. Borrowers Summary of the PSIB II and III program

(1)     Assessment of the PSIB II, III Objectives, Design, Implementation and
Operational Experience

The overall objective of the PSIB II was to continue deepening the ongoing reforms in
the areas of public administration and fiscal management. This operation also supported:
(a) better allocation of the fiscal resources in the areas of human development (health and
education); and (b) private sector development (investment climate, financial sector and
privatization of the state-owned enterprises - SOEs).

The overall objective of the PSIB III was to ensure deepening of the reforms initiated by
the previous PSIB especially in the area of public administration and fiscal management
and implementation of the comprehensive sectoral reforms.

In the Government's view the PSIB II and III have been timely prepared and processed.
The design of both operations has been appropriate for the Afghan environment. In
general, the operations' startup and implementation was largely satisfactory and the
supervision has been conducted on regular basis.

(2)     Assessment of the main PSIB II, III Outcomes

The Borrower's ICR summarizes in detail the progress in the implementation of prior
actions, triggers and outcome indicators during PSIB II and III for all pillars and then
discusses progress in the two broad areas of PSIB reform support: Public Financial
Management and Institution Building.

Throughout the period of implementation of the PSIB II, III (2005-2007) the Government
has maintained macroeconomic stability. The fiscal sector has undergone number of
reforms which led to increased domestic revenues and improved budget execution.
Rapid development of the banking sector has improved the business environment for
private sector development. Export has recorded robust growth. Afghanistan's debt
situation has improved. All prior actions for PSIB II and III were met and most triggers
were fulfilled as specified.

(i) Public Financial Management
The World Bank has recently completed the assessment of the GoA's performance in
implementation of the public finance management reforms (i.e. the Public Financial



                                               42

Management Performance Assessment, PEFA), which was the most important part of the
PSIB operations.

The key findings from this latest PEFA have confirmed significant improvements that the
Government of Afghanistan has achieved between June 2005 and December 2007 which
coincides with the period of implementation of the PSIB II and III. Among 28
performance indicators, 18 indicators improved, 4 indicators deteriorated (out of which 2
relates to donors' performance) and 6 indicators remained unchanged.

(ii) Progress in Institution Building
The Afghan authorities are of the view that the most important benefits of the PSIB II and
III are related to strengthening the institutional reforms and capacity. This is particularly
relevant for the public finance management. Both operations also proved to be
instrumental in developing the institutional framework for public administration reform.
For the first time transparent and the merit based civil servant recruitments have taken
place together with reorganization of the payroll and developing the legal and
institutional framework for establishing a sustainable pension system.

Apart from strengthening the fiduciary procedures and financial reporting, procurement
has significantly benefited from the institutional reforms supported by the PSIB II and
III: key government bodies such as the Public Procurement Unit and the Procurement
Appeal and Review Committee Panel were established together with the Special
Procurement Commission (SPC) for large value contracts. Finally, the PSIB reforms
supported strengthening of the stability of the financial sector by increasing the capacity
of the DAB for the banking supervision.

(3)     Assessment of the Borrower's Own Performance

The implementation of the both PSIB operations (II, III) has been beneficiary to the
Government of Afghanistan. The Government has demonstrated commitment and
ownership in implementing the PSIB reforms. This has been evidenced by satisfactory
conclusions of the World Bank's PSIB appraisals, and noted in missions' Aid Memoires
during the PSIB supervision. The PSIB supported reforms contributed to maintaining
macroeconomic stability and strengthening the budget process as well as to improving
fiduciary standards, accountability, procurement, audit and transparency of the public
finance. Poverty statistical data have also been improved allowing for the first Afghan-
owned poverty diagnostics to be completed under the ANDS preparations.

Despite the progress, limited capacity of the Government has proved to be a major
constrain for implementation of more comprehensive reform program. This is the area
where future progress will be critical in order to be able to respond to the challenges of
implementing the ANDS. The current heavy reliance of ministries and government
agencies on international advisers and donor funded local employees will have to be
slowly decreased and phased-out by strengthening more the capacity of the civil servants.

In conclusion, progress has been achieved in most of the areas, albeit the advancements
in implementation of some reforms have been slow.

(4)     Assessment of the World Bank Performance

The Government is thankful to the World Bank for assisting it to prepare and implement
the PSIB series. The WB advice proved to be crucial for developing the comprehensive
reform program that has led to achieving progress in number of areas, particularly in
strengthening the budget process and increasing accountability and transparency of public
finances.

The regular supervision and other PSIB missions resulted in number of useful
recommendations. The Government is particularly thankful for the open and frank
discussions conducted with the WB PSIB team. They have deepened the Government's
knowledge about important macroeconomic reforms including strengthening of the fiscal
sustainability.

The Government finds it particularly very useful that the PSIB team has continuously
raised importance of the capacity building. Most of the PSIB reforms were designed to
improve institutional capacity in several critical areas. Furthermore, stressing the
importance of combining macroeconomic with structural reforms contributed to
improved overall business environment for private sector development starting from
strengthening the financial sector regulations to approving the key legislations.

The Government also finds it very useful that most of the PSIB reforms have been
coordinated with the other WB projects resulting in increased overall impact of the
general reform program.

(5)     Lessons Learned

As aforementioned, the implementation of the PSIB II and III series has benefited the
Government of Afghanistan in several important areas. By strengthening institution
building and providing budgetary resources both operations have allowed the
Government of Afghanistan to:

     Speed up implementation of its priority strategies;
     Increase revenues and based on it expenditures for health and education to ensure
        delivery of basic services to Afghan people, and
     Mobilize the donor assistance and strengthen the National Budget

The key lessons learned from the implementation of the PSIB operations are related to
raising awareness of the Government about the importance of maintaining
macroeconomic stability, increasing fiscal sustainability and improving the public finance
accountability for the future development of the country. Equally, key lesson learned
relate to the importance of improving public service delivery and speeding up structural

reforms to support private sector development for higher employment and poverty
reduction.

The Government is of the view that the implementation of the PSIB series have resulted
in strengthening its ownership in implementation of crucial reforms. Given the
importance of the WB budget support operations in supporting key reforms, the
Government regards that the future conditionality will continuously need to provide
balanced support to strengthening the institutional capacities and improving the service
delivery, especially at the sub-national level. The important lesson for the Afghan
authorities is that the policy reforms in form of legislative activities do not always
produce excepted outcomes, especially if they proved to be premature.

Finally, the Government acknowledges that greater progress could have been achieved in
implementing the public administration reform, strengthening the stability of financial
sector and improving the financial reporting of the SOEs. Given this, the Government
will be ready to implement follow-up actions through the Successor Program to the PSIB
series.

(6)     Proposed Arrangements for Future Operations

The Government concurs with the WB findings (PSIB III, Aid Memoir, April - May
2008) that the overall success and general progress under the previous PSIB operations
justifies continuation of the direct budget support to Afghanistan. Therefore, the
Government welcomes the intention of the WB to prepare Successor Program to the
PSIB series.

Given the need to consolidate progress that has been achieved in the past and the need to
deepen the public finance reform program, the Government supports the WB proposal to
prepare a smaller adjustment operation which would mainly support further strengthening
of the public finance management. With respect to this, the Government proposes to
focus on the following important areas:

      Private sector development;
      Custom and administration reforms;
      Deepening the public administration reform process in the MoF;
      Strengthening the mustofiats and revenue collection at the sub-national level; and
      Improving the anti-corruption and transparency measures particularly in the area
         of procurement and revenue mobilization.

The Government would like to emphasize the importance of continuing with extending
the WB budget support to Afghanistan. It will not only increase discretionary budgetary
funds, critical to implementation of the highest national development priorities from the
ANDS, it will also help to focus on the implementation of priority reforms and to
strengthen GoA's ownership of reforms. The Government finds it particularly useful to
keep the frank and open dialogue with the WB, which has been developed under the
implementation of the previous PSIB operations.
