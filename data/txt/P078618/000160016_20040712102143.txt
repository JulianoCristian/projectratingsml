                   AFGHANISTAN: PROGRAMDOCUMENT
             PROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT FORINSTITUTIONBUILDING

                                    CreditSummary

Borrower:           Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan

ImplementingAgency: MinistryofFinance (MoF)

Amount:             SDR 54.7 million (US$80 million equivalent)

Terms:              Standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace period

Objectiveand        The Credit of SDR 54.7 million (USSSO million equivalent) is the first o f a
Description:        series o f operations aimed at supporting the implementation o f the
                    Government o f Afghanistan's (GOA) medium-term development strategy
                    withinthe context o f a secure environment and a satisfactory macroeconomic
                    framework. The Government's development program, initially formulated in
                    the National Development Framework o f April 2002, has been reaffirmed
                    through the 2003/04 and 2004105 National Development Budgets and the
                    document Securing Afghanistan 's Future presented by the Transitional
                    Islamic State o f Afghanistan (TISA) to the international community at the
                    donors' conference held in Berlin in March 2004. The operations outlined
                    here take the form o f Programmatic Support for Institution Buildingof which
                    the current Credit (PSIB I)  i s the first. They will provide rolling support to
                    the Government's development strategy with each operation specifying a set
                    o f triggers which, when met, provide the basis for proceeding with the next
                    operation.
                    The overall objective o f this operation i s to deepen, broaden and sustain the
                    reforms underway in the areas o f public administration and fiscal
                    management. The operation builds on the reforms initiated under IDA'S
                    Emergency Public Administration Projects (EPAP) to improve GOA'Sown
                    fiduciary standards. Deepening and broadening these reforms i s critical for
                    poverty reduction assistance to be effective. The operation supports on-going
                    reforms to strengthen the budget process, increase the administrative capacity
                    o f line ministries and sub-national governments, develop revenue policy and
                    administration, and improve civil service effectiveness.
                    The operation also supports the implementation o freforms that lead to a more
                    efficient allocation o f fiscal resources in the areas of human development
                    (health, basic education and social protection) and private sector development
                    (investment climate, financial sector, and state-owned enterprises).      More
                    comprehensive, thematic reforms in human and private sector development
                    will require support through other instruments, including sectoral operations
                    and technical assistance.

Disbursement:       The proposed first Credit would be released in one tranche upon Credit
                    effectiveness.    All performance conditions would be met prior to Board
                    presentation.




                                            V

Benefits:         The Credits provide potential benefits which will all contribute to poverty
                  reduction. First, they strengthen public administration and fiscal management,
                  and support reforms to improve fiduciary standards. This will reduce the
                  implementation risks o f all projects including these Credits, and is likely to
                  translate into higher levels o f donors' assistance.      Second, they provide
                  resources to the central Govemment to deepen its reform program including
                  service delivery beyond Kabul.        This will benefit the whole population
                  including the poor. Third, they also support the implementation o f reforms
                  leadingto a more efficient allocation o f fiscal resources inthe areas of human
                  development and private sector development, which will reduce poverty.
Risks:            The Credits have significant country risks (political,             security and
                  macroeconomics) and implementation risks (fiduciary, budget execution and
                  the implementation o f reforms). A reversal in the political process set out in
                  the December 2001 Bonn agreements or a deterioration o f the security
                  situation constitutes the largest source o f risk for the operations. The recent
                  conclusion o f the Constitutional Loya Jirga has somewhat reduced this risk,
                  butthe elections, currently scheduled for the fall of2004, remain a significant
                  source o f uncertainty. The macroeconomic scenario i s also uncertain since
                  donors' assistance and the response o f the private sector are highly dependent
                  on the political and security situation.
                  The mitigation o f these country risks i s largely outside the scope o f the
                  project.   However, the Credits will allow the Government to deepen the
                  implementation o f its program beyond Kabul, which will contribute to the
                  nation-building effort and will somewhat mitigate political and security risks.
                  Strengthening the Central Government could increase tensions with regional
                  leaders, which could slow down the nation-buildingprocess.
                  The Credits also have implementation risks. First, fiduciary standards, while
                  improving, partially as the result o f this Credit, are not yet fully effective.
                  Budgetary systems and mechanisms, including tax administration and
                  collection, are still at a formative stage.         Second, there i s room for
                  improvement in the execution o f the Budget, and implementing the reform
                  program may be a challenge duringan election year.
                  To mitigate the risks o f implementation, prior actions and triggers focus on
                  areas for which the authorities, under the leadership o f the MoF, have
                  expressed ownership and have built a good track record o f reforms.
                  Continued Intemational Development Association (IDA) support through the
                  Emergency Public Administration Projects, together with the next Credit's
                  triggers, in the areas o f financial management, audit and procurement, will
                  also contribute to raising fiduciary standards.
                  The risk o f not undertakmg these operations also i s significant. First, IDA'S
                  support to the Government o f Afghanistan's development strategy under the
                  form o f PSIBs i s seen as a catalyst for other donors' continuing support,
                  including through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF).
                  Second, the resources provided by the PSIBs will allow the authorities to
                  deepen the reform program and quickly deliver services throughout the
                  country, thereby reducing the risk o f further deterioration o f the political and
                  security situations.

                              AFGHANISTAN: PROGRAMDOCUMENT
               PROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT FORINSTITUTIONBUILDING



                                        I. INTRODUCTION


1.    This document constitutes the Program Document for a proposed first Programmatic
Support for Institution Building (PSIB I)       to the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan (IRA) o f SDR
54.7 million (US$SO million equivalent). It i s the first o f a series o f PSIBs aimed at supporting
the implementation o f the Government o f Afghanistan's (GOA) medium-term development
strategy within the context o f a secure environment and a satisfactory macroeconomic
framework. Initially formulated in the National Development Framework PDF) o f April 2002,
GoA's development strategy was reaffirmed through the 2003104 and 2004/05 National
Development Budgets (NDB) and the document Securing Afghanistan 's Future presentedby the
TISA to the international community at the donors' conference held in Berlin in March 2004.'
The Credits will provide rolling support to the Govemment's development strategy with each
operation specifying a set o f triggers which, when met, provide the basis for proceeding with the
next operation. The overall objective o f these Credits is to deepen, broaden and sustain the
reforms underway in the areas o f public administration and fiscal management.                    The
implementation o f these reforms will in turn facilitate a more efficient allocation o f fiscal
resources to priority activities inthe areas o f human development and private sector development.
PSIB Ii s a one-tranche operation based on prior actions. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
related to this operation i s provided inthe Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) o f the World Bank
Group for Afghanistan (IDAR-2003-0022) discussed at the Board inApril 2003.

2.    The Program Document i s structured as follows. Section I1provides background about
Afghanistan's at the end o f the Taliban regime in late 2001, the achievements to date, and future
prospects. Section I11presents the GoA's development strategy. Section N describes the Bank`s
assistance to Afghanistan and Bank's coordination with other donors. Section V describes the
proposed Credit including the reform areas to be supportedby the Credits, the prior actions before
Board presentationfor PSIB I,       and the triggers for PSIB 11.



 11.      AFGHANISTAN'S DEVELOPMENT:BACKGROUND,ACHIEVEMENTS, AND
                                               PROSPECTS


A.     Background

3.    The starting point for Afghanistan's reconstruction at the end o f 2001 was unusually dire.
After two decades o f conflict, interspersed with earthquakes and droughts, the new Afghan
authorities confronted their task with largely defunct Government and financial institutions, weak
administrative capacity, and widespread destruction o f the country's infrastructure. Most social
services and Government systems had been brought to a complete standstill. A legacy o f poor
administration and lack o f human capital investment over the last twenty years had left
Afghanistan with an aging civil service whose skills and abilities had depreciated over time.
Afghanistan's        formal    financial sector   was non-operational.      Commercial banks were
dysfunctional, lackingbasic management systems, procedures, controls and s l l l e d personnel. By
the end of 2001, the conflict had resulted in the (i)         disruption o f domestic and international
payment systems, (ii)cessation o f formal lending within the country, (iii)cessation o f
institutional deposit-taking activities, and (iv) stoppage o f most international banking

relationships, particularly when the Taliban Govemment was subjected to intemational sanctions
and offshore bank accounts were frozen. Afghanistan's central bank - Da Afghanistan Bank
(DAB) no longer had the infrastructure, staff and resources to perform conventional central
        -
banking functions. In the absence o f a formal banking system, a large and vibrant informal
market  -referredto as hawala - which includes a domestic and intemational payment systemhas
developed, largely organized around the money exchange dealers o f Kabul. There had also been
very   significant damage to infrastructure, especially to the power system, roads,
telecommunications, and the stock o f private housing. Traditional irrigation systems had greatly
suffered from destruction and lack o f maintenance.         Agnculture production had collapsed,
livestock herds had been depleted, and industries had ceased functioning while most slulled
professionals had fled the country.

4.     By the end of 2001, Govemment services, including health care and education, had
essentially stopped functioning, resulting in a dramatic decline in social indicators, particularly
affecting women. In 1996, Afghanistan ranked 169" out o f 174 countries inthe UnitedNations'
(UN) Human Development Index and conditions deteriorated further in the following years.
Under the Taliban, schools were religious institutions and attendance was extremely low while
girls were barred from attending schools. Women were excluded from political and economic
life. The health situation was grim. Infant and under-five mortality as well as maternal mortality
were estimated to be among the highest inthe world and malnutntion affected about 50 percent o f
childrenunder age five. The average life expectancy was little more than 40 years.


B.     Achievements

5.     The Bonn process. After more than 20 years o f conflict, a new opportunity for the
peaceful development of Afghanistan emerged with the fall o f the Taliban regime in late 2001.
The political agreement reached between the various Afghan factions in Bonn inDecember 2001
provided a road map for the creation of a peaceful and democratic state. An Afghanistan Interim
Administration (AIA) was appointed and governed for six months until an Emergency Loya Jirga
(Grand Council) was convened in June 2002 to elect a new Afghanistan Transitional
Administration (ATA), headed by President Karzai, to remain in office for about two years. The
ATA was charged with preparing a new Constitution and organizing free and fair elections to
elect a fully representative Govemment. A ConstitutionDrafting Commissionwas created inlate
2002 to draft the new Constitution, and a ConstitutionCommission was established inApril 2003
to seek opinions of the Afghan population. On the basis o f this broad consultation, a draft
Constitution was submitted to a Constitutional Loya Jirga in mid-December 2003. Eventually,
Afghanistan's first Constitution in three decades was ratified on January 26, 2004. The UN i s
working closely with the Afghan authorities to prepare for the Presidential and Parliamentary
elections to be held towards the end o f the year, possibly during the fall o f 2004.

6.     Refugee return. Following the fall o f the Taliban, a retum movement began among
Afghan refugees, mainly living in the neighboring countries o f Pakistan and Iran. At the
beginning o f 2002, an estimated 5.9 million Afghans lived outside the country and one million
Intemally Displaced Persons (IDPs) lived inside Afghanistan making one in every three Afghans
 a refugee or an IDP. According to UNHCR, within two years, 2.5 million Afghans have retumed
to their home country while within Afghanistan, an additional 600,000 IDPs have moved back to
their areas o f origin.

 7.    Security and rule of law. Actions were taken to establish security and the rule of law.
Achievements include (i)    the inauguration o f an Afghan National Army (ANA) and police force,
 (ii) commencementofmajorreformintheMinistryofDefense, (iii) implementationofa
     the                                                                      the
Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) program, (iv) the formulation o f a
National Drug Control Strategy in May 2003, (v) the initiation o f a comprehensive review o f the


                                                   2

country's judicial infrastructure, (vi) the establishment o f the Afghanistan Human Rights
Commission (AHRC), and (viii) steady progress inde-mining.

8.      Growth. Although the dearth o f economic statistics makes it difficult to assess the state o f
the economy, available indicators show strong signs o f recovery, albeit fi-om very low levels o f
activity. Following an economic growth o f 30 percent in 2002, estimates indicate that real Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growthremained strong at 23 percent in 2003 (Table 1). The economic
recovery reflects the end o f hostilities and i s drivenby sizable donor assistance, sound economic
policies, and the end o f a prolongeddrought. The impact o f economic recovery i s most visible in
services and construction; which are expanding rapidly in urban centers. Agricultural production
rose sharply, benefiting from increased rainfall and expanded acreage under cultivation. GDP
(excluding opium production) reached US$4.8 billion in 2003, equivalent to around US$200 per
capita.

9.      Macroeconomic stability. Under the leadership o f the Governor o f the Central Bank and
his team, a new currency was launched in late 2002. Since the completion o f this operation,
whose feasibility the international organizations had viewed with skepticism, the exchange rate
has been stable and inflation has been brought under control.                        Monetary policy has been
restrained, supported by the adherence to strong fiscal discipline and a "no overdraft" rule that
prohibits Central Bank financing o f the deficit.

 10. Donor-led humanitarian relief and immediate reconstruction. Donors initially focused
on providing immediate humanitarian relief to vulnerable Afghan people and ensuring regular
payment o f civil service salaries. Inthe first few months o f the AIA, the international community
and especially the UN system was closely involved in these efforts as the machinery o f
Government had not yet recovered enough to fully lead the recovery process.                             The Asian
Development Bank (ADB), IDA, and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
conducted a preliminary needs assessment in January 2002, estimating the cost o f Afghanistan's
reconstruction at US$15 billion over the next ten years.                     Based on this preliminary needs
assessment, the UN developed a set o f emergency programs to deal with the ongoing
humanitarian crisis. These programs, covering the period from October 2001 to December 2002,
were financed by US$1.1billion fi-om donor countries and mostly focused on (i)                     the return and
reintegration o frefugees and internally displaced people, (ii)            food assistance, (iii)
                                                                                                rehabilitationo f
crop production, (iv) child immunization, and (v) improvement o f school enrollment. Similarly,
inthe first six months ofthe AIA (January to June 2002), payrolls ofthe civil service bothat the
center and inthe provinces were processed, controlled, recorded, and financed through a specific
fund, the Afghanistan Interim Administration Fund (AIAF), set up and administered by the



                                                            3

UNDP. However, the preparation o f the payroll and the actual payment o f salaries were
performed, from the outset, by the line-ministries and MoF's Treasury.

11. Zncreasing Government ownership and accountability for development strategy. Under
the leadership o f the Ministry o f Finance, the authorities progressively took the lead in the
formulation of Afghanistan's development strategy.           In April 2002, they formulated a
comprehensive development strategy, the NDF, which outlined a strong agenda to rebuild
institutions and implement structural reforms within a stable macroeconomic framework.' The
NDF, which was prepared through an extensive consultative process, was also a significant step
taken by the Government to move away from a mostly donor-driven strategy to a tmly
Govemment-led reconstruction process.           The NDF provides a framework to coordinate the
Govemment's policies and donors' assistance, and to prepare the NDB. Although the
Government acknowledged from the outset that a number o f reconstruction projects would be
directly implemented by donors and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), without the
corresponding funds being channeled through the MoF, the authorities insisted that all
development projects should be approved inthe budget, as determined by the Cabinet. The NDF
was endorsed by the World Bank.

12.    The report Securing Afghanistan's Future i s a revised needs assessment based on the NDF
which was recently presented at the donors' conference held inBerlininMarch 2004. It furlher
enhances and underpins the Government's development strategy as formulated in the NDF. It
also reassesses Afghanistan's development needs to US$28 billion to cover the 7-year period
2004-10. The strategy outlined inSecuringAfghanistan s Future was also endorsed by the World
Bank.

13.    Budget process. Under the leadership o f the Ministry o f Finance, the budget progressively
became the main tool to implement the NDF and coordinate donors' assistance. The Government
budget consists o f an operating budget, which covers current expenditures and some capital
expenditures aimed at quick repairs, and a development budget covering reconstruction projects
and some donor-funded recurrent costs. The first operating budget (2002/03) was a first attempt
at prioritizing operating expenditures under the constraint o f limited external assistance, setting
up clear benchmarks for domestic revenue collection and establishing the Govemment's
macroeconomic credibility. The bulk o f expenditures was on wages and salaries (including inthe
provinces), while the rest was mostly on office refurbishment and basic equipment. The actual
provision o f public services was quite limited, especially outside Kabul. After a slow start, its
execution accelerated in line with the development o f administrative capacity at the MoF and
faster disbursements o f donor financing. Domestic revenues at US$163 million were higher than
expected (Table 2), in part reflecting exceptional revenues such as telecom licenses.          The
financing requirement was largely met by donor grants. However, the budget execution was
hampered by the fiscal systems' lack o f cohesion. Only a very small amount o f the revenues
collected by provinces was transferred to the center. Also, no reliable information was available
on provincial non-wage expenditures. In fact, very little o f the extemal assistance disbursed in
2002103 went through the Treasury, reflecting largely the Govemment's still very limited
administrative capacity, particularly inline ministries.

 14.   The 2003104 operating budget envisaged expenditures at US$550 million (11 percent o f
non-opium GDP), with domestic revenues were expected to reach US$200 million. It reflects the
enormous needs inthe security, health, and education sectors, and the slow but steady increase in
the Govemment's capacity to provide public services. The 2003/04 NDB, structured around a
public investment program, consisted o f a list o f projects amounting to USSl.8 billion consistent
with the strategic priorities expressed in the NDF, to be implemented as funding becomes
available. Estimates suggest that ordinary budget expenditures in 2003/04 were around US$457

million o f which US$208 million were financed from domestic resources. Disbursementsagainst
the NDBwere approximately US$2.4 billion.

15.   As the Government currently starts its third budget cycle (2004/05), the level o f technical
sophistication and understanding has increased, and the budgets have become more
comprehensive and prescriptive. The budgets are used more substantively to allocate funds to the
Government's highest priorities. The budget process i s also playing a major role in defining the
structure o f the Government and i s the catalyst that i s forcing the discussion o f major policy and
institutionalissues. Inaddition, the Government released inJune 2004 a comprehensive financial
report on how the resources available to the Govemment since 2002 hadbeen utilized.

16.   Fiscal management. Improvements have also been made inbudget execution and treasury
functions. The Government has implemented a centralized computerized system, the Afghanistan
Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) to issue checks and record revenues and
expenditures of the ordinary and development budgets. Parallel improvements have been made in
the DAB payment systems. The ARTF has set fiduciary standards for the Govemment to be
reimbursed and, over time, the Government has been improving its performance relative to these
standards. Under IDA'SEmergency Public Administration Projects (EPAPs), significant efforts
have been made to improve financial management, Government procurement, and audit, and
build local capacities to hand over these functions to Afghan nationals as soon as possible. The
Treasury has instructed provinces to open a single revenue account, which ensures that all
collected revenues are periodically swept to the Treasury Single Account (TSA) at DAB.
Provinces also have a single expenditure bank account, and reports and reconciliations on this
account have improved markedly. Also, the Government has several times reiterated publicly its
commitment to fiscal transparency.

17.   Public administration. As a component o f the NDF, the authorities designed and started to
implement a Public Administration Reform (PAR) program to strengthen public administration.
The size of the civil service was kept under control while its efficiency was increased. InJuly
2003, the Government enacted the Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRX) program to reform
the most critical functions o f Government by allowing administrative departments to place staff
on an elevated pay scale in exchange for organizational restructuring. In some ministries, an
integrated approach combining the best available resources from the existing Government staff,
senior transfers from outside Government (particularly from the NGO community), and
international expertise has resulted ina significant improvement in service delivery.

 18.  Human development.         Since the fall o f the Taliban regime, school enrollment has
continuously increased: more than 3 million students were enrolled in Grade 1-12 in 2002, and
4.3 million in 2003, o f which 3.9 million were inprimary schools. Progress has also been made
inhealth. A massive vaccination programledto areductioninconfirmedpoliocases. A measles
mortality reduction campaign was conducted and reached more than 90 percent o f children 6
months to 12 years o f age, and iodized salt has been provided to 300,000 malnourished women
and children. Three main programs were introduced to provide a basic safety net and reduce
poverty: (i)   the National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP) which is a cash-for-work
program to rehabilitate rural infrastructure, (ii)  the National Solidarity Program (NSP) which
provides block grants for community managed small-scale reconstruction and development
projects in rural areas, and (iii)the Comprehensive Disabled Afghan's Program which delivers
services to disabled and heirs o f martyred persons and transfers payments to around 300,000
disabled people and members o f martyr families. The new Constitutionprovides the legal basis
for women to participate inpolitical and economic affairs. There i s also a pension system for civil
servants which makes low pension payments to about 50,000 pensioners.

 19.   Fimmcial sector.      Afghanistan's formal financial system has been revived.              New
legislation (DAB Law and Banking Law) was adopted inthe summer o f 2003 to grant the Central
Bank independence and establish the basis for a modem legal framework for a two-tier banking

                                                   5

system. A number of banks have since been licensed based on standards consistent with the new
legal framework. Also, progress has been made inrebuildingthe DAB.

20.   Private sector development.         The authorities have taken initial steps to support the
development o f the private sector, including: (i)     enactment o f the Law on Domestic and Foreign
Investment (September 2002); (ii)     establishment o f the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency
(AISA), a single-window clearance and advice center for domestic and foreign investors (August
2003); (iii) allowance o f private investment into the telecommunication sector, and (iv) initiation
of institutional restructuring process in the Ministry o f Commerce. AISA has registered new
investment projects amounting to US$435 million from September 2003 to March 2004.


C.     Prospects

21.    Despite the impressive economic recovery and the forceful implementation o f a
development strategy based on sound economic fundamentals, the development challenges are
enormous and much remains to be done. The remaining o f this section outlines a medium-term
framework fully consistent with the IMF Staff-Monitored Program (SMP), which covers the
fiscal year 2004105.

22.    Security. The security situation remains precarious and significant expansion and
acceleration o f security sector reforms are necessary.            While progress has been made in
rebuilding state institutions and stimulating economic growth in Kabul and some other cities,
adverse security conditions have prevented such progress in other areas, particularly rural areas in
the South and along the border with Pakistan. As a result, the reconstruction process has been
fragmented and the pace reduced. In part due to security constraints, the GOAhas met with
difficulties imposing its presence inthe countryside and exerting countrywide leadership. For the
authorities, "security IS the number one issue and constraint for Afghanistan's reconstruction.
Without an adequate level o f security, the country will fail to achieve key national goals for
economic growth, political normalization and national reconciliation, reconstruction, and social
development. Not only would Afghanistan fail to develop, but in the absence o f adequate
security recent progress on all these fronts will be reversed, and resumption o f large-scale conflict
would become more l i k e l ~ . "Reforms are moving ahead as evidenced by the buildingup o f the
                                   ~
Afghan National Army, the creation o f Provincial Reconstruction Teams inthe provinces and the
expansion o f the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), but recent incidents
highlightincreased tensions inthe run-upto the elections.

23.    Drug economy. While the formal economy i s recovering, so i s the production o f opium.
In2002, opium production was estimated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime
(UNODC) to have reached 3,400 tons, a level similar to that o f the late 1990s. Production in
2003 increased further to an estimated 3,600 tons, equivalent to about half o f non-drug GDP. The
drug economy has a profound negative impact on security and rule o f law and increases political
instability. In Berlin in March 2004, the authorities made strong statements opposing opium
production and outlined a strategy to interdict drug trafficking.

24.    Growth. Maintaining a strong level of economic growth i s an important challenge.
Growth and security are mutually dependent. On one side, future economic growth i s highly
dependent on current investments, which, in tum, depend on the security situation. As a result,
maintaining security i s the main prerequisite for economic growth. On the other side, continued
growth and job creation i s likely to tip sentiment in favor o f progress thereby strengthening
security. Economic growth i s also highly dependent on the performance o f the agricultural sector
as agriculture accounts for half o f non-opium GDP. A significant proportion o f the economic
growth observed in the past two years directly relates to the recovery from conflict and drought.


  Securing Afghanistan Future. Govemment of Afghanistan. March 2004. p. 71

                                                      6

Beyond this level, sustained agricultural growth will require productivity gains fkom adoption o f
available technologies, rehabilitationo f imgation and investments in rural roads for better access
to input and output markets. It i s also critical to generate broad-based growth that includes the
industryand service sectors.

25.   Provided the authorities make progress in ensuring security and maintaining
macroeconomic stability while making continued progress in implementing the NDF, economic
prospects are good in the medium term. According to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), real
GDPis expected to grow by an average o f 12 percentper annum duringthe period 2004-06. The
three major sources o f growth are expected to be in the sectors directly benefiting from the
reconstruction effort (construction, Government and other services), the end o f the conflict (trade
and small services) and the end o f four years o f drought (agnculture).

26.   Human development. Despite recent achievements, Afghanistan still ranks poorly on all
health indicators. The majority o f children are stunted. Infant mortality (165 per thousand live
births),maternal health and immunizationcoverage at about 30 percent are o fparticular concern.
Access to basic health services i s still very limited particularly in rural areas.          Routine
immunization coverage (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis - DTP3) i s estimated to be at most 30
percent. Forty percent o f existing health facilities do not have female staff, which implies that
women are very unlikely to use those facilities. In addition, large numbers o f orphans, female
headed households and handicapped remain outside the social safety net. Despite progress,
accessto education i s also still limited. Short-term measures such as using tents as learning space
and opening up second and third shifts in schools have been adopted but the overall quality o f
education remains low. While no output indicators are yet available, all input indicators indicate
a poor quality o f education. There remains stark provincial and gender disparities. In 2003,
while net enrollment ratio in major cities is as high as 80 percent, it is only 47 percent in rural
areas. Nationally, female net enrollment ratio i s 40 percent while that o f boys i s 67 percent. Net
enrollment ratio for girls remains as low as one percent in some provinces. Inspite o f significant
budget funding for the Livelihoods and Social Protection program (US$170 million excluding
food aid in 2003/04), the coverage o f the existing social protection programs i s low while their
impacts remainun-assessed.

27.    Revenue mobilization. Beyond their initial focus on improving financial management, the
authorities are now focusing on increasing domestic revenues. Domestic revenues are expected
to increase to U S 3 0 9 million in 2004/05 (Table 2). To achieve this, the authorities have recently
introduced an ambitious tax package that includes new customs tariffs and amendments to the
Income Tax Law which eliminate tax holidays. The authorities are also takmg measures to
strengthentax administration, with the objective to increase incompliance by 40 percent over the
next three years and continue enforcing the rules regarding full remittance o f all revenues to the
TSA. A five-year plan to modernize customs has been developed, aiming at improving revenue
collection while facilitating trade. It includes facilitating the transfer o f customs revenues to the
central treasury, improving customs infrastructure, re-organizing and re-buildingthe capacity o f
central and regional customs offices, building a comprehensive legal fiamework for customs,
improving clearance times, and establishing effective enforcement controls. A five-year plan to
modernize tax administration was also developed. A Large Taxpayer Office i s being established
inthe MoFto administer the taxation ofthe largest taxpayers inthe country. Similar offices will
thenbe createdto manage medium-size taxpayers inselectedProvinces.

28.   Expenditures. Ordinary expenditures are expected to increase over the next three years.
Despite the pay reforms approved in 2003, the current pay and grading system remains
inadequate to attract, retain, and motivate slulled civil servants. The size o f the civil service i s
also expected to increase, but only to accommodate the need to recruit additional teachers, while
non-wage expenditures are expected to increase to provide local administrations and line
ministries with sufficient budget allocations to operate and maintain new investments.


                                                   7

29.      Development expenditures are also expected to increase in line with the implementation o f
GoA's development strategy.                         The Development Budget has been formulated around the
implementation of National Priority Programs (NPP). A key element of the new budget is that an
increasing share o f the budget i s executed through the Treasury to allow the Government to
directly finance and implement several NPPs.                         These programs include (i)the Afghanistan
Stabilization Program (ASP), (provincial and district public buildings and grants to provincial
governors), (ii)         a bilateral entry program to attract advisors at competitive rate on short-term
contracts, (iii)       a national vocational training program, and (iv) the scaling-up o f the NSP (block
grants to communities for community infrastructure).

30.      Efficiency of provincial administration.                     Improving service delivery in provinces is
becoming an increasingly important element o f GoA's development strategy. The Government
recognizes that it i s critical that resources are provided to provinces and districts to support state
buildingefforts and enhance service deliveryat the local level. These objectives are supportedby
the ASP and the NSP programs. The ASP extends the PRR program to provincial and district
departments o f ministries, provides funds for the physical reconstruction of province and district
administration, and includes a security and stabilization component.                               In the future, budget
allocations to provinces and districts through the ASP may be made contingent upon local
performance.

31. Financing. In the medium-term, donors' assistance will remain crucial for achieving
sustainable public finance in Afghanistan. The fiscal financing gap will remain large as the
increase in domestic revenues will remain insufficient to cover Afghanistan's fiscal expenditures
need over the next three years. At the donors' conference in Berlin, donors pledged US$4.5
billion for 2004/05 in line with the conclusions of the document Securing Afghanistan s Future
and US$8.2 billion for the three-year period 2004-06. About US$1.5 billion from ARTF, Law &
Order Trust Fund Afghanistan, and fast-disbursing loans i s expected to be available for general
budgetary support during the same period, translating into an expansion o f activities financed
through the Treasury .


                                                                 8

32.    Risks. The growth targets and fiscal framework outlined above are associated with
substantial risks. The scenario assumes: (i)a steady implementation o f the political process as
outlined in the Bonn Agreement, (ii)a steady improvement in the security conditions allowing
donors to implement programs throughout Afghanistan, (iii)               steady progress on the Government's
reform program, (iv) a strong private sector response, and (v) continued, well-targeted donor
support to Afghanistan, and (vi) favorable climatic conditions. Afghanistan has little cushion to
absorb the consequences o f any significant downward deviation inthese areas. Lack o f progress
on the political or security front would negatively affect both the willingness and capacity o f
donors to support Afghanistan's reconstruction effort. It could also negatively impact on the
relationship between central Government and provinces, reinforcing warlordism and reducing
nation-building efforts. Under this scenario, real GDP growth would be lower. A worsening of
the political and security situation would also favor the development o f poppy production with
associated negative impacts on security and political stability. If the implementation o f the
development strategy i s weaker than expected, private sector development would be negatively
affected. Reduced external assistance would also slow down reconstruction, with an adverse
impact on growth and nation-building efforts, and a potential impact on poppy culture, political
situation, and security. A drought would hurt agnculture, the main source o f income, with a
dramatic impact on poverty.



            111.            AFGHANISTAN'S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
33.    The Government's strategy can be articulated around five reform areas o f de~elopment:~

    e     Promoting Security and Rule of Law.                   Security and rule o f law are fundamental
          prerequisites for political normalization, national reconciliation, reconstruction, and
          social development.
    e     Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability. Maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework
          is a prerequisite for broad-based economic growth.
    e     Strengthening Public Administration and Fiscal management. This key element o f the
          strategy includes the following areas: civil service, administrative capacity, budget
          preparation, public sector financial management, procurement, and revenue mobilization
          and management.
    e     Enhancing Human Development. Buildinghuman capital through the implementation o f
          reforms inhealth, basic education and social protectioni s key for long-term growth.
    e     Promoting Private Sector Development.                  The strategy supports the creation o f an
          enabling environment for private sector development through improvement in the
          investment climate, provision o f infrastructure including transport, power and
          telecommunications, financial sector development, state-owned enterprise restructuring,
          trade reform, agriculture development, and development o f the oil, gas and mining
          sectors.


A.     PromotingSecurityandRule of Law

34.    Key Issues. Despite significant gains made by the Government in partnership with the
international community, the security sector reform process has beenbeset by difficulties since its
inception. According to the document Securing Afghanistan s Future, these difficulties relate to
the lack o f an overall strategic vision and framework to guide the process o f reform of the


~~




  The NDF is anchored in three pillars of development: (i)human capital and social protection, (ii)physical
reconstruction and natural resources, and (iii)private sector development, which includes security and rule o f law and
public administration reform and economic management. It also includes three cross-cutting themes: (i)govemance,
financial management and administrative reform, (ii)human rights, security and rule o f law, and (iii)
                                                                                                     gender.

security sector, which translates into low levels o f targeted resources, poor coordination structure
and misaligned reform objectives. The police reform process has been obstructed by a lack o f
coordination among stakeholders, corruption, a lack o f capacity, and shortfalls in funding.
Counter-narcotics activities have been constrained by the absence o f a coherent and credible
strategy as well as the absence o f well-targeted external support. The program to buildan army
meets with difficulties to attract and retain qualified recruits and suffers from an ethnic
imbalance, although recent outreach efforts, targeted recruitment and a greater focus on retention
have partially addressed these concerns.      The reform o f the justice system suffers from the
absence o fjudges' independence, the excessive concentration o f power and functions within the
Supreme Court, the low level o f adequate correctional facilities and related resources, the limited
availability o f legislation, legal texts and jurisprudence collections, the low reliability o f the
internal security forces, perceptions o f corruption, and nepotism and a lack o f human capacity in
terms o f qualified criminal justice professionals. There are also major human rights challenges
including allegations o f forced conscription o f civilians, including under-aged boys, existence o f
privatejails, and arbitrary and politically-motivated arrests, ill-treatment, and torture o f detainees.
Concerns also persist around issues related to forced marriage, abductions, and unchecked
surveillance by intelligence and security agencies. The implementation o f the DDR program
suffers from a lack o f security in some regions that prevents the return o f refugees and a lack o f
coordination among the main stakeholders in the DDR process. A number o f challenges also
remainrelatedto de-mining.

35.    Reform Strategy. The Government seeks to take the lead in effectively coordinating the
security sector reform process, by fostering a consensus among the ministries and institutions
involved with security, and developing their capacity through training and administrative reforms.
Key elements o f this strategy include coordinating ministries, as well as donor governments, by
the National Security Council, ensuring civilian control over the armed forces and monitoring
fiscal transparency. The Government aims to create a uniformed police force o f 50,000 supported
by 12,000 border police by end-2005 and an Afghan National Army o f 20,000 members over the
next three years.     The National Drug Control Strategy aims at eliminating the production,
consumption and trafficking o f illicit drugs into, within and from Afghanistan by 2012. Its key
elements are: (i) provision o f alternative livelihoods for Afghan poppy farmers, (ii)
                    the                                                                              the
extension o f drug law enforcement throughout Afghanistan, (iii)         the implementation o f drug
control legislation, (iv) the establishment o f effective institutions, and (v) the introduction o f
prevention and treatment programs for addicts. To improve the judicial system and ensure its
independence, the strategy includes efforts to rebuild the administration o fjuvenile justice, prison
and law enforcement systems. Among the activities to be carried out are the establishment o f
new courts and the strengthening o f legal aid services within the organizational structure o f the
Supreme Court. The Government also seeks to buildhuman rights institutions and capacity, raise
awareness, and seeks societal consensus around human rights issues.


B.      Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability

B.l       Macroeconomic Policy

36.     Key Issues. The authorities have implemented a prudent economic management which,
together with sizable aid and the end of the drought, has provided an environment conducive to
the resumption o f economic growth. The challenge now consists in maintaining macroeconomic
 stability.

 37.    Strategy. The authorities are committed to maintaining the implementation o f a
macroeconomic framework based on a strong commitment to fiscal discipline.                          The
implementation o f a Staff-Monitored Program with the IMF to cover the fiscal year 2004/05
provides evidence o f this commitment.


                                                  10

B.2     Budget Process

38.   Key Isszies.     Despite significant progress made since 2002103 to improve budget
preparation, the following issues remain (see para. 13), in part reflecting the challenges o f
coordinating external assistance through the budget. First, the budget formulation i s based on the
cost o f inputs rather than the cost o f implementing policies. The budget i s not based on a
medium-term fiscal framework and does not reflect the multi-year impacts o f reforms. Second,
the participation o f sub-national entities in budget preparation i s limited. Provinces have limited
inputs into the budgetprocess which decreasesthe budget's ability to address localneeds. Third,
the budget is not comprehensive. Untilthe current fiscal year (2004/05), the development budget
was a partially funded public investment program formulated on a commitment basis whose
implementation depends on the mobilization o f resources still to be identified. Fourth, linkages
between ordinary and development budgets are still missing. The ordinary budget does not
incorporate the amounts o f operations and maintenance implied by the development budget.
More generally, the distinction between ordinary and development budgets i s ill defined: the
development budget includes programs (like the provision o f health services) which are recurrent
while the ordinary budget includes some capital expenditures.

39.   Reform Strategy. In 2004105, the authorities have successfully prepared a fully funded
development budget. The authorities have also submitted to the Ministryo f Justice (MoJ) a draft
o f the Public Finance and Expenditure Management (PFEM) Law and intend to enact it in
2004/05. The PFEM Law provides a framework for the proper management o f public resources.
It specifies the budget process (includingthe requirement to base the budget on a medium-term
economic framework) and content (including transfers to public sector enterprises).            It also
mandates the budget to be presented by programs, defines the standards o f transparency and
financial reporting, and mandate the design and implementation o f a multi-year fiscal framework.

B.3      RevenuePolicy andAdministration

40.   Key issues.      Domestic revenues are insufficient to finance the functioning o f the
Government and the delivery o f basic public services. External assistance cannot be expected to
be sustained at current level over the longer term, so the authorities need to increase domestic
revenues. Key issues include an incomplete, albeit improving, voluntary remittance o f revenues
to central Government by some provinces, a weak administrative efficiency to mobilize
resources, an absence o f a clear tax code (several layers o f regulations accumulated since the
1960s are applied unevenlyacross the country), and the needto introduce new fiscal measures.

41.   Reform Strategy. The Government's strategy i s to increase domestic revenues to cover the
wage bill in 5 years and ordinary budget expenditures in 9 years. Increase in tax collection
efficiency i s also expected to result in a 60 percent increase in compliance over the next five
years. The authorities have recently introduced an ambitious tax package that includes new
customs tariffs and the elimination o f tax holidays for new investments (as amendments to the
Income Tax Law), a withholding tax on high income, a streamlined corporate income tax, and a
tax on selected services (see para. 27).

B.4      Statistics andDataManagement

42.   Key Issues. Inthe absence o f a functioning leading statistical agency (the CSO has very
limitedcapacity), the informationnecessary to formulate policiesi s providedthrough a number of
uncoordinated piecemeal initiatives from donors and line ministries.

43.   Reform Strategy. The authorities are developing the statistical framework necessary for
policy formulation. A Statistical Master Plan was drafted at the end o f 2003 (and discussed at the
workshop inKabul inMay 2004) to provide a roadmap for the development o f a viable statistical
system in Afghanistan. It recommends the creation o f a National Statistics Council in charge o f


                                                  11

identifyingneeds and priorities regarding statistics. It also aims at developing the CSO's physical
and human capacity to execute data collection including a population census and surveys as
scheduled inthe Statistical Master Plan.


C.     StrengtheningFiscalManagementandPublic Administration

C.l      Government Structure

44.   Key Issues. The administrative capacity o f the Government to formulate and implement
policies i s still very limited. There i s no systematic mechanism to adopt and coordinate policies
across a large number o f ministries which have overlapping functions. Also, ministries' capacity
to develop and implement policies i s limited.

45.   Reform Strategy.        The authorities intend to restructure and rationalize the Central
Government bureaucracy and strengthen policy design and program implementation capacity in
ministries, The Government has enacted the PRR Program decree in July 2003 to initiate the
process o f reforming the most critical functions o f the Government by allowing administrative
departments to place staff on an elevated pay scale in exchange for organizational restructuring
(see para. 17).      3,000 positions are covered by this program and the Government i s fully
committed to pursue its implementation. The first Program Management Unit (PMU) has been
created in the Ministry o f h g a t i o n to enhance project ownership by line ministries and
strengthen implementation capacity. Such units are expected to be responsible for the preparation,
procurement, financial management, supervision, and evaluation o f projects which should hasten
their implementation.        The authorities also intend to improve the bureaucracy o f central
Government, which includes reform o f the Office o f the President. The President has also
announcedits intentionto reducethe number o f Ministerial portfolios.

C.2      PersonnelManagement

C.2.a LegalFramework

46.    Key Issue. The absence o f transparent rules for recruitment and promotion adversely
affects civil servants' motivationand overall efficiency, especially inProvinces.

47.    Reform Strategy. An Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission
(IARCSC) was created inJune 2003 to coordinate and manage the PAR. The IARCSC comprises
(i)CivilServiceManagementDepartmentresponsiblefordevelopinganewlegalframework
    a
 (including a Code o f Ethics) for the Civil Service and modem human resources management
policies and procedures, (ii)    the Independent Appointments Board (IAB), responsible to have
appointments based on merit, and (iii)      the Independent Appeals Board responsible for hearing
complaints against unfair, illegal or discriminatory behavior in the workplace.        Merit-based
procedures have been adopted and the IAB has started applying them. The authorities intendto
adopt an updated legislative framework that defines civil service, its role, lays down ethical
standards, and regulates civil servants' terms and conditions in line with modem employment
practice. The upcoming adoption o f a Civil Service Law will establish a legal framework for
civil service in line with good modem employment practices. Appointments are expected to be
increasingly based on merit and progressively audited.

 C.2.b Systems for Payroll

48.    Key Issues. Failures with the existing arrangements for payroll (failures to pay govemment
 employees in time, in full amount, and with clear identification o f receiving individuals)
undermine the integnty o f the process and the motivation o f civil servants. These failures are: (i)
delays in confirming employment and authorizing quarterly budget allotments by line ministries
to provinces and districts and inpreparing lists o f establishedpositions (tashkeels), (ii)
                                                                                          errors and

                                                   12

existence o f "ghost" employees due to manual calculation o f payroll and lack o f supervision over
salary distribution, and (iii)
                             delays and payments o f less than 100 percent o f salary related to the
use o f bonded trustees contracted by the budget institutions for collection o f cash from the
Central Bank and for disbursement o f salaries in cash to individuals. The ARTF conducts spot
checks over payroll distribution, but Govemment's financial controls and audit are weak to
rectify the problems.

49. Reform Strategy. The MoF, with IARCSC and DAB, intends to implement a verified payroll
plan for government employees. The plan seeks to: (i)address the failures in the process o f
timely authorization o f budget allotments and tashkeels; (ii)   implement computerized payroll
systems and issue Afghanistan Personal Identification Numbers and standardized picture
identification cards to all government employees; and (iii) make salary payments through banks.
Improvements in the timeliness o f authorization o f allotments and tashkeels will stem from
improvements in the budget process. Improvements in other aspects o f the plan will buildon the
ongoing effort o f individualized salary payments, already implemented in Kabul for ten line
ministries, and to be gradually extended to all govemment employees. Additional reforms on
legal regulations, accounting, and audit will also support a more effective payroll system (see
para. 59).

C.2.c HumanResources

50.   Key Issues. There i s currently a dearth o f the core slulls and competencies required to
build an efficient administration, inpart the result o f competition with NGOs and aid agencies.
The problem is particularly severe at management level where a severe shortage o f people -
especially women - with the required skills i s compounded with the absence o f merit-based
appointments over many years. At middle and lower levels, generic management and such basic
skills as writing, counting, planning, and usingIT systems are largely missing.

51.    Reform Strategy. To enhance the level o f human resources i s by nature a long term
endeavor.     In the short-term, the PRR program provides an opportunity to administrative
departments to restructure themselves and increase salaries for key positions while accessing
funds to provide significant training to retained staff. Inaddition, the Government is designing a
lateral entry program to hire advisors on short-term contracts at competitive rate and place them
inkey positions. This programwould allow the Government to attract skilled employees while
limiting pressures on the whole pay structure. In the longer term, the Government intends to
conduct a training and development needs analysis, design and implement a Retraining,
Reslulling, and Redeployment Program, and build a proper human resource management system
to continuously enhance skills.

C.2.d Salary andPension

52.    Key Issues. Salary and pension levels remain inadequate to attract and retain skilledpublic
employees, and this despite recent salary and pension increases. Also, there i s still no long-term
pension policy and pension administration i s inefficient.

53.    Reform Strategy. Average salaries are expected to increase as the Government pursues the
implementation o f the PRR program. Beyond this, the Government intends to carry out a labor
market survey to be used as a base for a civil service pay and grading review. The Government
also intends to reform civil service pensions.       The recent increase in pensions for public
employees i s viewed as a temporary measure pending the overall reform o f civil service
compensation (salary and pension). The pension scheme i s expected to remain a contribution
based, defined benefit scheme for retired public sector employees and their dependents. It i s
expected to still be administered by the Pensions Administration Office, which i s planned to
undergo a modernization program.



                                                 13

C.2.e Gender

54.   Key Issues. Although there i s no accurate data on women`s share of civil employment, it is
clear that women are seriously under-represented at all levels o f Government. There has been
considerable discrimination against women especially under the Taliban regime. This has a
considerable impact on the capacity to deliver health and education services to girls and women.

5 5 . Reform Strategy. The Government i s committed to correct the gender imbalance and
promote the role o f women in civil service.      The strategy consists in establishing targets for
increased level o f female employment and develop and implement a plan to achieve these targets.

C.3      StrengtheningSubnationalAdministration

56.   Key Issues. Years o f destruction and absence o f new investments combined with an
absence o f operations and maintenance have left most Government offices in very poor
conditions and severely under-equipped. Although improvements mostly financed from donor
assistance have taken place for the central administration based in Kabul, the lack o f
infiastructure severely limits the administrative capacity o f provinces and districts to deliverbasic
services, including health and education.

57.   Reform Strategy. The authorities intend to strengthen provinces' and provincial
municipalities' capacities to deliver basic services. The authorities are already upgrading basic
office facilities in pilot districts to improve service delivery and provide the means to connect
citizens with central Government.         The authorities want to progressively increase budget
allotments to provinces. Modest budget grants could be provided to Provinces for public building
reconstruction. The recently created ASP will finance small-scale labor-intensive construction
projects (see para. 30). Modest grants could also be provided to provincial municipalities - the
only administrative units outside o f central Government with an independent budget process - to
finance the reconstruction o f the municipalities' own building, local roads and water and
sanitation programs and some labor-intensive works.            Municipalities' capacity will require
strengtheningto effectively manage these resources.

C.4      Fiduciary Standards

C.4.a FinancialControl Systemsand CashManagement

58.    Key Issues. Despite progress in financial management, several issues remain (Annex 4).
First, the centralization o f the financial management system (AFMIS is only implemented at the
Treasury and in Herat mustofiat), while a necessary first step, creates delays in recording
revenues and expenditures and making payments.             Second, despite recent achievements in
consolidating all government bank transactions in the center and provinces, cash management
needs to be strengthened. Third, budget managers have weak accountability because financial
controls and paperwork are excessive, the regulatory framework i s not well understood and
optionally applied, and there i s lack o f effective audit. Fourth, significant portions o f financial
management operations are managedby an external firm.

59.    Reform Strategy. First, the MoF will continue improving the timeliness and accuracy o f
periodic reporting from provinces and reconciliation o f accounts with line ministries. AFMIS i s
expected to be rolled out to line ministries and provinces.          The PFEM Law mandates the
appointment o f a Chief Financial Officer in each line ministry, which will increase financial
management accountability. It i s envisagedthat the line ministries where ChiefFinancial Officers
are in place will be provided more financial management responsibilities, including payments,
accounting, and reporting. Second, MoF will strengthen its cash management system. Treasury
particularly will promote the introduction o f direct payments from the TSA to vendors' bank
accounts, increasing bank intermediationinthe payment process. Third, financial controls will be
implementedthrough ongoing effort o f reducing ARFT ineligibilities and direct intervention of

                                                  14

the Treasury, where line ministries do not demonstrate due financial management capacity. The
regulatory framework for financial control will be updated in line with the PFEM Law. MoF's
Internal Audit Department i s being strengthened as part of MoF reform and the legal and
institutional framework will be clarified. Fourth, a strategy i s in place to gradually shift all
financial management capacities to Treasury, while external firms would focus only on advisory
and training services.

C.4.b Financialreporting

60.    Key Issues. Financial reporting remains weak.      Data are now available and internal
reporting i s prepared for the Minister o f Finance on a weekly basis, but has only aggregated
information. The capacity o f compiling informative financial statements is lacking at all levels o f
the government.

61.    Reform Strategy. The PFEMLaw will mandate quarterly reportingon public finances, as
well as the preparation and auditing o f annual financial accounts. Capacity will be built to
develop reporting functions.

C.4.c ExternalAudit

62.    Key Issues. The external auditor, the Controller and Audit Office (CAO), has not the
institutional and human capacity to conduct financial statement audits at international standards.
Despite support from an international firm (financed by IDA'SEPAP), which facilitated the audit
o f all IDA'Sgrants and credits, and ARTF for the solar year 200212003, no financial statements
has been audited for more than 10years.

63.    Reform Strategy. An update o f the legal framework, including an Audit Law, will
establish a clear framework for external audit: requirement to audit annual financial accounts,
requirement for the Government to respondto the Auditor's opinion, independence o f the auditor.
Thiswill be complemented by capacity buildingprograms.

C.4.d Procurement

64.    Key Issues. Despite significant initiatives to improve public sector procurement, three
main issues remain, leading donors to conduct themselves as much as fifty percent o f
procurement. First, regulations are inadequate to ensure a complete, transparent, uniform and
laid down process o f procurement. Procurement procedures need to address key issues such as
setting out qualification criteria,    specifications, evaluatiodaward criteria, post tender
negotiations, and time frame for settling tenders. Second, capacity in the administration is weak
and the procurement function i s sometimes misunderstood (mindset that only major works or
purchases are "procurement").      Third, the institutional framework is weak, with no clear
procurement championinGovernment.

65.    Reform Strategy. First, the legal framework will be clarified by a new Procurement Law,
with the procurement regulations, defining all the required ingredients o f the procurement as
discussed above. Second, the reform strategy seeks to address the lack o f capacity through the
assistance o f a central procurement consultant (currently supported by IDA through the EPAP
project). While this consultant initially provided direct procurement services, it will gradually
move towards advisory services.     Third, the institutional framework will be strengthened to
transfer procurement management from donors to line ministries as capacity i s built through new
recruitment (by implementing PRR in procurement units) and training.             A central Public
Procurement Unitwill be created to monitor and review the procurement policies.

D.     EnhancingHuman Development

D.l      Health

66.   Key issues. The most important issue facing the health sector i s the low coverage o f basic
health services (see para. 18). An estimated 43 percent o f the population still do not have access
to basic health services. Forty percent o f existinghealth facilities do not have female staff, which
implies that women are very unlikely to access those facilities. Quality o f services is also an
issue. Major bottlenecks to improve service delivery and quality include: (i)          overall lack o f
financial resources, (ii)highinefficiencies at the central ministrylevel which limitsthe amount of
fiscal resources that are allocated to health service delivery, (iii)shortage o f skilled staff inrural
areas, particularly female health staff, (iv) low management capacity in the Ministry of Health
(MoH) and at provincial level, and (v) absence o f a well-functioning health referral system.
There are also many important cross-cutting issues that impede improvements in health status
such as physical insecurity which discourages female health workers, low levels o f education
particularly among women, low social status afforded to women, and lack o f physical
infrastructure including rural roads, electricity, potable water, and sanitation.

67.   Reform strategy. With NGOs providing more than 80 percent o f existing services, the
M o H exerts a leading role in the sector, particularly in terms o f policy development. M o H
developed an Interim Health Strategy for the period 2002-04 to ensure that partners focus on
strategic priorities. These priorities are to: (i) ensure the nation-wide delivery o f Basic Package
o f Health Services (BPHS) and expansion o f referral services, (ii)   continue to strengthen vertical
programs such as salty iodination, polio, measles, tetanus immunization, and vitamin A
distribution, and (iii)improve the quality o f hospital services, with priority to emergency
obstetrical care and trauma management. To increase BPHS coverage, the M o H has already
signed Performance-based Partnership Agreements (PPAs) with NGOs for the delivery o f the
BPHS in some under-served areas. Also, the M o H plans to take a more active and direct role in
the provision o f health services than under the PPAs with NGOs. Implementation o f this strategy
will require a strengthening o f Government systems o f management, disbursement, financial
management, and procurement. The overall objective o f the strategy i s to deliver the BPHS in
areas that are not served by NGOs, and test whether in the long term the public sector can run
services as efficiently as the private sector under contract.

D.2      Education

68.    Key Issues. One of the most important issues facing the education sector are the poor
quality o f primary education and its low coverage and retention, particularly for girls (see para.
 18).  Major constraints include: (i)weak institutional capacity o f educational administration,
including financial management (ii)    weak capacity o f teachers and school principals, (iii)   limited
involvement o f communities in school management, and (iv) low quality and inadequate inputs
includingteaching learningmaterials and learning space.

69.    Reform strategy. The Government's approach to overcome the constraints in education i s
as follows. First, the authorities intend to redefine the Ministryo f Education's (MoE) role and its
Provincial and District Departments. MoE's capacity has already increased over the last 18
months and its mandate has also become more focused. M o E now emphasizes its role as policy
maker, regulating and monitoring service delivery, facilitating the roles o f others, and contracting
for services. This policy shift i s expected to be furtherreinforced at provincial and district levels,
to make the school the point o f service delivery. Second, the authorities intend to strengthen
teaching force by assessing the current status o f teachers and developing a comprehensive teacher
training program. Third, the authorities intend to strengthen the role o f both communities and
schools. Many communities and schools have sustained education at the local level in very
challenging environment for decades in Afghanistan. Government i s strengthening the functions


                                                   16

o f school principals and encouraging communities to participate in the planning, implementation
and monitoring o f education services.

D.3      Social Protection

70.    Key Issues. Coverage under the existing safety net system i s low (see para. 18). Also, an
impact evaluation needs to be conductedto assess its targeting.

71.    Reform Strategy. The thrust o f Government policy over the past two years has been to
shift increasingly beyond pure humanitarianrelief to the adoption and implementation of a more
comprehensive and sustainable integrated social protection. More effective coordination between
ministnes, and stronger Government leadership o f the overall social protection program,
including utilization o f food aid, is also a priority. The strategy also consists in conducting an
impact evaluation o f the existing programs. The M o H i s currently reviewing beneficiaries under
the disability program. Inthe longer term, the authorities intend to shift from work-for-food to
work-for-cash based systems while avoiding creating systems o f entitlements that are not
financially sustainable. The authorities have also initiated the design o f a National Vulnerability
Program, one o f the thirteen NPPs, including the rationalization and expansion o f a safety net
system (see C.2.d for the civil service).


E.     Promoting Private Sector Development

E.l      Investment Climate

72.    Key Issues.     Private sector-led development i s the key to Afghanistan's long-term
economic development. One main issue i s to overcome the legacy o f the Soviet-type system
established duringthe communist era. Currently, insecurity severely constrains the development
o f the private sector. The lack o f infrastructure i s also a constraint, increasing operating costs
(e.g. because o f the lack o f power) and reducing market opportunities (e.g. because o f a weak
road system). The lack o f management capacity and the lack o f insurance, financial services, and
other business services further constrain the development o f the private sector. In addition, there
are two main policy and institutional issues.         First, Afghanistan has inherited many laws,
regulations and procedures that tend to inhibit trade and investment instead o f encouraging it. A
legal framework should be inplace that allows businesses to start up easily, to function efficiently
while they are in operation and to exit the market in a timely and efficient manner. Second,
problems caused by a weak legal framework are compounded by a host o f administrative bamers
that affect entry and raise transaction costs, thereby reducing the competitive strength o f the
private sector.

73.    Reform Strategy. The Government i s committed to support private sector development (as
outlined in the NDF). A revised "Law on Domestic and Foreign Private Investment in
Afghanistan" will establish a simple, transparent and mostly automatic registration process for
both domestic and foreign investment. Restrictions for foreign investment will however apply to
some sectors or activities. The new law will use provisions for accelerated depreciation and loss-
carry forward instead o f tax holidays, as investment incentives.           The registration will be
undertakenby the newly established AISA, a "one-stop-shop" for investors that i s designed to cut
through the red tape o f investment. The Commercial Code i s also beingrevised. Administrative
reforms are expected to clarify responsibilities and increase capacity. These initiatives will need
to be followed by further legal reforms, including issuance o f implementing regulations for the
investment law and enactment o f a "Companies Act" and resolution o f urban land issues. More
generally, a thorough review o f the existing legal framework for PSD i s required in order to
identify areas where there are serious gaps or deficiencies inthe existinglegal framework.




                                                  17

E.2      Infrastructure

E.2.a    Transport

74.   Key Issues. The poor state o f the transport sector is a key issue for Afghanistan's
development. As a landlocked country and inthe absence o frailways, Afghanistan relies on road
and air transport. However, road infrastructure remains in very poor conditions and only about
16 o f the country's 21,000 km national road network is paved. Extending access to primary,
secondary and tertiary roads, which i s vital for market integration will also require a provincial
investment focus. The country's alrports and civil aviation infrastructure too have also suffered
significant destruction and neglect through years o f war.

75.    Reform Strategy. The Government's strategy consists in (i)urgently rehabilitating the
primary road network and key airports to accommodate increasing traffic volume and promote
trade with neighboring counties, (ii)  creating a regulatory framework to promote private sector
participation and provide efficient transport services; and (iii)restructuring the institutions
involved inthe sector including the Ministry o f Public Works (MPW), Ministry o f Civil Aviation
and Tourism (MCAT), and Ministry o f Transport and separatepolicy functions fi-om construction
activities. The Govemment plans to establish a PMU in MPW to manage the entire program o f
road and bridge construction. This would leave M P W with the primary task o f setting policies,
planning the development o f the country-wide road network, setting standards and regulations
and enforcing them, and managing the Super Corridors and National Highways for which works
will be contracted out. Ruralroads will continue to be under the responsibility o f the Ministryo f
Rural Rehabilitationand Development (MRRD). The M C A T will focus on (i)       formulating policy
and strategy, (ii)planning and budgeting, and (iii)creating and maintaining databases.
Specialized airport companies are expected to manage airports while the Government i s expected
to severe commercial and operational ties with Ariana, the Afghan national airline.

E.2.b Power Sector Development

76.    Key Issues. The power sector i s severely constraining Afghanistan's development. An
estimated 6 percent o f the population have access to power and electricity consumption per
capita, at 12kWh/year, i s among the lowest in the world. Only 234,000 customers are officially
connected to the public grid, o f which approximately 30 percent are in Kabul. Outside Kabul,
access to power i s muchmore limited, and rural areas are virtually un-served. The existingpower
network i s dilapidated, while the Da Afghanistan Brishna Moassesa (DABM), the power utility
responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution o f electricity, does not have an
appropriate governance structure nor the economic resources to improve services.

77.    Reform strutegy. The Ministry o f Water and Power (MWP) has adopted a Reform Road
Map and has submitted an Electricity Policy Statement to Cabinet. The vision o f the MWP i s for
DABM to evolve into autonomous, financially viable enterprises providing reliable, low cost
electric service to all Afghan citizens in an environmentally responsible manner. To accomplish
this vision, the MWP has planned, over the next few years, projects to rehabilitate its existing
infrastructure, increase its generation capacity through the participation o f the private sector
where feasible, steadily increase the number o f customers it serves, establish more appropriate
tariffs, and increase its revenue through enhanced and effective billing and collection and loss
reduction procedures. The Govemment has increased tariffs (although a significant gap remains
to achieve cost recovery), and several donors are providing ad hoc assistance to improve billing
and collection. However, a key first step to improve governance inthe sector i s the creation and
corporatization o f the Kabul Distribution Company to enable it to operate as a commercially and
financially viable enterprise.   Technical Assistance (TA) under IDA'SPower Rehabilitation
Project will help the authorities reach this objective. Lastly, the MWP recognizes the pressing
need to develop institutional capacity and tools to effectively manage the rehabilitation and



                                                 18

reconstruction efforts o f power infrastructure. As a first step, MWP i s inthe process o f creating a
Project Implementation Support Unit expected to be operational by mid-2004.

E.2.c    Telecommunications

78.    Key Issues.    The main challenge facing the telecommunications sector consists in
sustaining recent successes. Telecommunications were in a dilapidated state at the end o f recent
hostilities, when tele-density (telephones per 1,000 people) o f 1.6 was one o f the lowest in the
world. Since the end o f conflict, the telecommunications sector has been expanding rapidly.
Over the last two years, private investors and the Government supported by the donors, have
played a significant role in extending the quality and reach o f telecommunications services,
improving international connectivity and fixed services in major cities, and enhancing
Government communications. Full mobile services have rapidly developed reaching 135,000
subscribers in December 2003 and it i s now possible to make mobile calls between all major
cities. Confidence in the sector has resulted in significant private foreign investments (more than
US$90million o f projects is recordedby AISA and the Ministryo f Commerce).

79.    Reform Strategy. The overriding objective o f the Govemment's national communications
policy i s to achieve modernization and rapid expansion o f telecommunications networks and
services, and to create universal access across Afghanistan.          To reach this objective, the
Government's strategy consists in creating a regulatory framework to promote private sector
participation and restructuring o f the institutions involved in the sector to separate policy
functions from service provision. A regulatory body has already been established and will be
strengthened over the course o f the next few years. The regulatory framework i s expected to (i)
maintain an open and technologically neutral environment, (ii)      develop an open and transparent
system o f licensing, and (iii)emphasize private ownership and operation.          The Ministry o f
Communications is expected to reorient itself as a policy malung body while Ministry o f
Communication's telecommunications operational arm, Afghan Tel, and the postal services are
expected to be corporatized. The Ministry o f Communications i s rolling out wireless local loop
services in major towns and cities, while undertaking a rapid and ambitious reform agenda to
ensure that private services delivered on a competitive basis are the driving force behind future
sector growth.     Capacity development within Ministry o f Communications has already been
initiated through training and TA, and needs to be sustained. The private sector i s expected to
continue providing mobile phone services and play a growing role in other aspects of
telecommunications, telephone and internet access, informationtechnology and postal services.

E.3       Financial Sector Development

80.    Key Issues.    Afghanistan's financial sector face some key issues: (i)the legal and
regulatory environment remains extremely weak, (ii)DAB still remains far behind basic
standards o f modem central banking, and (iii)   Afghanistan's publicly-owned commercial banks
(i.e. all o f them except for the new licensed banks) are virtually non functioning lacking basic
management systems, procedures, contsols and skilled personnel and remain in critical need o f
rehabilitation.

81.    Reform Strategy. The reform strategy includes three elements. First, building on the
recently passed financial sector legislation (see para. 19), the authorities intend to further
strengthen the regulatory framework including the elaboration o f internationally accepted
prudential regulations to clarify the legal and regulatory environment. Second, the authorities
intendto continue implementing the reform o f DAB. These reforms are expected to focus on
creating an organization structure and culture that enables DAB to function as a regulatory body
for the financial sector and carry out key supervisory functions in Kabul and the most important
cities. These reforms include (i)   the development o f an effective national payment system, (ii)
the introduction of management information systems, and (iii) implementation of accounting
                                                                   the
and auditing standards in accordance with international standards.             It also includes the

                                                 19

implementation o f a reorganization and operational restructuring program which includes
substantial changes to human resources (including the implementation o f a PRR program),
personnel management processes, and management information systems. As commercial banks
develop, the Central Bank will gradually end its commercial banking functions.             Third, the
authorities intend to solve the situation o f the six state-owned banks. The banks have all applied
for re-licensing and a resolution plan is expected to be developed and implemented.

E.4       State-OwnedEnterpriseRestructuring

82.   Key Issues.       There are currently about seventy State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in
Afghanistan. Budgeted fiscal transfers to SOEs have been discontinued, which forced SOEs to
start restructuring themselves.     The Government still faces the challenge o f developing and
implementing a strategy to restructure SOEs and a plan to address the social impacts o f such a
restructuring.

83.   Reform Strategy. The authorities have been dealing forcefully with SOE restructuring. A
survey o f SOEs was conducted to assess their situation including number o f workers and asset
valuation particularly landholding.        In April 2004, the MoF was given the institutional
responsibility for SOE restructuring. The SOEs were requested to submit financial reports on a
quarterly basis. A strategy to restructure SOEs was developed and its implementation has started
while its completion i s programmed for 2007. As part o f this strategy, SOEs have already been
classified in four categories (economically viable, candidate for merger, candidate for liquidation,
and SOEs to remain under public ownership), while specific steps on how to deal with each
category within Afghanistan's existing legal framework have been developed. Also, a plan to
deal with the social impacts o f SOE restructuring, including the creation o f an employment
agency specifically geared to protect SOE employees, has been developed.

E.5       Trade Reform

 84.   Key Issues. Trade, both regional and global, will be a driving force in Afghanistan's
economic growth. Over the past 2 years, TISA has both renewed existing trade agreements,
while entering into new agreements with its neighbors. At the recent Cancun trade meeting,
Government representatives pledged to build a foreign trade regime that will allow Afghanistan
to easily pass the standards required for World Trade Organization accession over the next few
years. Afghanistan has also joined the World Customs Organization.                  While security and
 infrastructure are key constraints, there are policy problems related to (i)the customs code, (ii)
the weakness of the transport system, combined with burdensome transit procedures, and (iii)       the
 lack o f administrative capacity o f the Government to manage customs and transit, a responsibility
 fragmented amongst the Ministry o f Commerce, Finance, Interior and Transport, and the Afghan
 Chamber o f Commerce, creating obvious inefficiencies in securing customs and trade revenues
 and infacilitation o f trade and transit. Infuture years, it will be vital for the Government to move
 towards a multilateral system for trading within the region perhaps initially based around corridor
 agreements. This would also allow issues such as transshipment to be addressed. The May 2004
 meeting o f the Economic Cooperation Organization in Bishkek however symbolizes
 Afghanistan's return as the hub for regional trade.

 85.   Reform Strategy.First, the Government has approved the revised countrywide tariffregime
 with a simplified six-band tariff structure, a maximum rate o f 16 percent, and one that utilizes a
 uniform floating exchange rate. The Government i s focusing on harmonization o f standards and
 procedures, and curtailing smuggling. Second, the Government intends to improve regionaltrade
 and transit issues - including development o f efficient, safe, and reliable, transport corridors.
 Third,the Government intendsto clarify institutionalresponsibilities.




                                                   20

E.6      AgriculturalDevelopment

86.   Key Issues. The main constraints to agncultural growth include (i) utilization o f
                                                                              limited
Afghanistan's water resources and unsustainable water resource management and use practices,
(ii) accesstofarminputsincludingfertilizersdueinparttolimitedaccesstocredit,(iii)
    limited
limited information on available inputs and new technologies, (iv) limited private sector
involvement in input and service delivery, (v) lack o f land security and tenure, (vi) limited access
to markets, and (vii) lack o f grades and standards and certification systems which limit the scope
for cash generating export oriented production. Main issues with livestock are widespread animal
diseases and the limited access to animal healthpreventive services and vaccine programs.

87.   Reform Strategy. The Govemment i s committed to not introduce policy distortions like
those related to price support or direct subsidies for example. The Govemment also intends to
move away from direct interventions in the sector through the provision o f fertilizers and seeds
by SOEs or agricultural credit from the currently defunct Agricultural Development Bank.
Instead, the Govemment intends to revive institutions like those involved in agncultural research,
introduce more innovative delivery mechanisms like credit extension and also foster the legal and
regulatory framework for water user groups and agricultural marketing. The strategy also seeks
to identify viable substitutes for poppy production although this may not be achievable. InJune
2004, the authorities have created an amculture program as one o ftheir NPPs.

E.7      Oil, Gas and MiningDevelopment

88.   Key Issues. Afghanistan has substantial reserves o f solid minerals, among them coal,
quarry materials, marble and dimension stone, industrialminerals, some metals, and semiprecious
stones, and gas. Production suffered greatly during the conflict years, and the sector i s largely
outside the central Govemment's direct knowledge or control, with most production unregulated
and riskmg environmental damage. The regulatory framework i s poorly developed and public
institutions incharge o f supervisingthese activities have limited capacity.

89.   Reform Strategy. Government i s committed to focus its role on regulation o f the sector
and development o f a policy environment for private sector participation, rather than a directed
operational approach.      In particular, the reform strategy emphasizes the need to regularize
existing production (of quarry materials and gemstones in particular) and to streamline the
regulatory framework.       The policy and regulatory functions o f the Ministry o f Mines and
Industries need to be separated from its operations. The administrative capacity (e.g. for the
cadastral office) will also be strengthened. The revenue procedures for this sector will be made
transparent and inline with overall revenue policy and administration.



                     IV.      BANK'S ASSISTANCE TO AFGHANISTAN

90.    After a gap o f more than two decades, IDA'Sre-engagement with Afghanistan began with
an Approach Paper to the Board in November 2001 (IDAR-2001-23247) followed by a
Preliminary Needs Assessment prepared jointly with the UNDP and the ADB in early 2002. A
first TSS was presented to the Board on March2002 (IDAR-2002-0035) and proposeda 9-month
emergency assistance strategy to support post-conflict reconstruction and economic recovery as
part o f a broader intemational effort, as well as the establishment o f the ARTF. Initial Bank
interventions focused on addressing urgent public administration and fiscal management needs to
enable the Government to rapidly build capacity to oversee the reconstruction process. Other
assistance provided investment funding for critical short-term priorities including education,
infrastructure rehabilitation andjob creation.

91.    A second TSS (IDAR-2003-022) was presented to the IDA Board of Executive Directors
on March 2003 to cover the next 1%month to two-year period until Afghanistan develops a new

                                                 21

Constitution and a stable, representative Govemment is established, in line with the process
mandated by the Bonn Agreement. This second TSS was designed to focus IDA's financial
assistance and Analytical and Advisory Activities on supporting the Government's vision and
strategy for national reconstruction embodied in the NDF (April 2002). Following the clearance
of Afghanistan's arrears to IDA and commitments o fUS$lOO million inFY02 inthe form o f IDA
Post-Conflict Grants, the second TSS outlined a programwith up to four new operations inFY03,
and additional operations in FY04, to fully realize the World Bank's Tokyo pledge o f US$570
million.


A.    InvestmentLending

92.   As o f end-June 2004, IDA's portfolio consists o f 13 active projects which support GOA'S
development strategy.     IDA also administers the ARTF created in May 2002.            Donors'
contributions to ARTF amounted to US$185 million in 2002/03 and US$286 million in 2003104,
to support mainly the ordinary budget, but also several investment projects. IDA's investment
projects which amount to a total commitment ofUS$608million are as follows:

        Public Administration and Fiscal Management. The EPAP (US$lO million) and EPAP I1
        (US$8.4 million) have provided funds and TA to builda payment system at the Treasury
        and to raise the public sector's fiduciary standards.    These projects support budget
        preparation and execution, expenditure accounting and reporting, procurement, and audit.
        EPAP I1also supports public administration reform (PRR process and IARCSC).
     0  Human Development. The Health Sector Emergency Rehabilitation Project (US$59.6
        million) expands equitable delivery o f basic health services through performance-based
        partnership agreements with NGO service providers and the strengthening o f the Ministry
        o f Public Health. The Emergency Education Rehabilitation and Development Project
        (US$15 million) supports grants via NGOs to schools and communities to rehabilitate
        schools, and block grants to higher education institutes to improve student facilities,
        increase female enrollment and improve quality o f teaching. The Emergency Community
        Empowerment and Public Works Project (US$42 million) and the NEEP for Rural
        Access Project (US$39.2 million) aim at creating emergency short-term employment
        opportunities for the poor while improving rural access infrastructure. The Emergency
        NSP (US$95 million) aims at laying the foundations for local governance and assisting
        the reconstruction and development o frural communities through the provision o f grants.
        Private Sector Development.       The Emergency Custom Modemization and Trade
        Facilitation Project (US$31 million) supports the customs reform program, including
        trade-related infrastructure. The Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (US$40
        million) aims at rehabilitating more than 1,000 small and medium irrigation schemes.
        The Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project (US$33 million) seeks to
        rehabilitate power distribution networks in Kabul and five other cities, and water supply
        systems intwelve provincial cities. The power component includes assistance to increase
        generation capacity in Kabul and prepare a power sector strategy.        The project also
        supports municipal public works programs that have implemented over one hundred
        labor intensive projects.    The Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project (US$108
        million) finances the rehabilitation o f the main corridor from Kabul to Tajiskistan,
        including the Salang Tunnel, and some civil work in Kabul airport. The Emergency
        Communication Development          Project   (US$22 million)      seeks   to  rehabilitate
        communication infrastructure and provide the Govemment with communication
        equipment.     The Power Rehabilitation Project (US$l05 million) seeks to restore and
        expand the distribution network, rehabilitate the largest generation station supplying
        Kabul and the associated transmission line, and improve commercial operations o f the
        utility.

B.     Analytical and Advisory Services

93.   Knowledge partnership i s a core element o f IDA'Sassistance to Afghanistan. So far, the
Bank has focused analytical and advisory services on providing quick, practical, concrete and
focused technical inputs and advice on specific policy, institutional design and reform issues that
are o f immediate concern to the Government. In depth technical work has been conducted in
response to GOA'Srequests in key sectors such as public administration, health, the financial
sector, private sector development and infrastructure. The Bank has also made significant
contributions to the formulation o f the Government's strategy as outlined in the report Securing
Afghanistan's Future which was presented at the donor's conference held in Berlin in March
2004. A variety o f vehicles have contributed to this work, including Post-Conflict Fund grants,
TA components o f IDA Grants, and partner financing o f work. The Govemmentprovided strong
positive feedback particularly in the areas o f public administration, private sector development,
health and mining. Analytical and Advisory Activities also support the reform areas o f GOA'S
strategy as follows:

         Security and Rule of Law. A paper titled Afghanistan's Drug Economy: A Preliminaly
         Overview and Analysis (December 2003) was prepared as an input for the Government's
         report Securing Afghanistan 's Future (March 2004).
         Public Administration and Fiscal Management. TA i s continuously provided in the
         fiduciary areas and that o f civil service reform. A Workshop on Economic Management
         Strategy was held on April 2003. A Procurement Review was conducted in June 2003.
         Also, a comprehensive analysis o f the structure and work o f the administration at the sub-
         national level has been conducted in partnership with the Afghanistan Research and
         Evaluation Unit (AREU), leading to a constructive policy dialogue with the Government
         on public administration reform as well as a reference report A Guide to Government in
         Afghanistan, with a policy paper Subnational Administration in Afghanistan: Assessment
         and Recommendationsfor Action (December 2003). An Economic Report i s cu,rrently
         under preparation.
         Human Development. An Education Policy Note i s under preparation. A Poverty and
         Vulnerability Analysis i s also under preparation, based on a household survey recently
         completed incollaboration with the MRRD. A GenderAssessment inunderpreparation.
         Private Sector Development. Analysis has focused on sectors that are key for private
         sector development including: Trade and Regional Cooperation between Afghanistan
         and its Neighbors (February 2004), Afghanistan: Financial Sector Reforms (March 2003)
         and Afghanistan Border States Development Framework (November 200 1). Also, policy
         notes, industry and service studies and a comprehensive Private Sector Development
         Report are under preparation. IDA provided TA to prepare the MiningLaw and the Oil
         and Gas Law. The Report Mining as a Source of Growth (December 2003) assesses the
         existing mineral production and potential for development and addresses the challenges
         faced by the Govemment to establish an enabling environment which will regularize
         existing production and stimulate new investments. TA has been provided at the regional
         level inthe area o f power trade. Some work has also been done on water issues: a study
         o f Amu Darya riparian issues has just been completed and another study on riparian
         issues involving Pakistan and Afghanistan i s beingconsidered.


C.     Coordinationwith Other Donors

94.    The national budgetis the maininstrument for donor coordination. Donors finance projects
that belong to the development budget, itself structured around the NDF programs. To facilitate
donor coordination, a Consultative Group (CG) has been created for each program and an
Advisory Group for each cross-cutting theme (for example gender and environment). CGs are
chaired by the program's lead ministry and are composed o f representatives from all donors

                                                   23

involved in the reform area, under the leadership o f a `Donor Focal Point" (Table 3). CGs have
significantly improved donor coordination, information sharing, budget preparation and
monitoring, despite uneven performance across programs.            The Development Budget and
Extemal Relations Unit under the Director General o f Budget at MoF i s responsible for
coordinating and monitoring extemal assistance as well as undertalung reviews with each donor.
A firstjoint portfolio review preparedby IDA and the authorities has beenconducted inFebruary
2004. Similar reviews are expected to be conducted with other donors which will strengthen
project implementationand development budget coordination.

95.   TA i s a key component o f the development program that is also coordinated through CGs
and the NDB. To strengthen coordination, the Govemment has recently announced its intention
to channel TA through the Technical Assistance and Feasibility Studies component o f ARTF.

                                 Table 3: ConsultativeGroups




                               V.      THE PROPOSED CREDIT

96.    Starting from the particularly dire situation left by the Taliban, the Government has made
significant progress since it came to power in June 2002. Its main challenge now i s to deepen,
broaden and sustain the reforms underway in the areas o f public administration and fiscal
management while implementing reforms that lead to a more efficient allocation o f fiscal
resources in the areas o f human development and private sector development. The
implementation o f such reforms requires the Government to deepen its program beyond Kabul to
eventually reach all provinces and municipalities, including those where donors are absent.

                                                  24

97.   To reach this objective, in the short to medium term, the Government requestedmulti-year
financial support that i s not linked to specific projects, but that can support its entire budget
including recurrent costs, as well as development projects that are viewed as a priority, yet not
fully financed by donors including small-size rehabilitation projects, projects o f operations an
maintenance or projects located ininsecure areas.

98.   The following section provides a description of the proposed Credits including: (i)    reform
areas supportedby the Credits, (ii)  country ownership, (iii) actions to be taken before Board
                                                            prior
presentation o f PSIB I,(iv) triggers for PSIB 11, (v) monitoring and evaluation, (vi)
administration o f the Credit, (vii) coordination with the IMF and other donors, (viii) poverty
implications, and (ix) benefits and risks.


A.     ReformAreas Supportedbythe Credits

99.   The Government's medium-term development strategy i s described in Section 111. The
Govemment's policy action matrix i s outlined in Annex 1. The Govemment has requested IDA
to support an important subset o f the reforms outlined in its strategy (which excludes activities
related to security and rule o f law as per IDA's mandate) while other donors are supporting other
reform areas. The reform program supported by the Credit i s outlined in the attached Letter o f
Development Policy (LDP) (Annex 3).

100. The overall objective o f these operations is to provide rolling support to the Govemment's
objective to deepen, broaden and sustain the reforms underway in the areas o f public
administration and fiscal management.        PSIB Ibuilds on the reforms initiated under IDA's
Emergency Public Administration Projects (EPAP) to improve GOA'Sown fiduciary standards.
Deepening and broadening these reforms i s critical for poverty reduction assistance to be
effective. The Credit supports on-going reforms to strengthen the budget process, increase the
administrative capacity o f line ministries and subnational administration, develop revenue policy
and administration, and improve civil service effectiveness.        The Credit also supports the
implementation o f reforms that lead to a more efficient allocation o f fiscal resources in the areas
o f human development (health, basic education and social protection) and private sector
development (investment climate, financial sector, and state-owned enterprises).               More
comprehensive, thematic reforms in human and private sector development will require support
through other instruments, including sectoral operations and TA.


B.     CountryOwnership

 101. The overall framework for PSIB i s based around the NDF, the NDB and associated public
investment programs, and the Securing Afghanistan s Future document. The policy and strategy
framework for PSIB i s therefore driven by national priorities for state building and poverty
reduction.

 102. Ownership of the Credits by counterpart ministries and the Central Bank is strong. The
definition o f the reform areas supported by the Credits, prior actions and triggers results fi-om a
highly collaborative process between the Bank and the authorities including the Vice-president,
the Central Bank and the Ministries o fHealth and Education under the overall leadership o f MoF.

 103. Several aspects o f the PSIBs are expected to foster and support broader country ownership.
First, the PSIBs will provide incremental funding to the Central Govemment that could be used
strategically to implement centrally-funded development programs country-wide. Second, the
PSIBs allow the Government to establish a record o f accomplishments while adapting its reform
program as it goes forward. For example, the number o f prior actions and triggers included in
this operation reflects not only the solid achievements to date but also the level o f challenges the
Govemment i s willing to confront. As such, the PSIBs can be used strategically as they provide

                                                 25

both leverage to implement core reforms and the flexibility required to adapt to unforeseen
developments, which can only increase overall country ownership.

    D.       Triggers for PSIBI1

     105. Progress on several reform areas i s deemed important to the sustainability o f the
    Government's program. Triggers to measure progress on these areas have been identified in
    collaboration with the authorities.            Attainment o f these triggers would represent sufficient
    progress to move to the next operation.

     106.      Triggers for PSIB I1can be summarized as follows:

          0    Maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework, including progress in
               raising domestic revenues;

          0    Preparation o f a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF);

          0    Improvement in civil service efficiency as measured by: (i)              maintaining the increase in
               number of un-uniformed central government employees (except teachers) below 10,000
               compared to end-June 2004 level, and initiating a census o f all government employees,
               (ii)gazetting o f a new Civil Service Law and Code o f Ethics for government employees,

               merit-basis (i.e. by IARCSC);

           0   Preparation o f a draft Pension Law and proposedplan o f financing;

           0   Progress in raising fiduciary standards as reflected by: (i)             steady decrease in ARTF

                                                               29

       revenues and expenditures by Ministry and Province against appropriations, allocation o f
       contingencies), preparation and audit o f final accounts for 2003104, consolidation o f all
       Government's accounts into the Treasury Single Account, and preparation o f the 2004/05
       budget document in line with the standards outlined in the law, (iv) gazetting o f a
       Procurement Law and procurement regulations, and creation o f a Public Procurement

       program for existing and new teachers; and (iii)development o f MoE's financial
       management system and strengtheningo f MoE'scapacity;

       Review o f legislations, regulations and procedures related to private investments in order
       to simplify and harmonize them inline with international best practice;

        Continued progress on financial sector reform including strengthening the regulatory
        framework, modernization o f the Central Bank, and resolution o f the state-owned
        commercialbanks:

            o Regulatory Framework: Progress will be measured by the elaboration of
                internationally accepted prudential regulations for all core sectors o f banking
                (licensing, monitoring and closure) and the strengthening o f the banking
                supervision function o f the Central Bank,

            o Central Bank modernization: Progress will be measured by (i)            installation o f
                technical hardware and software equipment in the Central Bank and at least 6

                 demonstrated capacity to develop these functions,

            o Resolution o f state-owned commercial banks: Progress will be measured by (i)
                 completion o f re-licensing o f commercial banks, (ii)initiation o f a resolution for
                 the banks that have not beenre-licensed;

        Progress in SOE reform as evidenced by the continued implementation o f a plan for SOE
        restructuring.


E.    Monitoring and Evaluation

107. The existingcapacity o f the Government to monitor and evaluate outcomes o f andprogress
under its reform program is limited. Currently, indicators o f progress are not produced
systematically and, when they are produced, they often result from the monitoring and evaluation
components o f donor-financed projects. However, these activities are not institutionalized and
are conducted mostly on an ad hoc basis.

108. The Government i s expected to gradually strengthen its institutional capacity to monitor
and evaluate its development strategy including public expenditures. One element o f the strategy
consists in strengthening the CSO. IDA has contributed to the elaboration o f a Statistical Master
Plan for the CSO that includes the development o f the analytical capacity necessary for policy
making. This includes the design, implementation, and analysis o f regularly held households

                                                  30

surveys. This plan will provide the framework for IDA's technical assistance to build capacity to
evaluate and monitor outcomes related to poverty and social development. Reforms supportedby
this Credit, including the implementation o f the PFEM law, the completion o f a baseline study on
health service delivery, and a baseline evaluation o f existing teachers, are part o f this plan to
strengthen the Government's capacity to monitor and evaluates outputs and outcomes.

109. Inthe short term, monitoring and evaluation will focus on processes and inputs, as opposed
to outcomes. Annex 6 describes monitoring and evaluation indicators, which focus on budget and
reform program implementation.

110. The capacity to monitor these indicators has steadily been improving. An AFMIS i s in
place in MoF, providing data on revenues and expenditures. Processes are being improved and
training delivered to improve the reliability o f this system. In addition, ARTF has hred an
international firm to pre-audit expenditures before reimbursements which provides additional
monitoring mechanisms. Extemal audit has also started, with the audit o f ARTF's account for
2002103. As part o f the implementation o f the PFEM law, the budget documents will be more
comprehensive and quarterly reports on budget execution will be released. The Staff-Monitored
Program implemented by the IMF i s expected to increase the frequency and quality o f reporting.
The IMF has also posted a resident advisor to the Treasury. USAID provides assistance to MoF
in the area of budget formulation and salary payments and to DAB for central bank reform.
UNDP provides assistance to prepare the development budget and coordinate donor assistance.
IDA's assistance with financial management, audit, and procurement is expected to further raise
fiduciary standards and improve capacity to monitor revenues and expenditures. IDA's future
work program may also include a Public Expenditure Review (FY05) and a Poverty Assessment
(FY06), which will help monitor public spending as well as its impacts on poverty. This in turn
will permit IDA and the authorities to intensify their dialogue on the equity impact o f public
spending which will also contribute to refine the development strategy.


F.     Credit Administration

 111. Credit Amount, Benejiciary, Terms, and Tranching.             The borrower i s the Islamic
Republic o f Afghanistan, represented by MoF. The Credit i s for an amount equivalent to US$80
million, on standard IDA terms to be released in one tranche following approval o f the Credit and
notification by the Association o f Credit effectiveness. The completion o f the prior actions i s
sufficient to release the Credit.

 112. Implementation, Monitoring and Supervision. Duringthe preparation o f the Credit, IDA
has assisted the authorities to ensure timely implementation o f the agreed measures. Ministries
responsible for monitoring progress have been identified and a plan to monitor indicators
developed.     To assess the impact o f the proposed operation, IDA will monitor progress in
achieving the benchmarks described inthe LDP.

 113. Credit Management. A dedicated Deposit Account in U S Dollars will be established at
DAB in the name o f the MoF. The Account will be managed by the MoF, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. The only funds paid to this account would be the proceeds o f the
Credit.

 114. Disbursements. Uponnotificationby IDA o f Credit effectiveness, and with the submission
by the Recipient o f a withdrawal application, the proceeds o f the Credit will be deposited by IDA
into the Deposit Account o f the Recipient. The proposed Credit will follow IDA's simplified
disbursement procedures for adjustment credits. Disbursements will not be linked to specific
purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. However, the proceeds o f the Credit
cannot be used for ineligible expenditures (i.e. to finance items imported from non-member
countries, or goods and services from the IDA's standard negative list). If, after deposit into the
Deposit Account, the proceeds o f the Credit are used for ineligible expenditures, IDA will require

                                                 31

the Recipient to either (i) the amount to the account for use for eligible purposes, or (ii)
                           retum
refund the amount directly to IDA. Eligible expenditures would include payments by GOAto
meet its external service obligations, provided that there are legal agreements that establish such
external debt service obligations. Transactions and balances o f the Deposit Account will be fully
incorporated into the Govemment's accounting records and financial statements, via the AFMIS.

115. Fiduciary Aspects. Significant progress has been made over the last two years to reduce
fiduciary risks. Under IDA's EPAPs, financial management (implementation o f AFMIS),
procurement (establishment o f a Central Procurement Facilitation unit), and audit (external audit
o f all IDA grants and ARTF for 2002/03) have been strengthened. The IMF hasjust completed a
mission to assess the Central Bank's balance sheet.          The Authorities have also initiated
discussions with the IMF regarding a Safeguard Assessment o f the Central Bank. Overall
progress in raising fiduciary standards i s evidenced by GoA's compliance with standards set by
ARTF. Annex 4 describes inmore details the measures taken to reduce fiduciary risks as well as
GoA's strategy to further reduce these risks. As GOAtakes the whole responsibility for financial
management, procurement, and audit (currently supported by IDA through the EPAPs and other
donors), risks might temporarily increase due to lack o f capacity. However, such temporary
increase i s deemed unavoidable inorder to decrease fiduciary risks inthe long-term.

116. Reporting,Accounting and Auditing. Section 3.02 o f the Development Credit Agreement
gwes IDA the right to require the Borrower to audit the deposit account.          Pursuant to this
provision and considering the prevailing financial management situation in Afghanistan,
immediately following closure o f the Deposit Account, IDA intends to request the Borrower to
have the Deposit Account audited by auditors acceptable to IDA. The terms o f reference for
these auditors will be agreed at negotiations. The Borrower will send a copy o f the audit report to
IDA no later than 6 months following the date o f IDA's request for such an audit. In addition,
IDA may also request audits o f the Deposit Account prior to its closure in accordance with
Section 3.02 o f the Development Credit Agreement.

 117. ClosingDate. The expected closing date o f the Credit will be March 20,2005, which i s the
end o f Afghan fiscal year 1384.

 118. Environmental and Social Aspects. The proposed Credit supports a broad spectrum o f
economy-wide policies and institutions.        For the purpose o f Operational Directive 8.60,
environmental and social assessments are not requiredand the Credit has been placed in category
U. During implementation, the proposed Credit will follow the Social and Environmental
Safeguards Framework applied to other IDA-financed projects.           For that purpose, IDA has
developed a Capacity Assessment and Building for Social and Environmental Management
program, which the M o F and other implementingministries will be invitedto attend.


G.       Coordinationwith the IMFand Other Donors

 119. The achievement o f reform objectives will be supported by IDA's close collaboration with
the IMF and other donors.        The authorities' overall reform program i s designed within a
satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework as evidenced by the implementation o f a 12-month
S M P covering the Afghan fiscal year starting March 21, 2004 (Annex 2). The SMP's structural
benchmarks also place considerable focus on promoting fiscal discipline and further developing
public financial accountability.   The preparation and future implementation o f the proposed
Credit i s being closely coordinated with the IMF.            The PSIBs incorporate the SMP
macroeconomic framework and are fully consistent with its structural benchmarks. The PSIBs
are also consistent with the support provided by donors through the ARTF. Indeed, ARTF
funding is integrated inthe medium-term fiscal framework supported by the PSIBs while ARTF
provides key fiduciary standards aiming at mitigating fiduciary risks (Annex 4).



                                                 32

120. Many donors are active in the reform program supported by the proposed PSIBs. This
reform program has been discussed with other donors and will provide a platform to coordinate
donor's support around GOA'Sstrategy. Its implementation requires significant TA under IDA
projects (EPAPIand 11,and EPAP111under preparation), ARTF, and IMF and bilateral supports.

121. The authorities have initiated discussions with IDA for the preparation o f an Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper which will lay the basis for future donor coordination.


H. PovertyImplications

122. The Government has demonstrated a clear concern for both economic and social issues,
through the NDF and national budget. As described inits development strategy, the Government
aims to support broadbased economic growth, while designing and implementing an efficient and
comprehensive social protection program. The Government has already introduced a number o f
social programs (see para. 18). By increasing and allocating fiscal resources in line with the
Government's medium term priorities, the Credits will have positive impacts on poverty
reduction. The Credits will also help ensure that public spendingprogressively be targeted more
effectively in the areas o f health, basic education and social protection, while ensuring country-
wide coverage.


I. BenefitsandRisks
123. Benefits.    The Credits provide potential benefits which will all contribute to poverty
reduction.   First, they strengthen public administration and fiscal management, and support
reforms to improve fiduciary standards. This will reduce the implementation risks o f all projects
including these Credits, and i s likely to translate into higher levels o f donors' assistance. Second,
they provide resources to the central Government to deepen its reformprogram including service
delivery beyond Kabul. This will benefit the whole population including the poor. Third, they
also support the implementation of reforms leading to a more efficient allocation o f fiscal
resources in the areas o f human development and private sector development, which will reduce
poverty.

124. Risks. The Credits have significant country risks (political, security and macroeconomics)
and implementation risks (fiduciary, budget execution and reform implementation). A reversal in
the political process set out in the Bonn agreements or a deterioration o f the security situation
constitutes the largest source o f risk for the operations.           The recent conclusion o f the
Constitutional Loya Jirga has somewhat reduced this risk, but the elections scheduled for the fall
o f 2004 remain a significant source o f uncertainty.         The macroeconomic scenario i s also
uncertain since donors' assistance and the response o f the private sector are highly dependent on
the political and security situation, as outlined in Section 11.

125. The mitigation o f these country risks i s largely outside the scope o f the project. However,
the Credits will allow the Government to deepen the implementation o f its program beyond
Kabul, which will contribute to the nation-building effort and will somewhat mitigate political
and security risks. Strengthening the Central Government could increase tensions with regional
leaders, which could slow down the nation-building process.

 126. The Credits also have implementation risks. First, fiduciary standards, while improving,
partially as the result o f this Credit, are not yet fully effective.         Budgetary systems and
mechanisms, includingtax administration and collection, still needto be improved. Second, there
i s room for improvement in the execution o f the Budget, and implementing the reform program
may be a challenge during an election year. Third, implementation capacity, particularly at the
sub-national level and across sectoral ministries, remains constrained. However, even though the
commitment to the reform programo f the post-election Government remains to be evidenced, this

                                                   33

Government has already demonstrated its commitment to reforms by achieving all benchmarks
under the two tranches o f the ADB budget support operation.

127. To mitigate the risk o f implementation, prior actions and triggers focus on areas for which
the authorities, under the leadership o f the MoF, have expressed ownership and have already built
a good track record o f reforms. IDA and other donors are also supporting the Government's
efforts to improve its implementation capacity through investments and technical assistance. The
present operation also aims at strengthening the Government's structure (para. 45), personnel
management (para. 47-55) and subnational administration (para. 57). Continued IDA support
through the EPAPs, together with the next Credit's triggers, inthe areas o f financial management,
audit and procurement, will also contribute to raising fiduciary standards. Finally, the program
design as a series o f operations based on prior actions provides IDA with a possibility to adjust
subsequent operations to the security and political situation and the pace o f reform
implementation.

128. The risk o f not undertakmg these operations also i s significant. First, IDA'Ssupport to
GOA'Sdevelopment strategy under the form o f PSIBs is seen as a catalyst for other donors'
continuing support, including through the ARTF. Second, the resources provided by the PSIBs
will allow the authorities to deepen the reform program and quickly deliver services throughout
the country, thereby reducing the risk o f further deterioration o f the political and security
situations.

Background

1.         The Afghan Transitional Authority began its task o f reconstruction in an environment that
was virtually unparalleled. Two decades o f conflict had reduced physical and social infrastructure to
skeletal proportions. Coherent government and administration were non-existent. Social indicators
were among the world's lowest, and simply maintaining security was an immense challenge. During
the first two years o f administration, the government's central focus has been on emergency
interventions and crisis management, along with workmg to establish or rebuild the fundamental
institutions and services necessary for any state. The progress over this period i s recognized by the
international community as a monumental achievement by the Government o f Afghanistan. N o w that
many o f these building blocks are in place, the govemment's goals are increasingly focused on
establishing a greater sense o f economic and political `normalcy', while ensuring a high degree o f
government transparency and accountability.

2.         Establishing the institutions and processes necessary for a peaceful political transition has
been at the forefront o f the govemment's agenda, and in line with commitments made at the Bonn
Conference. The Constitution approved by the Loya Jirga inearly January 2004 was signed into law
by President Karzai on January 26, and is a critical first step inreestablishing an effective democratic
unified state. The new Constitution establishes a strong presidency with wide ranging powers and
checks and balances through a bicameral legislative body. Although Dan and Pashto are identifiedas
the national official languages, other languages were given official status in the areas where they are
spoken. The adoption o f the new Constitutionprovides for national elections in 2004, and fulfills the
timetable agreed upon at the Bonn Conference. Voter registration i s proceeding, although slower
than hoped, partly reflectingthe security conditions.

3.         Rebuildingeconomic and financial institutions and implementing sound macroeconomic
policies have been clear priorities.      Important economic and institutional reforms have been
undertaken. In the fiscal sector, the Government has focused on improving budgetary management,
enacting some important tax policy measures, introducing an ambitious program of customs reform,
and gaining control over national revenue. The budget has been guided by the "no-overdraft rule,"
which will remain a pillar o f fiscal policy for 2004/05. A draft Public Finance and Expenditure
Management (PFEM) law will be presented to the cabinet this fiscal year. In the monetary and
financial sector, a new currency was successfully launched and has gained acceptance by the public.
Monetary policy has been conducted with a view to guarding against inflation, providing a stable
exchange rate, and building an adequate level o f international reserves.         New financial sector
legislation has established autonomy for the central bank and paves the way for the creation o f a
modernbanking sector.

4.         The Government i s committed to fiscal transparency to the international community and
the people o f Afghanistan. InJune 2004, a comprehensive financial report on 1380-82 was released
by the Government on the resources available to the Government, how they were utilized and
detailing the modalities o f expenditure by the donor community outside the Government accounts.
The Government will publicly release the budget and provide a full accounting for its use.

Recent Economic Developments

5.         During2003104, real GDP (excluding opium) is estimated to have grown by 23 percent,
following 29 percent in 2002103, although these high figures represent growth from a very low base.
Construction and service sectors benefited from donor assistance, while agncultural production
recovered as a result o f increased rainfall, the retum o f refugees to their lands, and an expansion o f
cultivated acreage. However, the government i s deeply concemed about a similarly strong recovery
inopiumproduction, which represents an estimated 40 percent o fformal GDP.

6.          Consumer prices rose by 52 percent in 2002103. While prices remained relatively flat
during March-October 2003, prices rose by 3 percent in both November and December, mainly
driven by food prices, which were associated with Ramadan and colder-than-usual weather at end-
year. Pnces in January and February fell modestly, with year-over-year inflation at 10percent at the
endo f2003104.

7.          These encouraging developments reflected a monetary policy focused on maintainingprice
stability, in the context o f a relatively stable exchange rate. Monetary policy was executed through
control over the growth of currency in circulation. Despite the lack o f sophisticated monetary policy
instruments, the government has had considerable success in meeting its monetary objectives.
Increases in money demand brought about by increases in real growth and increased use o f the
Afghani have been accommodated while simultaneously avoiding excessive inflationary pressure.
Currency in circulation increased by 41 percent in the twelve months to March 2004. This growth
was also reflected in accumulation o f foreign exchange reserves. Intemational reserves increased by
$294 million through March 2004, to a level equivalent to 3 months o f imports.

8.          The enactment o f the new central bank and commercial banking laws, in 2003, paves the
way for modemizing of the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) and the entry o f new commercial banks.
The new laws provide a framework for an independent and accountable central bank and the creation
o f a sound financial system. Progress has already been achieved in reorganizing and modemizing
DAB, including building an information technology (IT) system, designing a national payment
network, and reestablishing communications between DAB'Sheadquarters and some o f its territorial
branches.    The monitoring o f monetary developments has also improved substantially. Further,
consistent with the Central Bank Law, a new corporate structure has been established, including the
appointment o f Supreme Council to oversee DAB'Soperations and to ensure accountability.              In
addition, five new commercial banks were licensed in2003104.

9.          Fiscal policy in 2003104 facilitated monetary control through continued adherence to the
"no-overdraft-rule,'' which forbids monetary financing o f the budget. Domestic revenues exceeded
the Af9 billion budgetary target with Af10.2 billion revenues ($209 million). Spending was slow
early in the year, due to delays in budget allotments, procurement constraints, and weak financial
management capacity in the Ministries.          However, ministries steadily accelerated their pace o f
spending through the course o f the year, and expenditures reached Af 22.1 billion ($457 million) by
the end of the financial year, compared with a budgeted amount o f Af 24.8 billion ($550 million).
The lower level o f spending compared to the budget principally reflects lower outlays by the
education, health, defense, interior, and foreign affairs ministries.        Donor disbursements have
amounted to about $239 million in2003104 (compared to a budgeted level o f $350 million), allowing
for the financing o f the budget and a small carry-over o f available financing into the upcoming year.
Donor commitments for 2003104 covered about 70 percent o f the requirements expressed in the
National Development Budget adopted in March 2003. As a result, high-priority projects were able
to be implemented ininfrastructure, education, and other critical areas.

 10.        Significant progress has also been made in fiscal management, where the immediate task
has been to identify and eliminate waste, and to reassert transparent control over public finances. The

                                                                                                 Annex 3
                                                                                             Page 4 of 10

major achievements include: (a) the introductiono f Afghanistan's FinancialManagement Information
System (AFMIS), a computerized system for expenditure recording, payment processing, and
financing reporting; (b) the assignment o f fiscal advisors to provincial offices o f the Ministry o f
Finance (Mustofiats) as well as to a number o f line ministries to assist with financial management and
reporting; (c) a budget process for 2004/05 which evolved from a top-down approach controlled by
the M o F to one that was driven by the ministries with a strong Cabinet consensus; (d) the progressive
consolidation o f government bank accounts to strengthen treasury control over cash flows; (e) initial
steps toward a modern payroll system; (f) the increased integration o f the operational and
development budgets; and (g) comprehensive traclung o f external resources by MoF and other
ministries through the Donor Assistance Database and integration with the budget preparation
process. The comparatively slow progress in the provinces highlights the need for continued focus
and support to bringresponsible fiscal management to the country as a whole.

11.        Onthe revenue side, a landmark customs reform package was enacted, which will ineffect
make Afghanistan one o f the most open economies in the region. The package includes using the
market exchange rate for import valuation, streamlining the tariff structure, putting in place new
broker processes, and lowering tariff rates from the current range o f 0 to 150 percent to six rates
ranging from 2.5 to 16 percent. Inaddition, an important set of new revenue measures was enacted,
including a final wage withholding tax on higher-income employees, an improved income tax regime,
a streamlined business establishment tax, a tax on a limited range o f services consumed by high-
income earners (e.g. hotels and restaurants), and other revenue measures (rent tax, land tax, and an
airport departure fee). Considerable progress has been made in securing the transfer o f provincial
revenues to the center in 2003/04 and the accounting o f these revenues. However, efforts will
continue to improve revenue collection mechanisms, including verification o f the total amount o f
provincial revenues and expenditures.

12.        Inthe area of civil service reform, the government designedaprogramto decompress the
civil service salary structure to help the government attract and retain qualified staff in key positions.
A large proportional increase in the base salary o f civil servants was decided in December 2003
(excluding the military, police, and teachers who had previously received a separate pay increase).
This increase ranged from 13 percent for the lowest grade to 130 percent for the highest grade, with
an overall average increase o f about 25 percent. Despite the increase, base salaries remainvery low.

13.        Efforts have also been made by the government to eliminate "ghost" workers from public
payrolls. A Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) program was launched by decree in July 2003
and provides the primary mechanisms for promoting administrative reforms across government
departments and agencies. Managed by the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service
Commission (IARCSC) under the oversight o f the Ministerial Advisory Committee on public
administration reforms, the PRR framework enables departments to transfer/appoint key staff in
reformed units to higher salary scales. By the end o f 2003/04, thirty-six departments had been
granted PRR status and approximately 3,000 civil servants were transferred to the PRR scales in these
departments.

14.        The Government is committed to an agenda o f public enterprise reform as an engine o f
future economic growth. Initial steps includethe establishment o f a census o f state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) and audits of the assets of SOEs. Progress to date has been limited by lack o f records and
absence o f foreign assistance in this area. Despite this, the Govemment expects to reform a number
o f key public enterprises and put inplace a strategy for implementationo f a long term reformagenda.

15.        The Government considers poppy cultivation and heroin production to be one o f the most
serious obstacles to developing Afghanistan into a secure, stable democracy with a prosperous
economy. Many Afghan farmers have been driven into poppy production by decades o f deep poverty
and lack o f alternative livelihoods.     But the drug economy has benefited mostly international

                                                                                                                Annex 3
                                                                                                           Page 5 of 10

narcotics and terrorist networks. The Government i s deeply committedto root out this grave threat to
Afghanistan's future.            It has therefore passed broad anti-narcotics legislation, banning all opium
production and trading. It has established an Anti-Narcotics Directorate and adopted a National Drug
Control Strategy that aims to reduce opium production by 70 percent by 2008, and eliminate it
altogether within ten years.                    An ambitious eradication program was launched that led to the
destruction o f more than 20,000 hectares o f poppy fields during the 2002-2003 season.

                                                11. THEGOVERNMENT'S        STRATEGY

16.        The Government has made significant progress since it came to power inJune 2002. It has
demonstrated its capacity to implement its ambitious reform program. It demonstrated achievement
o f benchmarks under the two tranches o f the ADB budget support operation and received full
disbursement o f the fund according to the original schedule - a momentous achievement which
demonstrates the capacity o f the Government to deliver against fiscal reform targets.                              The
Government has also entered into an ADB agriculture sector reform program and was able to fulfill
all prior conditions on schedule. On March 21, 2004, the Government started the implementation o f
an IMF's Staff Monitored Program.

17.        Yet, the Government's challenge is now to apply its authority nationally and to implement
reforms that, beyond the initial steps o f state building, will generate broad-based growth. For that, in
the short to medium term, the Government needs multi-year financial support that i s not linked to
specific projects, but that can support its reform program.

18.        Initially formulated in the National Development Framework (NDF) o f April 2002, the
Government's development strategy was reaffirmed in the document Securing Afghanistan s Future
presented by to the intemational community at the donors' conference held in Berlin at end-March
2004.' Within this reform strategy, the Government i s primarily seelng support to deepen, broaden
and sustain the reforms underway in the areas o f public administration and fiscal management. The
proposed reform program builds on ongoing reforms to strengthen the budget process, increase the
administrative capacity o f line ministries and sub-national governments, develop revenue policy and
administration, improve civil service effectiveness, and increase fiduciary standards in the areas o f
financial management, procurement and audit. These reforms will also facilitate a more efficient
allocation o f fiscal resources to priority activities in the areas o f human development (health, basic
education and social protection) and private sector development (investment climate, financial sector,
and state-owned enterprises).

19.         The key elements o f the reform program on fiscal management and public administration
are as follows.

20.         Revenues Collection.                     The Government's strategy i s to increase domestic revenues to
cover the wage bill in 5 years and ordinary budget expenditures in 9 years. Increase intax collection
efficiency i s also expected to result in a significant increase in compliance over the next five years.
The Cabinet has recently introduced an ambitious tax package that includes new customs tariffs and
the elimination of tax holidays for new investments, a withholding tax on highincome, a streamlined
business tax, a tax on selected services, a rent tax, a land tax, and an airport departure fee.

21.         Government Structure. The Government intends to restructure and rationalize the central
Government bureaucracy and strengthen policy design and program implementation capacity in
ministries. The PRRProgramdecree was enacted inJuly 2003 to initiate the process o f reforming the

commitment to implement the reform agenda agreed at the recent Intemational Conference on Afghanistan held
inBerlininMarch2004 (annex to the "Berlin Conference").

                                                                                                Annex 3
                                                                                           Page6oflO

most critical functions o f the Govemment by allowing administrative departments to place staff on an
elevated pay scale in exchange for organizational restructuring. 3,000 positions are covered by this
program and the Government i s fully committed to pursue its implementation. The first Program
Management Unit (PMU) has been created in the Ministry o f Imgation to enhance project ownership
by line ministries and strengthen implementation capacity. Such unitsare expected to be responsible
for the preparation, procurement, financial management, supervision, and evaluation o f projects
which should hasten their implementation. The Government also intends to improve the bureaucracy
o f central Government, which includes reform o f the Office o f the President.

22.         Sub-nationalAdministration. Provinces' andprovincial municipalities' capacities will be
strengthened to deliver basic services. Basic office facilities have been upgraded in 6 pilot districts to
improve service delivery and provide the means to connect citizens with central Govemment. Budget
allotments to provinces are gradually being increased. Budget grants could be provided to Provinces
for public building reconstruction.      The recently created Afghanistan Stabilization Program will
finance small-scale labor-intensive construction projects. Modest grants could also be provided to
provincial municipalitiesto finance the reconstruction o f the municipalities' own building,local roads
and water and sanitation programs and some labor-intensive works. Municipalities' capacity will
require strengthening to effectively manage these resources.

23.         Civil Service.   An Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission
(IARCSC) was created in June 2003 to coordinate and manage the PRR. The IARCSC comprises (i)
a Civil Service Management Department responsible for developing a new legal framework
(including a Code o f Ethics) for the Civil Service and modem human resources management policies
and procedures, (ii)  the Independent Appointments Board (IAB), responsible to have appointments
based on merit, and (iii)   the Independent Appeals Board responsible for hearing complaints against
unfair, illegal or discriminatory behavior in the workplace.        Merit-based procedures have been
adopted and the IABhas started applying them. An updated legislative framework will be adopted to
define civil service, its role, lays down ethical standards, and regulates civil servants' terms and
conditions in line with modem employment practice. The upcoming adoption o f a Civil Service Law
will establish a legal framework for civil service in line with good modern employment practices.
Appointments are expectedto be increasingly based on merit andprogressively audited.

24.         The strategy to control legitimacy o f public employment and progressively reduce delays in
payroll settlement i s as follows.    In the short term, first, the Government is decentralizing the
processing o f payroll to Provinces. Second, individualized salary payments are piloted in ten central
Ministries in Kabul and will be rolled-out to all central Ministries this year and, then, gradually to
provinces. Third, a headcount database has been created to control the size of the civil service. In
addition, the Monitoring Agent o f ARTF conducts spot checks on payroll distribution including
individual cash payments. Also, in the longer term, the Government aims at improving personnel
management and computerizing processes. This will contribute to speeding up the payroll process
(through computerization) and validate the legitimacy o f public employment (through random audit).

25.         The Government's objective to enhance the level o f human resources i s by nature a long
term endeavor.     In the short-term, the PRR program provide an opportunity to administrative
departments to restructure themselves and increase salaries for key positions while accessing funds to
provide significant training to retained staff. In addition, the Government i s designing a lateral entry
program to hire advisors on short-term contracts at competitive rate and place them in key positions.
This program would allow us to attract skdled employees while limitingpressures on the whole pay
structure. In the longer term, the Government intends to conduct a training and development needs
analysis, design and implement a Retraining, Reskilling and Redeployment Program, and build a
proper humanresourcemanagement systemto continuously enhance slulls.

                                                                                               Annex 3
                                                                                            Page 7 of I O

26.        The Government intends to pursue the implementation o f the PRR program and increase
the number o f employees under PRR. Beyond this initial reform, the Government intends to carry out
a labor market survey to be used as a base for a civil service pay and grading review. The
Government just increased the pensions o f public sector employees from about US$1 million to an
estimated US$15 million in the 2004/05 Budget. This short-term measure i s associated with a
commitment to review operations and management o f the Pension Fund Office and refrain from any
increase inpensionbefore the adoption o f a long-termpolicy regarding pension.

27.        The Government i s committed to correct the gender imbalance and promote the role o f
women in civil service. The strategy consists in establishing targets for increased level o f female
employment and develop and implement a plan to achieve these targets.

28.        Public Finance and Expenditure Management. The Ministry of Finance has completed
the final draft o f the Public Finance and Expenditure Management (PEFM) Law. The PFEM Law
provides a framework for the proper management o f public resources. It specifies the budget process
(including the requirement to base the budget on a medium-term economic framework) and content
(including transfers to public sector enterprises). It also mandates the budget to be presented by
programs, defines the standards o f transparency and financial reporting, and mandate the design and
implementation o f a multi-year fiscal framework. The PFEM Law will mandate quarterly reporting
on public finances, as well as the preparation and auditing o f annual financial accounts.

29.        Financial Management. Four elements are key for the Government's strategy to
strengthen financial management. First, Mustofiats are beingtrained to reduce delays inreporting. A
decentralization process i s being planned and AFMIS i s expected to be rolled out to line ministries
and provinces. The PFEM Law mandates the appointment o f a Chief Financial Officer in each line
ministry, which will increase financial management accountability. It is envisaged that the line
ministries where Chief Financial Officers are in place will be provided more financial management
responsibilities, includingpayments, accounting, and reporting. Second, MoF will strengthen its cash
management system. Treasury in cooperation with DAB will fully implement the TSA. Third, a
strategy i s inplace to gradually shift all financial management capacities to Treasury, while external
firms would focus only on advisory and training services. Fourth. MoF's Internal Audit Department
i s being strengthened as part o f M o F reform and the legal and institutional framework will be
clarified.

30.        ExternalAudit. An update ofthe legal framework, including an Audit Law, will establish
a clear framework for extemal audit: requirement to audit annual financial accounts, requirement for
the Government to respond to the Auditor's opinion, independence o f the auditor. This will be
complemented by capacity buildingprograms.

31.        Procurement. Three elements are key for the Government's strategy to strengthen public
procurement. First, the legal framework will be clarified by a new Procurement Law. Second, the
reform strategy seeks to address the lack o f capacity through the assistance o f a central procurement
consultant (currently supported by IDA through the EPAP project). While this consultant initially
provided direct procurement services, it will gradually move towards advisory services. Third, the
institutional framework will be strengthened to transfer procurement management from donors to line
ministries as capacity i s built through new recruitment (by implementing PRR in procurement units)
and training.      A central Public Procurement Unit will be created to monitor and review the
procurement policies.

                       111. STRUCTURAL REFORM        AGENDAUNDER       PSIBI

32.      The measures described in this section are considered critical to demonstrate the
Government's commitment to the reform program. The following measures have been taken before
approval o f the proposed Credit:

      Cabinet adoption o f an ordinary and a development budget for its fiscal year 1383, which,
      among other things, contains: (i)an adequate financing and fiscal framework, which shows
      the sources of the financing o f the deficit; (ii)an increase in aggregate allocations to
      provinces above allotments in fiscal year 1382; (iii)an increase in aggregate non-salary
      allocations to provinces above allotments in fiscal year 1382; (iv) an increase inthe allocation
      to the Basic Package o f Health Services above fiscal year 1382; (v) an increase in the
      ordinary budgetary allocation to the Ministry o f Education above fiscal year 1382; and (vi) an
      increase inthe allocation to the National Solidarity Program above fiscal year 1382.

       Submission to the Ministry o f Justice a draft o f the Public Finance and Expenditure
      Management Law, which includes the budget preparation process and applicable standards o f
       transparency and financial reporting.

                                               ANNEX 4
                          PROGRESSINREDUCINGFIDUCIARYRISKS


1.       Significant progress has been made over the last two years to reduce fiduciary risks. A key
objective o f the PSIBs i s to support the Government's strategy to further reduce risks, a prerequisite
to effectively deliver public services and implement Government's policies. This annex describes
these fiduciary risks, progress made by the Government, and its strategy to further reduce fiduciary
risks.

2.       In the past two years, GOA,with the assistance of a number o f international advisers, has
made significant progress to reduce fiduciary risks. First, the development o f financial management,
procurement, and audit has been supported under IDA'SEmergency Public Administration Projects
(EPAP). In these three areas, international firms have been contracted to develop and implement
fiduciary systems and build Government's capacity.              A financial management system, the
Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) has been implemented since
October 2002. A Central Procurement Facilitation unit has been set up. The Controller and Audit
Office  (CAO) has prepared external audits for all IDA grants and ARTF for the solar year 2002/03.
As part o f the IDA portfolio review conducted inFebruary 2004, progress on these projects has been
rated satisfactory, although administrative capacity still needs to be enhanced. Second, disbursements
under ARTF demand the application o ffiduciary standards inline with international standards. These
standards have been monitored since September 2003 by the Monitoring Agent of ARTF and their
compliance is a condition for expenditure reimbursement.            The application o f these standards
generates overall improvement in GOA'Spractices. Third, capacity i s being built in line ministries as
external advisors provide Technical Assistance in the area o f budget and financial management
(budget advisors are funded by DfIDand ChiefFinancial Officers by ARTF).

3.       To consolidate this progress, the Government's strategy i s to continue to build systems and
institutions, and strengthen its technical capacity to operate these systems (see Table below). First,in
terms o f institutions, the Treasury Department and the Budget Department have undergone the PRR
reform process and the Internal Audit Department will soon apply to this process. A Public Finance
and Expenditure Management Law, a Procurement Law, and an Audit Law will be adopted and
implemented, creating a strong legal basis for public finance management. In terms o f systems, the
AFMIS will be gradually rolled-out to line ministries and provinces, improving the effectiveness and
timeliness o f the overall system.     Second, to strengthen the Government's technical capacity to
operate these systems, the role o f international firms in the area o f procurement, financial
management, and audit i s expected to gradually shift towards training and advisory services. As a
result, GOAwill gradually take full responsibility in these areas. Already (as o f February 2004),
payments and accounting for Kabul are largely done by MoF staff, and payments and reporting for
Provinces are done by Mustofiat's staff (MoF's provincial departments) while the international firms
supported by EPAP operate a number o f coordination and reporting functions in Kabul. Finally, the
IMFhasjust completed a mission to assess the Central Bank's balance sheet. The Authorities have
also initiated discussions with the IMFregardinga Safeguard Assessment o fthe Central Bank.

4.       The PSlBs support this strategy and particularly the following measures:

     0   Submission to Ministry o f Justice o f a draft o f the Public Finance and Expenditure
         Management (PFEM) Law constitutes a prior action for PSIB Iand its enactment and
         implementation are critical triggers for PSIB 11. The law i s expected to increase standards o f
         financial management, by clarifying systems and accountability and establishing fundamental
         rules interms o ftransparency, reporting, accounting, and auditing.

                                                                                               Annex 4
                                                                                             Page 2 of 5


    0   Completion o f the draft o f the Procurement Law and procurement regulations constitutes a
        prior action for PSIB Iand its enactment and the creation o f a Public Procurement Unit are
        critical triggers for PSIB 11. The law will establish a clear institutional framework and raise
        procurement rules up to international standards.

    0   Preparation o f the Audit Law constitutes a trigger for PSIB 11. The law i s expected to give a
        clear authority to the external auditor (CAO).

    0   External assistance addressing fiduciarv risks i s also a key element o f the PSIBs. EPAP
        projects will continue to provide technical support for the implementation o f the Afghanistan
        Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) and will gradually shift their focus from
        operations to capacity building. Steady implementation o f the IMF Staff Monitored Program
        will also mitigate fiduciary risks as the SMP includes benchmarks progress on bank
        reconciliation of fiscal accounts and the implementation o f a Treasury Single Account that
        integrate provincial Mustofiat balances.

5.      By supporting these policies, the PSIBs provide a necessary complement to the EPAP
projects, which focus on technical assistance, in order to deepen, broaden, and sustain the reforms
underway in the areas o f public administration and fiscal management. Supporting the Govemment's
strategy to build institutions, systems, and skills inorder to gradually take over complete management
o f public resources i s a key enabling factor to effectively deliver public services and a necessary
component o f a long-term, sustainable approach. Three main benefits are expected from this strategy:
(i)directpositiveimpactonthequalityofpublicexpenditures;(ii)positiveimpactontheimageof
   a                                                                   a
Government and by way o f consequence on the nation-building effort; and (iii)a positive impact on
donors' willingness to mobilize more resources for Afghanistan and use the Government to manage
their projects.

6.       Progress on implementing this strategy and further reducing fiduciary risks will be closely
monitored by IDA (see Annex 6 on Monitoring and Evaluation). A joint Public Expenditure Review
and Country Financial Accountability Assessment i s scheduled for FY05.

                                               ANNEX 5
                                  REVIEW OF 2004/05 BUDGET


1.      The purpose o f this annex i s to describe Afghanistan's Budget for the solar year 1383 (March
21, 2004 to March 20,2005). This description will be a key base o f monitoring and evaluation during
project implementation. The first two sections describe the 2004105 Ordinary and the Development
Budgets. The third section outlines the execution o fthe 2003/04 Budget.

2.       The National Budget has two components. The Ordinary Budget includes the wage bill, most
non-salary recurrent costs, and some capital expenditures.     The Development Budget includes all
technical assistance, most capital expenditures, and some recurrent costs (e.g. health services
contracted out).    Treasury executes the Ordinary Budget, while donors largely execute the
Development Budget. The Ordinary Budget i s structured around ministries, while the Development
Budget i s composed of projects structured around development programs. The Ordinary Budget i s
based on the principle o f annuity, while the Development Budget i s prepared for three rolling years.
In2004105 for the first time, the development budget is presented in two components, the core
budget, including resources flowing through the Treasury, and the extemal budget. Also for the first
time, a consolidated budget, including operating expenditures and development expenditures, has
been approved and the 2004/05 consolidated core budget i s fully financed.

3.       The Ordinary Budget was approved on March 18,2004 and the DevelopmentBudget on June
30, 2004. A description o fthe Budget i s available at http://www.af./mofibudaet/index.html.

                                 I.2004/05ORDINARYBUDGET

4.       Total expenditures are set at US$609 million and are expected to be financed by US$309
million fi-om domestic revenues and US$300 million from extemal assistance.             This represents
expenditures o f 10.9 GDPpoints and revenues o f 5.5 GDP points.

5.       Revenues. The main source of revenues is import duties (54 percent, Table I).
Administrative fees, which include overflight fees from the Intemational Air Transport Association
(expected to reach US$18 million in2004/05) as well as fees on traders, are the second largest source
of revenues (18 percent).    Incidental sales by market establishment account for an additional 15
percent o f revenues.   Overall, tax revenues account for two thirds o f the revenue and non-tax
revenues for one third.




                        Source: MoF/Treasury, Staff estimates.

6.       Revenues are projected to grow from an estimated US$208 million in 1382 to a target o f
US$309 million, a US$lOl million increase. This would be driven by four elements:

                                                                                                    Annex 5
                                                                                                 Page 2 of 7

        A first assumption is that economic growth will continue at a high level (1WO),          generating
        about US$20 million additional revenue.

        Second, continued progress to increase compliance at border posts would generate US$26
        million. The customs reform adopted in 2003 (use o f market exchange rates for import
        valuation, streamlined tariff structure - moving from 25 tariff rates ranging from 0-150
        percent to 6 rates ranging 2.5-16 percent) i s under implementation since the beginningo f the
        fiscal year.

        Third, new policy reforms enacted during the year (a final wage withholding tax on higher
        income employees, a tax on a limited range o f services consumed by high income earners,
        and a rent tax, see Table 2) are expected to generate an additionalUS$14 million.

        Fourth, collection performance i s expected to improve, as a result o f administrative reforms,
        investments and technical assistance in the customs and tax administration, generating a
        US$41million increase.


               Law                                                 Reform

  Rent Tax                        Tax (20%) on rent for rents above -$200/month

7.      The IMF views this target as potentially achievable, but considers that it constitutes a high-
case scenario. Its Staff Monitored Programis based on an assumption o f US$256 million revenues in
2004105.

8.      Economic Classification. The wage bill accounts for 57 percent o f the ordinary budget
(Table 3).   Together with pensions and debt service, non-discretionary expenditures amount to 61
percent o f ordinary expenditures. Purchase o f goods and services account for 24 percent and capital
expenditures for 7 percent. Other expenditures (8 percent) include transfers and contingencies.

9.      Wage Bill. Public employment is capped at 406,000 inthe budget. Excluding Ministries of
Defense and Interior and National Security, the civil service i s capped at 269,200 employees. For the
civil service, the budgeted average salary i s around Af2,900 (around US$60) per month (this amount

                                                                                                  Annex 5

includes provisions for travel).     In addition, the budget includes a US$34 million provision for
allowances under the Prionty Reform and Restructuring scheme.

10.     Debt Service. Debt service (US$5.5 million) includes both principal and interest payments
to service debt. Current debt service i s mainly directed to international financial institutions.

11.     Pensions. Civil and military pension payments are expectedto reachUS$14.5 million. The
number o f pensioners from the Government are estimated at 50,000 and, as a result o f a recent
Cabinet decision, their pension i s expected to increase from US$21 to US$290per year.

12.     Other RecurrentExpenses. Other expenses first include the purchase of goods and services
(US$144 million). Transfers also include allowances given to disabled and heirs o f martyrs, as well
as transfers made by the Ministry o f Interior. Contingencies are set at 5 percent o f the budget.
Contrary to the first two Budgets o f this administration, no reserve has been set aside for transfers to
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), including to pay SOE staffs wages.

13.     CapitalExpenditures. The ordinary budget includes aprovision for about US$45 million of
capital expenditures. This includes small capital investments in a number o f ministries. A specific
amount i s earmarked for projects seeking to improve air safety because the implementation o f such
projects i s a condition to receive overflight fees.

14.     Comparisonwith 2003/04. 2004105 Budget is US$156 million above 2003104 expenditures
(and USS59 million above 2003104 Budget, Table 7). US$l05 million o f this increment reflect an
increase in salaries. This i s drivenby four elements:

    0   Recruitment of and pay increase for teachers: agreed employment for the Ministry of
        Education i s 162,000, a 37,000 increase on the level at mid-year. In addition, the full-year
        impact o f the pay increase decided in 2003 for teachers i s included in the 2004105 Budget
        (US$37 million);
    0   Full-year impact of 1382pay increase: a general pay increase was decided in December
        2003 for civil servants (other than policemen and teachers, who had separate pay increases).
        I t s annual cost was estimated at US$22 million (incremental cost o f US$ 13 million);
    0   Funding of PRR decree: while no civil servant received PRR allowances in 2003104, it i s
        expected that 30,000 civil servants will receive it by the end o f the year (US$34 million);
    0   Security financing: Additional funding i s provided to the Ministry o f Interior (including to
        cover the pay increase for policemen decided in 2003), National Security, and the Afghan
        National Army (the latter reflects that an increasing number o f soldiers are now on
        Government's payroll). This i s partly offset by a decreased allocation to the Ministry o f
        Defense, reflecting the impact of the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration
        program (net total cost o fUS$20 million).

15.     The rest o f the increase (VSS51 million) first reflects higher pension payments (US$14
million). In addition, contingency funds (by definition absent from expenditures) are set at US$28
million.

16.     Functional Classification. Education is the largest function o f the Ordinary Budget (21
percent), while funding for health (4 percent) and social protection (1percent) i s quite low, reflecting
the use o f the Development Budget to finance a large part o f these programs (Table 4). Defense and
public order functions account for 40 percent o f the Ordinary Budget. Reserve finds are quite high
(16 percent) since they include special allowances (for PRR, pensions, debt service, as well as
Martyrs and Disabled) as well as some contingencies (5 percent o f the Budget).               Compared to
2003104, the main Budget increases are for education and public order and safety.

17.      Provincial Expenditures. In 2003/04, only 29 percent o f the first quarter's allotment was
allocated to Provinces.     In particular, Provinces received only 7 percent of the first quarter's
allotment.   In 2004/05, the first quarter's allotment for Provinces is 27 percent higher than the
previous year.

                               11. 2004/05 DEVELOPMENTBUDGET

18.      The Development Budget for 2004/05 is set at US$4,524 million. This represents 74 percent
of the GDP. For the first time, the Development Budget i s presented in two components. The Core
Development Budget, set at US$1,070 million, includes all expenditures managed by the Treasury
and i s fully financed. The External Development Budget, set at US$3,455 million, includes projects
managedby donors directly and i s partially financed.

19.      The Development Budget is biased towards economic services (29 percent), because o f the
cost of large infrastructure investments (Table 6).             Social protection (12 percent) and health (6
percent) are also significant components o f this budget because they include recurrent costs such as
the provision o f a basic package o f health services (contracted to NGOs), aid to refugees and IDP, and
transfer programs such as the National Emergency Employment Program and the National Solidarity
Program. The Core Development Budget also includes a reserve fund to allocate to National Priority
Programs and to co-financed other projects.

20.      The 2004/05 DevelopmentBudget includes the new Afghanistan Stabilization Program, with
expenditures expected at US$81 million. The expected expenditures for the Basic Package o f Health
Services (for mothers and infants, and children under 5) and for the National Solidarity Program are
US$90 million and US$168 million.


                                     111. 2003/04 BUDGETEXECUTION

21.      Ordinary Budget Outcomes. The deficit on the Ordinary Budget (before extemal grants)
was planned at U S 3 4 9 million and reached US$245 million, reflecting the fact that expenditures
were US$98 million below plan (Table 7). This inpart reflects a depreciation o f the Afghani against
the Dollar. In addition, salary payments were significantly lower than planned, a result o f an unclear
picture o f the size o f the civil service at the Budget was formulated and an overly ambitious plan to
recruit teachers when the budget was prepared (and despite several pay increases decided during the
course o f the year). Non-salary payments also tumed out much lower than planned, probably in part
reflecting constraining low allotments inProvinces, where more was needed, and high allotments for
Central Ministries, where capacity or need to spend was lower. Another factor could be constraints
related to procurement procedures.

22.      Monthly Profile. The monthly profile of expenditures reflects this low spending. After a
very slow start, expenditures have steadily increased during the year. The very slow start (though
offset by a lumpy, unbudgeted payment inHerat inthe first month) reflects two factors: (i)             allotments
to departments (including provincial departments) were prepared and communicated very late and (ii)
cash management reforms in August 2003 created some confusion and constrained non-salary
expenditures untilthe Treasury decided to transfer cash in advance to Provinces. The increase during
the year reflects this slow start and usual year-end bunching. It reflects also policy decisions, such as
recruitment o f teachers and pay increases. L o w expenditures in the month o f Qaws reflect the
Ramadan and the Eid Holiday.

23.    Development Budget. The Government reports development expenditures for 2003/04 at
US$2,373 million. This i s higher than the original budget (UStSl.8 billion), but the two are difficult
to compare since the Government i s continuing its efforts to bring more resources under the Budget.

24.    Of these disbursements, a small portion flowed through Treasury. According to the 2004/05
Budget Document, only US$190 million has been disbursed, including grants and loans from IDA
and ADB and grants from the ARTF and LOTFA.

                              MONITORINGANDEVALUATION

1.      This annex describes the methodology to monitor and evaluate the reform agenda on public
finance management. As indicated in the Project Document, the evaluation o f PSIB Iwill largely
focus on process and input indicators, which themselves can be linked to medium-term outcomes (see
table below). This reflects the nascent but low capacity o f the Govemment's monitoring capacity.
Technical assistance required for this monitoring i s provided by IMF, IDA, and USAID inthese areas
(see Project Document).

2.      The framework was discussed with the Govemment as part as PSIB I preparation and is
therefore owned by the Govemment. The identification o f ministries and agencies responsible for
monitoring each indicator will increase accountability. Overall, the fi-amework will contribute to
create an evaluation culture inthe Government. The framework was also discussed with other donors
inorder to reacha common understandingon priorities and measurement.
