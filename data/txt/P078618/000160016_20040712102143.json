Building Project is the first of a series of\n            operations aimed at supporting the implementation of the\n            Government of Afghanistan's (GOA) medium-term\n            development strategy within the context of  a secure\n            environment and a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The\n            overall objective of  this operation is to deepen, broaden,\n            and sustain the reforms underway in the areas of public\n            administration and fiscal management. The operation builds\n            on the reforms initiated under the Emergency Public\n            Administration Projects (EPAP) of the International\n            Development Association to improve the GOA'S own\n            fiduciary standards. Deepening and broadening these reforms\n            is critical for poverty reduction assistance to be\n            effective. The operation supports on-going reforms to\n            strengthen the budget process, increase the administrative\n            capacity of  line ministries and sub-national governments,\n            develop revenue policy and administration, and improve civil\n            service effectiveness. The operation also supports the\n            implementation of  reforms that lead to a more efficient\n            allocation of  fiscal resources in the areas of  human\n            development (health, basic education and social protection)\n            and private sector development (investment climate,\n            financial sector, and state-owned enterprises). More\n            comprehensive, thematic reforms in human and private sector\n            development will require support through other instruments,\n            including sectoral operations and technical assistance. The\n            first Credit would be released in one tranche upon Credit effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2004-07-06T00:00:00Z"}
