Building for Afghanistan was satisfactory,\n            the sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project: Future operations will need to support further\n            strengthening of budget processes to ensure timely budget\n            implementation. The issue of weak capacity - notably to\n            carry out the legal reform agenda - should inform the design\n            of subsequent operations. Program ownership could be\n            strengthened, notably to ensure continuity in reform\n            implementation. The government could be encouraged to\n            enhance consultations, within government and with key\n            stakeholders, and communicate information about the reform\n            process and progress towards these objectives. The\n            monitoring framework requires further strengthening."}, "docdt": "2005-09-16T00:00:00Z"}
