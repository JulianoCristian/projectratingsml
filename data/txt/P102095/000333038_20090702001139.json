Some lessons learned included: the\n            appropriate application of the World Bank's fiduciary\n            procedures to an output-based arrangement allowed minimizing\n            the fiduciary risk of the Bank without encroaching on the\n            implementers' freedom to use its own systems to deliver\n            outputs. The project has confirmed that paying on outputs\n            effectively transfers procurement and Financial Management\n            (FM)-related risks to service providers. Deloitte Touch was\n            auditor of both the recipient and the implementing agencies\n            before the project and thus was familiar with the companies\n            and could easily appreciate all relevant aspects of the\n            project. Adding auditing of project accounts and independent\n            verification of outputs to Deloitte Touches existing tasks\n            helped saving money and ensuring smooth operations. While\n            the provision of basic cooking stoves has contributed to the\n            success of the project, there were households that already\n            had stoves for the use with Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\n            For such cases the distribution companies offered vouchers\n            for the value of the basic cooking stove that counted\n            towards the cost of connection."}, "docdt": "2008-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
