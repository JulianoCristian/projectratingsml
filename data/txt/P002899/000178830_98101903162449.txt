INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPTDENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOP1MENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A SECOND ROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $11.6 million
to the Republic of Uganda.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Arising from the detailed engineering of more than 700 km. of
roads for which financing was provided in the credit of $5.0 million for
the first road project (Credit 108-UG) signed on July 28, 1967, Uganda
requested the Association to help finance a further project to extend and
develop the road system in Uganda. Financing was also sought for technical
assistance to strengthen Uganda's Iiinistry of Works, Connnunications and
Housing (MOW). A preappraisal mission from the Bank's Permanent Office
ln East Africa visited Uganda in June 1968, which raised some important
technical nroblems concerning the design standards proposed for the roads.
These were resolved after further discussions with 110W and their consultants.
The present aporaisal report was prepared after an updating appraisal mission
visited Uganda in February 1969.
3.        Forrmial negotiations took place in Washington in July.  The
Uganda delegation was led by the Honorable S.K. Nkutu, Minister of Works,
Communications and Housing (IMOW) and included Plessrs. J.M.N. Zikusoka,
Engineer-in-Chief, MOW; A. Ocaya, Commissioner for Economic Affairs,
Ministry of Finance; A.Z. Hitimana, Chief Accountant, Treasury; S. Kisoro,
Chief Technical Officer, Uganda Tea Growers Corporation; and W. Nyakabwa,
Senior State Attorney.
4.        This is the second road project proposed for IDA financing in
Uganda and would be the fifth IDA credit to Uganda. Before independence,
Uganda received a Bank loan of $8.4 million for power development which
was guaranteed by the United Kingdom. The following is a sunnmary statement
of the Bank loan and IDA credits to Uganda as of August 31, 1969.

5.        Disbursement of the Education credit (101-UG) has been slow
because of some changes in designs of school buildings. Construction
work has now gathered momentum and this is beginning to be reflected
in disbursements. Wlith regard to the smallholder tea credit (109-UG),
delays were encountered in the organisational phase, resulting in slow
disbursements. These early difficulties have now been largely overcome
and the rate of disbursements is improving.  In the existing road credit
(108-UG), disbursements have been very slow mainly because of staff shortages
in the I-Iinistry of Works (HIOWI) which led to delays in project supervision
and execution.  The Mlinistry of Works is now concentrating on this project
and with the technical assistance now being proposed to strengthen the HOW,
the pace of disbursements will be speeded up.
6.        In addition to the above loan and credits, the Bank has made
four loans for Comnon Services in East Africa, one for railways and harbors,
one for railwiays only, one for harbors only and one for telecommunications.
All four loans are guaranteed jointly and severally by Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda with the United Kingdom also being guarantor for the first loan
for railways and harbors. The following is a summary statement of these
loans as of August 31, 1969.

$2.80 million was loan and $0.64 was equity with $70,000 as a standby
commitment.  As of August 31, 1969 $3.4 million had been disbursed.
8.        An agricultural credit project initially for the development of
tobacco cultivation has just been appraised in the field. Applications
are also expected from Uganda in the near future for further projects
concerning expansion of education and development of smallholder cultivation
of tea.



9.        Two other Community projects for Railways and Telecommunications
are being processed for possible Bank lending and are expected to be pre-
sented to the Executive Directors during the currentfiscal year.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CREDIT
10.       BORROIER:               The Republic of Uganda
AIOU1JT:                US $11.6 million equivalent in various
currencies.
PURPOSE:               To help finance the further development
of the primary, secondary and agricultural
roads system in Uganda.
MAIiORTIZATION:         In 50 years, including a ten-year period
of grace through semi-annual installments
of half of one percent from Mlarch 15, 1980
through September 15, 1989, and one and
a half percent from Narch 15, 1990 through
September 15, 2019.
SERVICE CHARGE:         3/4 of 1' per annurn.
ESTIiATED ECON1OMIC    From 13 percent to 32 percent on individual
PLETURN:             roads.
PART III - THE PROJECT
1'.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Highway
Project - Uganda", No. PTR-26a    dated August 25, 1969, is attached.  The
project consists of
(i)  the construction and reconstruction of
(a) three primary roads totalling about 167 Im
(b) three secondary roads totalling about 111 km
(c)  two feeder roads totalling about 57 km, and
(d) three tea roads totalling about 330 kmi;
(ii)  consultants services for
(a)  the supervision of road construction under (i)(a) to
(d) above;
(b)  a road investment and maintenance study;
(c)  detailed engineering of about 400 km. of primary,
secondary and feeder roads; and



- 5 -
(iii) technical assistance for staffing and training requirements
of the MOE.
12.       The roads to be constructed under this project have been engineered
by consultants as part of the earlier road project financed by IDA credit
108-UG in 1967. The present project is a logical extension of IDA lending
for road development in Uganda and is consistent with the aims of the
Uganda Government to continue the expansion and upgrading of the country's
road system to meet the needs of growing traffic and to facilitate agricul-
tural development.
13.       The estimated total cost of the project is $'16.6 million.  The
proposed credit of $11.6 million would cover the foreign exchange costs
which are estimated at 70 percent of total costs. The estimates for the
actual road construction and reconstruction which account for the major
portion of the total cost are based on detailed engineering and are con-
sidered reliable.
14.       The road investment and maintenance study included in the project
is mainly intended to eliminate the shortcomings in present planning and
to identify investment priorities and the maintenance requirements of
Uganda's roads system. The technical assistance scheme also included in
the proposed project is intended to enable the :IOW to handle the increasing
burden of planning, construction and maintenance work and to train Ugandans
who can eventually take over executive positions.
15.       Execution of the project will be the overall responsibility of
the MOW, assisted by qualified consultants employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association.  Contracts for the construction works
would be let on the basis of international bidding and the issuing of
tenders will be staggered in order to avoid overloading the capacity of
the HOW and of the contracting industry.  .lthough the progress of the
existing road project has not been as rapid as originally envisaged,
the capacity of the MNW should improve substantially given the better
planning and technical assistance provided for in the present project.
PART IV - LEGAL IIJSTRUIEDITS AND AUTHORITY
16.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Uganda and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Credit are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
17.       The draft Development Credit Agreement contains provisions
normally used for other road projects of the Association.

PART V - THE ECONOM1Y
18.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Uganda" (No. AE-2 dated June 9, 1969) was distributed to
the Executive Directors under covering memorandum R69-1h5 of June 21x, 1969.
This report also served as the basic documentation for the second meeting
on Uganda of the Consultative Group for East Aifrica, held in Paris at
the end of July this year.
19.       The growth of Uganda's economy, which amounted to 5 percent
a year during the period 1961-65, has since slmoed down to about 3 percent.
Among the factors responsible for this are adverse weather, the decline
in cotton output resulting from reduced acreage which, in turn, was the
consequence of a much needed dowmnward adjustment of producer prices which
the Government introduced in 1966, and delays in the preparation and
execution of projects. It is expected, however, that the growJth rate will
be significantly higher in 1969, owing to a recovery in cotton output and
higher outputs of other cash crops and of the manufacturing and service
sectors.
20.       The management of Uganda's public finances has undergone a marked
improvement since the inception of the Second Five-Year Plan in July 1966.
Recurrent revenue has risen steadily as a result of new taxes and greater
efficiency in tax collection. Although recurrent expenditure has also
risen, a serious attempt has been made to curtail its grownth and sizeable
recurrent surpluses have been achieved in recent years. In quest of
further improvement, an Economy Cormmission is being appointed to review
governmental expenditures and recommend methods of economizing particularly
on those of a non-essential nature. The Government's domestic borrowing
has been very successful. During the first two years of the Plan, domestic
resources financed about 65 percent of the total development expenditure.
21.       Although Uganda has been able to generate domestic resources on
an increasing scale to finance investment, it appears likely that maintaining
this trend will become more difficult, since the growth of government
revenues will probably be somewhat lower in the iimnediate future. At the
same time, recurrent expenditures will continue to rise, particularly as
a resu'lt of the investment which has taken place during the past few years.
Hence recurrent budget surpluses are likely to be lower and, despite the
possibility of higher domestic borrowing, it may become more difficult
to find resources for in-vestment; at the same time the capacity to under-
take investment should increase as the Government's ability to prepare
and execute projects improves. Consequently, Uganda's needs for external
financial assistance are likely to increase.

22.       At the end of 1968, Uganda's public debt (including, on a
notional one-third basis, its liability for the debt of the East African
Community organizations) amounted to $215.5 million. Estimated interest
and amortization payments on the debt were $19.0 million. Debt service
payments absorbed 7.7 percent of the estimated foreign exchange earnings
amounting to $2h8.0 million. A fifteen-year projection of Uganda's debt
service, which is included in the recent economic report, indicates that
the debt service is quite sensitive both to the terms of lending and to
variations in the growth of exports. In order to prevent an undesirable
rise in the debt burden in the long run, the provision of a good proportion
of aid on soft terms is justified.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
23.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOM1IENDATION
2h.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
