PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
UGANDA SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 164-UG)
PREFACE
Presented herewith is a Project Completion Note on the Second
Highway Project in Uganda for which Credit 164-UG for US$11.6 million was
signed on September 29, 1969. The credit was fully disbursed on November 25,
1980.
The Project Completion Note was prepared by the Eastern Africa
Regional Office in 1983. Because of the difficult political conditions in
Uganda from 1972-1978, during the latter part of the project period, limited
information was available on the implementation of the project and its comple-
tion. It was, therefore, decided that a Project Completion Note, rather than
a Project Completion Report, would be prepared.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this completion note was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but was not audited by OED staff. The Completion Note was sent for
comment to the Borrower who indicated by cable that they had no comments (see
attachment).

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
UGANDA SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
(CREDIT 164-UG)
HIGHLIGHTS
This credit was made in 1969 for the concluding phase of a series
of road construction and reconstruction projects identified in 1962. The
first and major parts of the project implementation gererally went well. By
1972 and early 1973 a number of important project objectives had been accom-
plished. Since that time project supervision has been very difficult due to
the political and security situation of the country, which also seriously
constrained the remaining project implementation. Furthermore, organized
Government activities like highway maintenance almost ceased until the early
1980s (para. 2.05).
With the exception of a one-day mission, no supervision missions
were carried out between 1972 and 1978. Since that time the security situa-
tion has prevented visits to most project road sections and the economy of
Uganda has drastically changed. In addition many earlier records were lost
during the liberation war. Much of the information requirements for a PCR are
therefore unavailable. For several of the project component costs financed by
the Bank are known, but total costs are incomplete since some of the road
works especially force account had to be finished by the Government. The
present condition of the completed roads has obviously been affected by the
lack of organized maintenance, and only limited information is now available.
No organized traffic counts were done until 1982 and vehicle operating costs
have not been estimated until recently and are now heavily influenced by
scarcity of foreign exchange and consequent price distortions. No meaningful
ex post estimate of the economic feasibility of the project is possible under
these circumstances (para. 2.07).
Some general indications of the progress of the project can never-
theless be made and these are included in more detail below. The principal
conclusion is that the main part of the project was carried out as anticipated
by the original closing date, and valuable technical assistance was provided
as long as IDA funds were available (para. 3.01).

II. EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT
2.01      Until the late 1950's, Uganda had the best highway system in
Eastern Africa in terms of coverage and technical standards. This was due
to a long tradition of communal labor, the existence of an abundant supply
of good road building materials and the presence of a competent and well
staffed highway administration. During the 1960's, the condition of the
highway system deteriorated. First, there was a loss of large numbers of
personnel at executive and administrative levels, and second, the funds
available for road maintenance were reduced to a considerable extent.
Parallel with these developments, traffic was increasing so that many of
the roads built for light traffic became increasingly difficult to
maintain, and the planning for future highway development was not done,
largely because of insufficient staff.
2.02      IDA's efforts to assist Uganda to overcome deficiencies dated
back to 1962, when an attempt was made to identify road investment needs.
Subsequent progress in project preparation was slow, mainly because of
staffing deficiencies in the highway management. As a result, the first
IDA Credit to Uganda (Credit 108-UG) for US$5.0 million equivalent for 161
km of road construction or reconstruction was not signed until 1967. It
took two more years to complete preparation of the present project, which
constitutes the second and concluding phase of the original list of road
investments that were identified in 1962.
2.03      The civil works components of the Second Highway project were
largely completed by 1974 and the road investment and maintenance study by
1972. By that time the highway investment study, two feasibility studies
and detailed engineering for five road sections had been completed.
Technical assistance to the MOW and remaining civil works continued until
1980. The original closing date of June 30, 1974 was extended five times
to allow for continued disbursement of funds for technical assistance. The
credit of $11.6 million was fully disbursed on November 5, 1980. While the
project was supervised adequately up to 1972 when mDst of the civil works
were completed or contracts awarded, country conditions then prevented
adequate supervision until 1978, except for one brief mission in 1974. In
addition, the works have not been physically inspected in the last eight
years, primarily because of security reasons in the country.  For the same
reasons, neither Government nor the Bank has been able to assess the impact
of the project. Hence, a re-evaluation of the benefits which were forecast
at appraisal would be difficult. As a result of the liberation war in
1979, most of the Government files were either destroyed or lost.
Although some of the construction costs are available, traffic counts and
estimates of vehicle operating costs are not. In addition, many of the
Ugandans in management positions at the Ministry of Works fled the country
or disappeared during the Amin regime and staff now in place have very
little knowledge or recollection of events going back to 1969 and the early
years of project implementation.
2.04      Given the constraining circumstances above, any assessment of the
project can only be very limited. The physical progress of the project can
best be judged by the situation in 1972 when contracts for six of the seven
main road sections had been awarded (Table 1). Awarded contracts then
covered US$10.9 million of US$11.6 million in the credit. Disbursements
are shown in table 2.



-3-
2.05      Up until 1972, the civil works generally went very well.  This
momentum meant that six of the seven main road sections were completed in
early 1973. The Jinja-Bukoloto road, however, cost almost twice the
original estimate. After poor performance of the contractor for the
Bale-Kayunga-Mabuganyi road and Sezibwa swamp crossing these works were
finished by the Government itself. Most of the tea roads were also
complete in 1974. The roads in the relatively easy Toro and Ankole areas
were finished first, whereas those in the mountainuous and therefore
difficult Kigezi area were lasr. A new bridge in this area was included in
the project after collapse of an old bridge during flood of the river
Ishasha; and finally completed in 1980. The Kabale-Katuna (Rwanda border)
road also in the Kigezi area had various problems over a long time. After
an initial high bid price the works were rebid and a contract was awarded
in 1974. This was also the reason for the first extension of the Credit
closing date. The last section of this road, the Katuna swamp crossing,
was finally completed by Rwanda in 1978. This crossing was just on the
border and Rwanda at the time was constructing their part of the same
road. Rwanda was reimbursed the cost under this Credit. Some studies were
made to use remaining funds to bitumenize part of this road but in the end
all credit funds were needed for the Ishasha bridge above; and technical
assistance. Traffic remains low since another road in Rwanda from Kigali,
although longer, is in better condition.
2.06      Despite the fact that traffic in Uganda has generally decreased
due to country conditions, traffic on the main project roads has generally
increased since the road improvements were carried out (table 3).
Furthermore vehicle operating costs have increased dramatically (table 4)
though the figures have to be considered very cautiously in view of the
devaluations and difficulties in selecting the most relevant exchange
rate. Even using a shadow exchange rate of several times the official rate
there has been a substantial vehicle cost increase over the period. On
these grounds a re-evaluation of at least most of the main roads would give
a satisfactory return.
2.07      At appraisal, the economic returns on the various road components
included in the project varied from 10% to 28%. A 1982 consultant survey
of traffic on certain selected roads in Uganda concluded that overall
traffic levels were about 50% below those which existed in 1972,
corroborated on the basis of vehicle fleet and fuel imports. Because the
economic justification for several roads were based on the value added of
increased production in addition to savings in vehicle operating costs, it
is likely that some of the economic returns today would be below acceptable
levels. However, it is not possible to derive any specific, quantified
conclusions since they are clouded by security and political events and the
entire economy of the country has been radically changed. These events
which occurred during project implementation could not have been foreseen
at appraisal.
2.08      The feeder roads (including tea roads) are therefore much more
difficult to judge. The last area was not complete until 1980 due to cost
increases and many other constraints. Nevertheless the major parts of the
works were carried out as anticipated although with delays and cost
overruns.



-4-
2.09      One of the main reasons for extending the credit closing date was
to maintain essential technical assistance as long as possible which
eventually covered the period June 30, 1974 to Nuveuber 5, 1980, after most
feasibility studies and main roads had been completed. Under normal
circumstances this would have been difficult to justify. Under the very
unusual conditions of the country in these years the technical assistance
provided a nucleus of continuity in the Ministry of Works and Housing. A
collapse of the works department in this Ministry was unavoidable in the
liberation war but the effects of this were diminished. Thus four of the
original eleven experts in key positions were retained until 1980 and well
justified.
t

III. CONCLUSIONS
3.01      The principal conclusion is that the main part of this project
was carried out as anticipated despite the fact that records cannot give
the complete and accurate estimate of construction costs and benefits. Six
out of seven main road sections, the main studies and two of three tea road
areas were completed by the original closing date.
3.02      The remaining road section Kabale-Katuma was eventually finished
since it was a potentially important international road link, but the full
impact of this road remains to be achieved.
3.03      Although the absence of complete cost data precludes an economic
re-evaluation, traffic counts in 1982 indicate that wDst main road sections
have shown increases in traffic although not quite as high as expected.
Most of the project goals have therefore been achieved.
3.04      With a few exceptions, performance of contractors and consultants
had generally been good. The vital continued technical assistance during a
very difficult time clearly justified the prolonged extensions of the
Credit.
