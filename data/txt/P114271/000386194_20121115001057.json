The loan disbursed only\n            the front-end fee (US$0.025 million) and was cancelled on\n            May 3, 2012 at the request of the client. At the loan\n            cancellation, progress towards the development objective was\n            rated unsatisfactory while the implementation progress was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. In sum, there were essentially\n            three main issues that contributed to the implementation\n            delays and eventually to the cancellation of the project.\n            Firstly, it took eight months from the approval of the\n            project in April 2009 to sign the contract among the\n            counterparts in Mexico. Secondly, the project needed to be\n            restructured during 2010 because of budget constraints.\n            Thirdly, exceptions and modifications to the harmonized\n            procurement documents, including the contract model further\n            delayed the procurement process on both the Bank and the\n            Government of Mexico (GOM) side. After the Board approval in\n            April 2009, a project launch event, which included training\n            to officials on the Bank's procurement processes, was\n            organized in July 2009. However, after approval, the project\n            experienced an effectiveness delay of 11 months."}, "docdt": "2012-11-02T00:00:00Z"}
