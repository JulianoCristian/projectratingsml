1. Context, Project Development Objectives, and Design:

1.        The Mexico Customs Institutional Strengthening Project is a US$54.87 million project out of
which the Bank intended to finance US$ 10.025 million in loan amount. The project was approved by
the Board on April 21, 2009 and became effective on March 9, 2010. The Loan disbursed only the
front-end fee (US$0.025 million) and was cancelled on May 3, 2012 at the request of the Client. At the
loan cancellation, progress towards the development objective was rated unsatisfactory while the
implementation progress was moderately unsatisfactory.

2.         At the time of project preparation, the Mexican economy was heading into a recession as it
faced the impacts of a sharp contraction in the aggregate demand of its major trading partners and
continuously strained global financial conditions. Strengthening of Customs was noted as an important
element to improve the competitiveness of the Mexican economy in the Country Partnership Strategy for
FY08-13. The project was prepared at the request of the Government to support the reform program of
the Tax Administration Service (Servicio de Administración Tríbutaria, SAT1) as outlined in SAT’s
Strategic Institutional Development Plan 2007-12.

3.         The project’s development objective was to improve the efficiency of Customs processes, thus
contributing to improving Mexico’s competitiveness and facilitating trade with foreign parties. The
project was intended to (i) help with the institutional redesign and redefinition of the services and
processes supporting Customs operations; (ii) contribute to improving the human capital at the Customs
through creating an incentive system based on results via the establishment of a Fiscal Career Service
Scheme; (iii) improve change management at the Customs. The project had four components including
institutional re-design ($US 38.87 million), human capital (US$ 10.23 million), change management
(US$ 2.48 million) and project administration and management (US$ 3.28 million). The key
performance indicators were defined as increase in the number of export/import declarations processed
per human resource unit involved, decrease in clearance processing time and increase in the perception
by users of the efficiency of services offered by the customs.

4.         Regarding the implementation arrangements, the Borrower for the project was the Finance
and Public Credit Secretariat (Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público, SHCP). Customs General
Administration (Administración General de Aduanas, AGA) within the SAT was the implementing
agency with participation from other SAT units such as the Planning General Administration and the
Resources and Services General Administration. In addition, National Financing Agent (Nacional
Financiera S.N.C, NAFIN) agreed to act as a financial agent representing the Borrower vis-à-vis the
Bank. Legally, the inclusion of a financial agent required signing a ‘Contrato de Mandato’ between SAT
and NAFIN. The PAD’s implementation arrangements include a more detailed governance structure for
the project with directive and executive committees and the project management unit.

5.         The preparation, design and quality at entry of the project were moderately satisfactory. The
preparation process met the Bank’s quality standards and risks related to counterpart capacity to
implement and manage the project were considered in the PAD. The preparations included risk
mitigation measures as well as the standard FM and procurement capacity assessments and additional
training on Bank procedures. Furthermore, the overall risk assessment could have placed more emphasis
on the institutional complexity on the client side (where several agencies and units were involved in the

project implementation2). There was also a considerable delay in defining the baselines for the results
framework which contributed to downgrading the rating from satisfactory.

2. Post-Approval Experience and Reasons for Cancellation:

6.         In sum, there were essentially three main issues that contributed to the implementation delays
and eventually to the cancellation of the project. Firstly, it took eight months from the approval of the
project in April 2009 to sign the ‘Contrato de Mandato’ among the counterparts in Mexico. Secondly,
the project needed to be restructured during 2010 because of budget constraints. Thirdly, exceptions and
modifications to the harmonized procurement documents, including the contract model further delayed
the procurement process on both the Bank and the GOM side.

7.         After the Board approval in April 2009, a project launch event, which included training to
SAT officials on the Bank’s procurement processes, was organized in July 2009. However, after
approval, the project experienced an effectiveness delay of 11 months. Some of the delay was due to the
internal approval and signing process of the ‘Contrato de Mandato’ among SHCP, SAT and NAFIN.
Despite the delay in effectiveness, the Government on several occasions reiterated its commitment to the
project's development objectives as well as its interest in proceeding as soon as possible in undertaking
activities detailed in the Implementation Plan. Furthermore, during 2010, an evaluation of the Customs
of Mexico was carried out using the Customs Assessment and Trade Toolkit (CATT, a new tool that
allows for on-line tracking and comparison with other offices). The CATT assessment was financed
partially from the supervision budget of the project. CATT data were used to establish the baseline
indicators for the project.

8.          The activities financed by the Bank were built around one international call for tender contract
totaling US$18.34 million for re-engineering the Mexican Customs, which absorbed all financing from
the Bank. The technical documents of the bidding process were drafted and advertised in 2009, and the
first short list of interested companies was submitted for non-objection to the Bank in November, 2009,
and the non-objection was granted on December, 2009. However, during 2010 it became clear in
discussions between the SAT and Bank Specialists that it would be necessary to change the initial scope
of the project. In September 2010, the authorities formally indicated their interest in restructuring the
project due to budgetary constraints. The original total project cost of US$54 million was proposed to be
reduced to US$24 million, without affecting the financing from IBRD of US$10.025 million. The
restructuring was to reduce the scope of the project without changing its project development objectives
or indicators. The authorities then re-launched the bidding process for the customs reengineering,
keeping it in line with the original project design. In October 12, 2010, the Bank gave a non-objection
for the contract with the revised scope.

9.         However, the contract model had to be approved also by the Secretariat of Public
Administration (Secretaría de Función Pública, SFP), because of the provisions on guarantee and fines.
SAT asked for exceptions to the harmonized contract conditions, which required waivers from the SFP
and the Bank. The Bank team facilitated a number of meetings between SFP and SAT in order to speed
up the approval from SFP but the back and forth about the contract model ended up delaying the
progress as both sides needed time for analyzing the proposed changes and processing the required
internal approvals. The main issue from the Bank’s perspective was related to the number and nature of
exceptions that were asked. The team tried to accommodate these requests to the extent possible.
However, some of them were not negotiable. For instance, an exception requested to grant an endless

                                                          2
Bank performance guarantee to cover potential issues of confidentiality was not acceptable to the World
Bank, as it could have negatively impacted the competition since endless bank guarantees are not
instruments available in the market.

10.       Furthermore, as a consequence of the changes in the scope, parts of the procurement process
had to be repeated causing additional delays and frustration. The model was finally agreed by SFP and
SAT, and was sent to the Bank with the bidding package and results of the selection for non- objection
in December 2011. The non- objection was issued on December, 2012, with the expectation that
Government would proceed with next steps in the process immediately. However, shortly thereafter,
SAT formally informed the Bank that it had decided to cancel the project.

11.        At the cancellation of the project, the Bank received a letter from NAFIN, SHCP and SAT
with the Government’s position related to the preparation, implementation and cancellation of the
project. The document includes an implementation timeline as well lessons learnt and its findings are
reflected in this NCO.3The GOM indicated to the Bank that the underlying reasons for the cancellation
included that considering the delays, the time required to finish the whole Customs process
reengineering effort would extend beyond the current administration's term and they would not like to
pass-on unfinished tasks to next administration. Furthermore, the upcoming change in the administration
and the possible reshuffling of key officials working on the project was considered to pose a high risk to
the project. The internal structures of the GOM and the Bank with multiple agencies and organizational
units involved in the project and numerous approvals required both for the effectiveness as well as the
restructuring and the procurement process contributed to the delays and eventually to the cancellation of
the project.

12.        Despite the cancellation of the loan, SAT underlined that customs modernization remains a
high priority and they intend to continue the reforms supported by the project in the future with their
own resources. They also considered the design of the project and the relationship with the Bank to have
been instrumental in conceptualizing the vision for the Mexican Customs. Particularly, the information
on international experiences and the data collected as part of the CATT assessment will be helpful in the
future when SAT is ready to undertake a business process reengineering in the Customs. In fact, SAT
has requested further technical assistance on specific topics (e.g. strategic management) after the loan
cancellation and the CATT assessment was repeated in June 2012.

3.     Assessment of Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

13.        As stated earlier, the preparation, design and quality at entry of the project were moderately
satisfactory. The project and the reforms supported seemed strategically relevant and the technical and
fiduciary aspects were adequately considered in the PAD. As explained earlier, there were some
shortcomings related to the monitoring and evaluation arrangements as well as in the analysis on the
institutional aspects with potential implications to the implementation of the project.

14.       The quality of supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Supervision missions for the
project and technical and procurement related meetings with the counterparts took place on regular
basis. The Bank team had reasons to believe that the Government was committed to the agreed reforms
and implementing the project. The implementation of the CATT, the re-launch of the reengineering

bidding process, and the passing of the Single Window Act reflected the commitment of the authorities
to continue with the project even if the total amounts of investment were proposed to be reduced. For
instance, still in the May 2011 supervision mission, the details of the revised components and indicators
were agreed upon with the client. The team was proactive in trying to speed up the effectiveness and
solve the problems related to the procurement process and particularly related to the contract model. The
team was trying to accommodate the exceptions required to the extent possible but some of them were
not permissible within the Bank’s rules. However, there were also some delays on several occasions in
providing the non-objections. The team could also have been more candid and detailed when reporting
on the issues related to the progress in the implementation status reports of the project. Otherwise
fiduciary and safeguards issues were sufficiently addressed both in the preparation and supervision of
the project.

15.       With the moderately satisfactory rating of ensuring quality of entry, moderately unsatisfactory
rating of quality of supervision and the outcome of the project being cancelled, the overall Bank
performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

4. Assessment of Borrower Performance:

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

16.        The overall Borrower performance of is considered moderately unsatisfactory. The different
Government agencies involved in the Borrower’s side demonstrated commitment to the customs reform
and the objectives of the project in the course of its preparation and implementation. However, the
additional exceptions requested and the consequent internal approvals required on both sides delayed the
progress with the project. This led to the loan cancellation and the moderately unsatisfactory
performance rating for both the Bank and the Borrower SAT as the implementing agency of the project
effectively coordinated the implementation of technical and administrative aspects between the SHCP
and the Bank.

5. Lessons Learned:

17.       The lessons learned of the project identified in this Note on Cancelled Operation include the
following:

18.        Customs modernization remains a high priority to the GOM and the reform process continues
with financing of GOM’s own resources. The experience of this project demonstrates that business
process re-engineering in the field of customs is highly complex and it is essential to define from the
beginning the objectives, scope, timeline and expected results. When assessing the reasons for
cancellation of the loan, SAT highlighted that it is essential to have the customs modernization expertise
in-house, rather than contracting the conceptualization and preparation of the terms of reference to third
parties. SAT considered that as a positive outcome of the project, the capacity within the different
agencies involved in the preparation of the project has increased, and they will be in better position to
implement similar reforms with in-house resources in the future.

19.        Similarly, related to the project design, it is important to get the scope and design right during
the preparation of the projects. The institutional complexities, both on the Bank and client-side when
there are several agencies and departments involved, can make the effectiveness and restructurings
difficult and slow. This and experiences with other projects confirm that the inclusion of a separate
financing agent (in this case NAFIN) or the Public Administration Secretariat (SFP) can cause further
                                                       4
delays in the implementation of the project. Consequently, it is essential to include sufficient analysis of
institutional aspects in project design and risk framework. For instance, the implementation
arrangements could include an illustration of the approvals required for possible restructurings.

20.        Arrangement of having "Contratos de Mandatos" after Board approval have delayed
tremendously the effectiveness of Bank projects and going forward the Bank will look into expediting
these internal agreements during the approval process rather than expecting them after approval, ideally
by negotiations they should be completed.

21.       Based on the experience of this project, the harmonization of the procurement processes and
contract models of GOM and the Bank that has taken place in the past years is very welcome.
