objective of the Customs\n            Institutional Strengthening Project is to improve the\n            efficiency of customs processes thus contributing to\n            improving Mexico's competitiveness and facilitating\n            trade with foreign parties. There are four components to the\n            project. The first component of the project is institutional\n            redesign. This component seeks to correct the structural\n            impediments to increasing the efficiency of the customs\n            cycle, through a redefinition and redesign of the services\n            and processes which support customs operations. The second\n            component of the project is human capital. This component is\n            geared towards increasing the professionalism and capacities\n            of the general administration for customs' managers and\n            staff. The third component of the project is change\n            management. This component is aimed at communicating the\n            changes to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring the\n            understanding of these changes and the involvement and\n            engagement with the project of said stakeholders. The fourth\n            component of the project is project administration and\n            management. This component aims to ensure an effective\n            coordination of the efforts to define, develop and implement\n            the project, to accomplish its stated objectives on time and\n            within budget."}, "docdt": "2009-03-26T00:00:00Z"}
