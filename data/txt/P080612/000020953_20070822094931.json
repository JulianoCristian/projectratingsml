risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) Bank\n            assistance should pay particular attention to food security\n            issues in countries with chronic food insecurity and\n            vulnerability to natural disasters; 2) To address food\n            insecurity a regional approach which promoted regional trade\n            is needed; 3) It is essential to the success of a public\n            works project to establish apriority objective of public\n            works between quick income generation and creation and/or\n            rehabilitation of assets with an acceptable technical\n            standard. An appropriate timing of public works is also\n            imperative to avert conflicting labor demand for\n            agriculture; and 4) Careful selection of institutional\n            arrangements to implement emergency operations would allow a\n            quick project start-up and minimize implementation risks."}, "docdt": "2007-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
