   Drought Recovery Project are to assist the Zambian\n            Government to maintain key commitments to its economic and\n            investment priorities laid out in the Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper (PRSP) while meeting the exigencies of the\n            food crisis, and to help restore the productive capability\n            of the affected people. The project consists of four\n            components: 1) quick-disbursing assistance to finance a\n            positive list of imports; 2) safety net interventions aimed\n            at improving access to food and services by vulnerable\n            groups; 3) distribution of agricultural inputs and\n            technologies to help farmers restart agriculture; and 4)\n            strengthening government's early warning system and\n            capacity for disaster mitigation and management. Benefits\n            include reducing the hardship caused by the food emergency,\n            while helping to maintain investments in health, education,\n            and rural infrastructure. The project will enhance the\n            capacity of vulnerable groups to access goods and services\n            by providing temporary employment and income supplements\n            through public works and other targeted interventions. Risks\n            derive from limitations in the capacity of the government to\n            handle complex issues related to the logistics and\n            distribution of food and other critical supplies to\n            vulnerable people."}, "docdt": "2002-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
