"versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The overall objectives of the Emergency\n            Drought Recovery Project (EDRP) for Zambia were to assist\n            the government in maintaining key commitments to its\n            economic and investment priorities as laid out in the\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) while meeting the\n            exigencies of the food crisis, and to help restore\n            productive capability of the affected population. The\n            development objective was not revised during project\n            implementation. Principal performance ratings are as\n            follows: project outcome was satisfactory; sustainability\n            was likely; institutional development impact was modest; and\n            Bank and borrower performance was satisfactory. A number of\n            lessons have been derived from the project and, it is hoped,\n            will be learned by both the Bank and its borrowers. Some of\n            the lessons learned are: The EDRP aimed at incorporating\n            lessons learned from previous emergency projects, such as\n            ' emergency operations must be simple and rapidly\n            executable, and not undertake too broad an agenda of\n            cross-cutting issues ', ' speed in implementation\n            is a critical element of success '. These lessons\n            remain valid, but they were not practiced during EDRP\n            implementation. 2) Short term and long term objectives\n            should not be combined in one lending instrument. 3) The\n            Bank needs to apply its disbursement and procurement\n            guidelines more flexibly in future emergency operations in\n            order to adequately meet the urgent needs of the client, 4)\n            Appropriate outcome-orientated monitoring and evaluation\n            indicators must be identified at appraisal, even in an\n            emergency operation when project preparation time is\n            limited. The PIU was charged with identifying additional\n            project performance indicators, but ultimately failed to\n            complete the task. 5) Finally, the implementation of a\n            multi-sectoral project such as the EDRP, should be\n            complemented by multi-sectoral donor coordination to avoid\n            duplication and inconsistencies."}, "docdt": "2006-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
