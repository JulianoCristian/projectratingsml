This will be achieved by\n            instituting agricultural and trade reforms aimed at\n            increasing market competition, encouraging private ownership\n            and investment in land and other productive assets, and\n            providing short term balance-of-payments support for\n            financing critical imports. The reform program that the Ag\n            SECAL support will improve agricultural terms of trade,\n            increase input flows to farms, expand agricultural exports,\n            and increase the efficiency of farm management. The Ag SECAL\n            encompasses policy reforms and balance of-payments\n            financing. The policy conditionally will focus on the\n            agricultural sector and address the following: a) reduction\n            in the export restrictions allowing increased access to\n            export market; b) development of a well functioning land\n            market; and c) enabling privatization and demonopolization\n            of existing agribusiness firms and encouraging new entrants.\n            The negative short-term adjustments associated with these\n            policy changes will be cushioned by balance-of-payments\n            financing. The funds provided under this component of the Ag\n            SECAL will be used to finance general imports. The funds\n            will be channeled through the National Bank of Ukraine, and\n            allocated through the established market system for\n            auctioning foreign exchange. While balance-of-payments\n            support is not expected to be targeted at financing imports\n            for the agricultural sector it is expected to improve the\n            availability of agricultural inputs."}, "docdt": "1996-09-13T00:00:00Z"}
