Key lesson learned include: 1) It is important\n            to build stable base for reform and anticipate potential\n            changes in leadership. A core group of articulate\n            agricultural policy analysts and working group leaders is\n            key to generating and sustaining momentum in an agricultural\n            reform program and maintaining the Government's level\n            of attention to politically charged agricultural reform\n            issues. 2) It is realistic to recognize the limits of the\n            policy instruments included under the conditionalities. 3)\n            It is key to pay close attention to the time frame and lags\n            of policies. It was unrealistic to believe that the\n            implementation of the sets of conditionalities aimed at farm\n            restructuring and agro-industrial privatization and\n            demonopolization would be able in a year and a half's\n            time to substantially reorient land tenure, alter corporate\n            governance, and cause newly formed enterprises to exhibit\n            independence of their former national and regional\n            supervising monopolies. 4) Considerable attention should be\n            accorded to the political economy of change. An explicit\n            analysis should be made of: a) the receptivity of major\n            political groups to change; b) public education and outreach\n            programs required to reach interested stakeholders; and c)\n            elements of the project design that could appeal to stakeholders."}, "docdt": "1999-04-27T00:00:00Z"}
