TANZANIA
TANZANIA POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (TPTC)
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Credit and ProJect Sumary
Borrower:         United Republic of Tanzania
Beneficiary:       Tanzania Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(TPTC)
IDA Credit:        SDR 17.9 million ($23.0 million equivalent).
T#erms:            Standard IDA terms.
On-Lending Terms: The Government will onlend the credit proceeds to
TPTC at 7.92% for 20 years including 4 years of
grace. TPTC will bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Project           The current deteriorated state of the Tanzanian
obiectives:       telecommunications network and consequent poor
quality of all telecommunications services are
severe constraints on Tanzanian economic
development, particularly of the agricultural and
other productive sectors which play a key role in
the Tanzanian economy. The project aims at
reducing these constraints through
rehabilitation, building up the supply of spares,
and limited expansion of physical facilities to
improve overall performance and to ensure that
the new and rehabilitated assets are maintained.
A further objective is the institutional
development of TPTC, with special emphasis on
utilization of financial and technical tools to
improve management performance and efficiency.
Project           The project comprises:
Description:
(a) rehabilitation of cables and subscriber
distribution networks and provision of equipment
to relieve traffic congestion to improve quality
of service;



- iv -
(b) upgrading of maintenance by (i) strengthening
maintenance units; (ii) upgrading stores, garage
and workshops; (iii) providing tools, instru-
ments, spare parts and specialized vehicles; and
(iv) partial financing of recurrent maintenance
costs;
(c) provision of ancillary equipment power and
air conditioning; computer hardware and software,
civil works material and training equipment;
(d) provision of fellowships and staff training;
and
(e) provision of consultant services to enhance
TPTC's capabilities in project planning, monitor-
ing and control; equipment installation, opera-
tion and maintenance; finance and accounting;
stores and material management.
Project Benefits  The project is expected to benefit all segments
and Risks:        of the economy, with the business and Government
subscribers being the major beneficiaries. Ex-
port sectors in general, and specifically
agriculture, tourism and industry, all key
foreign exchange earners, will benefit from
improved communications. More efficient use of
the transportation system, due to increased use
of telecommunication services, will reduce costs,
ease transportation bottlenecks, and reduce
energy consumption. The project faces a risk
that TPTC's management improvements may develop
slower than anticipated and that the physical
improvements financed under the project will not
be properly maintained or operated. Technical
assistance in the form *f experts in line
positions is provided to assist in institutional
development and to min-mize this risk. The
impact of technical assistance will be monitored
by TPTC and IDA in a joint annual review.
Furthermore, annual reviews of specific project
performance criteria will identify technical and
financial problems and measures to resolve them
in a timely fashion. Advanced procurement
activity will minimize technical implementation
delays. The occurance of long term foreign
exchange shortages after the project period,
which could adversely affect operation and
maintenance of TPTC's facilities, is dependent on
the prevailing macro-economic climate in
Tanzania. This will be monitored and addressed
in the consideration of future lending
operations.

TANZANIA
SECOtlD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Tanzanian Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (TPTC) is
responsible for domestic and international telephone, telex, postal and
savings bank services. The Government of Tanzania (GOT) has requested
IDA's continued support for the rehabilitation and further development of
the telecommunications network over 1986-90. Government's objectives are
to improve the quality and availability of services. TPTC's Government
approved Telecomminications Sector Investment Program amounts to $65.0
million equivalent, including $52.0 million in foreign exchange. The
program to be implemented over 1986-90 comprises ongoing works
($5.0 million) and the proposed project ($60.0 million). To finance the
project, the Government has secured $5.0 million from African Development
Bank (AfDB) and $10.0 million frou the Italian government on concessionary
terms. Of the balance, $11.0 million equivalent will be financed by TPTC,
$23.0 million from Internatioual Development Association (IDA) and $11.0
million from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA).
1.02      Despite previous interventions, the network has deteriorated due
to the lack of foreign exchange and inadequate institutional development.
The main thrust of the proposed project, is to rehabilitate the network and
ensure efficient maintenance through institutional strengthening of TPTC
and the provision of foreign exchange for spare parts, recurrent costs, and
maintenance and rehabilitation equipment. The project also provides
technical assistance and training. Based on the standard Bank/IDA
disbursement profile for all projects in East Africa, over FY76-85,
disbursements would be completed by June 30, 1995. Given the advanced
stage of procurement and its focus on rehabilitation, the project is,
however, expected to be completed much earlier.
I1. THE TELECOMNUNICATIONS SECTOR
A. Background
General
2.01      TPTC was established by the Tanzania Posts and Telecomminications
Corporation Act of December 2, 1977, following the breakup of the East
African Community. TPTC is an autonomous government-owned public corpora-
tion responsible for all domestic and international postal and
telecommunications services in Tanzania. It commenced operations on
February 3, 1978. In addition to the public telecommunications network
operated by TPTC, dedicated networks exist to meet the specialized
requirements of the police, military, railway and civil aviation services.
Private users are licensed to operate radio link services in areas
inadequately served by the public network. Tanzania has no
telecomunications manufacturing industry.



-2-
Access to Service
2.02      As of December 31, 1986, total installed telephone exchange capa-
city was about 73,000 lines with about 54,000 direct exchange lines (DELs)
in service. The overall telephone density of 0.2 DELs/100 population is
among the lowest in the world. 1, Service is concentrated in
Dar-es-Salaam and in the other 25 regional capitals which, with 80% of DELo
but only 101 of the population, have 1.4 DELs/100 population. In the rest
of the country the telephone density is only 0.05. Automated telex service
is available to 1,217 subscribers, 1,140 of whom are in Dar-es-Salaam.
Telegraph service is also available. Basic telecommunications statistics
are shown in Annex 1.
Usage of Service
2.03      No precise data are available regarding categories of subscribers
or users. However, rough analysis of the billing records shows that about
60% of telecommunications revenue is generated by business users, about 30%
by government users, including the parastatal entities and only about 10%
by residential users. About 402 of exchange lines serve PBXs. Few tele-
phones are used solely for residential purposes. Business communications
generate most of the traffic; this is reflected in pronounced peaks in both
local and long distance traffic, particularly between 9 a.m. and 12 noon.
In 1985, international calls generated 302 of total revenues (of about
$24.0 million equivalent); 35% came from local and automatic long distance
calls and 252 from operator assisted trunk calls. Dar-es-Salaam, with 402
of subscribers, generated about 50% of total revenues.
Existing Facilities
2.04      At the end of 1986, TPTC operated 173 telephone exchanges with an
installed capacity of 73,000 lines. Average exchange fill was 74% and
54,000 direct exchange lines (DELs) were connected. Seventy-seven percent
of the DELs were served by 35 automatic exchanges and the remaining lines
by 138 small manual exchanges. Seventy-one of the exchanges which serve
over 50% of the subscribers, are more than 20 years old and not in effi-
cient condition, due to poor maintenance over a prolonged period. Replace-
ment of the equipment is not feasible at this time, given the prevailing
macroeconomic conditions in Tanzania. Furthermore, the equipment has not
yet completed its useful life. However, the severe service degradation,
which has resulted from the years of inadequate mintenance, necessitates a
major rehabilitation effort. It is possible to improve performance consid-
erably by intensive maintenance and selective replacements. Two new
electronic exchanges were installed under the first project (Credit
1173-TA, para 2.27). The majority of international services are provided
through a standard B earth station at Dar-es-Salaam which has been opera-
ting at full capacity since 1983, and via a terrestrial link to leased
1/ For example, in 1985 Kenya had 4.7 DELs/100 population in the capital
area, 0.3 in the rest of the country; Zimbabwe 7.7 and 0.5; Ethiopia
4.1 and 0.2.

satellite circuits on a standard A earth station (Atlantic Ocean satellite)
at Nairobi. Telex service, which is automatic, is available in 16 towns.
Basic telecommunication statistics are shown in Annex 1.
Quality of Service
2.05      Although the quality of telex service is satisfactory, the tele-
phone service is congested, unreliable and inadequate. Poor maintenance
and inadequate trunk equipment terminations are the major contributors to
the present congestion and low quality of service. Service standards are
not prescribed and clearance of faults Is unsatisfactory. On average, only
about 24% (as against a target of 65%) of the long distance call attempts
are successful during the peak business hours. On average, there are about
25-30 faults per 100 telephones per month which is high. The faults are
mostly in the local cable distribution network. Repairs take 10 days on
average which is unacceptable.
2.06      The operator assisted long distance telephone service is severely
impaired by the shortage of long distance circuits, which is compounded by
heavy congestion in the local netwo ks.  Service delays of over 4 hours on
operator booked calls are frequent,j which leads to cancellation of more
than 50% of the booked calls. The average time for an operator to answer
on trunk calls was over 27 seconds (compared to TPTC's target of 10
second ) in Dar-es-Salaam. However these delays are expected to be
eased _/ following the completion of the first telecommnications project
(para 2.27) expected in December 1987.
2.07      International call statistics are properly maintained.  Outgoing
calls (semi-automatic) have an effective rate of 78% compared to a target
of 80X. However, only 25% of tie incoming international calls are suc-
cessful. Congestion on international routes will be relieved with the pro-
vision in 1989 of a standard A earth station at Dar-es-Salaam, (financed by
Italian aid) as part of the 1986-90 telecommunications program (para 3.01).
2.08      TPTC has reviewed the existing quality of service with assistance
from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and areas tar
improvement were broadly identified. To follow up on this work,
consultants under the project preparation facility (PPP) (para 2.24) have
now specified in detail the necessary measures and equipment which will be
required to improve the quality of service. The proposed project will (a)
provide equipment to alleviate traffic congestion in heavily congested
routes, (b) introduce modern maintenance aids and Improved maintenance
methods and procedures, and (c) provide for institutional development to
ensure the benefits of the rehabilitation and maintenance are sustained.
2/ In 1986, the average waiting time for long distance calls was 4 hours in
Dar-es-Salaam, with 5 hours nationwide.
3/ Average time to answer is expected to meet the target of 10 seconds and
cancellation is expected to be reduced to 25% of the booked calls.



-4-
Demand for Service
2.09      Public telecommunications facilities in Tanzania have developed
slowly and failed to keep up with demand. Over 1980-85, DELs increased at
an average of 5.7% p.a. but slowed to only 2.4% in 1986 as a consequence of
the worsening shortage of foreign exchange for imported equipment and
materials and the deteriorating condition of the cable network (Annex 1).
Over the same period, the registered waiting list increased by about 20%
p.a.; by the end of 1986 it had expanded to 64,000. Working lines thus
satisfied only 46% of total demand. Demand for telex services has also
grown faster than the number of connections and only 48% of the total de-
mand for telex service is satisfied.
2.10      Because of overall macro resource constraints, meeting demand is
clearly not a realistic policy option for the foreseeable future. The
allocation of scarce DELs to those with greatest need thus assumes critical
importance. In allocating new connections, TPTC gives priority to
essential services. It is considering modifications in the tariff
structure, such as the introduction of subscriber deposits, or a peak load
pricing structure (para 4.08). To overcome the shortage of telex
terminals, which are currently leased from TPTC, direct imports of telex
terminals by private subscribers has been permitted since 1984 for
connection to the network; this should reduce the telex waiting list.
B. The Entity - TPTC
Organization and Management
2.11      TPTC, created by law in December 1977 (para 2.01), is an autono-
mous government-owned corporation administered by an eight-member Board of
Directors, whose Chairman and Director General are appointed by the P-asi-
dent of Tanzania.  The other six members are appointed by the Minister of
Communications and Works. Since its inception, TPTC has established a
managerial framework, financial structure, manpower development and
information base to meet its perceived needs.  However, the systems are
fragmented and management lacks interactive and timely information. The
new management (appointed by the GOT in August 1986) has recognized the
need to strengthen TPTC's operations, organization and efficiency to
maintain and operate the existing network, undertake further rehabilitation
and plan for expansion. TPTC has therefore, assigned consultants (para
2.24) to undertake a comprehensive review of TPTC's organizational
structure, administrative and financial procedures, and management's
authority in administration and finance relative to the Board. The
Tanzania Posts and Telecommunications Corporation Act of 1977, which
governs TPTC's relationship and activities with other government ministries
and agencies and powers of the Board, will also be reviewed and amendments
recoumended to reflect TPTC's enhanced future responsibilities. TPTC's
current organization chart is given in Annex 2.



-5-
Staff and Training
2.12      As of December 31, 1986, TPTC had about 4,125 employees in tele-
communication operations. The staff ratio of about 69 per 1,000 DELs,
although high, is not excessive given the manual operation of the local
telephone service iP many areas, and of the long distance telephone and
telegraph services all over the country, as well as the maintenance needs
of the numerous open wire lines. With the gradual automation of services,
digitalization of sw-itching equipment, and replacement of open wire lines
by cables and radio systems, the staff ratio should, however, decrease.
TPTC expects to reduce the ratio to 55 staff per 1,000 DELs by 1990 through
retraining, reassignment and natural attrition as part of the
implementation of a detailed manpower plan, for which technical assistance
is provided under the project. The staff ratio will be monitored annually
in IDA's annual review of TPTC's performance (para 3.15).
2.13      There is a severe shortage of trained and experienced management
and staff, particularly in the engineering and financial grades. Further-
more, the staff morale and productivity are low, partly as a result of low
salaries, which in real terms have been declining significantly in recent
years. These problems are compounded by the lack of an incentive structure
to reward performance. In order to improve productivity in TPTC and to
make it a competitive employer, it is essential to introduce appro,riate
and workable incentive schemes. Consultants (para 2.24) have reviewed
TPTC's staff emoluments and benefits, including establishment of profit
centers, quality circles and bonuses based on performance targets and have
recommended changes which are consistent with overall Government guidelines
and Tanzania's recent experience with other parastatals. An acceptable
incentive scheme would consist of a list of performance categories, a
monitoring system and a pre-announced award system. TPTC agreed to develop
the details of such a scheme and forward it to GOT and IDA for their review
and approval by January 1, 1988. The scheme would be implemented by no
later than June 30, 1988.
2.14      TPTC has a new training center in Dar-es-Salaam, financed partly
by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), which offers
instruction and training programs (Annex 3) in most of TPTC's operational
activities. These in-house training facilities are supplemented by esta-
blished national training institutions and staff assignments with overseas
telecommunications administrations, universities, and manufacturers. Since
1979, when SIDA support was initiated, the annual training volume has
4oubled to 9,600 student weeks but is still inadequate to meet TPTC's
needs. TPTC plans to expand training to deliver about 15,000 student weeks
by 1990. The training center needs little additional investment in physi-
cal facilities, but improvements are needed in the quantity and quality of
training delivered. TPTC's Directorate of Manpower Development and Admini-
stration, which is respensible for assessing the training needs of all TPTC
staff, and for preparing and implementing staff development plans, has
identified critical shortages of technical staff and urgent training needs
in the maintenance of cables, subscriber equipment, switching, and trans-
mission and works supervision. Support for improving and expanding the



- 6 -
technical training program at TPTC's training center would be provided by
SIDA under the proposed project (para 3.04 and Annex 7).
2.15      TPTC has no program for managerial, administrative or financial
training. Some students have been sent on an ad hoc basis to a multina-
tional training institution in Arusha and to Nairobi, but those facilities
are limited. The project provides for about 40 overseas fellowships in
technical, commercial and financial functions. TPTC will agree with IDA on
the training disciplines and locations for fellowships by
December 31, 1987.
2.16      TPTC's current (1984-90) manpower plan emphasizes a reduction of
the overall staff ratio (para 2.12) by increasing productivity as the
system develops. There are no strict standards for staff recruitment or
requirements. It also does not accommodate the impact of technical changes
on staffing requirements nor the suitability of staff for redeployment
within the organization. With consultants' assistance (para 2.24), TPTC
will review its manpower plan and by December 31, 1988, will establish a
cnmputer data base for all staff records, incorporating its requirements,
targets and recruitment strategy.
Computerization
2.17      TPTC purchased and installed a computer under the first project
and has initiated recruitment and training of additional staff to utilize
the system's full capacity. The computer is now being tested for transfer-
ring billing and the payroll from an out-of-house computer. Additional key
areas for computerization as well as the necessary staff and other
resources have been identified by the consultants provided under the PPF.
Technical assistance to implement the systems in these areas is provided
under the proposed project (para 3.04).
Billing and Collection of Receivables
2.18      In theory TPTC has a strict billing and disconnection policy.
Monthly bills not paid within 14 days of the billing date of service should
be disconnected without notice. In practice, billing delays amount to
about 2 months. The transfer of billing to TPTC's in-house computer
(para 2.17) is expected to reduce billing de'lays to one month by the end of
FY88 which would be acceptable. Collection of accounts receivable is also
poor. Total accounts receivable, as recorded in the balance sheet for
FY85, are shown as TSh 953 million. However, total actual subscriber
receivables as of December 31, 1985 amounted to TSh 642 million. The gap
represents the two month billing delay, receivables from foreign admini-
strations and some postal receivables. Furthermore, about TSh 200 million
of receivables are more than 6 months old and, with little realistic pros-
pect of payment, should be written off. Incorporating these qualifica-
tions, outstanding accounts receivable, are equivalent to about 4 months of
revenues, which is high. Poor accounting recording and controls also de-
lays the recording of cash receipts. The billing and accounting systems
were reviewed by the consultants under the PPF (see TORs, Annex 4). Their



-7-
agreed recommendations will implemented by TPTC with the assistance of
consultants financed under the project (para 3.04). Progress will be
reviewed by IDA as part of the annual performance review (para 3.15).
TPTC's write off policy will also be reviewed. By December 31, 1987, TPTC
will present and agree with IDA upon a plan of action to reduce outstanding
subscriber receivables to two months of revenues by end 1990. TPTC will
also maintain an aging list of receivables to be forwarded to IDA every six
months commencing December 31, 1987.
International Payments
2.19      Severe overvaluation of TShillings and congestiotn in the local
network (paras 2.05, 2.06) have resulted in a high volume of outgoing
international telephone traffic relative to incoming traffic (at a ratio of
2 to 1); thus TPTC has to make substantial payments to foreign administra-
tions. As of December 31, 1985, these payments were about $11.2 million
equivalent. Although the Bank of Tanzania has approved most of TPTC's pay-
ment applications and received the equivalent amount in local currency, few
remittances have been made due to the country's foreign exchange shortage.
To reduce the imbalance TPTC is considering allocating more capacity to
incoming calls by deliberately delaying the outgoing calls beyond the peak
period for incoming calls. However, major improvement in incoming calls
cannot be achieved until the poor performance of the local network is
improved; only 25Z of incoming calls are successful. In January 1987, TPTC
increased the international tariff by 120% to partially compensate for the
devaluation of the TShilling since the last tariff revision February 1985.
Furthermore international tariffs are now quoted in dollars in an attempt
to minimize the impact of currency realignment. The project provides
technical assistance for improved record keeping and international traffic
management.
Accounts and Audit
2.20      TPTC prepares accounts both on a cash and commercial basis but
has been slow in finalizing accounts and having them audited by the
Tanzania Audit Corporation (TAC). Recent improvements resulted in draft
1985 accounts being finalized by TPTC in June 1986 and submitted to TAC for
audit. The audit report was received in March 1987, 15 months after the
close of TPTC's fiscal year. While this is later than the 6 month period
agreed to in the First Credit Agreement (Cr-1173) and stipulated by TPTC
Act (para 2.01), it is a major improvement over previous years when the
production of audited accounts took one to four years. TAC has recently
solved its staffing problems and should be able to reduce the audit
period. Provisional accounts for FY86 are expected to be completed by TPTC
by June 1987, and the audit report is expected from TAC by August 1987.
Furthermore, TPTC has taken corrective action to implement the auditor's
recommendations in those areas where lack of documentation or proper
accounting procedures did not permit a non-qualified audit. The technical
assistance to be provided under the project would support these efforts
(para 3.04). This includes the establishment of a computerized fixed
assets register (para 4.04); for which the telecoimunications asset



revaluation study (October 1986) is a good base; improving physical control
of materials and supplies; verification of the value of stores and
improving recording for international payments. TPTC will prepare and
forward to IDA draft and audited financial, special and project accounts
within 4 months and 9 months respectively of the end of FY87, e and 8
months respectively of the end of FY88, 3 and 6 months respectively of the
end of FY89 and 2 and 6 months respectively of the end of FY90.
C. Development
Sector Goals
2.21      The Government has recognized communications as vital for econo-
mic development and considers well functioning telecommunications crucial
to the 1986-89 Economic Recovery Program (ERP) and its achievement of the
targeted growth in exports and increased efficiencies in the productive
sectors. Priority is given to rehabilitation and maintenance of existing
facilities rather than to network expansion. The main sector goals are to:
(a) increase operational efficiency and quality of service
through network rehabilitation, introduction of an effec-
tive maintenance program and improved management systems,
and staff development;
(b) ensure that revenues cover operating costs and contribute
significantly to investments;
(c) generate revenues for Government; and
(d) extend services to rural areas.
Sector Constraints
2.22      The main constraints to sector development are:
(a)  lack of management skills and system  and trained man-
power, which constrain TPTC's capacity to maintain the
existing facilities and to prepare and implement develop-
ment projects; and
(b)  lack of foreign exchange, which limits procurement of
essential equipment and materials for maintenance and
expansion.
2.23      Lack of Management Skills and Systeas and Trained Manpower.
TPTC's current managerial framework and management system  are fragmented
and constrain sector development (para 2.11). Particular weaknesses exist
in muanpoper planning, budgeting and cost control, inventory management,
project implementation, network management, maintenance, and customer
service, as well as in data processing capabilities. Furthermore, there is
a severe shortage of trained and experienced managers and staff at all



- 9 -
levels, exacerbated by low salaries and incentives (para 2.13), which in
turn contribute to a lack of motivation among the existing staff.
2.24      To overcome current institutional deficiencies and develop an
effective and efficient management, TPTC appointed consultants, under a
PPF for $600,000 approved on November 11, 1986. They have undertaken a
comprehensive review of organization and management in the administrative,
technical and financial disciplines, identifying weaknesses, and have
recommended corrective measures. The TORs (Annex 4) for these assignments
were prepared with IDA's assistance. Specifically the consultants were to
review, recommend and propose an action plan on the following: (a) the
Tanzania Posts and Telecommunications Corporation Act of 1977; (b) TPTC's
relationship with the Government and its agencies; (c) TPTC's
organizational structure and management procedures (including introduction
of adequate management information systems); (d) delegation of
administrative and financial powers to lower levels of TPTC's management;
(e) norms of staff sanctions and productivity, long-term manpower plans,
recruitment and training programs; within the purview of Government
directives for state enterprises, staff emoluments and benefits; (f)
maintenance procedures, service quality norms and procedures for monitoring
service quality; (g) stores and materials control; and (h) use of computers
for efficient use of network capacity. The consultants' recommendations
were discussed and agreed between IDA and TPTC during negotiations.
Technical assistance amounting to about 140 manmonths is provided under the
project for implementation of agreed recommendations in these areas,
according to an action plan agreed upon during negotiations (para 3.04).
2.25      TPTC's work program includes areas that could be implemented
by outside agencies, such as subscriber installation, vehicle and electri-
cal equipment repair, transportation and computer activities. Such exter-
nal participation could relieve TPTC of current logistical problems and
speed up implementation. These nontelecommunications activities within
TPTC are currently inefficiently organized, lack skilled workers, operators
and uechanics and essential equipment. Major financing and training would
be needed to upgrade these activities if they are to be retained within
TPTC. Given TPTC's shortage of administrative capacity (para 2.11), suc-
cess from such an effort is doubtful. Consultants will assist TPTC in
identifying such activities and by December 31, 1987, TPTC will, In
consuluation with Government and IDA, prepare an action plan and commence
implementation of the following measures to increase its efficiency
through: (a) restructuring of its organizational structure and management
procedures; (b) establishing profit centers; and (c) contracting out those
activities which can be handled more efficiently by other agencies.
2.26      Lack of Foreign Exchange.  Over the past five years, TPTC has had
limited access to foreign exchange for essential spare parts and routine
operational requirements because of Tanzania's general foreign exchange
shortage and the relatively low priority accorded to the telecommunications
sector by the Government. As a result, the quality of service has remained
poor and declined in many areas (para 2.05). The project provides foreign
exchange to meet the urgently required purchase of services, equipment and



- 10 -
materials for rehabilitation, and maintenance and includes the
reestablishment of sufficient stock levels for the project implementation
period, with a minimum inventory level of six months by project completion
(December 31, 1990). However, given the continuing need to import spare
parts beyond the project period, the sustainability of a well functioning
telecommunications network will depend on the long term availability of
foreign funds. It is important that TPTC's and GOT's future investment
plans and annual budgets take this constraint into consideration.
Bank Group's Role and Strategy
2.27      Past Experience.  The World Bank Group has been associated with
the telecommunications sector in Tanzania since 1966, first through the
East African Community (EAC) and then directly with Tanzania. Prior to
1977, telecommunications services in EAC were managed by the BAC
Telecommunications Corporation. The Bank approved three loans to the EAC;
a $13.0 million loan in 1967 (Ln 483-EA), a $10.4 million loan in 1970
(Ln 675-EA) and a third loan of $32.5 million in 1973 (Ln 914-EA). These
were completed satisfactorily. The first credit to Tanzania, following the
breakup of the EAC in 1977, of SDR 22.1 million ($27 million equivalent),
was approved in July 1982 (Credit 1173); the original closing date of June
30, 1986 has been extended to June 30, 1987. The credit supported an
essential part of TPTC's 1980-86 investment program, focusing on service
expansion to rural areas and expansion of the network to presently unserved
or underserved areas, both urban and rural. It also had a broad
institutional objective of developing TPTC, mainly through expanding
training facilities. Progress has been good and the physical improvement
components of the project have been implemented: (a) improved long
distance communication links through replacement of highly fault-prone open
wire line by radio microwave systems; (b) provision of a pilot digital
exchange; (c) improved local cable networks in 90 urban and rural centers
(Mwanza, Shinyanga, Tabora); (d) telex service extended to 500 new
subscribers; and (e) training of 30 senior TPTC staff, mostly in
engineering and finance. In retrospect, the project shoul-i have given
higher priority to maintenance and rehabilitation. Full project benefits
have not been realized due to the persistent lack of complementar7 foreign
exchange, even for basic maintenance and rehabilitation, and poor
management (para 2.23) resulting in severe deterioration of the country's
telecommunications network. Furthermore, the institutional component was
limited and TPTC lacked staff incentives to retain staff once they had
received training.
2.28      IDA's Role.  These are three main reasons for IDA's assistance to
Government in the telecommunications sector in Tanzania. First, IDA is a
unique source of advice to Government on sector management and
organization, financial management, investment planning and staff
training. Second, IDA is needed to maintain a balance between physical and
institutional development of the sector. Bilateral funding support is not
necessarily institutionally oriented and typically it does not finance
maintenance. Without an IDA presence, it is likely that inadequate
attention would be paid to improving management and strengthening
technical, financial and maintenance systems compared to network



- 11 -
expansion. The project components supported by IDA will focus exclusively
on these items and will ensure that adequate foreign exchange for operation
and maintenance is made available to the sector. IDA's third role is to
help focus and coordinate bilateral assistance. Although Government
experienced early difficulties in securing cofinancing, IDA's involvement
has attracted participation by the AfDB, and the Italian and Swedish
Governments, who will finance a substantial part of the program. Donors
have significantly modified their support as a result of the appraisal
process for this project.
2.29      Current IDA Strategy.  Given the sector constraints (para 2.22),
and goals (paras 2.21) IDA's strategy, at Governrint's request, is to
finance the network's most urgent rehabilitation and maintenance needs and
to provide technical assistance to support sector reorganization,
management improvement and development of technical and financial systems.
IDA's efforts in the sector are consistent with and complement initiatives
currently undertaken by the GOT (and supported by IDA's Multisector
Rehabilitation Credit) for other priority parastatals in Tanzania. In
addition, IDA will discourage new investment until the above issues are
addressed. Network rehabilitation will also be financed by SIDA and AfDB;
Italian assistance will expand international facilities.
III. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
A. Description
The Program and Project
3.01      Within the framework of GOT's overall Economic Recovery Program
and consistent with the sector goals (para 2.21), TPTC's 1986-90 Investment
Program (Annex 5) is designed to: (a) rehabilitate the countrywide long
distance network: 46% of total program costs; (b) rehabilitate local net-
works: 35%; (c) improve international facilities: 12%; and (d) enhance
TPTC's management capabilities: 7%. The financing of maintenance and
spare parts is included in these components. The total cost of the program
is estimated at TSh 3,575.0 million ($65 million) with a foreign exchange
component of TSh 2,860.0 million ($52.0 million). It includes ongoing
works ($5.0 million), and works under the proposed project
($60.0 million). Sources of financing for the program are detailed in
Annex 6.
Project Objectives
3.02      The project objectives are to address the sector constraints
(para 2.22) by:
(a) strengthening TPTC's management, organization, financial
and engineering systems to maintain and operate the
existing network, to undertake further rehabilitation and
to plan for expansion; and



- 12 -
(b) rehabilitating key parts of the networks, removing
bottlenecks and imbalances to ma.i"ze capacity utiliza-
tion of existing installations.
Pro-lect Components
3.03      The Project (Annex 7) consists of the following components:
Part A. Rehabilitation:
(a) provision of equipment for rehabilitation of local cable
networks and subscriber facilities;
(b) replacement of worn out or obsolete switching and trans-
mission equipment, including marginal expansion where
justified by substantial excess demand (e.g., Pugu Road
industrial area, Bukoba and Kigoma agricultural area);
(c) installation of new transit exchanges for local and
international traffic and a satellite earth station for
international services;
(d) upgrading of maintenance facilities by providing tool and
test equipment, spare parts and specialized vehicles,
training equipment, upgrading the stores and the repair
facilities in workshops; and
(e) upgrading the computer facilities for: (i) introduction
of management information systems; and (ii) automation of
local cable and subscriber data to ensure optimLn utili-
zation of existing resources.
Part B. Technical Assistance and Training:
(a) for strengthening TPTC's organizational structure and
management systems;
(b) for strengthening TPTC's training programs; and
(c) overseas training for about 40 staff (for a total of 150
manmonths) in disciplines and locations to be agreed with
IDA commencing in 1988.
3.04      The technical assistance will be provided both by the SIDA and
IDA and comprises an appropriate balance of technical and institutional
strengthening. There are good prospects of sustained project benefits
through extensive training of counterpart staff. SIDA's assistance (about
100 manuonths) will focus on technical support for the installation and
operation of new equipment to be financed under the project and on
improving training by providing experts for TPTC's training center. IDA's
assistance (about 140 manmonths) will incorporate the agreed



- 13 -
recommendations prepared by the PPF consultants, (para 2.24) and will
assist TPTC in managing five critical areas-project planning, monitoring
and control; installation, operations and maintenance; financial management
and planning; materials management and data processing capabilities. Six
experts will be provided to work in line positions In TPTC and assist in
the organization and supervision of the network rehabilitation and
undertake on the job training of TPTC's counterpart staff in:
(a) Project planning, monitoring and control-an expert
to assist TPTC in establishing a central planning office
and project monitoring and control group; in designing
and developing planning, implementation and control
procedures and practices; and on guidelines for future
network operations and planning.
(b)  Installation, operations and maintenance-an expert and 3
technicians assist TPTC on field control and coordination
of operation and maintenance activities, setting of
standards for quality of service, maintenance operations
and performance; updating engineering instructions as
necessary and production of operational and maintenance
statistics. The expert and the technicians will ensure
that maintenance procedures are fully understood by
counterpart staff.
(c) Financial management and planning-two experts to assist
in the design and implementation of financial management
systems including the computerization of the accounting
system, separation of postal and telecommunications
accounts, budgeting, forecasting, cost control and stores
accounting.
(d) Materials management-an expert to assist TPTC in setting
up a comprehensive and integrated stores and material
management control procedure based on current and future
requirements of TPTC.
(e) Management information system-an expert to assist in
establishing an integrated management information system
to provide the data necessary for senior management to
monitor performance. TPTC's computer system will also be
updated, particularly for subscriber, financial and local
network data.
Draft terms of reference for the IDA financed experts are given in
Annex 8. TPTC will appoint, by no later than December 31, 1987, the six
experts and three technicians under terms of reference and conditions of
employment satisfactory to IDA. By the sae date, TPTC is expected to
appoint at least six counterpart officials and the necessary supervisory
staff to work with the experts and technicians. The counterpart officials
will subsequently head their respective units. TPTC will review with IDA,



- 14 -
by no later than October 1 each year, the implementation of all technical
assistance and counterpart staff training and agree to the implementation
objectives for the following year.

facilities over the project period. IBRD Map No. 20127-TA shows planned
telecommunications development in Tanzania under the proposed project.
B. Costs
Project Costs
3.06      The total cost of the project, including the PPF advance of
$600,000, is estimated at about TSh 3,300.0 million ($60.0 million), with a
foreign exchange component of about TSh 2,695.0 million ($49.0 million).
Costs are based on TPTC's experience with contracts under the first IDA
project and on experience in other countries of the region, adjusted to mid
1987 prices. TPTC is not liable for customs duties or taxes. The base
cost of technical assistance is estimated at $2.8 million. Project costs
are summarized below (Table 3.1).

Contingencies
3.07      Physical contingencies are estimated at 5% of local and foreign
costs for equipment, 10% on local and foreign costs for services and 10% on
civil works. Foreign price contingencies are based on annual foreign cost
increases of 3.0% in 1987 and 1.0% in 1988, 1989 and 1990. Local price
contingencies reflect annual increases of 20% in 1987, 15% in 1988 and
1989, and 10% in 1990.
Project Financing
3.08      The sources of project financing (Annex 6) are summarized in
Table 3.2 below. The project's foreign costs of $49.0 million equivalent
would be financed by AfDB, Italian aid, Swedish govcrnment aid and the IDA
credit. Local currency financing, estimated at $11.0 million equivalent,
will be provided by TPTC through internally generated funds.

3.09      The IDA Credit of $23.0 million equivalent would be onlent to
TPTC at 7.92% for 20 years including a 4 year grace period. The loans from
SIDA and Italy will be onlent to TPTC under the same concessionary terms as
to the Government. The loan from AfDB will be onlent to TPTC on the same
terms as the IDA credit. TPTC will bear the foreign exchange risks. The
execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and TPTC,
acceptable to IDA is a condition of credit effectiveness. The IDA financed
segment of the program comprises high priority critical elements,
particularly for spare parts and maintenance, and can stand on its own.
Cross effectiveness conditions are therefore not required. Moreover, the
parallel financing from AfDB, SIDA and the Italian Government is largely
confirmed.
3.10      TPTC's 1986-90 Rehabilitation Investment Program (para 3.01) has
been designed to address the urgent maintenance and rehabilitation needs
and to avert further deterioration of the network which is near collapse.
Given the prevailing macro resource constraints in Tanzania a larger



- 16 -
program is not feasibie. Furthermore, any major additions to the program
would impose a serious strain on TPTC's financial and institutional
resources. Consequently, TPTC will consult with IDA before undertaking
works outside the approved investment program which would require
investment of $2 million equivalent or more each year. Furthermore, TPTC
will review and agree with GOT and IDA, by no later than October 1 each
year, TPTC's annual expenditure budget within the agreed five-year
program. Disbursement of the specified IDA share of the annual financing
plan for TPTC's agreed five-year program would be conditional on agreement
on the annual expenditure program and provision of the agreed TPTC/GOT
funding. IDA's disbursements would be reduced pro rata if the annual
program is reduced below the levels indicated in the five-year program.

About $15.6 million of equipment (including contingencies) to be financed
by IDA would be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Spare parts and components costing
about $3.3 million for rehabilitation of existing equipment would be
procured through negotiations with the original suppliers subject to prices
being satisfactory to IDA. Limited International Bidding (bIB) would be
used to procure about $1.1 million of measuring equipment and tools for
which there are only a limited number of suppliers. IDA financed contracts
for more than $250,000 equivalent would be subject to IDA's prior review of
procurement documentation; this would cover about 85% of the total value of
IDA financed contracts, Other IDA financed contracts would be subject to
post-award review. Selection of IDA-financed consultants (about
$2.4 million equivalent) would be in accordance with IDA guidelines. Local
procurement of equipment and services to be financed by TPTC
($11.0 million) would be in accordance rith existing TPTC procedures which
are acceptable to IDA. To minimize possible delays, advanced procurement
activity has been undertaken by TPTC, including IDA's review of all
procurement packages which it will finance. By April 30, 1987, TPTC had
finalized and submitted to IDA for review and clearance, bid documents for
50% (by value) of the IDA-financed items. It is expected that bid
documents for a further 20% (by value) o  LDA-financed items will be
submitted to IDA for review and approval, enabling TPTC to issue bids for
about 70% (by value) of IDA-financed items by May 31, 1987. Procurement of
all equipment and services to be financed by Italian Government and SIDA
would be in accordance with their respective procedures. About $5.0
million of equipment (including contingencies), to be financed by AfDB
would be procured under their procurement guidelines.
Disbursement
3.12      Disbursement would be made against full standard documentation.
The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 10) is based on the Bank's
standard disbursement profile for all projects in East Africa. According
to this schedule, disbursement would be completed by December 31, 1995.
Rowever due to the advanced procurement activity it is expected that the
project and disbursements will be completed much earlier. A Special
Account in foreign currency of $2.0 million equivalent will be established
by GOT and held in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Association. This amount represents about four months of estimated
disbursements during the forecast peak disbursement period of 1988-89. The
Special Account for the IDA credit is replenishable and would be used for
disbursements against all foreign expenditures.
3.13      The proposed IDA credit of $23.0 million would be disbursed as
follows:

Implementation
3.14      The project, except for switching and transmission installations,
which will be executed on a turnkey basis as part of the equipment supply
contract, will be implemented by the TPTC staff, which has gained
experience under the First Telecommunications Project, over 1987-90. Civil
works for outside plant and mechanical services will be executed by
contractors under TPTC's supervision. To ensure coordination of all
project items and implementation of the project on schedule, TPTC will
appoint a Project Coordinator with adequate administrative and financial
autonomy. The Project Coordinator shall be responsible for implementation
of all development works in TPTC. His appointment, under terms of
reference and conditions of service agreed between TPTC and IDA, is a
condition of credit effectiveness. To minimize implementation delays,
technical assistance has been provided under the project which wil1 be
monitored annually (para 3.04). IDA's annual review of TPTC's expenditure
program (para 3.10) and frequent IDA supervision particularly in 1987 and
1988, will result in close monitoring of implementation. The proposed
implementation program for the major components is presented in Annex 11.
The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1990.
Performance Indicators
3.15      Upgrading TPTC's management systems will be monitored through
selected performance indicators on service quality, financial performance,
operating efficiency, and project implementation. TPTC and IDA agreed that
the performance indicators (Annex 12) represent desirable and feasible
goals, which IDA will review annually with TPTC. Targets and detailed
action plans designed to achieve them were agreee for 1987/88 (Annex 12).



- 19 -
By no later than October 1 each year, TPTC will review with Government and
IDA its performance against agreed targets, and agree on targets for
subsequent years together with an action plan to improve performance if
necessary. TPTC will report progress against the physical and
implementation indicators in quarterly project reports and against
financial indicators in annual financial statements. The Bank will use
these indicators as a guide in supervision.
IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Financial Analysis
Past Financial Performance
4.01      TPTC's financial performance was mixed during 1980-85 due to high
inflation, currency devaluations and infrequent tariff adjustments.
The quality of service deteriorated and despite tariff increases of 25% in
1983, and 33% in February 1985, real revenues per DEL declined by about 50X
over 1980. The imbalance of international traffic, (para 2.19) resulted in
an outflow of payments to other national authorities, more than doubling
from TSh 47 million ($5.9 million) in 1980 to TSh 184 million ($11*2
million) in 1985. The rate of return on net fixed telecommunications
assets (book value) in operation (after tax) rose from about 8% in 1980 to
53% in 1985. Telecommunications assets were revalued in 1985 (para 4.04);
the revalued rate of return was revised to 18%, easily meeting the 12% rate
of return covenant of the first project. TPTC's financial performance over
1980-85 is given in Annex 13 and summarized in Table 4.1 below.

4.02      TPTC's improved performance in 1985 reflected improvements in
telecommunications operations and tariff increases in 1983 and 1985. The
postal service, which is expected to operate on a break-even basis,
increased its losses from TSh 16 million ($2.0 million) in 1980 to TSh 42



- 20 -
million ($2.5 million) in 1985, which in turn remained equivalent to about
10% of telecommunications annual operating income. The postal losses were
easily covered by the telecommunications operating surplus. TPTC's
accounting system can separate the direct postal operation costs and
revenues but cannot yet produce separate financial statements for postal
operations. However, with consultants' assistance provided by the project
(par 3.04), TPTC will, by December 31, 1987, establish a computerized fixed
assets register and establish a methodology for regular asset revaluation
to be agreed with IDA. An acceptable methodology to IDA would comprise a
periodic review every three years of fixed asset values with a revaluation
index of 5% to be applied in the interim years. The size of the index and
the frequency of the review would be reviewed and if necessary adjusted
during project supervision. Telecommunications and postal accounts will be
separated by December 31, 1988.
TPTC's Financial Position
4.03      Despite fluctuating operating performance during 1980-85, TPTC's
financial position has remained satisfactory although the debt-equity ratio
has deteriorated to 47:53 due to the expansion in long-term loans.
Liquidity has increased with the current ratio improving from 1.6 to 2.3.
Accounting for billing delays, outstanding accounts receivable as of end
1985 were equivalent to about four months of revenues which is high
(para 2.18). TPTC's financial position is summarized below.

Revaluation of Assets
4.04      An asset revaluation study completed in October 1986, resulted in
a revaluation of gross fixed telecommunications assets as of end 1985 by 5
times. This revalued asset value has since been further revised to reflect
the recent devaluation. TPTC agreed that commencing with end FY87, the
financial accounts would reflect revaluation of TPTC's assets and
liabilities.
Financial Projections
4.05      TPTC's consolidated projected financial statements with
accompanying assumptions for the project period FY87-90 (Annex 14) are
summarized in Table 4.3. The recent devaluation in mid 1986 of about 160%
will increase the cost of imported equipment and materials, payments to
international administrations and foreign debt service. To partially
compensate for this, in January 1987 TPTC increased postal tariffs by 60%,
local telecommunications tariffs by 50%,. and international tariffs by
120%. International tariffs are now quoted in dollars thus providing an
element of automaticity. In the projections, no further tariff increases
have been assumed. Projected financial performance appears satisfactory
reflecting improvements in the quality of service, maintenance and
management. Total cash operating cost increases/DEL are about 19% p.a. and
staff costs/DEL are assumed to increase by about 5% p.a. in real terms In
1988, 1989 and 1990. Maintenance/DEL is expected to increase in real terms
by 10% in 1988 and 1989 and by 5% in 1990.  Total operating revenues/DEL
should increase by about 20% p.a. in real terms over the same period.
Postal losses are assumed to be eliminated in 1987 as a result of the above
increase in postal tariffs. The rate of return on revalued average net
fixed telecommunications assets after tax is expected to increase from
about 22% as of end FY87 to about 31% as of end FY90 due to efficiency
improve;tents under the project. TPTC and Government have agreed to make
tariff 4/ and efficiency improvements sufficient to achieve an annual rate
of return on revalued average net fixed telecommunications assets of at
least 12% after tax.

Financing Forecast
4.06      Table 4.4 below summarizes TPTC's projected flow of funds over
the project period (Annex 14). Government will onlend credit proceeds to
TPTC at 7.92% for 20 years including 4 years of grace, with TPTC bearing
the foreign exchange risk. TPTC agreed to take appropriate measures
sufficient to ensure that its net internal cash generation for the current
year shall not be less than 50% of the two-year moving average of TPTC's
total investment requirements (including incremental working capital) for
the current year and the following year. Foreign exchange is the main
constraint to TPTC's development program (para 2.22). Due to Tanzania's
overriding macro resource constraints, the Government is unable to
guarantee a flow of foreign exchange to TPTC. However, with the assistance
of consultants (para 3.04) TPTC will prepare and discuss with Government a
resource transfer policy to address TPTC's foreign exchange needs
(para 4.12). In addition to financing TPTC's foreign exchange requirements
for spare parts and equipment, IDA will be partially financing TPTC's
foreign exchange requirements of operation and maintenance. During IDA's
annual review (para 3.15), TPTC will review with Government and IDA its
foreign exchange needs for financing operating costs and identify sources
of funds to meet such needs. Furthermore, disbursement of the IDA share of
the annual financing plan would be conditional upon agreement on the annual
expenditure program and provision of the agreed TPTC/Government funding
(para 3.10).

B. Economic Analysis
Tariffs
4.07      Level.  Tariffs set by the East African Posts and Telecommunica-
tions Corporation in February 1975 remained in effect until September 1983
when they were reviewed and the level increased by 25%. A further tariff
increase of 33% occurred in February 1985. The tariff structure was not
reviewed in either 1983 or 1985. The combination of infrequent tariff re-
views, combined with continuing inflation, at about 25% p.a. over 1980-85,
resulted in a decline in real tariffs by about 100% over 1980-85. The
tariff adjustments that did occur also produced substantial swings in
overall profitability (para 4.01). The real cost of outgoing interna':ional
calls fell substantially during this period and exacerbated the interna-
tional imbalance problem (para 2.19). In January 1987, TPTC increased
tariffs to partially compensate for inflation and the recent devaluation.
International telephone and telex tariffs, which are now quoted in dollars,
were increased by 120%, domestic telecommunications tariffs were increased
by 50% and postal services by 60% (Annex 15).
4.08      Policy and Structure.  Consultants (financed by the first
project) analyzed the present tariff level and structure and concluded (in
October 1986) that existing services were underpriced. The January 1987
increase largely rectified the issue of tariff levels, which will now be
sufficient to meet the financial covenants (paras 4.05 and 4.06) but the
structure remains a problem. Furthermore, the expected rapid inflation
rate will also require more regular adjustment in levels if real rates are
to be maintained. With PPF consultants' assistance, TPTC is preparing a
tariff policy proposal including a mechanism for periodic tariff review to
ensure automatic tariff increases, providing TPTC has achieved the
efficiency improvements to be agreed under the project. Such an automatic
increase could be at the level of the inflation rate less 'x', where 'x'
represents efficiency improvements. The resulting tariff increases would
be reviewed every three years to ensure that they are in line with
inflation increases and currency realignment. The proposal would also
consider the introduction of a peak pricing system since demand is high and
relatively price inelastic (para 2.10). Government has provided IDA with a
statement of intent to introduce a revised tariff policy incorporating the
objective of automaticity. Government agread to introduce by January 31,
1988, a tariff policy, which had been reviewed and agreed with IDA, which
would include a formula and mechanism allowing TPTC to adjust its tariffs
automatically, provided efficiency improvements have been made.
Project Benefits
4.09      A countrywide network of reasonably well functioning telecommuni-
cations services is essential to support the Government's objectives under
the Economic Recovery Program. Efforts to increase export growth, increase
production efficiency and ease transportation bottlenecks are being
seriously impeded by inadequate communications, particularly between
Dar-es-Salaam and other regional capitals, and between them and the



- . 4 -
district centers and other principal towns. The proposed project will
follow on from the successful ongoing First Telecommunications Project
(para 2.27) and will protect existing investments, introduce effective
maintenance programs and halt the deterioration in the network. Key
elements of the network will be rehabilitated, bottlenecks and imbalances
will be alleviated to maximize utilization of existing installations.
Furthermore, TPTC's management and organization systems will be
strengthened to improve maintenance and operation of the existing network.
The project is consistent with the Bank's development assistance objective
for Tanzania, since it would develop an essential infrastructure sector,
and Improve productivity in other sectors, particularly transportation
infrastructure and agricultural marketing.
Risks
4.10      The project faces no unusual risks.  However, there is a risk
that TPTC will implement management improvements more slowly than
anticipated. Technical assistance is provided under the project in line
positions to assist in institutional development and will minimize this
risk. The impact of technical assistance will be reviewed annually with
IDA and TPTC will be required to agree to the implementation objectives for
the following year (para 3.04). Annual reviews of specific project
performance criteria will identify technical and financial problems and
determine measures to resolve them in a timely fashion (para 3.15).
Advanced procurement activity will minimize physical implementation
delays.  The risk that inadequate foreign exchange (para 2.22) will be
available during the project period is being addressed by financing of the
foreign exchange requirements of the program, including the provision of
spare parts and the financing of recurrent maintenance costs. The
occurrence of a longer term foreign exchange constraint facing TPTC for
spare parts after the project period will be dependent on the prevailing
macroeconomic climate in Tanzania. This will be monitored and addressed in
the consideration of future lending operations. The risk of a shortage of
domestic supply of imported components, e.g., building materials, is
addressed by the project's financing of indirect foreign exchange, and
providing TPTC with foreign exchange for their direct import if necessary.
Return on Investment
4.11      The rate of return calculations are based on the entire invest-
ment program. The projected financial and economic rates of return are 45%
and 40% respectively (Annex 16). These are in line with experience in
other countries and reflect the high rehabilitation content of the pro-
gram. The financial rate of return is based on the incremental benefits
and costs to TPTC. The minimum estimated economic rate of return includes
an estimate of consumer surplus and local costs and revenues are adjusted
by a standard conversion factor of 0.5. Sensitivity analysis indicates
that in the worst case scenario, (20% cost increase, 20% benefit decrease),
the ERR falls to about 22%.



- 25 -
Resource Mobilization
4.12      TPTC, as a public corporation is currently liable to income tax
at 50%. Over the project period (1987-90), this is expected to generate
about TSh 2,502 million ($45.5 million) for the Government. In addition,
the 5% sales tax on subscriber billing, which TPTC collects for the govern-
ment, is expected to generate about TSh 740 million ($13.5 million).
Although TPTC may not be a direct earner of foreign exchange due to its
dependence on imported equipment and materials, and the current i-st outflow
to foreign administrations, the improvements under the project are expected
to generate substantial foreign exchange earnings indirectly through
improved service to the export industries. Consultants provided under the
project (para 3.04) will identify the extent of the net outflows to foreign
administrations and ensure that TPTC receives payment due from them when
TPTC makes payments to them. They will also assist in renegotiating
international accounting rates. The financial projections indicate that
TPTC will generate a cash surplus in local currency, expected to amount to
TSh 3,058 million ($65.7 million) by end 1990. Consultants will assist
TPTC in preparing in a resource transfer policy which could include
dividend payments to Government, prepayment of TPTC's long-term debt or
other means to transfer resources to Government. TPTC will discuss and
agree this resource transfer policy with Government and IDA by
June 30, 1988, which would be implemented by December 31, 1988. Through
the dialogue with Government, TPTC should also investigate the possibility
of trading the projected large local currency surplus generated for foreign
exchange required for their operation and maintenance costs.
Least Cost Solution
4.13      The investment program (para 3.03) is the least cost solution for
providing the service levels planned, within the constraints imposed by the
existing configuration and technology of the telecommunications network.
The timing and dimensioning of elements in the system are based on accepted
engineering practices for selection of technique and equipment.
Environment and Health Aspects
4.14      The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or
health impacts. Improved telecommunications improve the delivery system
for routine and emergency health services. Increased use of telecommunica-
tions services produces more efficient use of the transportation system,
reduces costs, environmental pollution and energy consumption.

SUMMARY OF TRAINING FACILITIES
(1980-90)
Courses offered
1.01      A training centre, run by TPTC in Dar-es-Salaam, is utilized to
train both telecomunications and postal staff.  Telecomunications courses
have been developed for new recruits to the technical wing and for recruits
to the traffic wing. The technical staff courses are at the technicians
(operative) level, and at the Technical Officer (supervisory) level. The
minimum entry qualifications, method of selection and course duration,
including on-the-job training for technical courses are given below:
Minimum        Method of      Duration       No. of

1.02      The technical course is intended for recruits who would
ultimately be employed In external plant (underground and overhead)
construction. The maintenance technical officers course trains recruits
for junior supervisory pos;'0ons.  Their training covers four areas;
external plant switching, transmission and radio and power plant. Each
technical officer receives individual supervision in the field and the
specialized training in one of the four areas takes place during the final
year.

1.03      The telecommunications controllers course runs for 9 months for
traffic staff. Minimum qualifications for direct entrants to the course is
a B.Sc. in science subjects, while corporation employees are required to
five years experience in a supervisory position, such as a Senior Telephone
or Telegraph Supervisor. This course is run according to requirements
every two or three years.
1.04      The training center also runs refresher courses for technical
officers and technicians requiring further training on a particular type of
equipment.
1.05      The center can accommodate 240 students at a time.  For technical
staff it caters to 60 technicians and accommodate 60 technical officers in
three intakes.
Facilities
1.06      Facilities at the training center comprise the class room, 4
laboratories and 19 equipment rooms. While training material and equipment
is available for externa. plant, power plant, transmission and radio; the
necessary training equipment in crossbar and digital switching systems are
not available.
Instructors
1.07      The instructors for the courses are chosen from serving
Corporation staff, mainly from the level of Assistant Engineers holding
full technician certificates and considerable (more than 5 years)
experience in a particular field. However, adequately trained instructors
are not available for courses in digital technology, which has been adopted
by the corporation for phased implementation. Staff chosen as instructors
are given a promotion of one step and a special allowance while at the
training center.
Recruitment of engineering degree holders, based upon their academic
qualifications
1.08      Normally, the duration of training is 2 years for engineers other
than telecommunication engineers, while the training for the latter
category is limited to one year and is mainly on-the-job training. This
type of recruitment is made through the National Manpower Allocation
Committee under the Ministry of Labour, which allocates engineers according
to availability, qualifications and requirement. Training of qualified
(A.C.S.E. - level) technical officers as Engineers, outside Tanzania is
restricted due to lack of funding and, so far, only 1 or 2 candidates are
sent for such training each year.

TANZANIA
TANZANIA POSTS AND TELECOPWJNICATIONS CORPORATION (TPTC)
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Terms of Reference for PPF Study
1. Introduction and Alas
A. Background
1.        The Tanzanian Post and Telecomunications Corporation (TPTC) is
responsible for the provisions of all public telecommunications services
(domestic and international) in Tanzania. The telecommunications network
is being rehabilitated and is projected to expand in the future. TPTC
needs to improve and strengthen its organizational capabilities in order to
deal with the resulting increase in scale and complexity of its management
needs, in particular, in network planning and project implementation and
the operations and maintenance of the existing and more complex new digital
network planned to be introduced in Dar Es Saleaa.
B. Objectives
2.        The purpose of this assignment is to assist TPTC in the design
and implementation of requisite management systems necessary to assure
efficient implementation of Its investment program and operation and main-
tenance of its existing and future network, the assignment will focus on
three areas, (i) Development Planning and Control; (ii) Installation, Oper-
ations and Maintenance; and (ill) Financial Management and Accounting,
Stores and Materials Management, all within the framework of TPTC's policy
objectives.
C. Approach
3.        The assignment is to transfer mansgement know how and know why to
TPTC, a large part of which cannot be adequately codified in written
reports. Consequently, the consultant will work closely with relevant
staff and management of TPTC to assist them through a hands-on process with
both analytical techniques and Implementation of the recomendations. The
resources budgeted for this assignment will make due allowance in this.
II. Scope of work
4.        TPTC has, since its inception, established a managerial frame-
work, financial structure, manpower development and information base to
meet its perceived needs. The systems in place however, remain fragmented
in that management declsion making does not have the benefit of interactive
and timely flow of adequate information. In order to avoid possible incon-
sistencies In planning or delays ln decisions and to promote lntegration of



_ 43 _                     ANNEX 4
43 -               ~~~~Page 2 of 5
technical and financial aspects of network development and operation as
well as to facilitate anticipation of potential problems it is necessary to
have a coherent decision support system.
s.        To meet the above objectives, TPTC wishes to appoint a suitable
and competent telecommunications consulting coapany(s) to undertake a
series of tasks in phases. The first (about 40 manmonths) for which bids
are now being invited consists of the diagnostic problems. During thig
phase, the consultant will thoroughly analyze TPTC's performance in recent
years in project planning and monitoring and control operation and mainte-
nance and instalIations and in finance and accounting and stores and
materials management and identify the critical issues TPTC faces. Based on
the findings, the consultant will review with TPTC's management the perfor-
mance indicators currently monitored, propose a plan of actions to improve
the management system and assist in finalizing the implementation schedules
for major components of the project.
6.        The consultant will work with relevant staff and management of
TFTC to assist them through a hands-on process with analytical techniques
and preparation of the recommendations.
Task I: Development Planning and Control
A. ObJective
7.        Assist in establishing the basis for effective planning and pro-
ject control systems to support the implementation of TPTC's investment
program including establishing a central planning engineering and project
monitoring and control; and performing selected planning/engineering func-
tions. Consideration will be given to both manual and computer assisted
planning and control techniques.
8.        The consultants will thoroughly analyze TPTC's performance in
recent years along both technical and financil1 dimensions of activities
and identify the critical issues the Corporation faces. Based on their
findings, the consultants will then assist in devising suitable procedures
and formats for various units within TPTC to generate the requisite infor-
mation on an ongoing basis for timely management review. Concurrently, the
consultants will also assess the need for both long term and short term
strategies to address the issues, with special regard to the critical role
of focused management attention. Finally, the consultant team will assist
TPTC staff in actually formulating these strategies in a ",nitorable man-
ner, e.g., through the performance indicators and propose appropriate
action programs.
B. Main Elements
9. (a) Implementation - a review of causes of various bottle-
necks in the implementation of TPTC's investment pro-
grams. In connection with the rehabilitation program,
the consultants will assist TPTC in detailed planning,
design and engineering of the works, and will review the



ANN8X 4

current-set-up and operational status of TPTC development
planning unit and the procedures/practices used tn pro-
ject preparation and implementation;
(b) Installation, Operation and Maintenace - review of cur-
rent maintenance areas, manuals, procedures and technolo-
gies and fault identification and clearance organization,
practices and reporting procedures for exchange equip-
ment, outside plant, subscriber facilities, domestic long
distance and international transmission facilities (earth
station, microwave radio, UHF, VHF radio, open wire
lines), etc. and propose changes where necessary, parti-
cularly in light of new technology and modern malatenance
techniques, review current service standards in respect
of call failures, fault rate on equipment, fault clear-
ance, operator answer, etc. in respect of each type of
equipment and service;
(c) review the existing traffic forecasaing system for
national and International calls, with a view of recom-
mending appropriate dimensioning of the network. Effects
of peak period (busy hour) congestion and the resultant
pressure on engineering to provide the solution by
increasing circuits which ay be Idle or little used In
off peak periods should also be considered;
10.       The guiding principles for the an&lysis and recomendations
should be rationalization (rather than centralization necessarily) of plan-
ning (strategic and operational), monitoring and control functions; avoid-
ance of duplication; due to regard to the cost of laformation, i.e., only
that whlch can be deciphered and gainfully used should be generated.
11.       In addition to relatively straight forward historic output
measures such as number of connected subscribers, staffing ratios, per unit
costs, service quality, profitability and liquidity, the following areas
must be specifically investigated and plans of action established.
(a) an ower Plonni - review TPTC's manpower plans based on
an assessment of current projected needs due to network
rehabilitations, expansion and changes in technology.
The consultants will assist in detailing the require-
ments, targets and recruitment or training strategies;
(b)  Training - identification of specific training needs for
new staff, regarding deployment and skill upgrading with-
in the system. In addition to technical training, finan-
cial management, stores managemnt and audit needs will
be covered. The consultants will also review the availa-
bility of requisite facilities in the TPTC training
center and other institutions within Tanzania;

propose streamlining measures to be implemented in the
proposed systems; and
(d)  Computeritson - assist TPTC In developing a suitable
program for the Improvement of the finance, operations,
personnel, services, planning and other division opera-
tions, Consultants will review data processing needs of
the various divisions and devise strategy for computeri-
zation of the different divisions functions, with parti-
cular reference to software and communications between
the divisions within TPTC. This will Involve a program
for effective use of information processing capabilities
for functions such as inventory control, operation and
maintenance, customer services, financial management, and
billing and collection. Consultants should advise on the
role of personal computers, in particular with regard to
management Information systems and financial modelling.
12.  (a)  Review of accounting procedures and financial policies
and objectives of TPTC's plan and statement of policy;
(b) Review of internal procedures for budget preparation and
monitoring;
(c) Review billing and collection system and procedures and
propose options (software and hardware) for their
improvement; and
(d) Review the internatlonal In and out payments situation
and propose a solutlon to improve the balance of payments
and monitoring system.
13.       Output. On a  aonthly basis the consultants will issue a brief
progress report on each of the elements of the above assignment.
14.       On specific agreed dates to be determined between TPTC and the
consultants an interim detailed report will be issued by the consultants.
Dates will also be agreed for the issuance of draft final reports to be
reviewed by TPTC, the Consultants and IDA. These final reports will essen-
tially be the agreed plans of action for Task Two.

15.       One further assignment needs to be carried out in conjunction
with Task One. Of itself it is not implementation oriented but will focus
on sector structure and the policy and strategic relationships necessary
between TPTC, and parent Ministry and the Government of Tanzania. It will
also question concerning both the organizational thrust of TPTC over the
next few years, the need for and the format of a regulatory framework all
encompassed within the policy objectives of TPTC, its Ministry and the
Government.

TANZANIA POSTS & TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (TPTC)
SECOND TELECOMMUNICATION PROJECT
Technical Assistance for Institutional Development
Terms of Reference (T.O.R.)
1. Introduction and Aims
A. Background
i.     The Tanzanian Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(TPTC) is responsible for the provision of all public
telecommunications services (domestic and internatlonal) In
Tanzania. The telecommunications network is being
rehabilitated and is projected to expand in the future.
TPTC needs to improve and strengthen its organizational
capabilities in order to deal with the resulting increase in
scale and complexity of its managements needs, and in
particular, in network planning and project implementation
and the operations and maintenance of the existing and wore
complex new digital network planned to be introduced in the
country in future. TPTC has reviewed the current systems
and prepared proposals for strengthening its organizational
capabilities with assistance of consultants.
B. Objectives
2.     The purpose of the consultancy assignment is to assist TPTC
in the design and implementation of requsite managemnt
systems necessary to assure efficient implementation of its
investment program, and operation and maintenance of
existing and future network within the framework of TPTC's
policy objectives. The assignment will provide assistance
for engineering activities namely Project PlanAnig,
Monitoring and Control, and Operations and Maintenance, and
management assistance for: (i) Financial Management and
Planning; (ii) Materials Management; and (iiI) Data
Processing capabilities. The assignment will also transfer
management know-how and know-why to TPTC, a large part of
which cannot be adequately codified in written reports.
C. Approach
3.     To achieve the above objectives, while executing the
assignments in para 2 above, the Consultants shall be
required to work closely in line positions with management
and counterpart staff of TPTC to assist them through a
hands-on process with both analytical techniques and



ANNEX 8
-55 -                         Page 2 of 9
implementation of the accepted recommendation. Resources
budgeted for this assignment will make due allowance for
this.
II. SCOPE OF WORK
4.     TPTC has an established managerial framework, financial
structure, manpower development and information base
originally designed to mest its perceived needs. The
systems in place however, remain fragmented In that
management decision making does not have the benefit of
interactive and timely flow of adequate information. In
order to avoid possible inconsistencies in planning or
delays in decisions, to promote Integration of technical and
financial aspects of network development and operation, and
to anticipate potential problems and facilitate their
resolution, it is necessary to have a coherent decision
support system.
S.     To meet the above objectives, TPTC wishes to appoint
suitable and competent telcomuinications consultants to
refine and implement its investment program, operate and
manage its assets, and train TPTC's counterpart staff.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
TPTC CONSOLIDATED PROJECTIONS (7Y86-90)
Notes and Assumptions
1.        Projections for FY86-90 for consolidated postal and telecommni-
cations operations are based on the following assumptions. All figures are
in current terms reflecting forecast inflation. In addition:
(a)  Exc range rate projections are based on the prevail-
ing exchange rate of $1.0 - TSh 55.0 as of mid 1987;
and
(b) Local inflation rates of 30% in 1986, 20% in 1987,
15% in 1988 and 1989 and 10% in 1990 have been
assumed. International inflation is estimeted to be
4% in 1986, 3% in 1981, and 1% in 1988-90.
Income Statement
2.        Tariffs.  Tariff increases of January 1987 have been incorpora-
ted; 120% on international telephone and telex, 50X on domestic telephone
and telex and 60% on all postal charges.
3.        Telephone revenues are calculated by telephone revenue/average
DEL times the average number of subscribers. Traffic/DEL is assumed to
increase by 5% in 1986, 10% in 1987, 15% in 1988 and 1989 an 10% in 1990.
4.        Telex revenues are calculated by the telex revenue/average con-
nection times the average nmber of telex connections. Telex traffic is
assumed to increase by 10% each year over 1986-1990.
5.        Other revenues (operational), and miscellaneous revenues (mainly
rental incom on staff housing) are projected to increase from the 1985
levels by the same rate as domestic inflation.
6.        International traffic expenses include payments to foreign
administrations for International calls, international mail, telex and
telegram charges and contributions to other organizations. As a percentage
of total telephone revenue they are projected to fall from 15% in 1985 to
11X by end 1990.
7.        Staff expenses.  Only marginal Increases are expected in the num-
ber of existing staff. Base salaries are maintained at the 1985 level In
real terms. However, the impact of the lncentive bonu2se  of 5% are assumed
each year for 1988,, 1989 and 1990. Increases in the number of skilled
staff Is expected to increase the real unit staff costs by about 5X per
annum.

ANNEX 14
Page 5 of 6
8.        Naintenance expenses are increased from the 1985 level by the
currency devaluation in 1986 (1601) and a weighted annual inflation rate,
with the weights reflecting the 80% foreign exchange component in
maintenance costs. In addition maintenance costs are increased in real
terms by 10% in 1988, 10% in 1989 and 5X in 1990. Improvements due to the
project are expected to increase the efficiency of maintenance expense.
IDA will be financing $8.0 million equivalent of recurrent maintenance
expenses over 1987-90 with 35% in 1987 and 1988, 20X in 1989 and 10% in
1990.
9.        Other expenses comprising administration costs are projected to
increase at the domestic inflation rate.
10.       Training expenses are expected to increase by 20% in 1986, 50% in
1987, 100% in 1988, 15% in 1989 and 10Z in 1990. Ninety percent of
training expenses are allocated to telecoms, 10% to postal operations.
11.       Depreciation expenses are calculated on a straight line basis at
5% of gross fixed assets in oreration each year and divided between postal
and telcommunications operations in relation to their share of gross fixed
assets. I/ For the calculation of rate of return on revaluated assets,
operating income has been adjusted to reflect depreciation on a revalued
basis.
12.       Interest receipts, (mainly on fixed deposits) are assumed to
increase in 1986 and 19V but remain constant thereafter.  Interest
payments are calculated on TPTC's foreign borrowings, with varying Interest
rates.
13.       TPTC is subject to a 50% corporation tax.  In calculating the
revalued rate of return, a 50Z allowance for depreciation is made.
Balance Sheet
14.       Fixed assets reflect the investment program (Annex 5) and
transfers from work in progress. Work in progress as a percentage of the
construction program is 75% in 1986 and 1987, 30% in 1988 and 25% in 1989
and 1990, reflecting the rehabilitation and stores build up. It is
transferred to fixed assets in full the next year.
15.       Materials and equipment are equivalent to 202 of work in progress
and represents large construction and civil works item, identified for
project consumption. Investments, mainly in pension funds and INTELSAT,
11 It is assumed that 85% of CPA as of end 1985 relate to telecommunica-
tions operations and 15% for postal operations. The level of postal
assets at that time (TSh 144.0 milllon) is assumed to grow marginally.

increase at the domestic rate of inflation. The increment in stores ($5.6
million) financed by IDA is built-up over 1986 levels by 10% in l917, 201
in 1988 and 351 in 1989 and 1990. The value of stores in 1985 is not
revalued to account for devaluation, but in physical terms, stores will be
built up equivalent to six months of maintenance expense by end 1990.
16.       Subscriber receivables as a percent of total revenues are assumed
to decrease to 20% by end 1990, equivalent to about two months outstanding
which is acceptable.
17.       Accounts payable represent 201 of cash expenses plus 301 of fixed
assets and spares.
18.       International fees payable are assumed to be paid in full the
year they are due.
19.       Other accurals include negligible interest payments and
Tanganyika Post Office Savings Bank payables, both discontinued in 1983.
The balance consists of salaries payable and fees payable and is not
expected to increase.
20.       Corporation tax of 502 i  assumed to be paid In full the year it
is due.
21.       Net long  term loans are made up of bilateral loans and wulti-
lateral onlending.
22.       Fixed assets were revalued as of end 1985 by five times by a
revaluation study completed in October 1986. Antual revaluations of 51
have been applied; a weighted average of International and local inflation
with the weights reflecting the high import content (801) of
telecommunications assets.
Funds Flow Statement
23.       Bad debt provisions are Included in working capital.  The change
in fixed assets comprises changes In gross plant, work in progress,
materials and equipment and Investments.

SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PERIOD
Return on Investment
1.        TPTC's investment program for FY87-90 includes the IDA financed
project as an Integral part, ongoing and other works. The close
relationship between project and non-project Investments makes any attempt
at separation of benefits arbitrary. Consequently, the rate of return
calculation is made on the entire investment program. The benefit period
extends from 1987 to 2006, when on average the equLpment provided under the
program is expected to have substantlally completed its useful llfe. All
incremental costs and revenues have been deflacted at 10% p.s. to brLug
them to comparable 1987 prLce levels.
It Ls assumed that without the program:
(a)  the number of DELs would remain constant at the
end 1986 level;
(b)  traffic per line would remain at the FY86 level
through 1989 and decrease by 52 p.a. in FY90-91
and remain constant thereafter;
(c)  staff numbers vculd remain constant at the end
FY87 level; and
(d)  incremental licome tax is levied at 502 of the
incremental not benefLt with these assumptions, the
stream of financial costs and benefits is shown below:

2.      This calcilatlion does not account for the 5  sales tax which the
subscribers pay to the Government and i8 collected by TPTC, nor for
consumer surplus or indirect and external benefits due to the improved
telecommunications system. A portion of the consumer surplus was estimated
by assuming that new consumers are similar to the average current
consumer, and that the existing and new subscribers will be willing to pay
for telecomuunications services at the same rate in real terms as they pay
today. The 32 sales tax was added to the resulting economic benefit
stream. A conversion factor of 0.50 was applied to all local costs and
benefits to convert them into economic border prices. Based on these
assumptions, the stream of economic costs and benefits is summarized below:
