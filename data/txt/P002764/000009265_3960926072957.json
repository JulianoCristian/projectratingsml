This\n            telecommunications project is intended to eliminate these\n            constraints by rehabilitating key parts of the\n            telecommunications network, and to maximize capacity\n            utilization by removing bottlenecks and imbalances. A\n            further objective is the institutional development of TPTC\n            (Tanzanian Posts and Telecommunications Corporation).  To\n            this  end, the proposed project comprises TPTC's\n            1986-1990 Investment Program including (a) rehabilitation of\n            local cable networks and subscriber equipment; (b) marginal\n            expansion and replacement of worn out or obsolete switching\n            and transmission equipment; and (c) installation of transit\n            exchanges and a satellite earthstation.  The project also\n            provides for (d) upgrading maintenance facilities; (e)\n            upgrading computer facilities and (f) strengthening\n            TPTC's organizational structure and management systems."}, "docdt": "1987-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
