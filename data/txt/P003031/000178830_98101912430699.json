capital investment\n            requirements of subprojects approved by SOFIDE in the\n            agriculture, transportation and industrial sectors, and\n            working capital up to a total of US$3 million for existing\n            high economic priority projects in SOFIDE's portfolio.\n            At least US$7.5 million of the proposed credit would finance\n            agricultural projects. The Credit would also provide up to\n            US$230,000 to finance staff training and some equipment for\n            SOFIDE. In addition to current uncertainties about future\n            economic developments in Zaire, the main risks of the\n            project relate to the impact on SOFIDE's subborrowers\n            of: (a) the shortage of foreign exchange for importation of\n            raw materials and spare parts; (b) the rate of inflation in\n            Zaire. The working capital component is designed to\n            alleviate the impact on the output capacity of qualified\n            SOFIDE subborrowers of low imported input stock levels due\n            to reduced availability of foreign exchange."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
