The Banks performance at all stages of the\n            project cycle was satisfactory. The overall outcome of the\n            project is satisfactory. The project was timely. Without the\n            rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, the\n            country's power system would have been crippled The\n            Project has made a promising start in the Antananarivo area,\n            especially with the involvement of women's\n            organizations. There is a strong need to extend this effort\n            to other parts of the country where deforestation and\n            environmental degradation are particularly critical (e.g.\n            Mahajanga). The key lessons learned include: the need to\n            have a clear sector strategy that identifies the most urgent\n            needs of the sector; a clear understanding of the objectives\n            of a project and commitment to these objectives by the\n            borrower and the implementing agency, along with the\n            importance of capacity building as an objective."}, "docdt": "1995-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
