The\n            main objectives of the proposed project are to help improve\n            the reliability of power production and supply throughout\n            the country and the power sector's financial and\n            operational performance; maximize the efficient use of\n            locally available and economically accessible energy\n            resources; and strengthen energy sector planning capability.\n            To this end, the project specifically entails two main\n            components involving the energy sector as a whole and the\n            power subsector in particular.  Within the latter component,\n            the project involves generation rehabilitation and\n            expansion; transmission and substation improvement;\n            distribution rehabilitation and expansion and improvement in\n            general plant and services.  In addition, this component\n            includes power sector institution building; power sector\n            studies; and an electric boiler program.  For the energy\n            sector as a whole, the project entails providing equipment\n            for production of pine charcoal and rice husk briquettes and\n            technical assistance with sector studies."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
