                                      L. BACKGROUND

1.    The Project. The Ecuador Mining Development and Environmental                        Control
Technical Assistance Project (Loan Number 3655-EC) (PRODEMINCA,                       the Project),
closed last December 31, 2000. It was officially requested by the Government                      of
Ecuador twelve years ago. on March 14, 1989. The Initial Executive              Project Summary
(IEPS) was issued on April 9, 1990 and the project appraisal was                    completed on
December 17, 1992. The project was approved by the IBRD Board of Executive
Directors on October 21, 1993.

2.    At Approval, PRODEMINCA was a relatively small technical assistance loan,                with
IBRD Commitments of US$ 14.0 million, and was cofinanced by the Government                        of
Sweden's Agency for International Technical and Economic Cooperation (BITS)',                   and
by the Government of the United Kingdom's Overseas Development Agency                  (ODA)2 for
a total of US$ 8.1 million equivalent.

3.    The Request for Inspection. On December 17, 1999 the Inspection Panel                     (the
Panel) registered a Request for Inspection3 for PRODEMINCA filed by                       DECOIN
(Defensa y Conservaci6n Ecol6gica de Intag), a non-governmental organization                (NGO)
located in the Intag Valley of Ecuador and by four members of AACRI (Asociaci6n                   de
Caficultores Organicos Rio Intag) in the same region (the Requesters).             On January 18,
2000 Management prepared a response to this Request4. After a field visit to Ecuador,
the Panel prepared a memorandum entitled Request for Inspection:                  Ecuador Mining
Development and Environmental Control Technical Assistance Project                (Loan 3655-EC)
(INSP/R2000-5) which it sentto the IBRD Board of Executive Directors              on May 3, 2000.


4.     On May 15, 2000 the Board authorized the Panel to conduct an investigation               into
whether the Bank had violated its operational policies and procedures in                the design,

Environmental Assessment (EA), OPN 11.02 on Wildlands6, and                        OD 13.05 on Project
Supervision7.     After carrying out the investigation, on February 23, 2001 the Panel
submitted to the Board a report entitled Investigation Report                      on Ecuador Mining
Development and Environmental Control Technical Assistance                     Project (Loan 3655-EC)
(INSP/R2001-1) (Panel Report). On the same day, the Panel delivered                          copies of the
Panel Report to the President.

5.     This Management Report and Recommendation in Response                            to the Inspection
Panel Investigation Report is submitted to the IBRD Board                       of Executive Directors
pursuant to paragraph 238 of the Resolution establishing                   the World Bank Inspection
Panel9.

6.     Management would like to take this opportunity to thank the                  Inspection Panel for
the thorough and professional way in which it conducted the                 investigation, for the broad
range of stakeholders it consulted, and especially for its                 efforts to accommodate the
request of the Borrower with respect to the timing of the             field visits.



 II. CONCLUSIONS IN THE PANEL REPORT AND MANAGEMENT                                             REPORT


7.     Panel Report. The Panel Report concludes "that Management                        is substantially in
compliance with the provisions of OD 4.01 on Environmental                    Assessment (formerly OD
4.00, Annex A) except as noted below; OPN 11.02 on Wildlands                       (now OP/BP 4.04 on
Natural Habitats), and OD 13.05 on Project Supervision. The Panel                     finds, however, that
Management was in apparent violation of certain provisions                          of the policies and
procedures on Environmental Assessment (OD 4.00, Annex A and                        OD 4.01) concerning
processing, geographical scope, baseline data, and concerning                        consultation during
preparation."'   0



8.      Management Report. Management agrees with the Panel Report                             that it was
substantially in compliance with OPN 11.02 on Wildlands and                        OD 13.05 on Project-

  Operational Directive 4.00, Annex A: Environmental Assessment,     was issued on October 31, 1989 and
  was applicable to all projects that reached the IEPS stage afterOctober 15, 1989. OD 4.00 Annex A was
  replaced by Operational Directive 4.01: Environmental Assessment, which      was issued on October 3,
  1991 and was applicable to all projectsthat reached the IEPS stage after October    1, 1991. OD 4.01 was
  replaced by Operational Policy/Bank Policy4.01: Environmental Assessment,        which was issued in
  January 1999 and was applicable to all projects reaching the   Project Information Document (PID) stage
  after March 1, 1999.
6 Operational PolicyNote 11.02: Wildlands:Their Protection and       Management in Economic Development
  was issued on June 2, 1986. It was converted to Operational    Policy/Bank Policy 4.04: Natural Habitats
  in September 1995,and was applicable to all projectsreaching     the PID stage after October 15, 1995.
  Operational Directive 13.05:Project Supervision was issued     in March 1989.
s "Within six weeks from receiving the Panel's findings, Management will      submit to the Executive
  Directors for their consideration a report indicating its recommendations  in response to such findings."

Supervision. Management accepts the position stated in the Panel Report that a more
expanded and robust EA and consultation process should have been undertaken. The
Management Report describes the actions that are being taken on the issues raised in the
Panel Report.

9.     The Management Report is organized as follows: Section III summarizes the
findings in the Panel Report with respect to the claims made by the Requesters with
regard to material adverse effects. Sections IV and V discuss the findings in the Panel
Report with respect to the concerns raised by the Requesters regarding compliance with
the EA process and consultations. Section VI explains the actions that are being taken on
the issues raised in the Panel Report.



      III. FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS

10. As req1uired by the Resolution'1, and further explained in the Second
Clarifications     ,  the Panel Report discusses the claims made by the Requesters with
regard to material adverse effects in the following areas: (a) impact of public release of
map and mineral data; (b) impact of mapping activities; and (c) impact of project
supervision activities. As detailed below, in each case the Panel Report indicates that
there were no material adverse effects caused by Bank failure of compliance with its
policies and procedures.

A.     Impact of the Public Release of Map and MineralData

11.    The Panel Report notes that the Requesters claim "that the public release of maps
with mineral data collected under the Project's Geo-information component will attract
mining companies and informal' miners. In their [the Requesters'] view, this would
have a destructive impact in the areas where they live and on the protected areas andtheir
buffer zones. It would also prevent local communities from continuing to work on their
traditional farming and ecotourism activities, and trigger grave social problems within
their communities. They [the Requesters] maintain that mining activities in these areas
would be unavoidable should the geo-information maps and data reveal the existence of
mining potential in the region, and would result in significant degradation of critical
natural habitats, including the ecosystem of El Choc6 and the Cotacachi-Cayapas
Ecological Reserve. The latter is recognized as one of the world's richest remaining
naturalhabitats and threatened biodiversity hotspots."',3

" See footnote 9 above.
12World Bank Board of Executive Directors, "Conclusions of the Board's Second Review of the Inspection
  Panel," (Washington, D.C.. April 20. 1999). Paragraph 13states: "As required by the Resolution,the
  Panel's report to the Board will focus on whether there is a serious Bank failure to observe its operational
  policies and procedures with respect to project design, appraisal and/orimplementation. The report will
  include all relevant facts that are needed to understand fully the context and basis for the panel's findings
  and conclusions. The Panel will discuss in its written report only those material adverseeffects, alleged
  in the request, that have totally or partially resulted from serious Bank failure of compliance with its
  policies and procedures. Ifthe request alleges a material adverse effect and the Panel findsthat itis not
  totally or partially caused by Bank failure, the Panel's report will so state without entering intoanalysis of
  the material adverse effect itself or its causes."

                                           -7 -


12.   The Panel Report states that after having considered expert advice and examined
the evidence, it would be "reasonable to conclude that the maps alone, even in
conjunction with the geochemical data, are insufficient in themselves to locate ore
deposits. The geochemical data and the geologic maps would be useful reconnaissance
tools in narrowing the search area for further exploration, especially when used in
conjunction with other available maps, papers, and reports, but they should not lead
directly to mining activity.14 ...The geochemical data and maps are a good starting point
for further studies of the mineral potential of this region of Ecuador, but any interested
company would have to do much more work, primarily detailed mapping and drilling,
before any detailed exploration could begin. This would take considerable time and may
cost millions of dollars."'5

13. As a result of this analysis of the mining life cycle and the role of thematic maps,
the Panel Report concludes that "the eventualitythat the Project may come to cause harm
(i.e. material adverse effects) to the Requesters is, in all likelihood, very remote. First,
the Requesters reside in an area that has been excluded from the thematic mapping sub-
component of the Project (see Map [in Panel Report]) and, hence, no mining activity in
the area could be regarded as a direct consequence of the Project. Second, Ecuador's
legislation only permits mining activities in protected areas (such as the Cotachachi-
Cayapas Ecological Reserve) by exception. Even when permitted, these activities are
subject to strict environmental controls. In meetings with the Panel, the Government of
Ecuador's mining and environmental authorities confirmed their commitment to prohibit
any kind of mining activities in protected areas. Finally, officials of local government in
Ecuador (such as the Municipality of Cotacachi), representatives of civil society and local
(such as DECOIN and CEDENMA) and international NGOs appear firmly committed to
protect Ecuador's very rich biodiversity."'6

14.    Management is pleased to note that the Panel Report indicates that "the Panel
accepts that the geological and thematic mapping carried out under the Project is
ecologically neutral and agrees that thematic mapping is generally beneficial for the
country, as it increases its database of knowledge on its natural resources. It will also
help identify areas that are sensitive and that could be excluded from mining
development."''7       Management agrees with the Panel Report that the information
contained in the geological and thematic maps must be "carefully managed so as not to
generate adverse social and environmental consequences,"'8 and measures taken in this
regard are detailed in Section VI-B below.

B.      Impact of Mapping Activities

 15.    The Panel Report notesthat the Requestersclaim that during the mapping exercise,
carried out by the British Geological Survey and the Ecuadorian Geological Directorate
(Direcci6n Nacional de Geologia, DINAGE), and cofinanced by ODA/DFID, "damage

has already been done to the areas mentioned by paths being        opened up for personnel
engaged in prospecting and then being used by people who have nothing to do with          the
project as access route to the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological   Reserve."'9

16. The Panel Report indicates that the Panel "did not receive      any evidence to support
the Requesters' claim that the Cotacachi-Cayapas reserve            suffered substantial or
permanent damage as a result of the sampling activities carried out under   the Project."20


C.     Impact of Project Supervision Activities

17.     The Panel Report notes that the Requesters claim that "the  Bank has not monitored
the PRODEMINCA project carefully enough, and that lack of           control and surveillance
has done harm to the parties involved (OD 13.05)."21

18. The Panel Report indicates that "the Panel found that frequent            missions were
undertaken and that there was considerable follow up by the Bank      on outstanding issues.
Moreover, it appears that the composition and scope of the missions    evolved with Project
requirements.        On the basis of the evidence reviewed, the Panel finds the     Bank in
compliance with OD 13.05."22

19. Given these findings in the Panel Report, Management is              not proposing any
remedial efforts with regard to the claims made by the Requesters.


       IV. FINDINGS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT                         PROCESS


20.     As noted in the Panel Report, "'theRequesters claim a number of     violations of OD
4.01 on Environment Assessment,"23although the Requesters do         not claim that any harm
or damage was done as a result. The Panel Report indicates       "that a more expanded and
robust EA process should have been undertaken."2    4  Management accepts this position.


21.      After a decade of experience and knowledge accumulation within      the Bank and in
the community of practice, the limitations of the EA are           more apparent.    Seen in
historical perspective, this was the first EA for a mining technical    assistance project in
the Bank. Furthermore, OD 4.00 Annex A had been in effect for           less than six months
when the IEPS for PRODEMINCA was issued on April 9,                199025. The project's EA
category was changed from a Category B26 to a Category A on June 27,          199027, and the

consultants financed by the Government of Sweden's BITS started work on December 3,
199028. OD 4.01 was issued almost a year later on October 3, 199129, and had been in
effect for just a year by the time the EA studies had been completed and reviewed on
October 9, 199230. The EA Summary was finalized by the Government and issued to the
IBRD Board of Executive Directors on January 7, 1993 (Report Number SECM93-25).

22.    Despite the limitations of the EA, Management is pleased to note that the Panel
Report indicates that material adverse effects to the Requesters from the Project may be
considered as remote31.       The Project focused on the establishment of the conditions
allowing the development of the mining sector, including the development of information
systems, mining cadastre and geological and thematic mapping, which, as recognized in
the Panel Report (and detailed in Section III above) have negligible or non-existent direct
environmental impacts. However, Management accepts the position in the Panel Report
that a more comprehensive EA process "would have enabled the Borrower and Bank
management to better understand and prepare for potential adverse impacts derived from
the Project as a whole"32 and better positioned the Government of Ecuador for the
coming stages in the development of its mining industry and for the sound management
of the environmental and social consequences of an expansion of private sector mining in
the future.

23.    In retrospect, a more comprehensive sectoral EA should have been carried out with
many of the characteristics called for in the Panel Report - namely a broader scope
covering the entire project area; an analysis of the natural environment including on
biodiversity conservation, human health and safety, and social issues; greater emphasis
on the role of local public entities and civil society in addition to institutional, legal and
regulatory strengthening at the national level;and a broader and deeper consultation with
community-based, non-governmental and local, state and national government entities.



                  V. FINDINGS ON THE CONSULTATIONPROCESS

A.     Timing of the Consultations in the North

24.    The Panel Report correctly notes that consultations about the thematic mapping
activity did not take place in the northern part of the country at the time of project
preparation or as part of the EA process. Instead, the British Geological Survey and the
Ecuadorian Geological Directorate, working on behalf of the Project, followed the
standard international practice used by geological survey organizations. Prior to entering
an area to carry out the mapping exercise, the standard international practice is to meet
with local government authorities and community leaders (such as religious leaders and

village heads) in the area that will be mapped, describe the natureof the mapping activity
and the anticipated timeframe, and introduce members of the mapping      team. In the case
of Ecuador, this practice was applied as the mapping activity  progressed from south (late
1995)to north (1998).

B.     Quality of the Consultations

25.    Management agrees with the Panel Report that given the "strongly           expressed
fear,"33 the 'misinformation,"34 and the history of the "traumatic  event"35 related to the
removal of a mining company from the area, the consultations        in the area around the
Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve could have been            improved to address "the
legitimate needs of potentially affected people for information    about the Project" and
"could have led to a better understanding about what was intended,     allayed latent fears.
and provided feedback that would have improved the Project       and increased community
cooperation in implementing it."36

26.    Following the attention drawn to the mapping work and the ensuing    controversy, in
November 1999 the Government and the Bank recognized              the necessity of further
consultations, and the dissemination of more detailed        information.  A consultation
program was immediately designed and implemented, targeting           local authorities and
residents of the Intag Valley (which is a buffer zone of    Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological
Reserve), as well as other stakeholders at the national level. The purpose of the program
was to (i) present the interested parties with information in an accessible manner, based
on scientific facts, through a series of public fora and popular assemblies; (ii) give them
the opportunity to discuss the information with representatives    of the Project; and (iii)
propose ways for disseminating and tracking the use of the     information. A sociological
assessment of the Intag Valley was carried out by a well known    community development
NGO on the views of stakeholders regarding thematic           mapping.    The results were
published and disseminated to the residents and authorities    of the Intag Valley and the
Cotacachi area. Books and brochures were published,       to inform local communities on
the use of the information forplanning and resources management      purposes.

27.    Management is pleased that the Panel Report recognizes      these efforts, and notes
that "the Panel commends the November 1999 initiative          to strengthen and enhance,
however late, the consultation process related         to geo-information and thematic
mapping."37

                          VI. ACTIONS AND NEXT STEPS

A.    Remedies

28.   As discussed in Section III, given the findings in the Panel Report, Management is
not proposing any remedial efforts with regard to the claims made by the Requesters.

B.    Ensuring the Effective Use and Monitoring of Mapping Information

29.   PRODEMINCA is closed, but Bank staff will continue to work with the
Government and local NGOs to implement actions agreed on under the Project,
especially with regard to the use of the geological and thematic mapping information
produced by the Project. To prevent adverse social and environmental consequences and
to ensure that the information is used in favor of development effectiveness, the
following activities will be undertaken, as detailed below: (a) participation of NGOs in
monitoring the use and application of the information generated under the Project: (b)
enforcement of the standard license agreements for the use of the information; and (c)
publication of brochures, and workshops, on the use of geo-information.

30.   Monitoring of Information Use. In order to monitor the use of geological and
thematic information in protected areas, and to prevent unauthorized activities in such
areas, the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Energy and Mines have awarded
a two year contract to a group including two environmental NGOs. This group was
selected through a competitive process, based on terms of reference developed in
consultation with a broad and representative range of environmental NGOs. In each key
community, at least seven local resident observers will be trained to watch the protected
areas, and to provide information to local communities so as to assure their involvement.
Training will also be provided to local Protected Area Managers. Procedures to channel
complaints have been set up, and work is underway on launching a web site. Status
reports will be published twice a year, and a public conference will be organized once a
year to inform and assess the situation. Management is pleased that the Panel Report
indicates that "the Panel views this as a very positive development."38


31.   Enforcement of License Agreements.              Any organization, corporation, or
individual wishing to purchase the thematic and geological mapping information has to
sign a license agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Mines. In doing so, the
purchaser acknowledges that it knows the laws and regulations regarding the
development of mining activities within the National Protected Areas System (NPAS),
agrees to follow the regulations regarding the use of this information, and will
communicate with both the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Energy and
Mines regarding the use of such information in protected areas. Management is pleased
that the Panel Report also considers that these are "strict"39conditions that will promote
sound management.

32.   Additional Publications and Workshops.             Additional brochures are being
published and workshops are being organized, aimed at further facilitating the
understanding and use by a broader audience of the geo-information produced by
PRODEMINCA. This activity will be continued under the coordination of the Ministry
of Energy and Mines.

C.    Development of Consultation Mechanisms

33.   The development of consultation mechanisms for mining activities in Ecuador has
been initiated and is linked to that of other extractive industries. A governmental
coordination committee has been established, including the Ministry of Government, the
National Council of Indigenous Nationalities (CODENPE, the Consejo de Desarrollo de
las Nacionalidades y Pueblos del Ecuador), Ministry of Environment, and Ministry of
Energy and Mines, and advised by national consultants and Bank staff. The legal and
sectoral frameworks for the consultation process have been reviewed, and in November
2000 a series of workshops were organized with all stakeholders to define the scope and
procedures to develop consultation mechanisms.

D.    Support for Conservation and Environmental Management in Ecuador

34.   The findings documented in the Panel Report underscore the importance of the
Bank and the Latin America and the Caribbean Region (LCR) investing further in
sectoraland strategic EAs in the coming years. Such an approach is recommended in the
proposed corporate Environment Strategy and in LCR's recently approved Regional
Environmental Strategy. LCR will seek the opportunity to support its clients in carrying
out strategic EAs - sectoral, regional and policy-based - in upcoming operations. LCR
will also promote training for staff on strategic EAs in collaborationwith the World Bank
Institute.

35.   Although PRODEMINCA has now closed, the Bank continues to be engaged in
several activities in Ecuador that allow the Bank to continue the policy dialogue and
support for environmentally sustainable development through conservation and
strengthening of environmental managementcapacity.

36.   Country Assistance Strategy. In recognition of the unique biological and natural
resources, and the different ecosystems represented in Ecuador - which is one of the 17
megadiverse countries of the world - as well as the wide range of environmental issues
faced by the country, the Bank has made support to environmental strengthening
activities a priority for its country assistance strategy. This was documented in the
Country Assistance Strategy of May 5, 1993 (Report No. P-5657-EC), and reconfirmed in
the Country Assistance Strategy of June 1, 2000 (Report No. R2000-102) which was
recently discussed at the Board.

37.   Conservation. The first project to support the NPAS in Ecuador was a US$ 7.2
million equivalent Global Environment Facility Biodiversity Protection Project, (GEF
Grant 28700-EC), which was under preparation at the same time as PRODEMINCA, and
was approved six months later on May 9, 1994. The project closed on September 30,
1999. The objective of the grant was to support the restructuring and strengthening of the

                                           - 13 -


institutional capacity and overall policy and legal framework of the NPAS. Eight of the
eighteen protected areas in the system, including       the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological
Reserve, were included for direct assistance.

38.   Among project outcomes achieved with grant           assistance are: support to the
Ministry of Environment, created in 1996, which improved              the visibility of the
environmental agenda in Government policies       and decision and elevated the status of
protected areas within the Government structure; preparation    of a ten year Strategic Plan
of the National System of Natural Protected Areas        of Ecuador, which was officially
presented in October 1999; completion of the Protected      Areas Biodiversity Assessment
and the Socio-Economic Assessment; inputs into       the. formulation, and support for the
National Strategy for the Protection and Sustainable       Use of WildliJf in Ecuador, the
Special Biodiversity Law, and the National Biodiversitv       Strategy (under preparation);
creation of a Biodiversity Information Center with   input from four academic institutions,
and initiation of a database on Ecuador's biodiversity    and the production of vegetation
maps; highly participatory management planning          exercise in four protected areas;
upgrading of infrastructure andequipment, and training of key     personnel in the NPAS.


39.    The Government of Ecuador has requested Bank assistance       for the second stage of
conservation activities. The Strategic Plan prepared      under the first GEF project is the
basis for a second GEF project which is now inthe    early stages of preparation, and which
is intended as the US$ 8 million three-year firstphase  of a 15-yearprogram of support. It
has the objective of contributing to the improved sustainable     and equitable management
of Ecuador's biological diversity through the        effective management and financial
sustainability of the NPAS, and of conserving and           sustainably managing globally
important forest and freshwater ecosystems in       Ecuador. As currently designed, the
project would support the effective management of        the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological
Reserve and two other protected areas, through:           participatory development of a
management plan; identification and implementation         of co-management mechanisms;
training and other institutional capacity building     activities; and legal and regulatory
reforms to create sustainable mechanisms to finance park         management activities. In
addition, the project would capitalize a Protected Areas  Fund that would secure long-term
 funding for six protected areas that have little        opportunity to use market-based
 mechanisms to mobilize resourcesto finance managementactivities.

 40.   Strengthening of Environmental Institutions.       Also prepared at the same time as
 PRODEMINCA, the US$ 15 million Environmental            Management Technical Assistance
 Project (Loan 3998-EC, PATRA) which was approved               on April 4, 1996, had the
 objective of providing support for the ongoing process       of implementing the National
 Environmental Management Strategy by strengthening        the Ministry of Environment and
 environmental units in other ministries, and in assisting  the Government in building up
 environmental management capacity in three      priority geographic areas. Implementation
 of this project was problematic and the project was       restructured in early 1999. The
 Government has reaffirmed its commitment to the     objectives of the project, and the Bank
 is working closely with its counterparts to achieve these project objectives.
