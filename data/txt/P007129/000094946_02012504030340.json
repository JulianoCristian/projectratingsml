{"cdata!": "The outcome of the Mining Development\n            and Environmental Control Technical Assistance Project is\n            rated as satisfactory, sustainability as likely,\n            institutional development impact as substantial, Bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and Borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. The key lessons drawn include: Sector\n            development should be part of an overall political and\n            economic reform. This project provides a good example of the\n            importance to approach sector reform in an integrated way.\n            It is critical to design and implement during project\n            preparation and implementation a more systematic social\n            strategy, including improved information and consultation\n            participatory process. The geo-scientific information\n            management represents a very valuable tool not only for\n            sector development but also for land use and related\n            potential conflicts management. The project has demonstrated\n            the importance to use an integrated approach and to\n            emphasize the socio-economic aspects related to the\n            subsector situation to address artisanal and small-scale\n            mining issues. The involvement and balance of foreign versus\n            national expertise in project activities is an issue much\n            debated with respect to technical assistance capacity\n            building impact and sustainability. It is important for\n            sectoral institutions and their staff to develop a strong\n            commitment to reform and acquire a full sense of ownership\n            and responsibility for the project."}, "docdt": "2001-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
