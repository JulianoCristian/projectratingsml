                         Implementation Status Overview
                         MTR of the project was carried out supported by an independent consultant's technical evaluation. Generally, the project is on track to achieving its development objectives through
                         implementation of its three components. Component 1 which was intended to support Kampala City Council to develop a comprehensive approach to municipal development and
                         governance, through three key sub-components namely (i) Human resource managements and development, (ii) support to financial recovery, and (iii) strengthening service delivery,
                         is progressing reasonably well. Component 2 which is designed to support activities aimed at improving the provision of critical citywide infrastructure services to the city (drainage
                         system improvement, traffic management, road maintenance and upgrading, solid waste management; and urban markets infrastructure) had lagged behind due to delays in

                         recent restructuring of the project, allocation of funds for implementation of the RAP has been made from the credit and this will facilitate speedy compensation and commencement

                         of construction works. Component 3 ­ Project Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation- is progressing reasonably well. The restructuring has also allowed for extension of the
                         closing date of the project by 24 months from December 31, 2010 to December 31 2012 to make up for time lost due to Parliamentary approval of the Credit and other delays in
                         implementation. As major contracts for consulting services and works are to be awarded soon, disbursement will pick up rapidly. With the extended closing date, all planned
                         activities will be completed and the project will achieve its objectives. The overall DO rating is thus satisfactory while the IP rating is moderately satisfactory.
