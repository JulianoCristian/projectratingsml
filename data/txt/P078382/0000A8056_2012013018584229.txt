                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Although there were some delays in project start-up followed by a transition in the Kampala local government structure from KCC to the new KCCA which resulted into the need to
                         realign some of the institutional activities to fit with the new Corporate strategy of KCCA, a lot of progress has been made in project implementation since the ISM of March/April
                         2011. The mission confirms that the project objective of Institutional strengthening is still relevant and achievable with the extension of project closing date to December 31, 2012.

                         The new KCCA management has shown keen interest to complete implementation of remaining project activities by December 31, 2012. Most of the procurement activities have
                         been completed except for one package of roads works which is at the stage of evaluation. The implementation of the updated RAP has proceeded well. Out of the 504 affected
                         households, 396 households have been fully paid which translates into a completion rate of 80%. By the time of the mission a total of UGX 4.164 billion out of the total compensation
                         figure of UGX 4.7 billion had been paid. The most critical risk being faced by the project at the moment is the transition from KCC to KCCA since it will involve recruitment of new

                         staff with possible lay-off of existing KCC staff who might not meet the job specifications for the new KCCA. This also has implications for KCCA meeting the APL 2 staffing trigger of
                         having 80% of its establishment filled. During the next ISM the Bank will critically review progress regarding staffing and associated risk to the project.

                         The Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) for the Mpererwe Landfill Gas Project (P098012), a carbon project under the KIIDP, was signed between Kampala City
                         Council and the World Bank in April 2010. This is envisaged to reduce the GHG emission in the Kampala landfill with an expectation to deliver 74,144 CERs by the end of 2013.
                         Validation of the project has been concluded and the project has been submitted to UNFCCC for registration. The project is expected to be registered around the first quarter of 2012.
                         The implementation of the project however has been delayed due to financing issues. There is no funding provision under the current KIIDP APL1 to finance the project. However, it
                         is planned that the project will be financed under KIIDP APL2.
