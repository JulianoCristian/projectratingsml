                         Implementation Status Overview
                         A lot of progress has been made in project implementation since the MTR in November 24, 2010. The consultant to undertake the Kampala Structure Plan and the upgrading of the
                         Kampala GIS Unit in Kampala City started work in March and its assignment is due to be completed within 20 months by November 2012. On the civil works front, the implementation
                         of the updated RAP is on going. Disclosure and verifications were completed. Out of the total estimated RAP cost for drainage, roads and landfill at UGX5.039 billion, UGX5.358
                         billion is available. Out of a total of 403 persons affected households, so far compensations have been effected to 216 with 187 persons affected households still remaining. By the
                         time of the mission a total of UGX1.487 billion had been paid. The mission agreed with KCC that the outstanding RAP cost of UGX3.552 billion should be paid before the end of May

                         handled quickly and smoothly with any disruption to the implementation of the project.
