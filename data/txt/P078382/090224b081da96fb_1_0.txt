                         The Project is a SDR 22 million (US$ 33.6 million) APL. The Project Development Objective is to improve the institutional efficiency of Kampala Capital City (KCC) through
                         implementation of the Strategic Framework for Reform of the KCC. The project has three components: (i) Component 1 - Institutional development - focusing on activities that support
                         organizational development and governance, the implementation of the Financial Recovery Action Plan, and actions to enhance effectiveness of service delivery; (ii) Component 2 -

                         The main PDO indicators are: (i) KCC to reduce overdue liabilities from UGX 8 billion to UGX 3 billion; (ii) increase the share of KCC own source revenue spent on service delivery
                         from 10% to 30%; (iii) increase KCC own source revenue from UGX 22 billion to UGX 30 billion; and (iv) increase public satisfaction in service delivery in: roads from 18% to 50%,
                         drainage from 22% to 31%, and solid waste from 44% to 60%.

                         Overall, the project is on track towards achieving its development objective, except for the delays in the implementation of some of the civil works. As of April 2013 the project had
                         achieved the intended outcomes as follows: (i) overdue liabilities were reduced to zero (baseline - UGX8.9 billion, and project target – UGX0.5 billion), (ii) share of KCCA own source
                         revenue spent on service delivery – 39% (baseline 18%, target – 34%), (iii) KCCA owns source revenue increased to UGX 45.687 billion (base line – UGX 22 billion, and target –
                         UGX 33.5 billion), and (iv) public satisfaction in service delivery in (a) Roads, (b) Drainage, and (c) solid waste increased from 18%, 22% and 44% (baseline) to 29%, 22% and 46%
                         against the targets of 50%, 80%, and 70% respectively. From the above outcomes, it is evident that the project is on track in achieving its development objective. Given the extension
                         of project closing date to December 31, 2013, KCCA will be able to complete the remaining activities and the project will achieve its development objective.

                         The project closing date was first extended by 24 months because of the one year delay in project effectiveness occasioned by the Constitutional requirement for obtaining
                         Parliamentary approval for the credit and delays in verification and payment of compensation to the project affected persons (PAPs), as well as the challenges of getting utility bodies
                         to relocate their services in order to give right of way for civil works. The second extension of an additional 12 month extension was made to allow all the construction works on the
                         Lubigi Channel, the two roads upgrading works packages, and the expansion of the Kitezi landfill to be completed in order to ensure successful realization of the project development
                         objective. The new closing date of the project is now December 31, 2013.
