                         The Project is a SDR 22 million (US$ 33.6 million) APL. The Project Development Objective is to improve the institutional efficiency of Kampala Capital City (KCC) through
                         implementation of the Strategic Framework for Reform of the KCC. The project has the following components: Component 1 - Institutional development - focusing on activities that
                         support organizational development and governance, the implementation of the Financial Recovery Action Plan, and actions to enhance effectiveness of service delivery; Component

                         The main PDO indicators are: (i) KCC to reduce overdue liabilities from UGX 8 billion to UGX 3 billion; (ii) increase the share of KCC own source revenue spent on service delivery
                         from 10% to 30%; (iii) increase KCC own source revenue from UGX 22 billion to UGX 30 billion; and (iv) increase public satisfaction in service delivery in: roads from 18% to 50%,
                         drainage from 22% to 31%, and solid waste from 44% to 60%. As per the last implementation support mission in November 2012, progress in meeting these indicators is as follows;
                         (i) overdue liabilities have been reduced from UGX8 billion to zero (compared to target of UGX 3 billion); (ii) the share of KCC own source revenue spent on service deliver increased
                         from 10% to 67% (target 30%), (iii) own source revenue increased from UGX 22 billion to UGX41.95 billion (target UGX 30 billion). The only PDO indicator which has not been met,
                         because the civil works have not yet been completed, is public satisfaction in service delivery in roads, drainage and solid waste from 18% to 50%; 22% to 80% and 44% to 70%
                         respectively (achievements to date are 29%, 22% and 46% respectively).

                         With respect to the intermediate outcome indicators, the following has been achieved: (a) building plan permit approval has been reduced from 12 months to 2 months (target 2
                         months), (b) The percentage of property demands notes issued to property owners has increased from 70% to 100% (target 100%), (c) usage of citizens report card to measure
                         service delivery satisfaction has increased from zero to two (the second citizen report card has been completed). From the results above, the project has achieved its intended
                         Institutional strengthening objective, and the remaining activities to be completed are the City Wide Infrastructure civil works.

                         Government has requested for the extension of the closing date of the project from the current closing date of December 31, 2012 (which includes an earlier extension of 24 months)
                         for a further 12 months bringing the closing date to December 31, 2013 or a cumulative total of 36 months. The Project was approved on November 6, 2007 and the original closing
                         date was December 31, 2010.

                         The project closing date was first extended because of the one year delay in project effectiveness occasioned by the Constitutional requirement for obtaining Parliamentary approval
                         for the credit. Subsequent delays resulted from the difficulties faced in verification and payment of compensation to the project affected persons (PAPs), as well as the challenges of
                         getting utility bodies to relocate their services in order to give right of way for civil works. During the November 2012 ISM the team noted that the performance of the contractor for the
                         larger roads works package (8.9km) and the expansion of the Kitezi landfill were largely on track. However the performance of the contractor for a small roads package and the Lubigi
                         channel were behind schedule. The rationale for the current request for an additional 12 month extension of the closing date (December 31, 2013) is, therefore, to allow all the
                         construction works on the Lubigi Channel, the two roads upgrading works packages, and the expansion of the Kitezi landfill to be completed in order to ensure successful realization
                         of the project development objective. The team prepared a RP and management approved the extension of the closing date to December 31, 2013.
