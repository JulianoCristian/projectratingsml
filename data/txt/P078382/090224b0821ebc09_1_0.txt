                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is a SDR 22 million (US$ 33.6 million) APL. The Project Development Objective is to improve the institutional efficiency of Kampala Capital City (KCC) through
                         implementation of the Strategic Framework for Reform (SFR) of the KCC. The project has three components: (i) Component 1 - Institutional development - focusing on activities that
                         support organizational development and governance, the implementation of the Financial Recovery Action Plan, and actions to enhance effectiveness of service delivery; (ii)

                         project, the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system and the preparation of the next phase of the project.

                         The main PDO indicators are: (i) KCC to reduce overdue liabilities from UGX 8 billion to UGX 3 billion; (ii) increase the share of KCC own source revenue spent on service delivery
                         from 10% to 30%; (iii) increase KCC own source revenue from UGX 22 billion to UGX 30 billion; and (iv) increase public satisfaction in service delivery in: roads from 18% to 50%,
                         drainage from 22% to 31%, and solid waste from 44% to 60%.

                         Overall, the project objective, which is focusing on the institutional reform of Kampala city, is still relevant. As of November 8, 2013 the project had achieved the intended outcomes as
                         follows: (i) overdue liabilities were reduced to zero (baseline - UGX8.9 billion, and project target – UGX0.5 billion), (ii) share of KCCA own source revenue spent on service delivery –
                         34% (baseline 18%, target – 34%), (iii) KCCA owns source revenue increased to UGX55.71 billion (base line – UGX 22 billion, and target – UGX 33.5 billion), and (iv) public
                         satisfaction in service delivery in (a) Roads, (b) Drainage, and (c) solid waste increased from 18%, 22% and 44% (baseline) to 29%, 22% and 46% against the targets of 50%, 80%,
                         and 70% respectively.

                         In addition, the triggers for moving from APL 1 to APL 2 had been met as follows: (i) KCCA's new organizational system is in place and operational - top management (deputy
                         directors and above) are “on contract” (i.e. three year renewable contracts with implicit incentives for performance), (ii) KCCA has established and implementing a formal public
                         consultation process, (iii) KCCA has been implementing a financial recovery action plan (FRAP) which resulted into increase in OSR from UGX 22 billion in FY2008/9 to UGX55.71
                         billion in FY2012/13, (iv) KCCA has a comprehensive O&M plan for infrastructure in place, with Quality Management System (QMS) introduced in Engineering and Works and
                         Physical Planning Directorate and plans are underway to roll the system to the other Directorates/Departments under the proposed KIIDP 2, and (v) KCCA has an effective
                         implementation of infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance in place where infrastructure investments are being selected based on sound appraisal and public consultation.

                         The overall performances of the KCCA has improved. Management have introduced a zero tolerance policy for corruption, staff are being appraised bi-annually using the balance
                         score system and appropriate disciplinary actions taken on errant staff. The review of the overall human resource management (HRM) policy has been completed. The Authority has
                         developed and adopted a new corporate strategy (successor to the SFR). Draft assets register has been developed. These positive developments show the improvements in the
                         institutional performances of the Authority in line with the project objective.

                         There had been delays in implementation of project activities due to delays in obtaining Parliamentary approval of the credit, delays in timely procurement, delays in compensating
                         the PAPs, and challenges associated with contract management. As a consequent, the project closing date was first extended by 24 months because of the one year delay in project
                         effectiveness occasioned by the Constitutional requirement for obtaining Parliamentary approval for the credit and delays in verification and payment of compensation to the project
                         affected persons (PAPs), as well as the challenges of getting utility bodies to relocate their services in order to give right of way for civil works. The second extension of an additional
                         12 month extension was made to allow all the construction works on the Lubigi Channel, the two roads upgrading works packages, and the expansion of the Kitezi landfill to be
                         completed. Although the institutional objectives which deals with change management have been achieved, there have been delays in achieving the infrastructure results, which are
                         anticipated to be fully achieved by the new closing date of the project, which is now December 31, 2013.
