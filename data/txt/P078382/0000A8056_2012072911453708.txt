                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Development objective of the KIID APL 1 is "Improved institutional efficiency of KCC through the implementation of the Strategic Framework for Reform (SFR)". Although there
                         were some delays in project start-up followed by a transition in the Kampala local government structure from KCC to the new KCCA which resulted into the realignment of some of
                         the institutional activities to fit with the new Corporate strategy of KCCA, substantial progress has been made in project implementation since the ISM of November/December 2011.

                         The following project institutional efficiency PDO indicators have been achieved (i) overdue liabilities have been reduced from UGX8 billion to zero (compared to target of UGX 0.5
                         billion); (ii) the share of KCCA own source revenue spent on service deliver increased from 10% to 67% (target 34%), (iii) own source revenue increased from UGX 22 billion to
                         UGX33.9 billion (target UGX 33 billion). At the intermediate outcome indicators, the following have been achieved (a) approval of building plan permit approval reduced from 12
                         months to 2 months (target 2 months), (b) Percentage of property demands notes issued to property owners increased from 70% to 100% (target 100%), (c) usage of citizens report

                         card to measure service delivery satisfaction from zero to one (target 2 - second one under progress). The only PDO which has not been met is public satisfaction in service delivery
                         in roads, drainage and solid waste from 18%, 22% and 44% to 14%, 12% and 44% respective (target 50%, 80% and 70% respectively). This has been because of the delays in
                         completion of the civil works for roads and drainage, which is now scheduled for October 2012. From the results above, the project has achieved the intended Institutional
                         strengthening objective. In addition the new KCCA management has shown keen interest to complete implementation of remaining project activities by December 31, 2012. A new
                         Corporate Strategy for the Authority has been developed as a successor to the SFRII. KCCA has demonstrated commitment and interest to take on board advise from Bank mission
                         to ensure project implementation is completed by December 31, 2012.

                         With respect to the triggers to move from APL1 to APL2 the status are as follows: (i) New organizational system operational - the KCCA organizational structure has been approved
                         by Ministry of Public Service in March 2012. By the time of the mission, the Executive Director and nine Directors had been substantively appointed; the job descriptions and personal
                         specifications for all the 328 job families that make the approved KCCA structure had been developed, adverts for 279 jobs families (85%) had been made and first batch of
                         interviews started by May 21, 2012 with interviews for all job families to be completed by September 2012. In addition, under the new KCCA structure, top management will be on
                         three year renewable contract based on performance, while other staff will be appointed on permanent performance contract including enforcement of leadership code of conduct; (ii)
                         KCCA has established and implemented a formal public consultation process - this included the first citizen score card report, formulation of a media strategy for public feed back. in
                         addition a budget and development planning consultation for FY2012/13 was carried out in April 9, 2012 followed by a development partners breakfast meeting held on April 20,
                         2012, (iii) the implementation of the financial recovery action plan (FRAP) targets have been achieved - stock of overdue liability has been reduced from UGX8 billion to zero (target
                         UGX0.5 billion), own source revenue (OSR) has been increased from UGX22 billion to UGX 33.9 billion (target UGX 33.5 billion), (iv) KCCA has developed a comprehensive O&M
                         plan for infrastructure and in FY2011/12 out of a total budget of UGX145.73 billion about UGX81.1 billion was allocated for non-wage of which UGX45.5 billion has been allocated to
                         engineering and technical services for infrastructure O&M, (v) infrastructure investments by KCCA have continued to be selected based on sound appraisal and public consultation
                         and Quality Assurance System (QAS) has been started in the engineering and technical services department with plans to roll-out the system to the all of KCCA. With these
                         achievements the mission is convinced that KCCA will meet the triggers for APL2.
