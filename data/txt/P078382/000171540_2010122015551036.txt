Dear Minister: 
 
Uganda: Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure 
Development Project  
(Cr. 4367-UG)  
Extension of the Closing Date and Reallocation of Proceeds 
Second Amendment to the Financing Agreement
We refer to the Financing Agreement (the Agreement) dated February 20, 
2008 between the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank 
(referred to as the Association in the Agreement) and the Republic of Uganda (the 
Recipient), concerning the above mentioned credit for financing the Kampala 
Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (the Project). We also refer to a 
letter from the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to the Treasury, Ministry of Finance, 
Planning and Economic Development, dated February 9, 2010, requesting the World 
Bank to extend the closing Date of the Credit for up to twenty four (24) months. 
 
After consideration of reasons for the delays in the implementation of the civil 
works, we are pleased to inform you that the World Bank agrees to amend Section IV. 
A. (2.) and B. (2.) of Schedule 2 to the Agreement and to reallocate the credit 
proceeds to accommodate the payments of compensation costs for involuntary 
resettlement to avoid any further delays in implementation of civil works which 
cannot start before full payment of the associated involuntary resettlement costs. An 
additional category of eligible expenditure, grants to community, has been added to 
the project for this purpose.  In addition, IDA agrees to a further reallocation of credit 
proceeds for the Consultant’s Services category to accommodate increased 
consultancy costs due to the extension of the credit closing date for two years.   As a 
result, we are hereby amending the table under Section IV. A (2.) of Schedule 2 to the 
Agreement as presented here below:
