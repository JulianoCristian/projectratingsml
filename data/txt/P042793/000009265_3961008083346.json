Credit is to support the Government's reform\n            program to stabilize the economy and create conditions for a\n            resumption of growth and an improvement in living standards.\n            This will be achieved through: 1) provision of foreign\n            exchange for the purchase of critical imports, particularly\n            for the private sector; 2) budgetary support, especially for\n            the strengthening of the social safety net for the most\n            vulnerable groups; and 3) providing a framework for\n            urgently-needed financial assistance from other donors. The\n            program includes policies that: a) reorient the role of the\n            state away from direct management of the economy towards\n            support of private sector development; b) result in improved\n            financial discipline for enterprises and banks; and c)\n            improve the targeting of the social services and benefits to\n            the most needy."}, "docdt": "1996-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
