The performances of both the Bank and the Borrower\n            are rated as satisfactory. Among the lessons noted are: 1)\n            The Bank is well positioned to respond to similar\n            emergencies in the future; 2) The Bank can play an active\n            role to assist countries in meeting established and evolving\n            regulatory standards; 3) There can be significant advantages\n            to implementing multi-country programs through a regional\n            entity; 4) Regional procurement can bring important\n            cost-benefits; and 5) Emergency projects benefit from close supervision."}, "docdt": "2006-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
