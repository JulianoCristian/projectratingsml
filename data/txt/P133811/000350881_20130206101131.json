Emergency\n            Crisis Recovery Project (ECRP) for Yemen is to assist the\n            recipient in mitigating the impact of the 2011 crisis by\n            providing cash benefits to eligible poor households. The\n            proposed ECRP will finance cash assistance grants to poor\n            households in Yemen through the Social Welfare Fund (SWF)\n            cash transfer program. Poor households to be covered by the\n            grant have been added in 2011 to the SWF beneficiary list\n            after applying a Proxy Means Test (PMT) poverty-based\n            targeting. The project has two components. (1) Cash benefits\n            to poor households' component will provision temporary\n            cash benefits to eligible poor households for a maximum\n            period of fifteen months. (2) Project monitoring and\n            evaluation component will provide consultancy services\n            necessary to support the SWF in monitoring and evaluation of\n            project implementation, including external audit."}, "docdt": "2013-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
