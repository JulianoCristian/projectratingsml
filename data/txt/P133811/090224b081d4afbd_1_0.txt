                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was signed on February 27, 2013 and became effective on May 8, 2013. The project will provide cash assistance to about 400,000 households which have been added
                         to the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) program in 2011 using the Proxy Means Targeting (PMT) method and categorized as A, B, C or D. These households will include about 40,000
                         households funded by the EU/WB Emergency Social Safety Net Enhancement Project and 30,000 households funded by the Netherlands.

                         The project is making good progress and most of the earlier agreed actions have been met . The first withdrawal application is ready to be submitted. However, the SWF is having
                         problems submitting it through the e-disbursement system. The Bank team is closely following up on this.
