1. Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement

In 2011, Yemen experienced mass protests, violent clashes, and armed conflict that resulted in
the election of a new President and the formation of a transitional government. The conflict
situation caused significant disruptions in the supply and production chains resulting in
contraction of the economy and higher unemployment. Poverty is estimated to have risen further
from 42 percent of the population in 2009 to 54.5 percent in 2012. Approximately 45 percent of
the population (10 million people) were food insecure in March 2012, a significant increase from
the nearly 32 percent in 2009. A high level of poverty is one of the main challenges facing
Yemen and its people, and it is crucial to provide support to the poorest and most vulnerable in
these times of crisis to mitigate the impact and achieve stability in the country.

The proposed Emergency Crisis Recovery Grant (ECRG) is one of the main instruments planned
under the Yemen Interim Strategy Note, approved by the Bank in November 2012, targeting the
vulnerabilities of poor people and marginalized groups in the short term. It is in line with the
Joint Economic and Social Assessment (JSEA)1 recommendation of protecting critical social
expenditures in the short term, and with the transitional government objective of maintaining
income levels and critical basic services, especially for the poor. The ECRG is expected to
contribute to the stability of the transition through supporting the Government of Yemen (GOY)
in providing immediate financial assistance to poor households through the Social Welfare Fund
(SWF) Cash Transfer Program.

  An assessment prepared by the World Bank in collaboration with the United Nations, the European Union and the
Islamic Development Bank in 2012 to evaluate the impact of the crisis and identify recovery measures.
2. Proposed objective(s)

The main objective of the proposed ECRG is to assist the GoY in mitigating the impact of 2011
crisis by providing cash benefits to eligible poor households.

3. Preliminary description

The proposed ECRG would finance cash assistance grants delivered to about 487,000 poor
households in Yemen which have been added to the SWF beneficiaries list in 2011. These
households were found eligible after applying poverty-based targeting (proxy means testing)
based on the results of the 2008 national households survey. In addition, the project will finance
consultancy services necessary for monitoring and evaluation of project implementation.

4. Safeguard policies that might apply

Project activities—cash benefits and associated costs—do not trigger any safeguards policy, and
therefore the project safeguards category is C.
