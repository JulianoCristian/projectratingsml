Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (i) the existing institutional arrangements and structure\n            and the absorptive capacity of the Borrower and sector\n            ministry must be assessed in detail with regard to\n            implementation mechanisms and project management\n            arrangements; (ii) in hindsight it would also have been\n            useful to do an explicit stakeholder analysis; (iii)\n            architectural designs for the clinics should have been\n            agreed during appraisal and confirmed during negotiations;\n            and (iv) the Bank should have been more insistent that the\n            baseline survey was carried out as this was central to the\n            monitoring and evaluation system."}, "docdt": "1996-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
