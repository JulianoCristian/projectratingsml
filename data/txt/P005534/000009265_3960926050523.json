The\n            primary objectives of this project are as follows. First,\n            mortality and morbidity will be reduced. This is\n            particularly intended for the 300,000 inhabitants of the\n            predominantly rural Batinah region. Second, the\n            Government's institutional capacity to plan and manage\n            the health sector will be strengthened. Finally, efforts\n            will be made to prepare the way for country wide\n            implementation of a more efficient service delivery model."}, "docdt": "1987-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
