complete modernizing (mainly by canal lining) about\n            30% of its surface irrigation systems; develop supplemental\n            groundwater; accelerate development of irrigated agriculture\n            in the Jui Lift Irrigation Command Area; construct or\n            improve 26 produce markets and about 1,390 km of village\n            link roads; provide drinking water to about 175 villages;\n            and provide technical assistance to help project monitoring,\n            evaluation, research and development. The project would\n            comprise a four year phase of development designed to\n            increase food production and the standards of living of the\n            farmers in Haryana."}, "docdt": "1978-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
