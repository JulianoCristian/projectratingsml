Strategy                     It contributes to the first Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Pillar objective of
                             "develop[ing] a higher education system that produces graduates better suited to
                             the new economy's needs."
Risks and Risk Mitigation    Policy-related risk: MOET may have weak capacity in developing coherent policy.
                             Mitigation: HEP2 provides for technical assistance aimed at building capacity.
                             Institutional risk: MOET and HEIs may not be fully effective in applying the
                             regulations to their full potential. Mitigation: NMUP will provide a privileged
                             locus for testing the full application of the new body of regulations and offering a
                             demonstration effect for roll-out to other HEIs.
                             Fiduciary risk: Weaknesses identified in the 2007 CFAA will likely take some time
                             to remedy in the higher education sector. Mitigation: HEDPP includes an explicit

I.        INTRODUCTION

1.      The programmatic series of three single-tranche operation of Higher
Education Development Policy Programs (HEDPO1-3), along with the Second Higher
Education Project (HEP2) and the proposed New Model University Project (NMUP),
is designed to support the Government's implementation of its "Socio-Economic
Development Plan 2006-2010" (SEDP)1 and its "Higher Education Reform Agenda"
(HERA).2 In particular, HEDPO1-3 aims to strengthen governance, rationalize
financing, improve the quality of teaching and research, improve accountability for
performance, and enhance transparency in financial management within the higher
education sector. The First Higher Education Development Policy Program
(HEDPP1) was approved on June 23, 2009 and became effective on November 26,
2009. The proposed Higher Education Development Policy Program - Second
Operation (HEDPP2) would be the second in a programmatic series of three single-
tranche Development Policy Credits (DPCs) to support the sustained implementation
of selected elements of the Government's reform agenda.
2.      The Policy Matrix (Annex 2) and Results Framework (Annex 3) indicate the
status of the measures passed under HEDPO2, and policy triggers and benchmarks for
the proposed following third operation (HEDPO3).
3.      The HEDPO1-3 are designed to be forward-looking. The negotiation of each
operation includes reaching an agreement on a list of policy measures that will be
supported by the following operation. These policy measures, or "triggers," are
grounded in the HERA 2006-2020, and are considered to have strategic importance to
attain the HERA objectives. In addition to the "triggers," the policy dialogue
conducted under HEDPO1-3 addresses a broader set of issues, articulated as
"benchmarks." These benchmarks are reported to convey the scope of the reforms
being implemented. They are not part of the legal agreement, although they
strengthen the implementation of the higher education reform agenda.
4.     The first operation was for US$50million in International Development
Association (IDA) terms. This proposed second operation would be in the amount of
SDR 32.2 million (US$50million equivalent), of which SDR 3.1 million would be
recommitted from a partial cancellation of the Vietnam Primary Education for
Disadvantaged Children Project (Credit 3752-VN) and SDR 3.8 million would be
recommitted from a partial cancellation of the Vietnam Information and
Communication Technology Development Project (Credit 4116-VN).


    II.   COUNTRY CONTEXT

5.      Vietnam has experienced rapid and consistent growth and poverty reduction
since launching its transition towards market mechanisms (i mi) in 1986. Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth has averaged over 7.5 percent over the ten years
until 2007. In US dollar terms, income per capita rose from $260 in 1995 to $400 in

Vietnam's tertiary education in the 2006-2020 period).

2000 to a current level of $1,030 in 2009. By this achievement, Vietnam has just
entered the ranks of low middle-income countries. The poverty rate has declined
from 58.1 percent in 1993 to 28.9 percent in 2002 and to 14.5 percent in 2008, and
has continued to decline since.3 Vietnam is one of the top MDG Progress Index
Performers (MDGs)4.
6.      A key challenge is to maintain growth in the context of global integration and
to address concerns of increasing inequality. Vietnam has pursued a trade-led growth
strategy resulting in a steady increase in both exports and imports as a proportion of
GDP. World Trade Organization (WTO) accession in 2007 is driving further
liberalization of the economy. Economic integration is also increasing the country's
exposure to global economic volatility, requiring increasing sophistication of macro-
economic management to respond to capital flows, inflation pressures and shocks in
financial markets. Liberalization, while driving poverty reduction amongst all groups,
has also resulted in increased inequality between rural and urban areas, and in
particular amongst ethnic minorities whose poverty rate remains over 50 percent.
7.      Vietnam has become increasingly integrated with the world economy, and
joined the WTO in November 2006. In February 2009 Vietnam officially joined the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as an "associate member." The integration with the
world economy has become one of the cornerstones of its reform program. Exports
have been the main drivers for growth, and foreign investment has been buoyant in
recent years. The share of agriculture in GDP declined from 27 to 21 percent of GDP
over the period 1995-2008 while that of industry rose from 29 to 41 percent over the
same period. The services sector picked up 38 percent share of GDP in 2008.
Tourism-related services have been especially buoyant.
8.      The rising importance of the private sector has been a feature of recent
growth. The role of the state sector in manufacturing activity has declined
appreciably: from 52 percent in 1995 to under 35 percent in 2008. The rising share of
the private sector is also reflected in non-oil exports and bank credit. Macroeconomic
policies in Vietnam have been generally prudent and key economic balances have
been maintained at manageable levels. The government's stance towards fiscal and
monetary policies reflects a determination to not repeat past mistakes that resulted in a
short period of hyperinflation in 1992-1996.
Recent economic development in Vietnam

9.      Global crisis and its effects. The 2008-09 global financial crisis led to a
slowdown of economic growth in Vietnam. International commodity prices declined
in the third quarter of 2008, export orders for garments and other main industrial
products collapsed in the fourth quarter, and a slowdown in manufacturing became
noticeable. The impact was acute in the first quarter of 2009, when GDP increased
only by 3.1 percent compared with the same period in 2008, more than 4 percentage
points below the historic trend.
10.     The global financial crisis was the latest in a series of major external shocks.
In late 2007 and early 2008, in the aftermath of its accession to the WTO, Vietnam

  The more recent statistics are not directly comparable to the 1993 and 2006 figures, but the poverty reduction
trend is continuing since 2006. See the poverty reduction section below.

was confronted with massive capital inflows. Attempts to sterilize them were
inadequate to prevent a boom in banking credit, an acceleration of inflation, a
ballooning trade deficit and asset price bubbles. The bubbles were amplified by
sizeable infrastructure investments by central and provincial governments. The
investment decisions of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and "Economic
Groups,"5 which took advantage of their access to finance to diversify into booming
sectors, contributed to fanning the flames. The impact of overheating was further
aggravated by the surge in the international prices of food and energy in early 2008.

11.     Government responses. The government responded to the overheating with a
stabilization package. In March 2008, it adopted the "eight groups of measures" to
bring inflation down and reduce the trade deficit. This package combined the
tightening of banking credit, enhanced supervision of vulnerable banks, postponement
of non-urgent public investment projects, modest cuts in recurrent government

  "Economic Groups" are groups of enterprises each with distinct legal status, which are bound together through
mutual investments, capital contribution, merger, acquisition, reorganization or other forms of affiliation; share
common long-term economic interests, technology, market and/or business services; and constitute a consolidated
business entity in which the enterprises are organized into two or more levels, as parent companies and
subsidiaries, as set forth in the Enterprise Law of 2005 and Decree 139 of September 5, 2007.

                                                             3
expenditures, and temporary interventions in international trade. The (unofficial)
crawling peg of the dong to the US dollar was not abandoned, but the floatation band
was broadened.
12.     In the fall of 2008, when the policy response was beginning to work, the
government had to change gears from stabilization to stimulus, as the effects of the
global financial crisis on Vietnam became evident. In November 2008, the "five
groups of measures" aimed at supporting economic activities were announced. This
time, the package included cuts and deferrals in payments of corporate and personal
income tax as well as in value-added tax for small and medium enterprises. It also
included a small program of cash transfers to poor households for the occasion of the
Lunar New Year. Other measures followed in February 2009, including a short-term
interest rate subsidy scheme for working capital, which was de facto used to re-
finance enterprise debts contracted on very onerous terms during the stabilization
period. This scheme turned out to be instrumental in keeping credit flowing to the
economy, and prevented financial distress in the corporate sector.

13.     Inflation, which peaked around the summer of 2008, had been declining
steadily until the summer of 2009. In the second half of 2009, however, the trends
reversed (Figure 2) as the expansionary monetary policy during the stimulus period
has led to rapid credit growth, which reached 39.6 percent at end 2009 (Figure 3),
above the target of 30 percent for 2009. Inflationary pressures were one of the
reasons for which market participants shifted their portfolio from dong-based to


                                                  4
foreign currency-based assets. Towards the end of 2009, the government shifted
gears once again to balance the stimulus and macroeconomic stability objectives.
14.     Since November 2009, the base rate was raised from 7 to 8 percent, the dong
was devalued twice by a total of approximately 9 percent, and the floatation band was
narrowed from 5 percent to 3 percent. The interest rate subsidy scheme for
working capital was terminated in December 2009 as originally planned, further
contributing to monetary policy tightening. The cap on lending rates in dong for
medium to long term borrowing was de facto removed, allowing flexible interest rates
to allocate resources better and to entice households to shift some of their assets from
dollar-based to dong-based assets, contributing to a smoother operation of the foreign
exchange market.

15.     Economic Performance. For 2009, GDP growth was respectable at 5.3
percent, helped in part by the stimulus package. Growth in the last quarter of 2009
was particularly strong, reaching 6.9 percent (year on year). Construction and
services, two sectors buoyed by domestic demand, led the recovery, while agriculture
and manufacturing sectors still grew below the historic trend. The first has been
affected by unfavorable weather conditions in 2009 while the second was hit very
hard by the effects of the global financial crisis in the developed countries.
16.     Government Budget. The government's overall fiscal deficit is estimated to
have been 8.9 percent of GDP in 2009, substantially above those of previous years, as
the stimulus package came on top of an already expansionary budget plan. In
addition to the measures adopted to stimulate economic activities, the fall in oil prices
and the slowdown in economic activities have resulted in a decline in the government
revenue. This decline was partially offset in the second half of 2009, as both
international commodity prices and domestic economic activities became more
buoyant.
17.      External sector. The external balance held up reasonably well during 2009
despite the global crisis. Vietnamese exports declined by 8.9 percent in 2009 from
2008. The decline was less than in most other developing countries, but made 2009
the first year with negative export growth since the beginning of Vietnam's economic
reforms in 1987. The decline would have been larger if the sizeable gold exports of
early 2009 are not included. An even more dramatic decline in imports, by 13.3
percent, succeeded in reducing the trade deficit. Despite the faster recovery of

                                           5
imports than exports in the last months of 2009, and the decline in remittances from
abroad, the current account deficit decreased to 8.0 percent of GDP in 2009, down
from 11.9 percent in 2008. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows are down, but
Official Development Assistance (ODA) increased in 2009, resulting in an estimated
capital account surplus of around 11.5 percent of GDP in 2009.
18.     Even though the capital account surplus was sufficient to cover the current
account deficit, international reserves appeared to decline in 2009, reversing the
recent trend of slow accumulation. The increasing demand for foreign exchange by
importers and the market expectations of dong devaluation led to a shortage of foreign
exchange, which was particularly severe in May-July 2009, and again in November.
Economic Groups were among the entities holding on to their foreign currency
earnings. The uncertainty regarding the level of international reserves also
encouraged a precautionary demand for and hoarding of gold and hard currency.
These developments resulted in depreciation pressures on the exchange rate, with the
dong trading at the weaker end of the floatation band for an extended period, and the
spread between interbank and parallel exchange rates widening to between 3 and
more than 10 percent at various times (Figure 1).

19.     The Banking Sector. The banking sector was adversely affected by the
succession of asset price bubbles, monetary tightening and growth slowdown. The
real estate bubble of end-2007 and its subsequent bursting in early 2008 made it
difficult for several commercial banks to recover their loans; the rapid disinflation in
late 2008, at a time when interest rates were still very high, substantially increased the
debt service burden faced by enterprises because of the rapid rise in real interest rates.
                                                        6
During the stabilization phase of late 2007- early 2008, the SBV upgraded its
supervision efforts, and in parallel, raised minimum capital requirements. By the end
of 2008 all commercial banks, including the nine small joint stock banks that seemed
most vulnerable, had met the new requirements. This process continues, with the
minimum charter capital set at 3 trillion dong (about $150 million at today's exchange
rate) by end 2010. All banks need to submit plans on how they will meet this target
no later than June 2010. Banks which fail to meet this requirement will be forced to
merge with other larger banks, or will have their business licenses revoked.
20.     The fraction of bad debt (calculated based on days in arrears) for the banking
sector was on the rise until mid-2009 (generally a few percentage points), but has
started to decline more recently. Non Performing Loans (NPLs), calculated using
international standards based on borrower risks, would be at a much higher level (2-3
times higher), but are not known with certainty. In the absence of the interest subsidy
scheme, rapidly changing inflation and interest rates combined with weak orders due
to the global financial crisis would have resulted in an even more substantial
deterioration of bank portfolios. The increase in bad loans came after an overall
improvement in the quality of lending as a result of several years of efforts by the
State-owned Commercial Banks to clean their portfolios in preparation for
equitization. The recent reversal of this trend of increasing bad loans suggests that the
gradual recovery of economic activities is helping enterprises cope with their financial
obligations.
21.     Poverty Reduction. Poverty has fallen rapidly in Vietnam, from 58.1 percent
of the population in 1993, to 28.9 percent in 2002, and only 14.5 percent by 2008, the
last year for which comparable poverty estimates are available6 (Figure 4). Less than
5 percent of the urban population is poor. However, there are growing concerns about
poverty and living conditions in Vietnam's cities and peri-urban areas due to high
rates of urban population growth (including a heavy influx of migrant workers),
excess demand for urban services, and a continuing rise in the cost of living.
Inequality also remains low, and poverty has become increasingly concentrated in
rural areas and among certain social groups (viz. ethnic minority populations).
Although ethnic minority poverty rates have fallen over time, there is still a
considerable gap between living conditions of ethnic minorities and the Kinh/Hoa.
                             FIGURE 4: POVERTY TRENDS IN VIETNAM




6
  Poverty data are based on the Government Statistics Office (GSO) Vietnam Living Standards Surveys (VHLSS)
carried out in 1993, 1998, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008.

                                                     7
22.     Regional differentials are important and likely to become more so in the
future. Poverty levels vary substantially across regions; poverty headcounts are
highest in the mountainous and more isolated Northwest region, as well as in the
North East and the Central Highlands. All regions have witnessed progress in recent
years (Figure 5) although disparities remain.
                    FIGURE 5: REGIONAL DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY




23.     Progress at reducing poverty has been more difficult in the last several years.
Inflation rose rapidly throughout the first half of 2008, with food prices reaching a
peak by mid-year before stabilization measures were put in place. The construction
sector was hard-hit by the credit squeeze in the middle of 2008 and agriculture
suffered a series of shocks. The most recent poverty estimates for Vietnam reflect the
situation in 2008 but not more recent impacts of the global financial crisis. Although
the 2008 Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) shows continued
progress at reducing poverty, it was at a somewhat slower rate than earlier periods:
the poverty headcount fell by around 1 percentage point each year between 2006 and
2008, compared to 2-3 percentage points a year in earlier periods (VHLSS 2002,
2004, 2006).
Macroeconomic outlook and debt sustainability

24.     The outlook for 2010 is challenging. The stimulus program, while succeeding
in encouraging economic activities, has also contributed to increased external
vulnerability during 2009. Expansionary monetary and fiscal policies contributed to
the return of a large current account deficit, although smaller than that in 2008.
Critical macroeconomic information such as the real size of the stimulus package and
international reserves were not made clear in a timely manner, which added to
uncertainty and exacerbated the foreign exchange shortage by inducing preemptive
hard currency hoarding. As the world economy recovers, the government has adopted
tighter monetary and fiscal policies commensurate with the available financing. The
government also needs to redouble its efforts in communicating and demonstrating its
determination to pursue macroeconomic stability to the public in general, and market
participants in particular, in order to avoid the situation where inadequate information
breeds anxiety.

                                           8
25.     External Sector. Balance of Payments will continue to be a challenge for the
authorities in 2010. The trade deficit has been on a widening trend again since mid-
2009. While medium to long term capital inflows are expected to cover the current
account deficit, it is also important to reverse the apparent trend of declining
international reserves. In addition to the devaluations and administrative efforts
undertaken by the authorities since December 2009 to ease the excess demand for
foreign currency and gold, such as instructing SOEs to render foreign currency
holdings into the banking system, and tightening supervision of gold trading, it is
necessary to address the underlying causes of the excess demand for foreign
exchange. In this respect, the recent decision to allow negotiated interest rates for
dong-denominated medium and long-term loans was an important step in easing the
foreign exchange market pressure. The parallel exchange market rate is now within
the official trading band, and the dong appreciated by 0.28 percent in April. While
the market interest rates prevailing today may be too high to be conducive to
nurturing the economic recovery, the authorities need to tread carefully among the
competing objectives of economic growth and stability. If the market sentiment
swings in the other extreme and massive capital inflows resume, adequate sterilization
will become necessary, as will stepped up monitoring and management of systemic
risks arising from short-term inflows and exposure to exchange rate risks.
26.    Inflation. The inflationary pressure appears to be subsiding. The effects of
devaluation, the 6.8 percent increase on average of the price of electricity in March
2010, and the 12.3 percent increase in minimum wage and civil service salaries
wages, effective May 1, 2010 have all worked their way through, and April increase
in consumer price index recorded the lowest monthly growth since the beginning of
the year.
27.     Government Budget. The budget plan for 2010, which translates into a
projected overall fiscal deficit of 5.9 percent, entails a substantial contraction
compared to 2009, but still expansionary compared to previous years. The
government is expected to reduce the deficit to pre-crisis levels by 2013 (Table 2).
The deficit is expected to be financed with a combination of bond issuance, including
the proceeds of a sovereign bond offering of $1 billion completed early 2010, and
increased ODA. At the Consultative Group meeting held in December 2009,
development partners pledged over $8 billion (including both loans and grants), a
sharp increase from $5 billion in the previous year. Even with the caveat that the
pledged figures do not directly translate into disbursements within the calendar year,
the ODA funds are expected to help finance the budget deficit. In the past, the
government has not monetized unfunded expenditure, preferring to adjust capital
spending (including on-lending to lower levels of government) when financing fell
short of expectations.
28.     Debt. Vietnam's debt is likely to stay sustainable if the current economic
recovery continues and the authorities revert to the fiscal deficit of 3-4 percent in the
next three years as expected. Preliminary results of the debt sustainability analysis
currently underway indicate that the public sector debt was estimated to be 49 percent
of GDP at the end of 2009, two-thirds of which (31 percent of GDP) was to external
creditors. Under the baseline scenario, this ratio was projected to increase to just
above 50 percent of GDP in the second half of this decade before starting to decline
again in the next decade. The large fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010 do not affect the


                                           9
overall debt sustainability significantly, as long as the government reverts to the pre-
crisis levels of deficit in a few years.
29.     Even with the recent borrowings on less concessional terms, nearly two-thirds
of Vietnam's debt is contracted on highly concessional terms. The ratio of debt
service to exports is projected to remain at or below 5 percent until 2013. The stress
tests for the current exercise are not yet completed, but the basic picture has not
changed from the previous exercise conducted in 2009. The two main risks to debt
sustainability are likely to continue to be a one-time nominal depreciation of the dong
of 30 percent and an increase in debt-creating flows by 10 percentage points of GDP.
Both scenarios are unlikely.
30.      The largest source of uncertainty and hence, unquantifiable risk comes from
implicit obligations that are not captured under public and publicly-guaranteed debt
statistics. Contingent liabilities might arise from off-budget statutory funds such as
health insurance fund, large SOEs, or the banking sector. However, a clear definition
and a reliable estimate of such liabilities are not available, which limits the
government's ability to manage associated risks.
III.      THE GOVERNMENT'S REFORM AGENDA
Higher education reform: context

31.     The education sector in Vietnam has expanded rapidly, with the fastest growth
taking place at the upper levels of education. The VHLSS data show that, between
1992 and 2006, the percentage of the population aged 25-55 not having completed
even the lowest level of education went down from 23 percent to less than 1 percent.
Primary educational attainment increased from 28 to 34 percent of the population,
lower secondary attainment from 30 to 34 percent only, and upper secondary
education from 7 to 12 percent. Access to university increased, with about 5 percent
of the 25-55 population group reaching the undergraduate stage in 2006. Rural and
lower income populations have benefited the most from the increase in primary and
lower secondary attainment. Enrollment in colleges and universities has nearly
doubled from some 900,000 students in 2001 to more than 1,600,000 students in
2008. This can be explained by: (i) an initially low enrollment rate; (ii) high demand
for higher education as a result of higher returns to skills; and (iii) the Government's
actions in expanding the subsector. Over the same period, demographic changes have
resulted in a significant decline in primary school age children which translated into
decreasing primary education enrollments and a leveling off of lower secondary
enrollments.
32.     As a result of these enrollment and demographic trends, gross and net
enrolment rates have continued to increase for all education levels. Higher education
coverage, though, remains relatively low. Primary enrollment is now near universal,
and the gross enrollment rate in lower and overall secondary is reaching, respectively,
about 85 and 70 percent according to the most recent UIS data7which places Vietnam
in a very favorable position vis-à-vis countries with similar per-capita income in
relation to the coverage of these two education levels. At the same time, the Vietnam
Household Living Standards Survey data show that the gross enrollment rate in higher
education increased from about 11 percent in 1998 to 18 percent in 2008. While on

the rise and higher than some other countries with similar income per capita, the
coverage of higher education in Vietnam is still quite low at the regional level (Table
3), which, combined with increasing wage premiums on workers with higher
education (Figure 6), shows significant room for further expansion.

33.     While increasing, access to higher education is also becoming more equitable
in time across urban and rural areas and income quintiles. Ethnic minority groups,
however, have yet to see significant improvement. While the proportion of adult
population attaining higher education is still highly skewed towards the most
advantaged groups (with, for instance, only a 0.15 percent the adult population
reaching higher education in 2006 versus over 8 percent for the highest quintile), the
gross enrollment rate has been growing faster since 1998 in rural areas and for lower
income quintiles (Figures 7 and 8), which will lead to higher equity in tertiary
educated workforce later on.           After controlling for other socio-economic
characteristics, in 2006, Vietnam was on the low side of inequities in access to higher
education in the region (Figure 9). However, while these trends are positive,
differences in enrollment between advantaged and disadvantaged groups remain
marked and the educational attainment gap to be filled is large requiring sustained
effort. Most importantly, ethnic minorities are only experiencing slow improvement
of their access to higher education, requiring renewed action on this front.

34.     The emergence of the private higher education started since the mid-1990s
supporting increasing enrollment in higher education. However, the State remains by
far the main provider. Private provision has become an increasingly important share
of the total sector provision. By 2007- 08, Vietnam counted 407 Higher Education
Institutes (HEIs), of which 76 were private representing 18.6 percent of the overall
delivery versus about 14 percent in 1999-2000. As a result the share of enrollment in
private HEIs has also increased (Table 4), although these last years have seen
stagnation in the private university share. The State remains for the moment the key
provider and financier of the sector. If enrollment in the non-public sector is to
increase further and faster in order to relieve pressure from the public system, the
regulatory framework for private institutions will need to be strengthened, including
creating a common set of rules for the operation of both public and private HEIs.
               Table 4: Share of enrollment by private higher education institutions
     Level            2000-    2001-     2002-    2003-    2004-     2005-    2006-    2007-    2008-

35.     The State is also the main financer of higher education, but introducing cost-
recovery has resulted in a rapid increase in the share of tuition fees raising some
challenges for the financing of the sector. The State is also the key financier of the
higher education sector providing 50 to 60 percent of the total budget of public HEIs,
but tuition fees provide a significant 30 to 35 percent share of the budget. The policy
of introducing cost-recovery in higher education has resulted in a rapid increase in the
share of tuition fees in the total revenue of higher education institutions. This strategy
helped Vietnam to expand the sector rapidly without creating a heavy burden on the
State budget. It may have strained the capacity of some students and their families to
pay, but this risk has been mitigated to a considerable extent by the expansion of
student loans scheme and other aid mechanisms. In this funding context, to support
further expansion, main options include a further increase in public spending (in

particular given the fact that the State budget for education increased steadily but the
spending remains skewed towards lower levels of education and the share allocated to
higher education is low by all standards (countries of similar income per-capita;
regional average; OECD average ­ Figure 10), diversification of resources9, increase
of tuition fees in the public sector mitigated by strengthened student
loans/scholarships schemes, or, yet, further expansion of the mostly privately financed
private sector.10

36.     The management of the financing of higher education is also highly
fragmented. Responsibility for implementation of the education sector budget is
shared between the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), other line ministries
and local authorities. Some 60 public HEIs are under direct MOET control, while the
others are controlled by other ministries (depending on the areas of study and
research) or provincial people's committees (in the case of HEIs that have a "local"
vocation). Budgeting is a bottom-up process which MOET controls. HEIs submit
their annual plan and budget estimates to MOET for approval and consolidation, and
other public HEIs submit theirs to the controlling ministries or provincial people's
committees. This gives rise to some incoherence and opaqueness in the sector
policies in setting enrollment quotas, in budget allocation and determining the levels
of scholarships and fees.
37.     Along this line a key challenge that stands on the path of higher access and
better quality and of a better fit of higher education with the current needs of the
Vietnamese economy is the slow pace of change in the governance structure of
Vietnam's higher education, especially its centrally planned vertical organization,
which results in lack of decision-making autonomy at the HEI level. Public HEIs
have currently still limited autonomy in human resource, financing, admission,
pedagogical and academic decisions.         The centrally planned non-transparent

  Universities in Vietnam do not generate any significant income from research activities or donations,
or any other sources such as sale of services.
10
   Tuition and student fees constitute about 82 percent of the revenues collected by private universities.

                                                    14
enrollment quota system constrains the coverage, efficiency and quality potential of
the system. Modifying the criteria for the determination of the quotas and
decentralizing as much as possible decisions to the HEI level, in combination with a
clear definition of respective roles and responsibilities of the different levels and a
strong quality assurance/accountability framework, would move a long way towards
improving the flexibility, quality and relevance of higher education in the country.
38.     Finally, and in part as a result of still ineffective financing and governance
policies, beyond equitable expansion, quality of higher education is also at stake in
Vietnam. The proportion of faculty members with doctoral degrees is generally used
as an indicator of the quality of a higher education institution, especially in the case of
international rankings. A large proportion of academic staff in Vietnam does not have
a postgraduate degree and very few have doctorates. In fact, the proportion of faculty
having a doctoral degree has been falling over the last decade (Table 5). Additionally,
there is a large number of students for each faculty member11 with negative
consequences on the learning environment. Finally, the spending for research is also
small, amounting to less than 1 percent of the total government spending, about 0.2
percent of the country's GDP (low by international standards ­ Table 6) and
representing less than 2 percent of their revenues for public HEIs. This fact,
combined with low ratios of faculty with doctorate degrees and the absence of a
clearly laid-out "multi-tiered" system with the potential for the development of top
research institutions, greatly constrains the capacity of universities to conduct
research (as also measured by the low proportion of published scientific and journal
articles).

standards.

Higher education reform: strategy

39.    There was a noticeable acceleration, starting around 2001, of the
Government's drive towards relying on market mechanisms, building a multi-
stakeholder economy and further integrating with the region and the world. The
vision underlying this drive was articulated in several strategic plans and documents,
including the Ten-Year Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2001-2010, the
second Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-20010 and the
Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS). These strategic
plans and documents aimed at building a market economy with a socialist orientation.
They were built on the successes of the renovation process initiated in the late 1980s
with Doi Moi, while also preserving the strong poverty focus which has characterized
Vietnam's reform process.
40.     The SEDP 2006-2010, represented a sharp improvement from earlier
planning documents based on a "command and control" view of the economy. Rather
than spelling out detailed sector-by-sector production targets, the SEDP focused on
development outcomes such as poverty reduction and other Vietnam Development
Goals. Empirical evidence and a broad consultation process were used to identify the
policies best suited to attaining those development outcomes. Efforts were also made
to cost these policies and to align resources towards their attainment. The reform
agenda in the SEDP was structured around four main pillars: fostering business
development, ensuring social inclusion, managing natural resources, and
strengthening governance. A set of indicators was developed to monitor progress in
implementation.
41.    Other important policy developments have influenced this reform agenda and
are bound to accelerate the pace of change in the coming years. The year 2004 saw
the coming into effect of the new Budget Law, which makes the National Assembly
and People's Councils at all levels responsible for resource appropriations. In 2006, a
new anti-corruption law was passed, with the emphasis shifting from punitive
measures to increased transparency and the strengthening of the systems through
which the government operates. In 2007, Vietnam acceded to the WTO.
42.      The Government of Vietnam (GOV) sets clear goals for higher education in its
"SEDP 2006-2010".12 The SEDP aims for an overall quantitative goal of "increasing
enrollment in universities and colleges by 10 percent annually, to reach a level of 200
students over 10,000 population by 2010" and an overall qualitative goal of
"approaching the advanced education standards of the region and the world,"
specifically inter alia by: renovating curricula and teaching methods; developing
systems that increase study opportunities through transfers; renovating financial
mechanisms and policies to make institutions more pro-active and responsible for
finance, staff and organization; renovating management with stronger
decentralization, and clearer responsibilities and authorities for different entities;
implementing quality assurance and accreditation schemes, gradually applying
standards and criteria used by developed countries and joining international
educational quality accreditation systems; encouraging the establishment of private
institutions, including high-quality, accredited and 100 percent foreign-invested
institutions in science, technology, and economic management; and encouraging

43.      The GOV elaborates on its goals for higher education in its "Higher
Education Reform Agenda" (HERA).13 HERA develops forward-looking strategy for
the development of higher education and research. The main objectives of the
strategy are: (i) a dramatic increase in capacity to allow an increase of the
participation rate in higher education (or tertiary) institutions, which implies huge
investments in infrastructure and in training of new lecturers and faculty; (ii)
simultaneous increase in quality and/or efficiency of the system;14 (iii) the
introduction or reinforcement of research in universities -- in order to better train
future new teachers, to enrich and upgrade present teachers' teaching and to upgrade
the quality level and international visibility of Vietnamese universities; and (iv) to
improve the governance of the higher education and research system at both national
and regional levels, as well as of universities. The latter implies, in particular, giving
greater autonomy to individual institutions and introducing measures in order to
create a climate of competition between and within institutions that promotes
improvement. In HERA, the GOV has set the following targets for the higher
education sector: (i) revenue from science and technology activities increased to 15
percent of total university revenue by 2010, and to 25 percent by 2020; (ii) proportion
of university teaching staff with masters' level degree increased to 40 percent by
2010, and to 60 percent by 2020; (iii) proportion of university teaching staff with
doctoral level degree increased to 11 percent by 2010, and to 25 percent by 2020; and
(iv) ratio of university students to teaching staff reduced to 26:1 by 2020.
Higher education reform: cost

44.     The Government's HERA is backed by an ambitious MOET plan to cover the
additional costs over the 15-year period 2006-2020. The MOET estimates these
additional costs at US$ 20 billion over 15 years, with the largest share for HEI
infrastructure and smaller shares to training program development, staff development
and student financial assistance.

45.     HERA's additional costs are to be financed from a combination of public
funds, private funds and ODA funds. The MOET plan is for half of the additional
costs to be met from private sources, with the other half to be met from a combination
of the State's own funds and ODA resources. The 2006 proposal for raising these
funds (see following paragraphs) makes a major contribution to this plan but still falls
short of the total required.

46.     The State budget for higher education is expected to increase as a proportion
of the State budget for education. The MOET is proposing to increase the proportion
to 11 percent over the period of HEDPP implementation.16 Over the same period, the
proportion allocated to basic education would decline in light of the decrease in the
school-age population. For the five-year period 2008-2012, the increase in the State
budget allocated to higher education would provide some VND 40 trillion above the
2005 baseline level.
47.     Vietnam's total spending on higher education, a sum of both private and
public resources, is low as percentage of GDP. In 2009 Vietnam spent 11.7 percent
of total education state budget (about 0.66 percent of total GDP) on higher education.
Like many other lower-middle income countries, the relatively low percentage of
GDP devoted to higher education in Vietnam mostly reflect its low coverage and low
quality of tertiary education.

48.     The MOET has proposed granting HEIs greater flexibility to set student
tuition fees. This policy is expected to result in an increase in HEIs' revenue derived
from tuition fees, from 34 percent of the combined State budget and fees revenue in
2006 to 45 percent in 2012. For the five-year period 2008-2012, the increase in the
budget allocated to higher education would provide some VND 55 trillion above the
2005 baseline level.

49.    The Government's `socialization" policy in education has made a significant
increase of investment for higher education. In the last ten years, 46 new universities
and 30 colleges have been established by other than state budget. The total
contribution to higher education development is about U$$100 million, let aside
revenue from tuition fees. The establishment of these new institutions have created
opportunities for hundred thousand young people to have access to higher education
and mobilized financial increase to higher education sub-sector.
50.     The Government has plans to raise major ODA financing for the development
of the higher education sub-sector. The World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) currently have proposals to provide about US$1.0 billion specifically to
Vietnam's higher education sub-sector. While the present programmatic operation
will provide budget support, the other investment operations support specific elements
of the Government's HERA strategy. The New Model University Project (NMUP17)
aims to develop an autonomous research-based university to demonstrate a new
policy framework on governance, financing, and quality in Vietnam's higher
education system. The two operations in the pipeline for FY 2012; i.e. Private Higher
Education Lending Facility and Science and Technology and Innovation will provide
further support to Vietnam's higher education sub-sector. Other ODA contributions
to the HERA strategy come from bilateral sources, including assistance directly to
certain HEIs and various scholarship programs that enable HEI faculty to complete
their doctoral studies in overseas universities.

World Bank assessment

51.     HERA outlines ambitious targets for the higher education sector. By 2020,
Vietnam aims to increase the coverage of higher education to 35 percent gross
enrolment rate of the 18-24 years old and is expecting that 40 percent of the
enrolment will be provided by private higher education institutions. Through HERA,
the Government shows its commitment to improving the higher education system in a
rapidly changing economic and social environment. It is strategic and comprehensive,
with major emphasis on key operational reforms that the World Bank supports,
namely: (i) improving the quality of teaching and research, with a view to integration
into the increasingly global economy; (ii) extending HEI autonomy, especially in
academic and administrative matters, with a view to improving responsiveness to the
needs of beneficiaries; and (iii) increasing private sector investment, vital in the fiscal
sustainability of an expanding sector. The Government's main challenge is to
operationalize these strategic goals by addressing broad governance issues (e.g. legal
and financial frameworks) while promoting local, HEI-level modernization. This
requires a shift in responsibilities between the central authorities and individual HEIs,
with the MOET taking on a "stewardship" role in broad sector orientation, public
financing (especially with a view to ensuring equitable access to higher education),
and monitoring results for public accountability.
52.      The governance reforms supported by HERA fit squarely within international
best practices in governance reforms. In particular, an increasing number of countries
are now relying on the private sector to support further expansion of higher education,
while at the same time supporting increasing institutional autonomy of public
institutions. In fact, with about 38 percent of its enrollment provided by the private
sector East Asia is second only to the Latin America region in the importance of
private higher education.18 The 40 percent target included in the HERA agenda would
raise the country to the regional average. At the same time, several OECD countries
and East Asian upper and middle-income countries (in particular Japan, Singapore,
Hong Kong SAR, China and China) have greatly increased the institutional autonomy
of many of their public institutions in both substantive and procedural areas over these

last years.19 So, increasing autonomy would better align Vietnam to the region. It is
expected that private higher institutions can not only provide a quicker and cheaper
way of expanding coverage but also offer fields in high request from the labor market,
provide innovative management and entrepreneurial models and even take the lead in
innovative fields and fashion innovative partnerships with the business world. On the
other hand, higher autonomy has the potential to lead to a higher match with labor
market needs through flexibility and an increased potential role of external
stakeholders and, even, to higher innovation potential in combination with
competition. In both cases, international experience20 also shows the importance of
setting well working accountability mechanisms, including appropriate financial
mechanisms, quality assurance, information systems, management structures which
involve external stakeholders and incentives to competition among institutions. In
fact, all countries in the region already have some form of quality assurance, often led
by independent bodies (examples are Hong Kong SAR, China; Korea; Malaysia; and
Indonesia). Vietnam is behind in setting independently led quality assurance.
53.     HERA assumes that the total government spending for education will reach 20
percent by 2010 and stay at least at that level thereafter. The government budget for
scientific research to be conducted by higher education institutions will also reach 1.5
percent of the budget by 2015. In line with regional practice21, the principle of cost
sharing between the state and the students and families continues to underlie the
HERA targets. Tuition fees are expected to grow to cover HEIs' recurrent spending,
while public spending will focus on capital and research projects which are to be
awarded using competitive processes. The aims are to make the sector financing
more transparent and increase the accountability of the higher education institutions,
through financial audits and the publication of those audits.
54.     The government financing strategy for HERA relies heavily on overseas
development assistance (about 20 percent). In the last decade, due to "i mi"
policy to a more market economy, the education market in Vietnam provides a wide
range of opportunities for foreign investment and partnerships. The government has
encouraged foreign educational entities to become involved in the education and
training sector, especially in the development of new disciplines, such as information
technology and environmental science, and other scientific fields that are not yet
widely available in Vietnam.
55.      A segment of higher education that is growing quickly within Vietnam is the
establishment of foreign education programs run either entirely by foreign
universities or through cooperation between foreign and Vietnamese institutions. The
sector received a boost with the enactment of Decree No. 06/2000/ND-CP, dated
March 6, 2000, which provided incentives for foreign investment in several areas,
including education and training. Existing joint ventures include collaborative
projects, staff/student exchanges, offshore provision of courses and services, aid
projects involving university upgrade programmes and many other interrelated
activities including the granting of joint degrees. A new regulation on foreign
investment in education is being drafted, with full consultation from in-country

   Recent data from Mongolia, Indonesia and China show that tuition fees represent between 30 and
50% of overall income for public higher education institutions.

international community including the WB, favoring to attract more and more
investment to Vietnam by reducing tax, land use for education purposes, etc.
56.     It is obvious that Vietnam is investing heavily in its education system.
Presently its educational infrastructure is not sufficient to accommodate its ambitious
goals, and it is looking for foreign partners to develop a new higher education system.
The Government's market-friendly policies in education have mobilized increasing
amounts of ODA financing for the higher education sector over the years. For
instance, the trends go from US$31 million in 1998 to US$35.4 million in 2000, to
US$86.2 million in 2005 and to US$145.9 million in 2009. In addition, the existing
five foreign-owned institutions (four colleges and one university) with a total
investment of about US$70 million are also contributing to increased investment for
higher education development.22
57.     Although Vietnam remains a "prime destination" for foreign direct investment
(FDI)23, the government should be more practical and less ambitious in setting its
targets to avoid the risk of not fulfilling them or over dependence on external sources.
An alternative strategy, which looks quite feasible at this point, is to rely on a higher
share of the State budget for the financing of the HERA. In fact, Vietnam has already
surpassed its goal of a tertiary priority ratio of 11 percent over the HERA time period
to achieve a ratio of about 12 percent in 2009. And there are indications that this ratio
will continue growing as Vietnam performance continues to improve in primary and
secondary education and the country seeks to align itself a bit more with international
standards. Simulation analyses undertaken by the World Bank team have shown that a
gradual increase in the tertiary priority ratio to 14 percent over the HERA period
would half the needs for ODA (from the current estimate US$ 4 billion to about US$
2 billion) and, if we do consider that only the WB and ADB are already covering
about US$ 1 billion and ODA trends are increasing quite fast, filling the remaining
gap seems achievable.
58.     The Bank appreciates the body of measures that the Government proposes for
HEDPP. The HEDPP policy matrix in particular provides HEIs with greater
autonomy in defining their academic programs, in managing their human resources
(including its teaching and research faculty) and in taking important budgetary
decisions. It also moves the higher education sector further along the path of
transparency and accountability, with respect to both the use of public and private
funds and to the quality of its performance in delivering teaching and research
services.
59.     At the same time, the Bank recognizes risks in the HERA strategy. The
experience of policy development in Vietnam has revealed economic and institutional
constraints inherent in the system that hinder the pace and directions of the reform.
MOET has not yet developed a "master plan" ­ setting out multi-tiered structure of
the higher education sub-sector, and functions of key bodies within HEIs
differentiated by tier ­ that would orient the various elements in the strategy package.
There is some "categorization" of universities within the HEDPO1 measures (e.g.
"key universities" given greater autonomy in managing human resources), but the full
"master plan" development will not be ready until HEDPO3.

60.     Some measures may have unintended effects. Raising the standards that new
private investors have to meet to enter the higher education market are intended to
improve quality; overly restrictive standards may however constrain investment to the
point where the Government's targets for quantitative expansion are not met.
Likewise, the mechanism for allocating professorships may, depending on its design,
increase the risk of corruption, which in itself is likely to undermine the reform
process. Finally, the continuous application of the cost sharing policies between state
and students with a rising share of tuition fees, while instrumental to the expansion of
the system, may have unintended negative consequences on the equity of access if not
adequately mitigated by effective student loans and scholarships policies.
61.      The measures presented for HEDPO1-3 indicate on the part of the
Government an "incremental/gradualist approach" to reform rather than a radical
"paradigm shift". While the Government has a clear sense of its development goals
for higher education and a solid knowledge of the steps required to achieve the goals,
the Government officials responsible for putting in place each of these steps often
display risk-averse behaviors. This reflects both a decision-making process at the
highest levels that relies on extensive consensus building across a range of political
stakeholders rather than regular electoral mandates and an incentive framework that
rewards bureaucratic caution and conservatism. This approach is evident for example
in the move towards HEI autonomy: various measures confer small increases in
autonomy in the areas of planning/budgeting and human resource management, rather
than introduce a fully-fledged reform where transfer of authority from the central
authorities to individual public HEIs is linked to a funding formula that limits public
liability and reporting arrangements that promote accountability for results.
62.     Given however the high degree of effective autonomy conferred on private
HEIs and the need to move up the value-added ladder, the Government may be
encouraged by emerging competition and the need to address labor market needs to
accelerate the implementation of the roadmap to granting greater autonomy ­ in
academic, managerial and financial matters ­ to its public HEIs. If public HEIs are
forced to compete with private entrants, they will have to either adjust or lose ground.
This competition logic has been successfully used as a driver of reform in other areas
by the government. SOE reform has relied on private sector entry (and a hard budget
constraint) to encourage reforms. Many SOEs are now run like private enterprises.
Financial sector reforms used WTO accession as the push to modernize the state-
owned commercial banks, by providing a clear calendar for the entry of much
stronger competitors. Moreover, as labor costs increase, Vietnam will need to move
up the value added ladder in its exports; the most advanced regions have a deliberate
policy to do just that by focusing for example on the development of high-tech parks.
The fact that enterprises settling in those parks face difficulties in recruiting the
skilled personnel they need provides incentives for HEIs to produce graduates in the
disciplines in high demand (and will allow them to charge fees accordingly). This
combination of competition among HEIs and a move up to the value added ladder
should do much to mitigate the risks identified above. World Bank assesses HERA
positively and agreed in principle to provide a series of three programmatic
operations to support the GOV's implementation of HERA. The first operation
HEDPO1 was approved by the Board in June 2009 with an amount of US$50 million
in IDA terms and was closed on time at December 31, 2009 with full disbursement.



                                          23
Consultations and Participation

63.     In the last decade in Vietnam there has been a trend towards new modes of
political participation for citizens to provide feedback to government policies and
regulations or to provide new methods for holding public officials to account.
Vietnam has embraced this direction through various new administrative modes of
participation and using different means for this purpose; such as, through media,
internet, consultation workshop with specific groups of audience, etc. The process has
been welcome by public and become popular means of public consultation and
participation. It is however, argued here that these new modes also reflect both a
decision-making process at the highest levels that relies on extensive consensus
building across a range of political stakeholders rather than regular electoral mandate
and an incentive framework that rewards bureaucratic caution and conservatism. This
approach somehow slowdown the process.
64.     The operation supports the Government's own Higher Education Reform
Agenda 2006-2020 in a range of areas: access, quality, equity and efficiency. The
development of the reform agenda involved an extensive consultation process with
numerous stakeholder groups. Broad consultation process was used to identify the
policies best suited to attaining those development outcomes. Efforts were also made
to cost these policies and to align resources towards their attainment. Issued as a
Prime Ministerial decree, the reform agenda enjoys strong Government ownership
The Bank's support, through this operation, reflects the results of an on-going and
productive relationship with the Government in the education sector generally and in
the higher education sub-sector in particular.
65.    In working with the government on this operation, to address an issue raised
during concept note review, a study on "Equity and Access to Tertiary Education: The
case of Vietnam" was commissioned, the findings and recommendations have been
presented to the Government during preparation mission as part of the consultation
process.
IV.        BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY
Link to the Country Partnership Strategy

66.      The World Bank's five-year Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)24 supports
the GOV's "Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010." Under CPS
Pillar I, which aims to assist GOV in its transition to a market economy, the World
Bank's program will help to "develop a higher education system that produces
graduates better suited to the new economy's needs," measured by changes in the
proportion of students finding employment within six months of graduation by field
of study. The HEDPO1-3 contribute directly to this objective by improving the
quality of higher education in ways that enable central government and universities to:
(i) produce graduates with the knowledge and skills that meet labor market demands,
and (ii) support the national innovation system through relevant basic and applied
research. The first operation (HEDPO1) submitted to the Board in June 2009 charts
the second and the third cycle of HEDPO2-3. The CPS allocates US$50 million to
each of the HEDPP.

67.     The World Bank can bring its international experience in the higher
education sector to help Vietnam implement its HERA program. The World Bank has
in-depth experience across many higher education projects in the design and
implementation of competitive funding, institutional autonomy and performance-
based financing to drive improved standards in research and teaching and
improvements in the relevance of higher education, all of which are important
objectives set out in HERA.
68.     Higher education contributes to economic development. Building a higher
education system in Vietnam that is innovative, responsive to the demands of the
market and of high quality is essential to the economic growth and development of
Vietnam. GOV has requested the World Bank to provide continued support for
Vietnam's higher education agenda, recognizing the success of past collaboration in
the sector. This is all the more critical at a time when Vietnam, having recently
acceded to membership of the WTO, is looking to develop a skilled population, with a
strong knowledge base, that will position the country well for economic expansion
and integration into the global economy.
69.      Higher education contributes to social development and equity. Economic
development is not the only driver of investment in higher levels of education.
Higher education institutions also satisfy a growing demand from students for a
sophisticated and rewarding education and provide a forum in which societies can
examine their culture and values, analyze problems and identify appropriate solutions.
The higher education system must provide equal education opportunities, regardless
of students' gender, ethnicity, family income or other characteristics. This push for
equity is of course built on strong pre-higher education systems that provide rich
educational opportunities for the entire population.
70.     The World Bank looks at economic and social development in a
comprehensive way. The World Bank can therefore work with GOV on a higher
education strategy that is consistent with, and in support of, Vietnam's overall
development strategy.
Collaboration with the IMF and other donors

71.     The implementation of Vietnam's ambitious reform agenda was initially
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well, through a Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) credit approved at the same time as Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) 1. The IMF has not had a lending arrangement in
Vietnam since the expiry of its PRGF in April 2004. However, the IMF remains fully
committed to continuing an effective partnership with the government of Vietnam to
support the implementation of the Socio-Economic Development Plan. The IMF
maintains a regular policy dialogue with the Government through Article IV
consultations, interim staff visits, and its resident representative office in Hanoi, and
seeks to build capacity through training activities in Vietnam and abroad. It
supplements this dialogue with technical assistance in areas of core Fund expertise,
including tax policy and administration, budget management, monetary and financial
sector policy, and macroeconomic statistics. The IMF continues to cooperate closely
with the World Bank in Vietnam, and to contribute actively to the broader dialogue
between the Government and its development partners.



                                           25
72.      The International Finance Corporation, through Vietnam Business Forum
secretariat cooperates closely with the World Bank in Vietnam and contributes
actively in the area of policy development, particularly in foreign investment policy
and strategies.
73.      Meanwhile, the nineths PRSC operations in Vietnam approved to date have
been co-financed by numerous bilateral and multilateral agencies, either through
grants or through parallel lending. More importantly, the process saw a transition in
the role of co-financiers from providers of finance to partners substantially engaged in
the preparation of the operations and conduct of the policy dialogue. This dialogue is
organized by policy areas, in which donors engage selectively, based on their interests
and technical capacity on the ground. The number of donors participating in this
process has increased from four in PRSC 1 to 13 donors for preparation of PRSC 8, of
which 11 are co-financing and similar number for PRSC 9 which was approved by the
Board in June 2010.
Relationship to other Bank operations

74.      The series of operations is designed explicitly to complement and build on
both the Poverty Reduction Support Credits and ongoing investment operations. It
bridges the gap between the macro-reform agenda of the PRSC series and the micro-
operational foundations of ongoing investment operations; it supports a set of mid-
level policy and institutional actions that institutionalize a programmatic reform
agenda for improved delivery of higher education services. Measures related to
education have featured throughout the PRSC series, with a focus in the most recent
operations on formulating an Education Development Strategy to 2020 which
addresses issues of equity of learning outcomes. PRSC-8, for instance, included
policy measures related to continued systematic and comprehensive reform,
standardization and modernization of education; improved quality of human resource
training; and enhanced forms of university education. The strategy also reflects a
concern to ensure that education opportunities are distributed equitably across the
youth in a society where disadvantages are characterized by poverty, geographic
remoteness and ethnic minority status.
75.      HEDPO1-3, along with the Second Higher Education Project 25 and the New
Model University Project,26 is designed to support the Government's implementation
of its Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010, and its HERA, by increasing the
quality of teaching and research in universities, in ways that improve the
employability of graduates and the relevance of research. From HEDPO2 onwards,
HEP2 will take the policy development from the definition of the problem, through
the collection and analysis of information, to the development and discussion of
policy options; HEDPO1-3 will cover the promulgation and execution of policy
measures; NMUP will then provide for the demonstration of these policy measures in

25
   HEP2, financed by a US$ 59.4 million IDA Credit and a US$ 4.8 million PHRD Co-financing Grant,
runs from FY08 through FY12 and has three components: (i) capacity building in higher education
policy development; (ii) capacity building for university teaching and research primarily through a
competitive grants scheme; and (iii) project management and monitoring/evaluation.
26
   NMUP was approved by the World Bank in June 2010, with a US$180 million IDA Credit The
project, supporting the establishment and development of the "new-model university" ­ in Binh Duong
City­ has four components: (i) policy and regulatory framework; (ii) academic and research
development; (iii) campus and facilities development; and (iv) project management and
monitoring/evaluation.

                                                26
specific institutional settings. HEDPO1-3 consists of a series of key policy measures,
each set financed by a separate operation, linked to the Government's higher
education reform strategy. The future Private Higher Education Loan Fund Facility
and Science and Technology Innovation will further strengthen policy development
and implementation in areas related to quality and innovation.
76.     The set of higher education operations (HEDPO1-3, HEP2 and NMUP)
complement the Bank's support for access to, and quality of, primary education. In
this way, the Bank's Vietnam education portfolio contributes both to the
Government's growth strategy (CPS Pillar I) and its equity strategy (CPS Pillar II).
More generally, equity issues in the education sector will continue to be a major focus
of the World Bank's support for basic education, with an emphasis on achieving an
equitable distribution of quality education outcomes across the school-age population
in order to ensure a greater proportion of young people from disadvantaged
backgrounds complete basic education and are therefore able to take up post-basic
education opportunities.
Lessons learned

77.      The World Bank has contributed to education in Vietnam. The World Bank's
main policy successes in the Vietnam education sector have involved working
through lending operations to pilot the establishment of minimum standards (e.g.
minimum primary school input norms for infrastructure, teacher qualifications and
textbooks, primary teacher professional standards, higher education institution
"charter" standards), which are in some cases then linked to national budget
allocations. These innovations have been well received by Government and are now
being taken to scale (either geographically and/or up through higher levels of the
system). That said, the decentralized nature of various operations has challenged the
sector's ability to manage those operations efficiently, whether using the World
Bank's procurement and financial management procedures or the Government's own
systems. The move towards greater reliance on Government's own systems requires
support for their on-going strengthening, in order to meet generally accepted fiduciary
standards.
78.       The HEDPO1-3 operations in particular build on the experience gained
during the implementation of the first IDA-financed Vietnam Higher Education
Project (HEP1). HEP1 made a contribution to higher education reform in three ways.
First, a competitive grants scheme increased HEIs' effective autonomy, by providing
discretionary revenue that enabled them to engage in local strategic planning
processes. Second, there is now greater public accountability both at institutional and
central administrative levels: (i) participating HEIs were required to disclose key
survey data; (ii) the central administration established and institutionalized national
standards for quality assurance; and (iii) quality assurance evaluations ­ a
combination of self-evaluation and external evaluation ­ were carried out in
universities on a voluntary pilot basis. Third, there is also a more systematic and
unified view amongst ministries of the importance of higher education policy
development; indeed, policy design activities carried out under HEP1, including
institutionalization of quality assurance and increased autonomy, underpin HERA's
policy content. HEP1 contribution to policy development was nevertheless
constrained by the project's organizational structure, with the project coordination
unit often unable to promote "ownership" of specific policy activities within the

                                          27
Ministry of Education and Training core business units (e.g., in strengthening the
central Higher Education Management and Policy Information System [HEMPIS]);
the Second Higher Education Project design aims to overcome this weakness by
rendering systematic the relatively unsystematic achievements of HEP1.

Impacts of the policy measures adopted under the HEDPO1

79.     It is difficult to overstate the seriousness of the challenges confronting
Vietnam's higher education. The government recognized that without fundamental
reform to the higher education system Vietnam will fail to achieve its enormous
potential. The economic development of East and Southeast Asia reveals the close
relationship between development and higher education. Although each of the most
prosperous countries in the region--South Korea and Taiwan, China the city states,
and more recently China--have followed unique development paths, their single-
minded pursuit of excellence in higher education and science is common theme in
their success.
80.      The French colonial regime that ruled Vietnam from the latter half of the
nineteenth century until 1945 invested very little in tertiary education, even in
comparison with other colonial powers. As a result, Vietnam missed the wave of
institutional innovation in higher education that swept across much of Asia during the
early 20th century, when many HEIs become region's leading institutions were
established. Thus, Vietnam had very weak institutional foundations to building
quality institutions of higher learning.
81.     Since 1986 when Vietnam embarked on "doi moi", its process of economic
reform and liberalization, the pace of reform in higher education has been glacial. In
2005, the government adopted the policy statement Resolution 14/2005/NQ-CP on the
"comprehensive renovation of higher education" and 2006 the Higher Education
Reform Agenda (HERA) by 2020 was adopted. It is a turning point, calling for
governance reforms, including greater institutional autonomy and more merit-based
selection mechanisms. While it is difficult to gauge Resolution 14's impact on the
policymaking process, but the pace of change remains slow.
82.      Under HEDPO1 eleven (11) policy measures have been adopted in the themes
of governance, financing, quality improvement, quality assurance and financial
reporting/audit. All the measures have been selected on the basis of a number of
principles: (i) that the measures be on the critical path to the achievement of key
reform objectives throughout HEDPO1-3 within the Government's HERA agenda;
(ii) that the measures be part of a strategy that has strong Government ownership; (iii)
that the implementation of the measures rely on the Government's own systems and
procedures; (iv) that the achievement of the measures be transparent and predictable;
and (v) that the evaluation of the measures use an agreed framework that fits with the
Government's own monitoring processes, cycles and timelines.
83.    The MOET has conducted an implementation review. The assessment
included ninety universities and one hundred colleges and ended by a national
workshop during the preparation mission of the HEDPO2 in March 2010. The
findings show that the policy measures have had overall positive impacts on the
development of the HE sector, providing legal basis for HEIs to be more proactive
and more accountable in carrying out their academic, financial and human resource

                                          28
duties. The adopted policy measures have resulted in a significant transfer of decision
making authority to HEIs from the central ministry. The central ministry will, for
example, focus on "implementation of the development strategy", "development of
quality assurance and accreditation system", "monitoring and inspection" and plays
its "supervision" roles.
84.     However, there remain some issues related to the ambiguity of the content,
feasibility for implementation, comprehensiveness and consistency between different
regulations for higher education. The ambiguities, contradictions and omissions may
result in confusion during implementation.           The possibility of successfully
implementing large-scale restructuring, as Berkhout and Wielemans (1999) argue, is
dimmed in the absence of the micro-details needed for proper reflection and
adjustment. They point out that it is naïve for central policy makers to believe that a
top-down policy development process without a solid supporting foundation would be
faithfully implemented at institutional levels. An example of ambiguity of the content
is the decision 64/2008/Q-BGDT dated November 28, 2008 on working
conditions for HEIs teaching and research staff. The decision was adopted with a view
to enhance HEIs leadership's autonomy in the management of its human resources.
However, the decision put emphasis on the number of working/teaching hours (input
based), but the expected results or ouputs/outcomes of teaching or research activities
were not defined. This led to some confusion or bias in implementation at institutional
levels.
85.     The decision 380/Q-TTg dated March 24, 2009 by the prime Minister on
"organization and operation of the Vietnam-German University" (one of the four new
model universities) is another example of somewhat inconsistent policies in
delegating decision-making to university. While allowing the institution to enjoy high
autonomy and special operational mechanisms beyond current practice in financial
management, including setting its own tuition fees and salary for staff based on
competencies and professional performance, the university is still requested to submit
its financing proposal for approval, weakening incentives to innovate and be
accountable.
86.      On the other hand, as Vietnam seeks to infuse its higher education with greater
autonomy and to reduce central control, HEIs will also need to have the capacity both
to decide their own goals and programs and to determine how their goals and
programs will be pursued. Critical for the nascent institutional autonomy will be
"academic freedom, individual academic autonomy, institutional sovereignty and
institutional self-determination" (Hayden and Lam 2007:84). Vietnam's higher
education system is very much in early stage of development. The tendency of
"waiting instruction from the top" still exists. Many universities are still looking for
specific guidance for implementation from the centre. An example is the decision
62/QD-BGDDT dated November 25, 2008 on the admission to part-time programs
with a view to providing an alternative but equivalent pathway to national higher
education qualifications. The decision allows HEIs to set their own admission
standards while being accountable for their academic quality. The universities,
however, still request specific instructions on examination organization, test score,
admission fees, etc. In many ways, some universities are still passive in performing
their roles in the new legal environment.
87.    At the same time, there is clearly a constraining effect of the limited resources
for capacity building and enormous pressure associated with redefining the operation

                                          29
of governance infrastructure and developing functional accountability relationship.
The government's incremental approach in implementing its higher education reform
may prove virtuous. However, in a world changing at an extremely rapid pace,
successful international integration requires both efficiency and speed. The ability to
respond rapidly has become a significant advantage in business. Most important of all
is a strategic vision for immediate and long-term objectives, direction, demand,
capacity relevant to development trends, guiding ideology, and a general action map;
this constitutes a philosophy for development. Vietnam has ambitious objectives, but
without a bold, systematic and comprehensive vision, as well as processes for
implementation of its reform, progress may be much less substantial and systematic
than expected.
88.     Any reform takes time, along with HEP2 and NMUP, the HEDPO1-3 are
designed to complement each other in supporting the Government to implement
effectively and successfully its SEDP 2006-2010 and its HERA.
Analytical underpinnings

89.      As shown in the recent study, Higher Education and Skills for Growth
completed in 2008), the demand for skills has been increasing significantly in
Vietnam, due to a combination of inter-industry employment changes, capital
accumulation and some evidence which is consistent with skills-biased technical
change, but the higher education system may not have yet the tools to adapt to the
growing and changing needs of the dynamic economy Employment opportunities for
tertiary graduates now exist in most sectors. Higher education graduates are also
shown to contribute positively to firm productivity. On the one hand, this evidence
provides a strong justification for further expansion and improvement of higher
education in the country. On the other hand, increasing evidence of skills bottlenecks,
combined with broad institutional and financing constraints, suggests that the higher
education system may not have yet the tools to adapt to the growing and changing
needs of the dynamic economy. Improving higher education responsiveness will
require a set of reforms that create a more flexible and diverse system, with, among
other characteristics, more private sector participation, higher autonomy at the HEI
level and greater emphasis on research with the potential development of centers of
excellence. The study proposes that the GOV creates supporting governance and
financing frameworks, with new roles for the public and private sector, by pursuing a
reform agenda in stages. The initial stages would aim at strengthening the framework
for a competitive higher education system, while helping universities improve the
relevance of decision making to the emerging social and economic needs. A later
stage would then focus on further investments in building a first class higher
education system.
90.      A case study on "Equity and Access to Tertiary Education in Vietnam" has
also been conducted. The objectives of this case study are to document the
significance and consequences of disparities in tertiary education opportunities, and to
investigate the results and lessons of efforts to expand access to tertiary education and
improve the chances of success for under-privileged youths (with particular emphasis
on the effects of the fee structure as well as student loans and scholarships schemes).
The study finds that the comprehensive package of measures introduced by the
government has had some success in reducing disparities. It however also still
documents important gaps and offers concrete recommendations on how to address
them ­ with focus on the amount, coverage and allocation of the student aid and loan

                                           30
schemes. A detailed list of analytical outputs produced by the World Bank and
others, with a summary of the findings, is presented in Annex 4 (list of analytical
outputs).
91.     Finally, further assessments and studies have also been undertaken by the
Government financed by the technical assistance component of the current higher
education project. Studies and/or assessments have being commissioned to support
HEDPO2 and HEDPO3 in the areas of governance (development of the master plan,
higher education situation analysis), financing (policy development and capacity
building for financing), quality improvement (reform of the entrance examination)
and quality assurance (analysis of current quality culture and accreditation of Vietnam
higher education).
V.        THE PROPOSED OPERATION
Operation description

92.      The proposed operation is the second in a programmatic series of three
single-tranche Development Policy Credits (DPCs) to support the sustained
implementation of selected elements of the Government's reform agenda. Along with
the Second Higher Education Project and the proposed New Model University
Project, it is designed to support the Government's implementation of its "Socio-
Economic Development Plan 2006-2010" and its "Higher Education Reform
Agenda". In particular, HEDPO2 aims to continue support the government effort's in
strengthening governance, rationalizing the financing system, improving the quality
of teaching and research, improving accountability for performance, and enhancing
transparency in financial management within the higher education sector that have
been started under the HEDPO1. Measures implemented by Government on the basis
of policy analysis and development carried out with technical assistance under grant-
financed component of HEP2.
93.      The policy measures, summarized in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2), are
grouped under the themes of governance, financing, quality improvement, quality
assurance and financial reporting/audit. The measures for the first four of these
themes are drawn from the Government's HERA Strategy. The measures for
financial reporting/audit are designed in response to the Country Fiduciary
Accountability Assessment 2007 ("CFAA 2007") recommendations27 that are relevant
to the higher education sub-sector. All the measures have been selected on the basis
of a number of principles: (i) that the measures be on the critical path to the
achievement of key reform objectives; (ii) that the measures be part of a strategy that
has strong Government ownership; (iii) that the implementation of the measures relies
27
    The CFAA 2007 analyzed the education sector and highlighted four key findings and
recommendations:
 · Improve the comprehensiveness of annual budgets by incorporating all revenues and other fund
    sources;
 · Develop and implement measures to require public, private and semi-public institutions to adopt
    standard PFM practices and provide regular financial and audited annual financial statements, as
    well as public disclosure of budget plans and financial reports;
 · Require institutions that are controlled by provinces, cities or other ministries, to provide financial
    plans and financial audit reports to the relevant sector Ministry to enhance the comprehensiveness
    of sector budgets and sector oversight;
 · Increase transparency by ensuring compliance with requirements for publication of quarterly and
    annual plans, budget allocations, financial reports and audit results.

                                                   31
on the Government's own systems and procedures; (iv) that the achievement of the
measures be transparent and predictable; and (v) that the evaluation of the measures
use an agreed framework that fits with the Government's own monitoring processes,
cycles and timelines.
94.     The policy matrix contains all the "triggers" of HEDPP. These are the policy
actions which are deemed to be more strategic, because they constitute critical steps
on the path of reform and because of their potential impact on development outcomes
over time. These actions were selected during the previous HEDPP operation, and are
reported in the minutes of the negotiations (HEDPO1 in this case). The triggers that
are deemed met become prior actions for the current operation.
95.      In addition to the triggers, additional reform actions are also undertaken by
the government. This broader set of actions, or "benchmarks," does not reflect the
use of conditionality and as such is only reported in the text. Its reporting is intended
to convey the breadth and scope of the reforms being undertaken by the Government
of Vietnam. In most instances the benchmarks are either complementary measures to
the triggers, important to ensure the consistency and comprehensiveness of the
reform, or general regulations which are not necessarily specific to higher education
but important to support the development and implementation of the higher education
specific legislation. The policy areas are discussed below.
Governance
96.      This policy area has two objectives. The first is to increase the quantitative
capacity of the higher education sector. The second is to increase the responsiveness
and efficiency of higher education and research.
97.      The first objective requires a clarification of the regulatory environment for
private higher education providers (both domestic and foreign) and the creation of a
common set of rules for the operation of both public and private HEIs. The second
objective requires the development of new governance arrangements, both for the
higher education system as a whole, as well as for individual HEIs. The ultimate aim
is to develop a "master plan" specifying the role of different types of HEIs and
composed of HEIs operating under different ownership models (public, private and
mixed). The "master plan" will support the development of research in "research
universities" and the integration of research institutes into these universities, as well
as the development of a private higher education sub-sector that includes national and
international providers. The new governance arrangements will alter the respective
roles of MOET and HEIs, in particular in giving more autonomy to HEIs. Indeed,
considering the huge needs to satisfy and the rapid change of the environment, it is of
utmost importance to decentralize all decisions which can best be taken at institutional
level.
98.      The implementation of this strategy implies sustained and in-depth actions on
many fronts, in particular the development of facilities and staff  in quantitative and
qualitative terms. It requires also the amendment of laws and regulations inherited
from a period characterized by another political and higher education environment
and the drafting of entirely new laws and regulations to allow for the changing
objectives and means. Several laws have already been passed as prior actions to the
launch of HEDPP (summarized in the policy matrix).


                                           32
99.      The generic higher education institutions charter is crucial for the success of
the government's policy towards increasing the autonomy, capacity of the higher
education sector and for increasing its responsiveness and efficiency. The aim of the
University Charter is to stipulate the duties and rights of HEIs regarding their three
fundamental missions, education and training, fundamental and applied research and
interaction with society (outreach). The charter defines the rights and duties of
academic, technical and administrative staff, the duties and rights of students, to fix
the governance of the institutions, the composition and roles of the different bodies
involved in managerial, financial and academic decisions. And the charter also
stipulates the control mechanisms of institutions, as well as the settlement of
violations.
100.     The charter is applicable to both public and private universities, academies
and colleges in charge of higher education in Vietnam. One important aim of this
charter is to give more autonomy to HEIs ­ subject to accountability as regulated by
laws and the Charter - in planning, organization of studies and research, financing,
international relationships, organizational structure of the institution (establishment
and dissolution of units) and personnel. Another important point is that the Charter
anticipates a division of responsibilities between different types of HEIs. It is also
important to note that the Charter integrates policy actions conducted under different
headings, for example the accreditation of universities and curricula. A mapping of
higher education institutions has already been undertaken as a basis for the Charter
and "master plan".
101.     The Charter, in line with the objective to increase the autonomy of HEIs, is
giving most of the decision power to two bodies. The University Board, which is
often better called University Council, and the Rector (used as a generic term to
describe the Rector of colleges, President of Universities and Director of Academies).
The University Council or Board is considered the management authority of HEIs,
responsible for passing resolutions on major policies to implement the autonomy and
social duties of the Universities as assigned by the State. It is also responsible for
nominating candidates for Rectors and Vice-Rectors for appointment (for public
universities) or approval (for private universities) by the competent governmental
body. The Rector is directly responsible for managing and leading all the institutions'
activities as stipulated in the State's laws and in the Charter. The composition and
role of University Councils (boards) raise many delicate questions in the Vietnamese
political and higher education environments. Among others, despite the fact that such
a body was already foreseen in the 2003 charter, few institutions have set-up one.
This is why MOET is paying special attention to specifying the composition and
responsibilities of this body. The main aim is to clarify the respective roles of the
Communist party, the Council and the Management of the institutions. It is expected
that participation of the private sector will be allowed in the University Councils to
support stronger linkages between universities and the private sector and therefore
ultimately higher responsiveness to labor market needs.
102.    The University Charter and University Council (one integrated regulation),
which is the governance prior action of HEDPO2, was approved by the Prime
Minister28. In the same time, a general Directives on higher education management


28
     Decision No58/Q-TTg (September 22, 2010)

                                                33
for the 2010-2012 period29 has been approved by the Prime Minister setting the basis
for an acceleration of governance (towards university "self-management" and
independent quality assurance) and financing reforms (tuition fee policies coupled
with fee exemption and student loan policies).
103.    The prior action in the Governance area of HEDPO2 is issuing a regulation
on generic HEI "charter", setting out functions and responsibilities of key bodies
within HEIs, and on functions and responsibilities of university councils, enhancing
HEIs autonomy in governance has been completed. This supported by the two
benchmark; i.e. (i) the higher education mapping and workshops and consultations;
and (ii) the Directives issued by the Prime Minister setting out the basis for
acceleration of governance reform in HE.
 104.   In HEDPO3 measures would include a master plan for the higher education
and research sector of Vietnam was recommended. The elaboration of the Master
Plan with technical assistance from international consulting firm (hired by the HEP2)
is a means to put in place an organization of multi-tiered structure of higher education
and research capable of reaching the ambitious goals of HERA.
 105.    As the Education Law has been revised in December 2009, other related
documents will be developed for implementation. The Government is working on the
draft of the HE Act, a state law that governs the administration of higher education
sector. This document would be considered a trigger for the next operation given its
important position in HE governance.
 106.    The University Charter once is promulgated, it is critical to monitor the
adoption of the charter and how the universities react to it. It is therefore, proposed
that a number of HEIs that have adopted the new charter would be considered a
trigger of the third operation.
Financing

107.     This policy area aims to enhance fiscal transparency, financial sustainability,
efficiency and equity of higher education and to promote greater autonomy and
improve the quality of research universities through changes to the financing régime.
This would be achieved through moving to an enrollment quota mechanism that is
based on clear and transparent criteria (rather than on historical student numbers),
diversifying funding sources while supporting increasing public budget for higher
education with clear allocation criteria, increasing funds made directly available to
poor households and/or differentiating treatment of poor households, and supporting
competitive funding for research.
108.     Following the dissemination of its proposal to restructure education and
training financing, the National Assembly has already approved Resolution No.
35/2009 dated June 19, 2009 with the multiple purpose of developing new
mechanisms to attract and use different sources of funding (public and non-public) to
improve the quantity and quality of education. In relation to higher education, the
resolution provides the basis for increasing public budget for higher education,
attracting family contributions based on capacity and on a cost-sharing principle,
increasing the financial autonomy of HEIs giving them the flexibility to set up fee

29
     Directive No. 296/CT-TTg (February 27, 2010).

                                                 34
levels based on the fee framework approved by the Government, supporting student
loan schemes and clarifying criteria and responsibilities in budgeting and allocation.
109.     The prior actions supported by HEDPO2 build on the Resolution's direction.
The first is the regulation on introducing a criteria-based formula for setting HEIs'
maximum enrollment quotas for the 2010/2011 academic year. The regulation will
contribute to increasing transparency in enrollment and, to the extent that they are
linked, budgetary decisions, while supporting higher quality. The main criteria
include student-faculty ratios, availability of equipment for teaching and research,
training and teaching space for students and program accreditation and the extent to
which HEIs comply with rules on public disclosure of information on teaching
conditions, expected learning outcomes and finance. HEIs also remain free to add
additional specific criteria as needed. The demand side is incorporated into the picture
by also supporting human resource production/development centers providing signals
from the labor market to the HEIs on the number and skill profile required of new
graduates. Specific guidelines are being prepared to help HEIs apply the new criteria.
While the use of an input-based formula is not ideal it represents a significant
advancement towards higher transparency in enrollment and budgetary decisions in
Vietnam in relation to the previous practice (based on negotiations, historical costs
and political connections). Additionally, it can also be seen as a step towards more
quality-enhancing budgeting which could lead the way to performance-based
budgeting, already applied in several countries of the region, in the future. This is all
the more true as the use of this formula encourages the practice of having universities
publishing information on quality related staff and facilities. Publication will also
support accountability and competition. The regulation, which is also the main prior
action of the financing component of HEDPO2, has been approved by the MOET
Minister in February.30
110.     The second prior action supported by HEDPO2 is the decree to regulate the
setting of tuition fees for the 2011-2015 time periods. This document is critical to
allow for further financial diversification in already budget constrained institutions
through a planned increase in tuition fees. At the same time it addresses potential
inequities in access to higher education that the use of tuition fees entails. The
« trick » is in finding the right balance between fee increases and mechanisms to
protect the access of disadvantaged groups. The decree, which is presented as a new
prior action of the financing component of the program, has been approved by the
Prime Minister in May 2010.31 In setting out a unified and systematic approach to
tuition exemption, the decree also marks a considerable improvement compared to the
previous. It shows in the poverty and social impact section that this approach supports
an adequate balance between fee increases and mechanism to protect the poor.
111.    Finally, a new regulation on the financing of higher education research has
been completed and awaiting for approval. Currently higher education research is
financed on both, a per-capita and competitive basis, while, according to the 2000
Science and Technology Law only competitive funding should be used. Through this
new regulation, which replaces some past decisions, the MOET will fully implement
the competitive funding mechanism.

     Decision No. 795/QD-BGDDT (February 27, 2010).
31
     Decree N0. 49/2010/ND-CP (May 14, 2010).

                                               35
112.      In sum, the policy measures included in the Financing area of the HEDPO2
Program are: (i) issuing resolution 35 on reforming education financing (approved);
(ii) issuing a regulation and guidelines on criteria formula for setting HEIs annual
maximum enrolment quotas (regulation approved); (iii) issuing a decree on tuition
fees over the 2011-2015 time period (approved) and (iv) issuing a regulation on
higher education research. The prior actions are (ii) and (iii) and both have already
been achieved.
113.     In HEDPO3, measure would include a new regulation on allocating public
financing to public Higher Education Institutions, including recurrent budget
allocations. This would come as a replacement for the previously agreed trigger "issue
regulation on financing mechanism of national education system, covering public
subsidies, student tuition fees and student financial assistance for higher education".
The rationale is that tuition fees and student loans have already been regulated in
separate legislation, while the allocation of public financing needs reform. Changes to
the allocation of public financing to HEIs is also consistent with the move towards a
criteria-based formula for setting HEIs' maximum enrollment quotas supported under
HEDPO2.
Quality Improvement

114.     The ultimate goal of the reform agenda in HERA is to augment the quality of
higher education. The continuing growth of higher education enrolment puts
tremendous pressures on the quality of teaching, research and public service. Lack of
physical, financial and human resources combined with institutional constraints are
identified as major impediments to quality improvement. Beyond increasing the
quantitatve capacity of the system, some of the policy actions under the governance
and financing part already aim at supporting higher responsiveness, efficiency and
quality. More actions are needed beyond these measures.
115.     In HEDPO1, the government has issued regulations which: (i) govern
different modes of study (part-time and full-time); (ii) introduce advanced under-
graduate programs with imported curricula and training processes; and (iii) give more
autonomy and responsibilities for awarding doctoral degrees to universities.
116.     HEDPO2 includes a far reaching agenda to improve quality through
enhancing flexibility, mobility and competition in the higher education system while
targeting additional resources to some advanced programs. The following actions are
included in the Quality Improvement area of the HEDPO2 Program: (i)
transformation on a pilot basis, to credit-based training (with related workshops)
(completed); (ii) a circular providing equivalency among degrees: (iii) a circular on
the disclosure of output-standards ; and (iv) a regulation on resource allocation to the
advanced under-graduate programs (approved). The first is the prior action for this
component in accordance with initial program design and due to its significance for
the overall quality improvement agenda.
117.    The move to the credit-based training system is already well under way. More
than 43 HEIs are already applying the full/partial credit system. This reform will
increase the efficiency, accountability and quality of study programs and faculties by
allowing students to move among institutions much more easily. In other words,
together with higher entry of private and foreign institutions and the publication of
information on quality related inputs the transition to a credit-based system will

                                          36
support competition among institutions. As a related benchmark, workshops and
reviews to support and train HEIs in the new credit system have been required and
already implemented.
118.    To build further steps towards the development of a national qualification
framework, a MoET/MOLISA Joint Circular on recognition of prior learning and
building pathways between professional technical education and higher education has
also been recently completed. This is an urgent priority given the high importance of
TVET but also its relative isolation in the country education system, and the need to
develop multiple skill development pathways. The drafted content was consulted and
agreed by all stakeholdres. The joint circular is expected to be approved in early
September 2010.
119.    To further advance on quality improvement through competition and
accountability, a circular on the disclosure of output-standards by HEIs has been
adopted32. This regulation provides the administrative framework for the public
disclosure of the outputs (knowledge, skills, competencies and attitudes) that
graduates should achieve at graduation, as determined by each university, providing
students with additional elements to make an informed enrollment decision.
120.    Finally, a joint-circular on financial norms for advanced study programs33 has
been approved with the objective of increasing funds for and improve the flexibility
of these study programs, with the expectation that this would enhance their quality
and encourage their attendance and therefore help create more qualified HEI
teaching/research staff.
121.     Two actions initially included in the design of the second operation (although
not as triggers) have been excluded at this stage from the program. The first is the
regulation on alternative delivery methodologies. The recent development of
alternative delivery channels unleashes the potential for Vietnam to move from elite
to mass higher education, but poses a challenge of ensuring quality of delivery. It is
therefore important for the country to start developing an adequate regulatory and
quality-assurance framework. However, given the still limited expansion of these
alternative channels (much more limited still than in other countries of the region), the
country rather decided to put emphasis on other measures including the
MOET/Ministry of Labor, Invalid and Social Affairs Joint Circular on recognition of
prior learning and building pathways between professional technical education and
higher education, with the expectation that this circular would also provide a basis for
developing equivalencies between formal and non-formal higher education later on.
122.      The second action is the establishment of a common examination for
secondary and higher education. Given the on-going expansion of enrollments in
higher education, a heavy emphasis has been placed on quality at entry to HEIs. The
government plans to combine the high school graduation examination and the
admission examination to HEI into one to reduce the costs and administration burden
at all levels, while ensuring the fairness and quality of the admission process. A draft
proposal for reforming the examination system is being widely disseminated to raise
awareness and seek public opinion on the matter but there are bottlenecks. The
reform of the admission system entails complex technical and political challenges and

32
     Regulation No. 2196/BGDT-GHH dated April 22, 2010
33
     Joint-circular No. 220/2009/TTLT-BTC-BGDT dated November 20, 2009

                                              37
requires consensus building for all stakeholders. The key constraints are the capacity
to design high quality, objective and fair tests and the sharing of responsibilities in
examination and admission between MOET and HEIs. The changes contemplated in
the university admission system, while commendable, requires a clear road map for
implementation, including measures to further improve the quality of the secondary
leaving exam, public disclosure of results, technical analysis of the correlation
between the Grade 12 and university entrance exams, and a persuasive
communication strategy for a comprehensive participatory decision making process.
A highly technical capacity building program for test design and administration may
also need to be supported. For all these reasons the completion process of this policy
measure has been slow and the potential for this reform to take place is beyond the
time frame of the HEDPOs series. .
 123.    In HEDPO3, it is proposed that a further increase in the number of HEIs
applying the credit system will continue to be the key policy action. It is envisaged
that a revision of Decision for introduction of the credit system (Decision
43/2007/QD-BGDDT dated August 15, 2007) will be revised to take into account the
experience and lessons learnt to date. A handbook to provide guidance and good
practice will be prepared and provided to HEIs.


Quality Assurance
124.      Together with efforts to raise quality, another stream of policy aims at
cultivating and sustaining a culture of quality in the higher education system. This
quality culture needs to be developed from within individual higher education
institutions and supported by an external environment that demands high quality
standards. External and internal quality assurance will also be critical to improve the
accountability of more autonomous institutions.
125.    In HEDPO1, the government has issued a regulation to require universities to
disclose information relating to the quality of education, facilities, teaching and
management staff, income and expenditure on a regular basis, to improve information
about HEI performance that is available to Government, as well as to employers,
graduates, students and their families, and established the National Accreditation
Body to reinforce the quality assurance system at the central level by specifying and
ensuring minimum quality standards.
126.      In HEDPO2, the main policy actions aim at continuing to develop an external
quality assurance framework as well as supporting higher quality culture within
institutions. The main actions are to: (i) issue regulation for the establishment of
independent review agencies, responsible for regularly reviewing public and private
HEIs against minimum standards and advising government on their accreditation
(supported by an analysis of the external review of 40 universities); and (ii) issue a
plan/roadmap for developing "quality culture and accreditation. The first action is the
trigger for this component in accordance with initial program design and due to its
significance for the overall quality improvement agenda.
127.    The development of the accreditation framework has taken a new turn in that
the Education Law 2009 requires that education institutions are to be accredited by
independent agencies. MOET, therefore, plans to put out a comprehensive framework
for education quality assurance and accreditation (QA &A) before a new structure for

                                          38
accreditation will be set up. The establishment of independent review agencies (the
proposed prior action) is therefore postponed until after the overall framework is
established. This approach is commended because it lays the foundation for an
independent accreditation framework. The overall education quality assurance and
accreditation framework is therefore proposed as a replacement to the prior action
above.
128.     The QA&A framework outlines two main objectives of the system: (i)
ensuring minimum standards and accountability of higher education institutions; and
(ii) promoting the development of quality assurance culture at the institutional level.
The first objective will be achieved through the accreditation process. It is envisaged
that MOET will be responsible for setting accreditation standards and procedures and
licensing accreditation agencies. Three types of accreditation agencies (government,
non-governmental and private) can be established. For the second objective, the
framework outlines the process of developing quality systems at the institutional level
including: (i) establishment of quality centers; (ii) development of quality assurance
mechanisms including internal and external reviews; and (iii) other feedback
mechanisms.
 129.    The proposed accreditation model is commendable because this structure puts
stronger independence to accreditation agencies than the previous model (in which
these agencies only conduct external evaluation and the accreditation/certification
rests with the MOET-led accreditation body). Given Vietnam's scarce resources, it is
recommended that the government should focus on institutional accreditation
(mandatory) and leave program accreditation as voluntary because the latter requires
excessive resources whose costs may outweigh its benefits. The regulation on QA&A
has been approved by the Minister of MOET34.
130.     Finally further progress has been achieved on developing the internal quality
systems, although it merits more attention. As Vietnam strives to become a middle-
income country in the near future, the desire to have high quality HEIs that are
comparable to regional and international standards is increasingly pressing. A culture
for quality improvement needs to be spearheaded by HEIs themselves such that they
can prove their capacity to deliver high quality teaching and research and public
service through international benchmarking and continuous improvement. To date
121 universities have set up quality assurance centers but their capacity to provide
quality assurance services to the university and to faculties is very limited. For
example, very few centers have yet gathered and provided feedback from students,
graduates or employers on the quality of provision to the faculties. Several workshops
took place over the last months to provide capacity building for staff of QA centers
and the development of feedback instruments (from students/employers/graduates
etc).
131.    For HEDPO3, key policy measures would include: (i) establishment of the
accreditation agencies; (ii) number of HEIs having been accredited; and (iii) number
of HEIs having established and developed their own quality systems.

Public Financial Management


34
     Decision No.4138/Q-BGDT dated September 20, 2010

                                            39
132.     This policy area aims to improve transparency and accountability in public
financial management in the higher education sub-sector. This is particularly
important given the high level of perceived risk in public investment programs
operating in increasingly decentralized HEIs with moderate institutional capacity.
The policy actions outlined below focus therefore on financial reporting and auditing,
with a strong emphasis on public disclosure.
133.     The Government has been working to streamline the budgeting, financial
reporting and audit process between MOET and HEIs. Under the HEDPO1 twenty
(20) MoET-controlled HEIs required to have submitted their annual financial reports
for FY2007 complied satisfactorily, as verified by the World Bank, and twelve (12)
had their activities audited in accordance with Vietnamese law.
134.     The policy measures to be included in the Public Financial Management area
of the HEDPO2 Program are: (i) at least 40 HEIs preparing full annual financial
reports for the fiscal 2008; and (ii) ensuring that at least 20 MOET-controlled HEIs
have their previous year's activities audited in accordance with the Vietnamese law.
135.     The Government completed satisfactory both policy actions with financial
reports already received from more than forty (40) HEIs and a decision of the State
Audit of Vietnam to audit thirty (30) HEIs. Ten (10) annual financial statements were
selected on a random basis; the reviewed financial statements complied with the
Government's regulations. The audit report was reviewed and endorsed by the Bank's
Financial Specialist.
VI.       OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION
Poverty and social impacts

136.     The policy actions included in this second operation are expected to have
generally positive or at most no poverty and social impacts. In its support to private
sector delivery and a comprehensive financing strategy to address needs for fund
diversification but also equitable access the reform is expected to have generally
positive effects. We review below the likely implications of the main policy measures.
137.     Governance and quality assurance: the higher autonomy provided to HEIs
together with clarification on the composition of university councils is expected to
have no particular poverty or social impact. In particular, autonomy does not involve
full freedom in determining fees which will continue to be regulated, although in a
somewhat more flexible way, by MoET. Supporting private sector delivery, on the
other hand, will lead to increased coverage, which is likely to significantly benefit
relatively lower income families who do not currently have access to the generally
"more prestigious" public sector because of insufficient scores in the entrance exam
(also due to lower quality secondary schooling) and cultural and social barriers.35
Along these lines, most of the increase in private delivery occurring over these last
years has been at the college level and, as illustrated in Figure 11, access to college is
much more equitable than access to university. As long as private delivery is of
sufficient quality ­ and this is one of the purposes of the quality assurance framework

35
  In his review of higher education system in Vietnam, Ngo (2006) attributes the widening access to
higher education to a number of government policies, including the establishment and development of
non-public higher education institutions in rural and remote areas, and the introduction of a student
loan programme.

                                                 40
which is being developed ­ its development provides therefore a viable alternative for
students of lower income families. The private sector alternative will be made even
more equitable by the recent extension of student loans also to private sector students.
Getting back to quality assurance, it is important to reiterate that better quality
assurance for private institutions will be important to address the current inequity in
performance for the poor.36 The challenge, however, will be to find the right balance
between higher quality and increased enrollment through adequately defining the role
and scope of the independent review agencies.

138.      Quality improvement: the action on degree equivalencies between higher
and TVET education and recognition of prior learning will have very significant
positive effects on disadvantaged students who typically attend TVET education in
significant amounts and will now have the possibility of seeing their degree
recognized for the purpose of higher education allowing them to transit to this
education level of they so wish. There is currently no bridge between these two levels
in Vietnam. The other quality improvement measures are expected to have no
particular poverty and social impact.
139.      Financing: the higher education reform supported by this program is
expected to be financed through the State Budget, ODA funds and fees. While the
share of the State Budget will be increasing, so will also the share of fees ­ from 36
percent in 2009 to 45 percent in 2012 and 50 percent in 2020. To contribute to this
increase, the Government has just approved a new decree establishing a new tuition
fee schedule over the 2011-2015 time period for public sector institutions (private
institutions have no cap on their fees). At the same time, however, the Government
has also used the above decree to expand fee exemptions and reductions and student
aid and, in separate directive, further increase the amount of student loans. A detailed
study was carried out to get a better understanding of this package of measures and its
poverty and equity implications. Main findings are reported below.
140.     Impact of fee increase in the public sector. The new decree modifies the
previous fee range for public universities from VND 50,000-180,000 per month to

36
  While equity of access has clearly improved, differences in completion rates and later on earnings
are still very substantial across groups in Vietnam (Ballal and di Gropello, 2010).

                                                  41
VND 50,000-240,000 per month, from 2010 onwards, implying an increase of VN
60,000 (or 33 percent) of the previous maximum rate. To understand what this means
for public sector students, estimates of average monthly higher education costs37 for a
sample of public universities were obtained and the fee increase compared to these
costs. Additionally both the original and increased amount of costs was compared
with the average monthly income. While overall costs (before any fee exemption,
student aid and student loans) represent a very significant amount in relation to
income for the poorest quintile38, it is however also fairly clear that the VN 60,000 fee
increase represents only a small additional burden ­ which is bound to be acceptable
considering Vietnam's expected GDP growth rate of more than 5 percent per year
over the 2010-2015 period. In addition, Vietnam has introduced over the past years
several monetary measures to tackle the high cost of public (and private) higher
education which have substantially decreased (although not yet completely addressed)
the overall monetary burden for poor students.

141.      Fee exemptions and student aid measures. Since 1998 MoET has had a very
active policy in terms of fee deductions and exemptions benefitting, among other
student categories, poor and ethnic minority students. In 2006, about 22percent of
mostly disadvantaged university students were benefiting from significant fee
deductions (up to 50percent). And another smaller percentage of poor students would
benefit from complete fee exemptions. In parallel with fee increases, the new Decree
expands the coverage of fee deductions and exemptions by adopting a broader
concept of disadvantage (including disability, several types of economic difficulties,
remote areas and ethnic minorities). Beyond fee policies, the Government has also
adopted student aid schemes since the mid-1990s. Since a 2006 Circular, students
from ethnic minorities are receiving lump-sum assistance for about VND 470,000 a
month ­ representing therefore about one-third of their overall monthly higher
education costs. VHLSS 2006 estimations indicate that scholarships and grants are
reasonably well targeted with the large majority benefiting poor and ethnic minority
groups. Additionally, from 2007, scholarships for poor students were also increased to
cover the full tuition fees. The new decree is aligning these student aid schemes to the
fee increase implying therefore an equivalent increase in student assistance.

     Including tuition fees, extra-class fees, living and accommodation costs.

142.      Student loans. In 1998, the Government also introduced a student loan
program which, however, over its 9 years of implementation only covered a very
reduced number of students (about 1percent of all students benefited from it), with
therefore very little impact. In 2007 the scheme was substantially modified including
a significant increase of the loan amount (from VND 300,000 per month to VND
800,000 per month) and a longer repayment period. As a consequence over only two
years of implementation the number of students benefitting from the scheme was
already ten times higher than over the previous nine years (over 1 million students,
representing about 25 percent of all students, versus 100,000 students). Importantly
both public and private sector students are potential beneficiaries of the loan program.
Survey data from 77 schools show that loans were mostly for students' daily-life
necessities ­ including living and accommodation expenses. About 46 percent of
students however mentioned that the loan amount was still not sufficient to cover all
their expenses. The loan amount has been very recently increased to VND 860,000.
143.       Overall impact. While a full impact analysis could not be undertaken it is
rather clear that the combination of measures addresses to a significant extent the
inequitable access of poor groups to higher education. In fact, this combination of
measures aligns fairly well Vietnam with some of the best practices in the region and
outside.39 If we add up tuition fee scholarships and loans, poor students can
potentially cover most of their monthly costs of about VN 1,264,000 (VND 860,000 +
VND 240,000). It is expected that access to the poor will continue improving beyond
what we have seen in the 1998-2008 time period where the full impact of loans could
still not be captured. One area for further investigation, however, is the allocation of
student loans, to make sure that the poor have their fair share. The loan program will
need to continue being monitored. More problematic remains the access to higher
education of ethnic minority groups. While some of the effects of the lump-sum
assistance introduced in 2006 can probably still not be fully captured in the 2008
VHLSS and the very recent expansion of fee deductions and exemptions is also
expected to have a positive impact in the future, mitigating the effect of the fee
increase, these measures are probably yet not sufficient to make a very significant
difference in the access of these groups. Further measures will need to be taken
including continuous increases in student aid ­ to cover a larger proportion of costs-
and making sure that the loan scheme benefits much more ethnic groups.
144.     Criteria-based enrollment formula. Finally, the new criteria-based formula
for determining maximum HEIs' enrollment quotas may potentially lead to some
enrollment reductions and further selection which could potentially hurt some poor.
However, as for better quality assurance for private institutions, better quality will
also have a positive effect on student performance including poor student
performance.
Implementation, monitoring and evaluation

145.     A set of indicators for monitoring were agreed for all the three programmatic
operations (HEDPO1-3). The MOET's Program Unit will monitor and report on
progress against the HEDPP development objectives across the full three-tranches
program with specific indicators related to each operation.(Annex 3: program Results
Framework).

Fiduciary aspects

146.     With the DPL instrument, the MOET will use Government procurement
procedures and Government financial management systems in executing the HEDPO2
Program.
147.     Procurement. The policies supported by the operation relate to governance,
financing, and quality of teaching and are not considered to directly support any
procurement. The Bank team will rely on existing country-level procurement
assessment, and is unlikely to require a MOET-specific procurement assessment. The
MOET must implement procurement in accordance with the national procurement
law. The Bank encourages the Public Procurement Agency of the Ministry of
Planning and Investment (PPA/MPI) to include MOET in its annual procurement
audit program.
Financial management.
148.      Public Financial Management. Vietnam's public financial management
(PFM) environment is considered adequate to support this operation. The most recent
Country Financial Accountability Assessment conducted in 2007 concluded that `the
financial management risk to proper use, control and reporting of funds that are
managed through the Vietnam public financial management systems is assessed as
moderate'. The Government has maintained strong ownership of the PFM reform
agenda and continues to lead a coordinated reform program in consultation with the
donor community. Financial management and accountability systems of the
government have improved but there is not yet full compliance with a number of new
laws and regulations. Financial management risks arise from weaknesses in
implementation and compliance gaps. The quality and extent of independent audit
oversight remains low given the financial audit programs of the State Audit of
Vietnam do not yet accord with international standards and the development of an
effective internal audit functions is only at an embryonic stage.. A more detailed
discussion of public financial management in Vietnam is at Annex 6.
149.     Foreign Exchange Environment. An IMF safeguards assessment has not
been conducted in Vietnam. This assessment would provide information about the
foreign exchange control environment of the SBV and integrity of financial
information. The SBV is subject to auditing by SAV on an annual basis, however
under the current laws the audited financial statements and audit reports of SBV are
not made public. Notwithstanding these factors, IDA understands, following recent
discussions with the IMF, that there are no serious concerns with the SBV's foreign
exchange control environment.
150.      Flow of funds and auditing. To address the potential residual fiduciary risks
related to the foreign exchange environment, the Borrower will maintain a dedicated
foreign currency deposit account (DA) for the proceeds of the Credit, and will report
on the funds flow of the dedicated deposit account. The Government will, if deemed
necessary by IDA, allow an independent external audit of the dedicated foreign
currency deposit account (DA).
151.    Disbursement. The proposed Credit will follow IDA's disbursement
procedures for development policy lending operations. The Credit proceeds will be

                                          44
disbursed against satisfactory implementation of the Program and not tied to any
specific purchases, and no procurement requirements will be needed. Various
measures have been taken to ensure that the overall fiduciary policies and institutions
are adequate to proceed with support from IDA and other development partners. The
Recipient will open and maintain a dedicated Deposit Account in US dollars for the
Recipient's use once the Credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective. The
dedicated DA will form part of the country's official foreign reserves. The Recipient
shall ensure that upon the deposit of the Credit into said account, an equivalent
amount in Vietnamese Dong is credited in the Recipient's budget management system
to be used for budget expenditures in a manner acceptable to IDA. The Recipient will
report to IDA on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited
to the budget management system and on the timing of such deposits and credits. If
the proceeds of the Credit are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing
Agreement (FA), IDA will require the Recipient to either return that amount to the
dedicated DA to be used for eligible purposes, or refund the amount directly to IDA.
Amounts refunded to IDA shall be cancelled. The administration of this Credit will
be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.
152.      Reporting. The Recipient will: (i) report the exact sum received into the
dedicated DA and the timing of such receipts; (ii) ensure that all withdrawals are for
eligible expenditures; (iii) confirm to IDA details of the Treasury account to which
the Vietnamese Dong equivalent of the Credit proceeds will be credited, the credited
amount, and their timing, and (iv) submit a report on receipts and disbursements for
the dedicated DA.
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
153.     The policies supported by the proposed operation relate to governance,
financing, and quality of teaching and are not likely to have any significant positive or
negative effects on the country's environment, forest, and other natural resources. The
present operation is the second in a programmatic series of three single-tranche DPCs
to support the sustained implementation of selected elements of the Government's
reform agenda. Under the governance policy area, one of the HEDPP objectives is to
increase the quantitative capacity of the higher education sector. The national
capacity can be increased through a number of different approaches but certainly one
expected result of the Bank's support to this sector could be increased construction of
HEI facilities, which does raise the possibility of minor environmental impacts.
154.      The impacts of new facilities construction or renovation are considered to be
minor because HEI facilities are almost invariably constructed in urban or highly
converted environments with little likely impact on natural habitats, forests, or
natural resources. Nevertheless, Vietnamese law requires environmental impact
assessments of all large construction projects, including educational facilities.
Considering the scale and magnitude of likely impacts, the Bank considers that the
capacity of the education sector to adequately address environmental issues is
sufficient.
155.     Through on-going or planned sectoral investment loans the Bank is actively
engaged with MOET in ensuring that adequate environmental impact assessment
takes place. This includes general capacity building and the preparation and adoption
of environmental management frameworks for HEI construction and renovation


                                           45
which are de facto general manuals suitable for use in all similar projects, such as
those that could be stimulated by the HEDPP.
156.     The World Bank is also part of a multi-donor initiative with the Ministry of
Environment and Natural Resources (MONRE) to build long-term capacity in the
country for adequate management of environmental impacts in all donor-assisted
operations. As part of the "harmonization agenda" between the "Six Banks"40 and the
Government of Vietnam, MONRE has worked intensively on revisions to existing
procedures, on preparation of detailed technical guidelines for specific sectors, and on
preparation of an online "tool kit" to provide governments, financiers, and consultants
with detailed guidance on environmental issues associated with specific types of
investments such as construction. These products have all been produced and are
currently in use; through the period 2009-2010 they will be further refined with on-
going support from ADB and from the Comprehensive Capacity Building Program
(CCBP), a World Bank-managed trust fund program with the Ministry of Planning
and Investment (MPI).

1.       The Higher Education Development Policy Program (HEDPP), along with
the Second Higher Education Project (HEP2) and the proposed New-Model
Universities Project (NMUP), is designed to support the Government's
implementation of its "Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006-2010" (SEDP)43 and
its "Higher Education Reform Agenda" (HERA).44 In particular, HEDPP aims to
strengthen governance, rationalize financing, improve the quality of teaching and
research, improve accountability for performance, and enhance transparency in
financial management within the higher education sector. The proposed Second
Higher Education Development Policy Operation (HEDPO2) will be the second in a
programmatic series of three single-tranche Development Policy Credits (DPCs) to
support the sustained implementation of selected elements of the Government's
reform agenda.
2.       This operation provides general budget support to the Vietnamese
Government and will be executed through the Government's public financial
management (PFM) systems. This annex summarizes the current state of these
systems and the ongoing reforms with the aim of assessing the attendant fiduciary
risks with respect to the proceeds of this development policy operation.
Public Financial Management in Vietnam

3.       Public financial management reform is one of the four focus areas of the
Government's Public Administration Reform Master Program for the period 2001-
2010. Other focus areas are organizational restructuring, pay and employment reform
and institutional development. The PFM reforms have seven priorities: budget
management, revenue management, debt management, SOE fiscal risk management,
financial market supervision and government bond market development, public asset
management, and price management.
4.       Over the past decade, Vietnam has made strides in establishing a sound
public financial management system. With the adoption of the first organic budget
law in 1996 and its revision in 2002, a legal framework for public resource
management has been put in place. A centralized treasury system has been set up with
branches extending from the center to all provinces and districts to provide basic
essential financial services to all government agencies. Steady progress has been
achieved in making the budget more predictable and pro-poor, and the budgeting
process more transparent and participatory. Substantial efforts have also been made in
recent years to improve transparency in the use of public resources through disclosure
of information on detailed government spending as well as expenditure policies,
regulations and procedures.
5.      The country's public financial management system has a range of internal
oversight mechanisms. In the past, the focus was on inspection rather than systematic
review to provide regular and timely feedback to the management on the use of public
resources. Internal auditing is an important element of a sound public financial

management system, which helps increase effectiveness, efficiency and financial
control. This issue becomes even more important if the government intends to
decentralize further to the local levels.
6.       Under the timeframe of this operation, the legal framework for the
organization and operation of internal audit is being developed. Although
implementation will be challenging, this has been a very encouraging steps towards
establishing a sound internal audit system in Vietnam in the coming years.
7.       Independent scrutiny of PFM has increased, with external oversight of
budgetary affairs by the National Assembly and the recently independent State Audit
of Vietnam (SAV). The functional committees and deputies of the National
Assembly, and the local People's Committees have been given greater prominence in
examining, decision-making and oversight of the state budget. There is steady
expansion of external audit coverage and quality and legislative oversight.
Encouragingly, the SAV audit report was made public for the first time in 2006, and
regularly since, triggering serious debates on the usage of state budgets. However, the
capacity of these institutions, especially the SAV, is limiting the coverage and scope
of audits. It is difficult for the SAV to manage the increasing workload including
compulsory audit for 100 percent of SOEs, and to consider the move towards
performance audit.
8.       Vietnam has increased its level of fiscal transparency. Budget plans and
budget execution accounts are being made available publicly, and there is increasing
compliance with reporting regulations. However there is still room for improvement,
particularly in relation to consistency in quality of reports and their timeliness. To
enhance the quality of financial reporting, consistency between budget and accounting
classifications needs to be maintained. The number of budget execution reports needs
to be rationalized. Content and presentation of financial information needs to be
improved in line with existing government regulations in the publicly available
budget execution reports to make them more informative. The Government should
start producing and issuing annual financial statements in line with international
practices. Financial reporting of the government as a whole should include cash and
asset information. The State annual accounts and financial statements need to be
issued faster than the current 18 months after year end to enhance their relevance.
9.       Good progress has been made in establishing legislation and the environment
for greater financial accountability and transparency of financial information.
Regulations on financial disclosures of the State Budget Law, Accounting Law and
State Audit Law have been issued increasing the scope and range of required
disclosures by entities at all levels of government. Information is being made
available on public accessible websites. However, implementation remains the
challenge. To further increase transparency, the content of budget documentation and
the final accounts could be enhanced by including analysis, explanations and
information in line with international practices. Disclosure of financial information,
particularly spending at unit level should be actively monitored to ensure compliance
with the enhanced disclosure requirements. Published financial reports should be
timely, and a calendar for disclosures issued publicly.
10.       Progress and impact of the PFM reforms and development initiatives are
difficult to measure as there has been no official monitoring framework, and baseline
performance measures have yet to be established. The Public Expenditure and

                                          79
Financial Accountability (PEFA) Measurement Framework provides a recognized
measurement of the performance of the public financial management of government.
Similarly, the Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA), adapted from
the PEFA framework, but is focused on debt management issues, would provide a
baseline assessment of debt management capacity. Although the Government has
agreed in principle to introducing these measurement frameworks through self-
assessment process, no decision on timeframe and firm commitment of resources have
been made.
11.     At the policy level, the series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs)
and the recent Public Investment Reform Loan, have been nurturing constant policy
dialogue on the strategic elements of a broad and cross-cutting reform agenda
including PFM modernization. Meanwhile, these operations have been strengthening
coordination among line ministries and government agencies, and triggering chances
to reach endorsement on reforms at the highest decision-making level. At the
technical level, there are currently three active Bank-funded projects in PFM area,
namely the Public Finance Management Reform, Customs Modernization and Tax
Administration Modernization projects. In addition, there are two Multi-donor Trust
Funds (MTDF) established to tackle one of the main bottlenecks in the
implementation of reform in Vietnam -- limited government capacity -- which mainly
finances the needs of technical assistance and capacity building activities, and
analytical and diagnostic work laid out in the government strategy.
12.      In addition, a series of AAA works have been undertaken to provide sound
analytical underpinnings to the implementation of the Government-led PFM reform
program. These include the joint IMF-World Bank study of 1999 "Towards Fiscal
Transparency"; the joint 2000 Government-donor Public Expenditure Review; the
2001 Country Financial Accountability Assessment; the 2002 Country Procurement
Assessment Report, and mostly recently are the joint government-donor 2004 Public
Expenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment (PER-IFA) and the 2007
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). The CFAA 2007 proposes a
set of recommendations to help the government design and continue implementing
reforms and capacity building programs to modernize and strengthen public financial
management and enhance transparency and accountability arrangements in support of
sound economic management and improved governance
13.      There is strong ownership in the Vietnam government of the PFM reform
agenda. The government actively engages with donors and demonstrates a strong
commitment to PFM reform in Vietnam. The "Single Document" issued in 2007
articulates the government's strategy for mobilizing both national and international
resources to advance reform in PFM. Support to the implementation of reforms is
coordinated through the PFM partnership group which overarches the activities of
government, donors, and working groups, meeting half yearly to discuss progress.

14.      By 2008, there are approximately 315 colleges and universities, 64 out of
which are non-public. There are 60 public colleges and universities directly belong to
MOET, the rest belongs to Provincial People's Committees (PPCs) and other
ministries.

Budgeting/planning

15.     Budgeting is a bottom-up process where MOET-controlled HEIs prepare their
annual plan and budget estimate and submit to MOET for approval and consolidation.
Other public HEIs submit their annual plan and budget estimate to their respective
PPCs and ministries.
16.       Funding sources for HEIs include the following:
      -   State budget allocated by MOET (or PPCs or other line ministries)
      -   Tuition fee, registration fee
      -   Donors' funding
      -   Others
17.      On average, annual state budget allocation for HEIs accounts for 50-60
percent of their total budget, while tuition fee 30-35 percent. Normally, universities of
education (where students do not have to pay tuition fee) are more reliant on state
budget while there are other universities that are more autonomous i.e. their annual
state budget allocation account for only 10-20 percent of their total funding sources.
18.     MOET will decide the detailed budget allocation for its controlled HEIs.
MOET also regulates a range of tuition fee for HEIs to decide to apply. HEIs decide
total number of students for enrolment based on a set of criteria stipulated by MOET
(e.g. number of lecturers, infrastructure, and equipments).
19.      Decentralised planning and budget prioritisation follow centrally-determined,
formula-based, per student budgetary norms rather than relating to policy and needs.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) control of
centrally determined budgetary norms limits the impact of MOET-driven strategy and
demand-side factors. Moreover, MOET's detailed budget allocation to its controlled
HEIs is usually late and there are several budget revisions within a fiscal year. This
affects autonomy of HEIs in budgeting and budget execution. CFAA 2007, Sector
PFM with the case of Education and Training provides both operational and policy
recommendations to improve the comprehensiveness of annual sector budgets.

                                           81
FM staffing

20.      HEIs normally have a finance/accounting and planning department with a
head of the department and several accountants. FM staffing normally have adequate
qualifications and experience in finance and accounting in accordance with
government's laws and regulations.

Accounting system

21.      Public accounting is cash based and based on regulations which specify in
detail accounting definitions, accounting treatments and recording practices, and
consists mainly of revenue and expenditure accounting. Currently there are 6 main
accounting regimes defined by legislation (see Annex 4): (i) System of budget
accounting and state treasury operations, (ii) Import tax, export tax accounting
system, (iii) Accounting system for administrative and non-business units, (iv)
Accounting system for statutory funds, (v) Accounting system for capital project
management units, and (vi) Accounting system for state budget and finance at
commune level. As a result of having these various accounting systems,
inconsistencies and gaps in accounting classification, accounting treatments and
reporting exist and some agencies are required to follow several systems for different
parts of their financial activities.
22.     HEIs adopt accounting system and chart of account as stipulated in Decision
no. 19/2006/QD-BTC dated 30 March 2006 by MOF, which is Accounting system for
administrative and non-business units. The accounting system complies with
Vietnamese Accounting Standards (VAS).
23.     Each HEI can have its own computerized accounting software to help with
accounting work in compliance with Decision 19.
Internal controls

24.       Internal controls follow government's current regulations and include:
         Periodic cash count;
         Periodic state treasury reconciliation on budget allocation and budget
         withdrawal;
         Fixed asset management including fixed assets register, tagging, annual
         physical count;
         Level of authority with responsibility of account holders (normally the
         principal and the head of the finance and accounting department);
         Government's cost norms;
         State Treasury's expenditure verification process applied on state budget
         spending.

25.     Each HEIs will have state treasury accounts to receive state budget allocation
and other bank accounts at commercial banks to meet with their needs.
Auditing

26.      HEIs are subject to the following different types of inspections:
            a. MOET's Inspectorate: both technical and financial areas;
                                           82
           b. MOF's Inspectorate: financial inspection;
           c. Government's Inspectorate: both technical and financial areas;
           d. Tax authorities' inspection: tax related issues.

27.     There are overlapping among different inspections and these inspections are
not on an annual but rather ad-hoc basis.
28.      Besides these inspections, MOET and MOF have to perform the so-called
financial liquidation/settlement process (quyet toan tai chinh) on an annual basis. This
process requires HEIs to submit their annual financial statements to MOET/MOF and
MOET/MOF to pay a field visit to each HEIs to check supporting documents to
ascertain the adequacy of the financial statements.
29.    State audit. MOET and its controlled entities including HEIs are subject to
SAV audit. However, frequency of audit, audit scope and sample size of HEIs vary
depending on SAV's audit plan.
30.     The SAV has responsibility for auditing all activities related to the
management and use of state budget, money and assets at all levels of government.
The SAV's development strategy basically commits it to auditing all of its clients
annually by the year 2010, and the SAV has been step by step constructing and
completing its organization and mechanisms to ensure this goal is achieved. The
strategy for further development of the SAV as of 2003 stipulates the following
annual targets to be achieved by 2010 for financial audits:
      a. Auditing all annual budget settlement reports of all ministries and other
         administrative entities of the same order, of all provinces and cities,
      b. Auditing 75 percent of annual budget settlement reports of all districts and
         communes
      c. Auditing of all large State-owned Enterprises (SOE) and of 75 percent of
         the most important investment high value projects.

31.      In addition, the SAV is to include performance audits and cross-cutting audits
in its annual work plans.
32.      Legislation requires all state entities that use state budget, money and assets
to be audited annually by the SAV. In practicethe SAV has audited on average around
40 percent by expenditure value of State Budget, and some key entities have not been
audited for several years. The 2006 and 2008 financial statements of MOET and its
controlled HEIs were and will be audited by SAV, while the 2007 financial reports of
14 HEIs under MOET was inspected by MOF's Inspectorate (out of the 14 HEIs
which were inspected by MOF Inspectorate on their 2007 activities, 12 HEIs were
already audited by SAV on their 2006 Financial Statements).
33.     SAV's audit reports for MOET's 2006 financial statements revealed the
following fiduciary issues:
     Collected tuition fees exceeded Government's regulations and cost norms for
       16 HEIs and non-tuition fees from were collected from students not in line
       with Government's regulations (equivalent to 2 percent of total tuition fees).
     Collected tuition fees and other revenues were not timely deposited to State
       treasury. Some faculties/departments under HEIs were allowed to collect
       tuition fees directly from students rather than through HEI's Finance and
       Accounting Department.
                                          83
         Budget allocation by MOET to HEIs was slow with many amendments and
         revisions, affecting HEIs in their budget execution.
         Total cost estimate for the whole project and detailed cost estimate for each
         work item were not approved on time for ODA funded projects to form basis
         for procurement process.
         Recording of ODA sources and related uses of funds into state accounts is not
         timely.

34.     Following up on SAV's audit report, MOET sent official letters to HEIs
requesting them to make necessary audit adjustments and audit recommendations.
35.     Normally, 6 months after the audit reports are issued, SAV will perform a
follow-up investigation to check whether the auditees has implemented their audit
adjustments and recommendations or not.
36.     Also, other Inspectorates such as Government Inspectorate, MOF's
Inspectorate and MOET's Inspectorate will have to ascertain whether SAV's audit
adjustments and recommendations from previous years are properly implemented by
HEIs or not.
37.     In addition to the above, MOET, when performing annual financial
statements finalisation and approval process for HEIs, has to make sure all audit
adjustments are already made and reflected in the Financial Statements.
