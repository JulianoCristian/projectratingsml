APPRAISAL OF A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Landlocked Swaziland is well linked by road to its neighboring
territories; within the country, all areas are accessible by a relatively
dense road network. Most of the country's road system, however, consists
of gravel and earth roads which, in many cases, are impassable during the
rainy season, causing interruptions in the flow of traffic. Moreover, the
poor quality of much of the road system results in relatively high transport
costs. Road improvements, along with adequate maintenance, are essential
to enhancing the reliability of road transport and to lowering transport
costs.
ii.       The Bank Group became involved in the transport sector of Swaziland
in 1962 when Credit 60-SW (US$2.8 million) was made to help finance construc-
tion of the Oshoek-Lomahasha road (181 km) which extends from the western
border through the main economic core of the country to the Mozambique border.
This project was satisfactorily completed. There has been no financing by
the Bank Group of other projects in the transport sector of Swaziland.
iii.      This project is concerned with two roads; The first, Tshaneni-
Mlaula Road (about 39 km), an important link in the national transport
system, connects a major agricultural area and sugar milling center with
Mlaula Station on the Swaziland Railway. The second road, between Helehele
and Phuzumoya (about 43 km), connects the IDA-financed main east-west road
through the country with Phuzumoya Station on the Swaziland Railway. The
latter road is part of the principal route linking two areas undergoing
relatively rapid agricultural development. However, the poor condition of
both roads results in high transport costs which are an impediment to economic
growth. The purpose of the proposed project is to reduce transport costs by
improving the two roads to a two-lane paved standard. The necessary feasi-
bility and engineering studies were financed by the United Nations Development
Programme and the Government of Swaziland, with the Bank as executing agency.
iv.       The project comprises improvement of the Tshaneni-Mlaula and
Helehele-Phyzumoya roads. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$9.92 million (which includes US$500,000 taxes and duties), with a foreign
expenditure component of US$7.53 million. The Bank loan of US$7.00 million
will cover 93% of the foreign costs, or about 74% of project costs net of taxes
and duties.
v.        The Roads Branch of the Ministry of Works, Power and Communications
will be responsible for executing the project; consultants will provide
assistance in construction supervision. Award of construction contracts will
be based on international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. Two years will be required for construction.



- ii -
vi.       Improvement of the two roads will result in significant savings
in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs. The project is well
justified; it will yield an economic return to Swaziland of 13% on the
Tshaneni-Mlaula Road and 17% on the Helehele-Phyzumoya Road.
vii.      Satisfactory assurances were obtained from the Government on the
matters mentioned in paragraph 6.01 and the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$7.00 million to the Government of Swaziland. An appropriate loan
term would be 23 years with a grace period of three years.

APPRAISAL OF A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1970-71, the University of Natal, partly financed through South
African technical assistance, prepared a road development plan and carried
out feasibility studies of a number of roads including the Tshaneni-Mlaula
and the Helehele-Phyzumoya roads which are the subject of this project. The
studies indicated that improvement of these roads had high priority and was
economically justified. Subsequently, the Italian consultants, COMTEC,
financed by the United Nations Development Programme and the Government of
Swaziland, with the Bank as executing agency, completed detailed engineering
of both roads in mid-1974. The Government has asked the Bank to help finance
construction of the roads.
1.02      This report is based on the above-mentioned studies and on the
findings of an appraisal mission to Swaziland in August-September 1974, com-
prising Messrs. K.G. Clare (economist) and W.H. Cooke (consultant). The
report was prepared with the assistance of Mr. H. Peters (engineer).
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Swaziland is a small (17,364 sq km) landlocked country in southern
Africa bounded by the Republic of South Africa and Mozambique. Four identi-
fiable topographic regions are, from west to east, the mountainous highveld
(average height 1,300 meters), the undulating middleveld, the more gently
undulating lowveld, and the Lubombo plateau on the eastern border. Annual
rainfall is relatively heavy (1,270 mm per year average) and the temperature
moderate in the higher elevations as compared with the lower-lying areas.
2.02      The population, increasing at an annual rate of 3.0%, totals about
500,000 of whom only a small percentage live in urban areas. The average
population density is 28 per sq km and differences in density throughout the
country are not pronounced. The most economically active part of the coun-
try is the west central area with Mbabane, Manzini, and Bhunya as principal
centers. The area includes a pulp mill, some small industrial establishments,
most of the country's commercial firms, and considerable irrigated agricul-
ture. Three other important areas are located in the vicinity of Piggs Peak,
Tshaneni, and Big Bend: Lumbering and agriculture are the chief activities
in the Piggs Peak area, while sugar and other cash crops are principal pro-
ducts of the Tshaneni and Big Bend areas.



- 2 -
2.03      The country is well-endowed with natural resources.  It has a var-
iety of mineral deposits and soil and climate are favorable for diversified
agriculture. GDP, at constant market prices, increased over the period
1963-72 by an average of 7% per year. At current prices, per capita GNP in 1974
was estimated at US$450. The principal exports are sugar, citrus fruits,
wood pulp, iron ore, and asbestos. Swaziland forms part of a customs union
with South Africa, Botswana, and Lesotho; under this union customs dues on
imports into the union are apportioned between the four countries. There are
no customs duties on movement of goods within the union.
B. The Transport System
2.04      The transport system comprises about 2,600 km of road, 220 km of
railway, an international airport and several airstrips. Transport facilities
are available to a high percentage of the people of Swaziland although many
of these facilities are not reliable all-weather connections to market and
administrative centers. For internal and import trade, road transport pre-
dominates, while for export trade the traffic is carried largely by a railway
which connects Swaziland with the port of Lorenco Marques via a rail line
through neighboring Mozambique.
Highways
2.05      Only 190 km (7%) of the approximately 2,600 km of roads are paved;
the rest are gravel and earth roads. Road density, about 150 km per 1,000
sq km or 5 km per 1,000 inhabitants, is about average compared to other
countries in a similar stage of development. The poor quality of most of the
network results, however, in high transport costs, adversely affecting the
market price of goods. Road transport accounted for some 110 million ton-
kilometers in 1974 or only about 15% of total freight traffic in the country.
The reason for this low percentage of traffic moving by road is that iron ore,
which forms the bulk of the country's freight traffic, moves by rail. All
surface transport between Swaziland and the Republic of South Africa is
handled by South African motor carriers. Details concerning highways and their
administration are given in Chapter 3.
Railways
2.06      The Swaziland Railway extends (220 km) from an iron ore mine at
Ka Dake, in the extreme west of the country, to the eastern border with
Mozambique where it joins a line stretching 74 km from the border to the port
of Lorenco Marques; it does not connect with the South African System. Built
in 1962-64 to carry iron ore for export to Japan, the funds for constructing
the line have been repaid by the freight revenues received from transport of
iron ore. The railway is operated by the Mozambique Railway under a contract
which is profitable to Swaziland and includes providing locomotives and
rolling stock. While iron ore is the principal traffic, some other freight



- 3 -
is also carried, but no passengers. In 1973, the railway carried about 3
million tons or about 85% of the country's total freight, three-fourths of
which was iron ore while sugar, wood pulp, and petroleum products accounted
for most of the rest. The movement of iron ore is expected to end sometime
between 1975 and 1978 because of depletion of good grade ore. As a conse-
quence, some portions of the line may be closed. Although the economic
viability of the remainder is uncertain and is presently under study by the
Government, it is the Government's intention not only to see that it continues
in operation but also to enable Swaziland Railway to take over operation of
the system from Mozambique Railway.
Air Transport
2.07      Swaziland has no national airline; international air service is
provided at Matsapa airport near Manzini by a foreign carrier. A total of
about 13,000 passengers and a small amount of freight were handled in 1972.
At present, consultants are assisting the Government in determining whether
the present airport should be improved or a new airport constructed.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.08      Swaziland's present transport policy has two broad aims:  (1) to
aid development, particularly in rural areas, by improving transport services
within Swaziland and expanding the highway network in areas of high economic
potential; and (2) to reduce transPort costs within the country and between
Swaziland and neighboring countries. With these aims in mind, the Government
has established a development program encompassing significant investments
in road improvement, lesser investments in airport facilities, and minor
investments in railways. Planned expenditures in the transport sector for the
period 1973-76 are E 5.2 million or about 12% of total public expenditures
projected for the period.
2.09      Coordination of transport planning is the responsibility of the
Economic Planning Office in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
which reviews proposals and determines priorities. The proposals are put
forward by various ministries, most importantly by the Ministry of Works,
Power and Communications (MWPC).  Since MWPC encompasses agencies concerned
with road, rail, and air transport, the Ministry is broadly structured in
order to permit analysis of the inter-relationships between transport projects
of each mode. Lack of transport economists in the MWPC, however, means that
the Economic Planning Office, using general economists, must undertake the
economic analysis of proposed projects. It was to assist that office in this
function that the Government invited the University of Natal in 1970-71 to
conduct an overall transport study, and that report has been the principal
basis for the Government's subsequent transport planning.



- 4 -
2.10      Government control over transport is provided through the MWPC.
Railway transportation falls under the jurisdiction of the MWPC and is
provided by the Swaziland Railway which is operated by Mozambique Railways
under an agreement between the two railway organizations. In the road
transport field, the MWPC is responsible for regulating private carriers
for whom entry into the road transport industry is relatively unrestricted;
applicants are required to demonstrate only financial capability and a nominal
demand for transport services. Permits have not been difficult to obtain. As
a result, there are numerous small private operators providing freight and
bus services. Provision of regular air carrier services or changes in exist-
ing services are subject to prior approval by the fWPC.
2.11      Transport rates for freight services of motor carriers are free of
Government regulation; fares for bus passengers, however, are subject to a
reasonable maximum (fare per passenger-kilometer) established by the Road
Transportation Board of the MWPC.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Network
3.01      The highway network is defined in the Roads and Outspan Act of 1931.
Under this Act, "proclaimed" roads, which are the responsibility of the NWPC,
are divided into two classes--Main and District roads. There are at the present
time 1,456 km of Main roads and 1,150 km of District roads, a total of 2,606
kIn proclaimed roads, of which 190 km are paved (Table 1). In addition, there
are several thousand kilometers of unclassified earth tracks for which no
organization bears responsibility.
B.  Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.02      The composition and growth of the vehicle fleet is shown in Table 2.
In 1972, there were an estimated 4,800 automobiles, 3,200 goods vehicles and
300 buses, with the vehicle fleet as a whole having grown at an annual average
of 3.2% since 1966. Most goods vehicles are small trucks and vans of less
than 3-ton capacity. The carrier with the largest number of trucks is South
African Railways, but it accounts for only 4% of the total truck fleet; most
truck and bus operators have only one vehicle.
3.03      Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and duties
on vehicles, fuel, lubricants, and spare parts and through licenses and
registration fees. No specific data are available on total revenues collected
from road users. All customs and sales duties on goods imported into the
common customs area (Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa) are paid into



- 5 -
a common revenue pool. Only the license fees, which are not paid into the
common revenue pool, are set by the Swaziland Government; this source yielded
E 223,000 in fiscal year 1972.
3.04      The Roads Branch has conducted traffic counts on selected roads
over a period of several years. While these counts have not been taken as
frequently and carefully as desirable, the available data indicate that traffic
has been growing at 7-8% annually. The Government has agreed to improve and
expand its traffic count methods to provide an adequate basis for future road
planning.
C. Administration
3.05      The Roads Branch of the MWPC (Chart 2) has the executive responsibility
for planning, constructing, and maintaining all proclaimed roads. Area offices,
under a Clerk of Works (senior technical officer), are responsible for routine
highway maintenance in the field. Planning, new construction, and periodic
maintenance (resealing and regravelling) are handled from the Ministry head-
quarters located at Mbabane. Equipment is rented from the NWPC plant and
vehicle organization which has a Central Workshop in Mbabane with a sub-unit
at Manzini.
3.06      The professional staff of the Roads Branch, provided under British
technical assistance, consists of four expatriate engineers: a Senior Road
Engineer, head of the Branch, who is assisted by a road maintenance engineer; a
planning engineer; and an engineer in charge of construction. All are based
at Mbabane. An Assistant Engineer assists the Senior Roads Engineer in
administration and coordination of the work of the office. Below professional
level, all staff are Swazi nationals. With this minimal professional staff,
the Branch has no road designing capacity; all engineering and construction
supervision is carried out by consultants. This has proved a workable
arrangement.
3.07      Road use is regulated by the fWPC under a Road Traffic Law which has
recently been revised to bring it into line with South African law. The
regulations impose, among other things, limits on size and weight of vehicles,
axle and wheel loads, and power-to-weight ratios. Most commercial trucking
is carried out by South African Railways and other bulk carriers operating
in and out of South Africa where the regulations are strictly enforced, so
there is no problem with breach of regulations. However, there may be a
problem on the project roads caused by locally operating bulk sugarcane
carriers, but assurances were obtained from the Government that it would take
such steps as are reasonably required to ensure that the dimensions and axle-
loads of vehicles using the highway system are consistent with the structural
and geometric design standards of the roads.



- 6-
D. Planning and Financing
3.08      The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning is responsible for
national economic planning and has prepared the Second National Development
Plan covering the five-year period 1973-1977. Proposals for road transport
development are based on recommendations of the transportation study carried
out by the University of Natal (para 1.01). A list of project roads being
engineered for construction is given in Table 3; most of the roads in this
table, as well as the roads included in this project, were included in the
construction program recommended by the University of Natal.  In addition, to
serve agriculture, some rural roads now under construction by force account
are being financed by British Technical Assistance (ODM). Also, the African
Development Bank is financing 92 km of engineering for the Manzini-Nhalangano-
Mahamba road and Government is financing the engineering of the Motshane-Piggs
Peak-Jeppes Reef Road (95 km). In another type of assistance, the Canadian
Government (CIDA) is, as stated in para. 3.13, financing a study of road
maintenance and may finance a technical assistance program with the object of
increasing the maintenance capacity of the Roads Branch and improving highway
maintenance.
3.09      Recurrent highway expenditures (Table 4) are financed out of the
general budget. New construction is financed through grants and credits under
bilateral aid programs. Expenditures under both the recurrent and the capital
budget for highways have increased from US$552,000 to US$1,236,000 per annum
during the five year period ending 1971/72. Although expenditures on main-
tenance have increased in recent years, the amounts have generally fallen
short of budget allocations for maintenance because of problems with the
availability of staff and equipment (para. 3.13). The CIDA-financed project
would help eliminate these problems (para. 3.08), and improved management as
a result of CIDA technical assistance should lead to better availability of
equipment. Assurances were obtained from the Government that sufficient funds
will be allocated to insure proper maintenance of the highway network.
E. Engineering
3.10      The Roads Branch does not have the capacity to engineer road projects
other than those few executed by force account. The preparation and execution
of nearly all new works is therefore carried out by consultants. Design
standards (Table 5) are influenced by, and similar to those in South Africa.
They appear to be on the high side but, since they are used as maximum standards,
few problems arise.
F. Construction
3.11      No major road works have been carried out in Swaziland during the
past ten years and there is no domestic contracting industry capable of



- 7 -
executing the project (para. 4.05). The small size of the country and the
limited construction work planned provides only a small potential for developing
a domestic highway construction industry. The Roads Branch has a small
construction unit for building low standard feeder roads serving rural
development projects and has satisfactorily constructed 57 km of such roads
during the past two years. For major road works, the Roads Branch employs
consultants fo supervise contractors selected after suitable prequalification
and tendering procedures. Contracts are normally let on a unit-price basis.
G. Maintenance
3.12      For routine maintenance, the country is divided into three areas and
17 districts. Each area is supervised by a Roads Branch clerk of works who
is assisted by an inspector of works, a construction foreman and five or six
overseers. Depending on the size of the area, work is largely mechanized,
relying on motor graders for reshaping and removal of corrugations. However,
due to the low availability of equipment, no regular schedule of grading is
possible and some roads are in very bad condition. For periodic maintenance,
there are a bitumen unit, three gravelling units and two bridge construction
and repair units under head office control. These units are undermanned and
are often idle due to breakdown of important items of equipment. Regravelling
is seriously in arrears and at the present rate of progress it will take some
21 years to regravel roads which should be done every 5-7 years. The CIDA-
financed project would aim at resolving these difficulties.
3.13      The Government has a poor record for maintenance of its plant and
vehicles. In an attempt to improve this situation, the British Government
(ODM) financed a study of the whole system of purchase, repair and adminis-
tration of equipment and vehicles. The study recommended that a Central
Transport Organization (CTO) be established which would maintain all Govern-
ment equipment. The organization has failed to achieve its objective due to
the failure of the GoverLnent to appoint suitably qualified and experienced
management and technical staff. At present, the availability of plant and
vehicles is less than 50%, making it impossible for the Roads Branch to
function properly. Only one out of three gravelling units is manned, and the
bitumen unit is not functioning at all. There is no shortage of equipment.
To remedy this situation, the CIDA mission, under its technical assistance
program (para. 3.08), is reviewing the operations of CTO and its relationship
with the Roads Branch. The Government agreed to ensure that by the Closing
Date for the project the management of its Central Transport Organization, or
any other entity performing essentially the same functions, operates along
lines agreed with the Bank in order to ensure the most economic and effective
utilization of its road maintenance equipment.



-8-
H. Training
3.14      The Government has a program for selecting, educating, and training
administrative and technical staff for the public service. Within the
Government, a Staff Training Institute is playing a major part in localization
by providing training for civil servants in administration. The Swaziland
Industrial Training Institute (SITI) has been expanded and courses are now
offered in most technical skills. The University of Botswana, Lesotho and
Swaziland (UBLS) has been enlarged and, since 1971, has been taking students
for degree courses, including engineering; also, increasing numbers of students
are sent to courses overseas when no equivalent degree courses are available
locally. At the present time, there are 8 civil engineers in training (3 at
UBLS and 5 in the USA); the xWEC estimates its ultimate requirements will be
14. Also at the SITI, there are 36 students taking a three-year course for
mechanical technicians and 7 are training to be draughtsmen. In addition,
CIDA may provide technical assistance for training highway maintenance personnel,
including equipment operators and mechanics; the CIDA assistance may also
include provision of replacement road maintenance equipment. These programs
are adequate to meet the present and immediate future needs of the Roads
Branch.
4. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The objectives of the project are to:
(a)  improve the road between Tshaneni and Mlaula (about 39 km)
to a two-lane bitumen paved standard; and
(b)  improve the Helehele-Siphofaneni-Phuzumoya road (about
43 km) to two-lane bitumen paved standard.
B. Description
4.02      The first road passes through flat lowlands of irrigated sugar and
citrus fruit plantations. During the development of this area, a new spine
road was planned, although only half of it was built. The project provides
for the construction of the rest of that road and improvement of the existing
alignment which was engineered to gravel standard under the First Higlhway
Project (Credit 60-SW). The present road has a rough gravel surface and is
expensive to maintain under existing traffic conditions of about 250 ADT
(average daily traffic). Under the project, the road will be improved to
two-lane bituminous paved standard. The new alignment will also shorten the
present route by about 6 km.



4.03      The second road is located in the middleveld, which consists of a
more hilly and undulating terrain. It branches off the transterritorial
highway, paved under Credit 60-SW, at Helehele and runs in a southeasterly
direction fo 43 km. There is little gravel on the road and its condition
is poor, particularly in the rainy season when pot holes develop and make it
very rough. Although the existing route will be followed for most of the
way, there will be a few significant diversions to improve the geometry of
the road, effecting a route reduction of about 4 km.
4.04      The proposed design standards for these roads, based on the
recommendations of the Natal University Transportation Study (Table 5), are
in accordance with those recently adopted by the Government and are satisfactory.
Briefly, these provide for a 7.30 m wide pavement on the Tshaneni-Mlaula road
which carries heavy sugarcane traffic in bulky vehicles and 6.70 m wide for
the Helehele-Phuzumoya road which does not carry this type of traffic. The
inter-territorial highway financed under the First Highway Project (Credit
60-SW) is also 6.70 m wide. The pavement structure will be composed of a
natural gravel sub-base, base course and shoulders, with a triple bituminous
surface treatment. The nature of the terrain does not impose any restrictions
on geometric design standards. On the Tshaneni-Mlaula road, one small bridge
of 20 m span will be constructed to full formation width. Design standards
are set out Table 5.
C. Execution
4.05      The Roads Branch will be responsible for the execution of the project
but wishes to retain consultants to supervise construction. The Government
confirmed that suitably qualified consultants will be engaged for supervision
of the construction under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Construction will be under one unit price contract, awarded after international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines, including prequali-
fication of contractors which will be undertaken before bids are invited.
Construction is expected to take about 24 months. There is no domestic road
contracting industry in Swaziland and the Government has no intention of
developing one because of the small size of the country.

4.07      The costs of construction were estimated by the consultants in June
1974 on the basis of final design quantities; the estimates have been updated
to reflect costs expected in March 1975. As no major road construction
contract has been carried out in Swaziland for the past ten years, unit
prices have been arrived at after a detailed survey of prices in the adjoin-
ing South African provinces of Transvaal and Natal where an extensive road
construction program is under way. The costs of supervision have been esti-
mated by the Association. A 10% physical contingency has been provided for
construction and supervision to allow for possible quantity variations and
time extensions. A price contingency of about 25% has been provided to cover
expected price increases during the project period and has been derived by
applying the following price escalation rates to the cost estimates for civil
works: 16% in 1975, 14% in 1976, 12% in 1977, and 10% in 1978; for consultant
services, 10% per annum.

E. Financing and Disbursements
4.08      The Bank loan of US$7.00 million will cover 93% of the foreign
expenditure element of the project; the Government will finance the remaining
foreign expenditure element and the local costs of US$2.39 million.
4.09      Disbursement of loan funds will be on the following basis:
(a) 70% of the total costs of construction contracts, and
(b) 100% of foreign costs of consultants' services.
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 6. Any funds remaining
in the loan account upon completion of the project will be cancelled.
5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The two roads included in this project, which are major links in
the national road system, are high on the Government's list of road development
priorities. Their improvement will contribute to Swaziland's principal trans-
port aims of reducing transport costs and aiding development (para. 2.08).
In the northeast, the Tshaneni-Mlaula road not only services the internal
needs of an important area of commercial agriculture but also connects that
production center with the railway. The Helehele-Phuzumoya road links two
of the more rapidly developing regions in the country, the Mbabane/Manzini/
Bhunya area with the important agricultural district centered at Big Bend.
It also connects the main east-west road with Phuzumoya Station on the
Swaziland Railway.
5.02      The area served by the Tshaneni-Mlaula road (covering approximately
350 sq km) produces about 950,000 tons of sugarcane annually, or over half of
Swaziland's total cane production. The cane is hauled by truck to a mill in
Mhlume for processing after which the sucrose and molassas are transported
by truck to the railway station at Mlaula. Estimated production at the
Mhlume mill during the 1974-75 season is 100,000 tons of sucrose and 30,000
tons of molasses; a 25% expansion of mill production is planned within the
next few years. The Mhlume mill is wholly-owned by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, a British institution. While most of the cane is grown on large
estates, a small but increasing number of smallholders also supply cane to
the mill. In addition to sugarcane, this area also produces a substantial
part of Swaziland's citrus fruit plus some cotton, maize, and potatoes.
5.03      Recognizing that the Mhlume Sugar Company, the principal grower
and only miller of sugarcane in the northeast, would benefit substantially
from the lower transport costs which would result from constructing the



- 12 -
Tshaneni-Mlaula road, consideration was given to the possibility that the
company be required to make a specific contribution to financing the construc-
tion. Since 1973, however, the sugar industry has been subject to a special
levy on sugar exports. This levy is so structured that a reduction in sugar
production costs, including transport costs, results in half this saving being
captured under the levy. Accordingly, while the Company will share in the
benefits from the road, the Government has decided it would rely on the
sugar levy to recover such benefits rather than require that the Company be
subject to an additional tax aimed at financing the road improvement. In
addition, the Government will collect income tax on profits. As indicated
below (para. 5.07), the road improvement is economically viable even if the
recovered benefits to the Mhlume sugar company are excluded.
5.04      The principal benefit from the Helehele-Phuzumoya road improvement
would be lower transport costs for inter-regional traffic, i.e., traffic
between the main economic core of the country and the rich agricultural area
in the southeast. This traffic includes several thousand tons per year of
cotton produced by both foreign-owned farms and a large number of Swazi
smallholders and transported to the ginnery at Manzini; other important ele-
ments of westbound traffic are citrus fruits, maize, and vegetables, while
eastbound traffic is a diversity of non-agricultural goods. Immediately
south of Phuzumoya is the Mapobeni area where about 4,000 hectares are to be
developed as an important center of irrigated agriculture with citrus fruits,
sugarcane, and vegetables as the projected main crops. This development would
have a notable impact on traffic over the Helehele-Phuzumoya road.
5.05      In 1973, traffic on the Helehele-Phuzumoya road was about 240 ADT
and on the Tshaneni-Mlaula road 248 ADT. Both roads when improved will divert
relatively small amounts of traffic from other routes. Specifically, some
traffic will probably be diverted to the Tshaneni-Mlaula road from the road
running southeastward from Bordergate along the country's northern border;
traffic is also expected to be diverted to the Helehele-Phuzumoya road from
the Helehele-Mpaka-Big Bend road. On the basis of past traffic growth,
averaging 7-8% annually in recent years, and ongoing development schemes in
the two areas served by these roads, the consultants have estimated that
traffic will continue to grow by about 7% per annum (Table 7).
5.06      The basis for the economic analysis is an assessment of the benefits
for expected traffic and costs with and without the proposed improvements
over a 20-year period, the estimated economic life of the project. For the
purpose of the analysis, the investment cost has been taken as the cost, net
of taxes, of improving the two roads, including the cost of supervision and
taking physical contingencies into account. The principal quantifiable
benefits will be savings in vehicle operating costs (Table 8) and savings in
road maintenance costs. There will, of course, be other benefits which cannot
be quantified such as improved access to social and administrative facilities.



- 13
5.07      The streams of costs and benefits summarized in Table 9 indicate
that the proposed investments are economically sound. They will yield a 13%
economic return to Swaziland on the Tshaneni-Mlaula road; this return is based
on benefits which exclude both those to foreign owners and Government revenue
from the sugar levy. If sugar levy revenue is included in the benefits, the
economic return is 20%, and if the total benefits to foreign owners as well
are included, the return is 28%. On the Helehele-Phuzumoya road, the economic
return to Swaziland is 17%. Including benefits to foreign owners, the economic
return on this road is 25%. Both roads have first year returns to Swaziland
above 10% when using a 10% discount rate.
5.08      Sensitivity tests applied to the economic analysis assumed increases
in construction costs, reductions in rate of traffic growth, and increases in
vehicle operating costs. If the construction costs on both roads increased by
25% the economic return would be reduced from 13% to 10% and from 17% to 15%,
respectively. If traffic is assumed to grow at only 5% throughout the economic
life of the project, the economic return would remain satisfactory at about 10%
and 13%, respectively, for the two roads. In case of a decrease of 10% in
savings in vehicle operating costs, the return would be reduced by about 2%.
In each case the economic return remains satisfactory. The major risk in the
project is considered to be increases in construction costs.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      The following points were agreed with the Swaziland Government:
(a) data on traffic flows and vehicles will be collected as
necessary for sound transport planning (para. 3.04);
(b) the Government will take such steps as shall be reasonably
required to ensure that the dimensions and axleloads of
vehicles using the highway system are consistent with the
structural and geometric standards of the roads (para. 3.07);
(c) sufficient funds will be allocated annually for highway
maintenance to assure proper maintenance of the road
system (para. 3.09);
(d) the Government will ensure that by the Closing Date the
management of the Central Transport Organization, or any
other entity performing essentially the same functions,
operates along lines agreed with the Bank in order to
ensure the most economic and effective utilization of its
road maintenance equipment and vehicles (para. 3.13);



- 14 -
(e) suitably qualified consultants will be engaged for supervision
of construction under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank (para. 4.05);
(f) procurement under the project will be in accordance with Bank
guidelines (para. 4.05); and,
(g) the Government will finance all project costs not covered by
the proposed Bank loan (para. 4.08).
6.02      Satisfactory assurances were obtained from the Government on the
matters mentioned above and the project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$7.00 million equivalent to the Government of Swaziland. An appropriate
loan term would be 23 years with a grace period of 3 years.
