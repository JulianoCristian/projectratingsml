MEXICO
SMALL-SCALE AGRICULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1I. BACKGROUND
A. Project Background
1.01      The proposed project would be a part of an on-going program for
agricultural development, based mainly on small-scale irrigation and dating
back to 1937, when the Directorate for Small-Scale Irrigation was created
within the National Commission for Irrigation with the purpose of benefitting
small groups of low-income farmers. More recently, in 1967, the Government
established the National Plan for Small-Scale Irrigation, aímed at system-
atizing the approach to small-scale irrigation development. As a consequence
of the merger in December 1976 of the Secretariat of Hydraulic Resources and
the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock into the Secretariat of Agriculture
and Hydraulic Resources (SARH), the scope of the small-scale irrigation program
was enlarged to include infrastructure works for drainage and livestock devel-
opment and became the National Plan for Small-Scale Agricultural Infrastructure
Development (PNDR).
B. The Agricultural Sector
Agricultural Production
1.02         During the 1945-65 period, Mexico's crop output grew at a rapid
average annual rate of 6%. 1/  Major causes were rapid expansion of irrigation,
supplemented by successful efforts in research directed to irrigated crops.
The increasing physical complexity and higher costs of large-scale irrigation
schemes and the lack of alternative strategies, together with the slowing down.
of private investments derived from the uneasiness felt by many land-owners
regarding the security of their land titles, were probably the main factors
leading to a substantial drop in the sector's growth rate, which for the
1965-76 period was estimated at a mere 1%, well below the demographic growth
of 3.5% p.a. As a consequence, despite a sustained growth of about 4% p.a. in
livestock production, agriculture's share in Mexico's GDP decreased from 18%
in 1955 to 10% in 1975.
Foreign Trade
1.03      Concurrent with the production trend, the agricultural trade balance
deteriorated during the early 1970s, although it recovered sharply in 1976 due
1/   Source:  Banco de Mexico.

mainly to the abrupt jump in coffee prices. Owing to the advantage derived
from their relative prices, oilseeds and sorghum displaced wheat and maize to
an appreciable extent, particularly in irrigated areas, which brought about
large imports of these cereals while imports of oilseeds and sorghum are still
necessary. Adverse conditions of international markets caused a decline in
exports of cotton, vegetables and beef, while sugar exports fell to zero in
1976 since the moderate increase of production was absorbed by the growing
domestic demand.
Rural Population, Employment and Income
1.04      The agricultural sector provides the livelihood for a rural popula-
tion scattered over 95,000 villages totalling some 24 million people (4 million
families), or about 40% of Mexico's total population. While no detailed labor
statistics are available, unemployment and/or under-employment appear to be a
major problem of the agricultural sector. With a labor force between 8 and 12
million people and a cropping area fluctuating around 15 million ha, the ratio
of cropped area to potential active population is between 1.3 and 2.0 ha per
person, very low when the land use pattern (about two-thirds of the cropped
area devoted to cereals) is consídered. This is one of the major causes
determining the level of income in the agricultural sector, lower than that of
other sectors, as the following table illustrates.
Per Capita GDP (1975) /1
1960 US$        Index
Agriculture                               127            100
Natíonal Average                          527            415
Industry and Services                     793            624
/1   Based on data of "Prontuario Estadistico de la Secretaria de Recursos
Hídraulicos" (SRH) Mexico, D.F., 1976.
Moreover, the income distribution pattern within the agricultural sector
is skewed, as 50% of the rural families account for about 20% of the agri-
cultural output while the upper 10% of the agricultural populatíon provides
50% of it.
Government Policies
1.05      Within the agricultural sector, Government's policies aim at increas-
ing production of basic food crops (maize, wheat and rice) so as to attain
self-sufficiency by 1982 and increasing income levels and generating employment
opportunities among the rural population through specific programs such as
PIDER and the PNDR, described in the next chapter.
1.06      To íncrease the area devoted to basic food crops, the Governmnent
intends to: (a) bring new lands into production, both under rainfed condi-
tions and through irrigation projects; and (b) induce adequate changes in
cropping patterns.



(a) Development of New Lands. Development of new rainfed lands is
getting underway mainly in the humid tropical zone, where an area of about
8 million ha, at present unutilized or underutilized is estimated to have
medium to high agricultural potential. In this context, the Bank recently
(April 1978) approved a US$56 million loan for a Tropical Agricultural
Development Project (Loan 1554-ME). In the short term, development of new
lands under irrigation would continue to take place mainly under the small-
scale program and, in selected cases, medium and large conventional projects
would also be undertaken. In the long term, however, large-scale irrigation
projects will continue to be developed, although, due to their increasing
physical complexity, high investments and long gestation periods, future
large schemes are expected to yield lower benefit-cost ratios than the project:s
successfully implemented in the past. Thus, while priority should be given
to improving water use efficiency and rehabilitating deteriorated projects,
it may be well justified in the national interest, to carry out in due course
the Government plans for the full use of the nation's still unused hydraulic
potential, which would bring the area under large-scale irrigation projects
to an impressive total of about 7.5 million hectares and about 2.5 million
hectares under small-scale projects (para 2.22) by the end of the century.
(b) Changes in Cropping Pattern. To induce changes in cropping pattern
that would contribute to offset the decreasing trend shown by the area devoted
to wheat and maize during recent years, the Government increased the guarantee
prices of these two crops relative to sorghum and soybeans as shown below:
1976                            1978
Crop              Price         Index              Price          Index
Mex$/ton         (%)            Mex$/ton          (%)
Maize             1,800          100              2,900            100
Wheat             1,650           92              2,600             90
Sorghum           1,600           89              2,300             79
Soybeans         3,690           205              5,000            172
With this price structure, the Government expects a favorable response from
farmers that would contribute to increase production of maize and wheat.
1.07      To increase yields in rainfed lands presently cultivated, the
Government intends to strengthen and coordinate the different supporting
services (extension, credit, and marketing) through the Distritos de Temporal
(Rainfed Districts), of which 110 covering the entire country were created
in March 1977, although specific projects have not yet materialized. To
increase yields and improve performance in irrigated areas, the Government
intends to: (a) rehabilitate those irrigation districts where, owing to
inadequate maintenance, hydraulic works and/or irrigable lands are in poor
conditions resulting in low levels of production; and (b) revise and enforce
collection of water charges in irrigation districts with a view to improve
water use efficiency and achieve the much needed financial self-sufficiency
for adequate project operation and maintenance.

C. Bank Participation
1.08      In the past five years (FY 1974-78) Bank participation in the
agricultural sector amounted to US$835 million distributed over nine projects
as follows: irrigation (Panuco, Siía¿loa and Bajo Bravo/Bajo San Juan),
US$174 million; rural development (PIDER 1 and II and Papaloapan Basin),
US$280 million; credit (Fifth and Sixth projects), US$325 miliíon; and area
development (Tropical Agriculture), US$56 míllion. Irrigation projects
encountered initial difficulties derived from inadequate project design and/or
unexpected high price increases; these circumstances led to reformulation of
the Bajo Bravo/Bajo San Juan project with subsequent cancellation of US$100
(from an original loan of US$150 million) and to a supplementary loan of
US$25 million, approved by the Bank on July 11, 1978 to assist financíng cost
overruns of the Panuco project. A project to complete the works of the
Sinaloa Irrigation project and rehabilitate the Rio Fuerte Irrigation
District has been recently appraised (September 1978), for which a loan
is under consideration. With these actions, implementation of the above
projects is now progressing satisfactorily. PIDER I and II are multi-
sectoral projects designed for improving living conditions and increasing
productivity in localized small areas of rural poverty ("micro-regions").
After some difficulties inherent to their nature, overall progress of these
projects is improving along with steps taken to decentralize the decision-
making process, although the success in carrying out the different components
of the project varíes with the implementation capacity of the agencies
involved. The Papaloapan project had also a very slow start due to a severe
shortage of budgetary allocatíons, a situation that now is being corrected
with a recent appropriatíon of funds (September 1978). Disbursement pace
of the Fifth Credit project was faster than projected, although lately has
slowed down with respect to funds earmarked for low-income producers; in
any case, the project is expected to be completed about six months before
closing date (January 1, 1980). The Sixth Credit project and the Tropical
Agriculture project were signed on September 27, 1978; both loans are ex-
pected to be effective before the end of the CY1978.
1.09      A Project Performance Audit (OED's Report 1573, April 27, 1977)
on the Third Credit Project (Loan 747-ME) pointed out that the project made
a significant contribution to improve financial assistance to commercial
farmers, but noted that technical aspects at farm level were to be improved;
to thís aim, specific actions for monitoring agricultural development were
introduced in the Fifth and Sixth Credit projects.
1.10      Bank assistance for the development of Mexican agriculture will
probably continue to focus on: (a) small-scale infrastructure projects
within PNDR's framework; (b) water control projects, oriented toward rehabili-
tation of irrigation districts or drainage and/or flood control projects;
(c) development of new lands in the humid and sub-humid zones; (d) technical
assistance programs oriented toward ímprovíng performance of rainfed agricul-
ture; (e) agricultural credit with a view to meeting the needs of (i) general
development programs drawn on a regional basis and/or (ii) specific projects,
be they local or national; (f) rural development programs; and (g) selected
conventional irrigation projects.

II. TRE NATIONAL PLAN FOR SMALL-SCALE AGRICULTURAL
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT (PNDR)
A.   Institutional Framework
2.01      The administrative structure of SARH rests on the following seven
units: five undersecretariats (Planning; Hydraulic Infrastructure; Agriculture
and Operation; Livestock; and Forestry); a Coordinating Office and an Admin-
istrative Office. Responsibility for PNDR is shared by two undersecretariats:
Hydraulic Infrastructure (SIH), for execution of project works; and Agricul-
ture and Operation (SAO), for supervision and technical assistance.
The General Directorate of Hydraulic Works and Agricultural Engineering
for Rural Development (OHDR)
2.02      Within SIH, the administrative unit in charge of PNDR is OHDR,
whose structure comprises three levels: national, regional and state.
A description of the functional structure of OHDR is given in following
paragraphs and its organization ís shown in Annex 1, Chart 1.
2.03      At headquarters, in Mexico D.F., OHDR has eight subdirectorates:
Development Programs; Specific Studies; Projects; Hydraulic Engineering;
Construction; Rural Engineering; Monitoring and Statistics; and Administra-
tive Services. As of April 78, OHDR professional and technical support
staff numbered 1,550, of which 404 are at headquarters. Annex 1, Table 1,
gives a detailed breakdown of staff by regions and disciplines.
2.04      The Subdirectorate of Development Programs is both the starting
and finishing unit of the project preparation process; it is responsible
for the programming and budgeting of OHDR as well as reviewing the final
reports (para. 2.07) of the sub-projects submitted to the Secretariat of
Programming and Budgeting (SPP) for approval prior to be included in PNDR.
2.05      At design stage, four subdirectorates are responsible for the
technical aspects of PNDR; they are: Specific Studies, Projects, Hydrau-
lic Engineering, and Rural Engineering. These subdirectorates assist
regional offices in project preparation when technical complexities so
require and supervise the engineering aspects of project reports. The
Subdirectorate of Construction is responsible for supervising the regional
offices in the execution of project works. Physical progress of PNDR
is followed up by the Subdirectorate of Monitoring and Statistics, which
is also in charge of preparing the progress reports to be submitted to
financing institutions.
2.06      For the purpose of OHDR activities, the Mexican Republic is divided
into four administrative regions (Map IBRD 13930): Northwest, with regional



-6-
headquarters in Hermosillo, Son; Northeast, in San Luis Potosi, S.L.P.;
Central, in Queretaro, Qro.; and Peninsula and Isthmus, in Merída, Yuc. The
Regional Offices were created on January 11, 1974 with a view to expediting
the administrative process and strengthening the preparation, construction
and supervision of projects included in PNDR. Regional Offices are headed by
a Deputy Regional Director, directly reporting to the General Director and
structured in departments whose titles and functions are parallel to those of
the sub-directorate at headquarters. A detailed breakdown of regíonal staff,
1,146 throughout the country, is shown in Annex 1, Table 1.
2.07      The Regional Offices are responsible for preparing their regions'
plans, the report (expediente integrado) of each proposed sub-project and the
physícal implementation of sub-projects, be it by force account or contract.
Sub-project reports, which are prepared according to the standard guidelines
set forth by the central offíce, include:  detailed engineering studies,
agricultural development plans, analysis of social and economic benefits and
the Convenio de Participacion (para 2.08) signed by all beneficiaries. As an
illustration, Annex 1, Table 2, shows the table of contents of the report of
an actual case: a groundwater development sub-project, Valle de Canindo,
which has been chosen as one of the representative sub-projects to be financed
under the proposed loan.
The Users' Association
2.08      A key feature of project implementation is the role played by the
beneficiaries themselves who, for each sub-project, are organized in a
Users' Association. The Federal Water Law (Art. 77) establishes that, at
project level, such users' associations--managed by an elected executive
committee--are responsible for the administration, operation and maintenance
of the subproject. After completing the preliminary studies for a sub-project
and before undertaking its execution, the Users' Association and SARH
enter into a participation agreement (Convenio de Participacion) which
specifically establishes that users' share in project financing will be
equivalent to 30% of total project cost, of which up to 10% can be contri-
buted as labor; the remainder will be in cash, either by financing, usually
through credit, the purchase of equípment or by means of annual payments to
the Users' Association. In addition, users must provide evidence of their
legal right to use the land (ownership or possession) and, through their
Association, commit themselves to (a) receiving the works when SARH so deter-
mines, and (b) establishing and collecting water charges to cover operation
and maintenance of the project and, when applicable, to recover the users'
cash contribution toward project cost.
The General Subdirectorate for Supervision of Rural Development Units (SUDR)
2.09      Within SAO, the unit in charge of supervising the operations of
PNDR and providing technical assistance to users' associations is SUDR, under
the General Directorate of Irrigation Districts and Rural Development Units.



- 7 -
While SUDR is also organized at national, regional and state levels, its basic
activities are carried out at state level under the supervision of the regional
offices, whose territories coincide with those of OHDR. Details of SUDR
functions are given in following paragraphs and its organization is shown in
Annex 1, Chart 2.
2.10      SUDR is divided into three departments:  Rural Development; Tech-
nical Services; and Evaluation and Statistics. As of April 1978, professional
and technical support staff numbered 1,615 of which only 44 were stationed
at headquarters. Annex 1, Table 3, shows a breakdown of staff by regions and
level.
2.11      The Rural Development Department is in charge of providing tech-
nical assistance to PNDR beneficiaries. Prior to the merger of the two former
secretariats of Hydraulic Resources and Agriculture, emphasis was on irrigation
techniques, through a successful specific program, partly financed by the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB): the Plan for Improving On-farm Irri-
gation Practices (PLAMEPA). Currently, however, under PNDR's broader scope,
general agricultural extension is provided by SUDR, using both its own regional
staff and extension agents from the General Directorate of Extension and
Agricultural Production, also within SAO.
2.12      The Technical Services Department is primarily responsible for
preparing farm plans, including credit requirements, and monitoring the
agricultural, economic and social development at sub-project level.
Each sub-project is monitored using a standard "master sheet" on which the
following information is recorded:
(a) Basic Data
-    soil classification
-    land tenure (number of users, farm size, and such)
-    description of project works
(b) Water Use
-    projected
-    actual
(c) Agricultural Development
-    cropping pattern
-    inputs
-    credit
-    yields, production.
-    gross value of production
This information, which is recorded annually, is used to analyze the users'
payment capacity and advise the users' associations in imposing water charges



- 8 -
to properly operate and maintain project facilities. In additíon, the Tech-
nical Services Department 1s also responsible for assessing the performance
of users' associations.
2.13      The Evaluation and Statistics Department receives the field informa-
tion and evaluates PNDR as a whole; it is the unit in charge of preparing
periodic reports on project development to be submitted to financing insti-

B.   Historic Development and Present Situation
2.14      Small-scale irrigation projects were initially conceived as a means
to reach the most depressed sector of the rural population. More than 90%
of the area brought under irrigation by PNDR belongs to ejidos, a legal
entity 1/ which, in essence, consists of the right of the rural communities
to enjoy the usufruct of lands whose ownership remains with the Federation,
and defines the rights of individual members, the ejidatarios, to share the
usufruct right of their community. In the early stages of the Plan Nacional
de Pequena Irrigacion, many of these projects were justified on social rather
than on purely economic grounds. During the previous six-year period (1971-76),
however, more attention was paid to the economic aspects of the program as a
logical consequence of the systematization brought about by its growth. The
program has been largely supported by the IDB, which has made 11 loans amounting
to US$225 million to assist financing US$547 million worth of small scale
irrigation projects. IDB support of small-scale irrigation projects amounts
to about 50% of its total contribution (US$520) to finance irrigation projects
and related supporting services (PLAMEPA, for example) in Mexico.
2.15      A related plan, the Investment Program for Rural Development (PIDER),
was launched by the Government in 1973 with the objective of channeling multi-
sectorial public investment packages, which include small-scale irrigation, in
selected "micro-regions." 2/ PIDER is supported by IBRD (Loans 1110-ME,
1/   The concept of the ejido existed, de jure and de facto, during the
colonial period. Within the context of Mexican agrarian reform
the word first appeared in 1911, when Emiliano Zapata demanded the
restitution of the ejido lands to the communities. The Constitution
of 1917 (Art. 27) recognized the ejido; further, the Ley de Ejidos
of December 28, 1920, the Ley de Dotaciones y Restitucion de Tierras
of April 23, 1927 and Ley Federal de Reforma Agraria of March 16,
1971 are the most relevant pieces of legislation regulating
the ejidos.
2/   Micro-regions comprise an average of 50,000 people located in two
to seven contiguous rural municipalities within a state. They are
selected using criteria that balance poverty levels (per capita income
averaging below US$100) with potential for income-increasing produc-
tíve activities.



-9-
US$110 million, and 1462-ME, US$120 million) and IDB (one loan, US$40 million).
Responsibility for implementation rests with the participating agencies under
the coordination of SPP, whose role vis-a-vis small-scale irrigation is
limited to selecting the micro-regions where projects included in PIDER are to
be executed and appropriating financial resources. All other activities
related to project execution--design, construction, contracting, and the
like--are carried out by OHDR, for which PIDER is simply one among its several
financial sources, which in 1976 supplied about 5% of its annual budget,
a contribution that was raised to about 10% in 1977, is currently (1978) at
a level of 15% and is expected to reach 25% in 1979. According to PIDER
sources, the steady growth of its contribution to OHDR's budget is due to
the fact that the small-scale irrigation program is one of the most efficient
within PIDER.
2.16      PNDR is now in its Fourth Stage; selected indicators of small scale
irrigation works completed under previous stages are summarized below:
Investment
PNDR Stage    Year      Area     Families        Total        Per ha       Per FamJiv

Total              303,500    156,100
In addition to the above, under the Fourth Stage, about Mex$2,700 million
worth of irrigation infrastructure will be completed on about 61,000 ha,
benefitting about 19,000 families; thus, in the Fourth Stage, the investment
per ha and per family would be, respectively, Mex$44,300 (US$1,920) and
Mex$142,100 (US$6,180).
2.17      To further illustrate the scope and results of PNDR, Annex 1,
Table 4, presents a fairly detailed analysis of sub-projects larger than
25 ha included in the Third Stage. The following remarks summarize the
most relevant findings:
(a) 84% of irrigation sub-projects were based on groundwater
development;
(b) average family holding was 3.4 ha, ranging between 2.5 ha in
the Central Region and 4.9 ha in the Northwest Region;
(e) average investment per ha was US$1,410 ranging between US$700
in the Isthmus and Yucatan Region and US$1,530 in the Northwest
Region 1/;
1/   Based at the then prevailing rate:  US$1 = Mex$12.50.



- 10 -
(d)  average investment per family was US$4,760, varying between
US$2,100 in the Isthmus and Yucatan Region and US$7,540 in the
Northwest Region;
(e)  in relative terms, average incremental gross value of production
per ha was seven times that of the pre-project situation; the
highest íncrement was obtained in the Isthmus and Yucatan Region
(1,325%) and the lowest in the Central Region (630%);
(f)  average incremental family income was US$1,540, or about four times
that of the pre-project situation; the highest increment, US$2,460
per family, or 770% over the pre-project situation, was obtained in
the Northeast; the lowest increment, US$820, or 280% over the
pre-project situation, was obtained in the Isthmus and Yucatan
Region;
(g)  when referred to the hectare, the average incremental gross
value of production was 56% of the investment; the highest
ratio was 68% in the Central Region and the lowest 35% in
the Northwest Region; and
(h)  the ratio between the average incremental family income and the
average gross value of production per family was 58%, ranging
between 50% in the Central Region and 83% in the Northeast
Region; this is an índex of which part of the incremental
output of the project remains with the rural family.
2.18      An evaluation of PNDR was carried out in 1975 by SPP and SARH (then
Secretariat of the Presidency and Secretariat of Hydrulic Resources, respec-
tively) and submitted to IDB. Conclusions of the Mexican agencies and IDB may
be summarized as follows:
(a) about 90% of the projected area was actually under irrigation;
(b)   substantial improvements were made regarding;
(i) completion of on-farm works;
(ii) clarification of land tenure situations (since definition of
farmers' rights to the.land is a condition for sub-project
appraisal);
(iii)  organization and effectiveness of users' associations; and
(iv) project implementation (construction and agricultural develop-
ment) periods decreased from five years in the First Stage to
three years in the Third Stage;
(c) double cropping is widely practiced;
(d) most sub-projects yield an EER better than 14%, with highest
returns in pumping sub-projects and lowest returns in storage



- 11 -
dam sub-projects; results were lower than expected in about
15% of the sub-projects;
(e) about 95% of the area under irrigation has access to agricultural
credit;
(f)  operation and maintenance are satisfactory; water charges
imposed to that effect by the users' associations are fully
paid by farmers, although conversely, annual charges to cover
farmers' contríbution toward project cost were not yet collected
(paras 4.08 and 4.09); and
(h)  in summary, "overall results are perfectly acceptable and, in
some respects, higher than the projected targets" 1/
2.19      In addition to the economic and social results, the institution
building aspects are a major outcome of the program. OHDR has executed irri-
gation works on some 360,000 ha and SUDR is supervising operations on and
providing technical assistance over about 1,100,000 ha, which comprise the
area brought under irrigation by OHDR plus an additional area of some 700,000
ha of small-scale irrigaton works (executed outside of PNDR by private farmers,
states or other entities) that, under provisions of Federal Water Law (Art.
73), have been brought into PNDR for the purpose of improving land and water
use through the supervision and. technical assistance provided by SUDR. On
grounds of the evaluation carried out by the Mexican agencies and IDB and
based also on its own knowledge of the small-scale irrigation program, the
Bank is of the opinion that both ORDR and SUDR are efficient organizations,
which, with a highly motivated and qualified staff at headquarters and regional
offices and effective administrative structures, have made major contributions
to the successful development of PNDR.
C. The Future Outlook
2.20      For the "Sexenio" 1977-82, the current Mexican Administration set
the targets of PNDR at developing 570,000 ha and benefitting about 200,000
families with a total investment of US$840 million. The projected breakdown
of the total area is:
Type of Infrastructure Works                       Area (ha)
Irrigation                                    350,000
Drainage                                      100,000
Livestock                                     120,000

The irrigation program, of which about 64% would be groundwater development,
is proceeding satisfactorily, at a pace of about 60,000 ha per year; the
drainage program has recently started while the livestock program will be
initiated under the Fifth Stage. From past experience and current status of
studies, it appears that the irrigation and drainage programs are likely to
attain their targets; conversely, it seems doubtful that the livestock infra-
structure program can move fast enough to complete about 30 to 40,000 ha per
year.
2.21      In addition to the Fifth Stage, ORDR plans to launch further stages
to complete the financing of its six-year program and foresees that IDB
and IBRD will continue supporting PNDR. Thus, subject to the development
of the Fifth Stage, it is expected that a repeater project will be proposed
to the Bank in two or three years.
2.22      Over the long term, PNDR 1s expected to have a larger share in
SARH's program, which, for the year 2000--the time horizon adopted by the
Mexican policy makers for the agricultural sector--calls for extending the
cultivated area up to 30 million ha, twice today's 15 million ha. Both
irrigated and rainfed areas, today estimated at about 5 and 10 million ha,
respectively, would be doubled by the end of the twentieth century. Within
this general framework, PNDR is expected to progress along the lines outlined
below:
(a) Irrigation Infrastructure. Of the new 5 million ha to be brought
under irrigation, between 33% and 40% would be developed in small-scale
projects which thus would account for about 2.5 million ha, or 25% of Mexico's
total irrigated area projected for the end of the century. Thus, by using
localized water resources where available, the small-scale approach would
constitute a valuable complement to large-scale schemes, which are to be
developed when the use of the resources of large rivers so requires. From an
operational point of view, the most notable advantages are: (1) due to a
systematic approach to project preparation and design standards, probabilíty
of errors is low since unforeseen circumstances seldom arise; when errors do
occur, they are not too difficult to correct and, in any case, they do not
affect the entire program; (ii) investment costs, fluctuating around US$1,200
per ha for pumping plants, US$1,600 per ha for groundwater and US$2,200 per ha
for storage dams, are considerably lower than the US$3,500 to 5,000 per ha
frequently obtaíned in large scale irrigation schemes; in addition, due to the
relative simplicity of sub-projects, actual costs are kept fairly close to
estimates; (iii) due to project typology (a significant proportion of pumping
schemes), water control is reasonably efficient; and (iv) Government's
financial burden is lower than in the case of large projects since operation
and maintenance costs are directly covered by beneficiaries, who also
contribute 30% of investment cost.
(b) Drainage Infrastructure. PNDR is to play a supporting role
since drainage projects are usually required in the low lands of the hydro-
graphic basins of the humid tropical regions, which, in general, require



- 13 -
large infrastructure schemes. Local drainage and flood control projects,
however, are frequently advisable and those would be included in PNDR.
(c) Livestock Infrastructure. As noted at the outset (para 1.01),
the scope of PNDR has been enlarged to include small-scale infrastructure
projects for livestock development, an attractive innovation which essen-
tially consists of improving pastures and establishing animal watering
points, stables, corrals and fences, and is expected to have a major impact
on the productive and social structure of rural communities with few develop-
ment alternatives and little off-farm employment opportunities. This type of
sub-project would mainly take place in those ejidos where most of the land is
generally unused due to physical constraints (unreliable rainfall, unsuitable
topography or poor soils) so that only a small fraction is cultivated. Small-
scale livestock infrastructure projects would be developed on land, either
unused or devoted to low-level subsistence agriculture, but with a potential
for livestock development, and where Government initiative would be justified
because the farmers, due to their limited resources, would not be eligible for
obtaining credit under commercial conditions to finance the infrastructure
works. Once such works were executed, however, beneficiaries could finance
the acquisition of livestock under the on-going credit programs for low-income
producers. Thus, by bringing into production lands otherwise greatly under-
utilized, small-scale livestock infrastructure sub-projects would provide a
strategy to increase income level and improve living conditions of a large
number of rural families who would otherwise remain at or below subsistence
level if their only source of income were their rainfed farms. To effectively
enlarge the scope of its support to small farmers, OHDR counts on two points:
first, its understanding of the peculiarities of communities of small farmers
gained through its efficiently decentralized technical and administrative
structure; and second, its absorption of the Department of Rural Engineering
of the former Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, which was in charge of
similar activities. These considerations fully justify the decision of the
Mexican Government of applying the systematic approach of PNDR to the devel-
opment of small-scale livestock infrastructure sub-projects and vesting the
responsibility for its implementation in OHDR, which would be responsible for
designing and carrying out the infrastructure works of the sub-projects; the
acquisition of livestock would be financed by BANRURAL which, under its
standard procedures, would prepare development plans and provide technical
assistance to beneficiaries.
III.  THE PROJECT
A. Description
3.01      The Government of Mexico, through Nacional Financiera S.A.--its
specialized agency for international financial operations--has requested a
Bank loan to help finance a Small Scale Agricultural Infrastructure Project
which would constitute the Fifth Stage of PNDR. The project, to be executed



- 14 -
in four years (1979-82) would consist of a series of about 250 sub-
projects, scattered throughout the country, covering an aggregate area of
about 150,000 ha and benefitting some 30,000 families, mostly ejidatarios,
well within the poverty target group. The project was prepared by SARH and
presented to the Bank in February 1978; it would include:
(a)  tGue eZecutiol of.
(i) irrigation infrastructure on about 56,000 ha, of which:
-    900 tubewells would command about 36,000 ha,
-    20 storage dams would command about 12,000 ha,
-    18 pumping plants would command about 8,000 ha;
(ii) drainage infrastructure on about 36,000 ha;
(iii) livestock infrastructure on about 58,000 ha; and
(b)  the acquisition of equipment for:
(í) hydrogeological studies,
(ií) construction of civil and on-farm works,
(iii) tubewells and pumping plants, and
(iv) livestock farms.
3.02      The project comprises a wide range of activities with great geo-
graphical dispersion.  In an attempt to arrive at a meaningful definition of
the engineering, agricultural, economic and social aspects of the project,
about 25 sub-projects were studied. From such sample, the following six
(Map IBRD 13930) have been selected to describe the conceptual aspects of the
project and quantify its relevant indicators:

Isthmus
B. Organization and Management
3.03      Responsibility for the execution of the project would rest with
OHDR. The users' associations would be in charge of administration, operation
and maintenance of the project. SUDR would supervise operation and provide
technical assistance to project beneficiaries. The chart on page 16 shows
graphically the project cycle, with explicit identification of activities
and definition of responsibilities.
C. Status of Project Preparation
3.04      To ensure PNDR's satisfactory progress, OHDR maintains an adequate
portfolio of project reports (para. 2.07) of which there is a complete list in
the project file. At the time of appraisal (May 1978), reports for irrigation
sub-projects tentatively earmarked to be submitted to the Bank covered an area
of some 36,200 ha, totalling an investment of about Mex$1,100 million, equiv-
alent to approximately 65% of the estimated size of the irrigation component
in the proposed Bank project. For drainage infrastructure sub-projects,
complete reports cover an area of about 10,600 ha, with a total investment of
about Mex$60 million, or about 30% of the area that would be included in the
proposed project. In addition, studies are underway to cover about 32,600 ha.
Details on the status of preparation of livestock infrastructure sub-projects
are given in paragraph 3.07.

D. Design Standards
Irrigation Infrastructure Projects
3.05      With more than 200 dams, several hundred pumping plants and over
4,000 deep wells constructed and in operation over PNDR's 12 years of life,
OHDR has systematized the technique of developing small-scale hydraulic
schemes. Design criteria for small dams and pumping plants used by OHDR are
based on its own as well as world-wide experience and are published in a
series of well prepared manuals, a complete set of which is available in the
project file. Regarding groundwater sub-projects, exploration and development
progress simultaneously. When a suitable supply of groundwater is found, a
well is completed and tested and, if favorable, irrigation works are completed
according to well yield and land available (at the rate of 1 l/s/ha). This
process continues until the zone is fully developed. In areas where a consid-
erable development of groundwater resources has already taken place, wells are
systematically monitored and pumping rates are adjusted when depletion is
observed. In zones being mined, a 10 to 20% decline in yields over a period of
10 years is anticipated, although depletion would not occur throughout the
entire zone but only in certain wells where the degree of interference is high
due to close spacing and/or local geological conditions. To allow for
reductions in yields, pumping rates are designed at 80% of the maximum yield
obtained when the well is tested. Key technical data of the irrigation
sub-projects mentioned in paragraph 3.02 are given in Annex 1, Table 5.
Drainage Infrastructure Project
3.06      Drainage infrastructure projects are located mainly in the Península
and Isthmus Region. In a first stage, sub-projects are designed to drain only
superficial excess of rainfall water from a limited area (generally a few
thousand hectares); sub-surface drainage would be studied at a later stage, if
and when justified by physical and economic considerations. Sub-projects
consist generally of a main drain discharging to a water course draining the
area; secondary drains are spaced about 1,000 m apart, depending on topographic
conditions; tertiary ditches are about 50 to 60 cm deep and spaced at intervals
of about 400 m.
Livestock Development Infrastructure Projects
3.07      Since OHDR experience with livestock development infrastructure
projects is not as extensive as it is in regard to design and execution of
hydraulic schemes, sub-projects prepared for Bank consideration were generally
overdesigned. Infrastructure works (pasture improvement, installations), as
originally planned, were to have been completed in the initial years, without
allowing for phased development; thus, investments in infrastructure were
overly concentrated in the early stage of the sub-projects and parallel
private investments (credit) were estimated at the level required to finance
the maximum carrying capacity of the farms, thereby reducing the number that
could be reached; further, credit to finance private investment would then
merely have supported the acquisition of livestock without promoting the



- 18 -
growth of herds. During appraisal, these issues were discussed with staff of
the OHDR's Sub-directorate of Rural Engineering, who agreed to revise livestock
infrastructure sub-projects to slow down the development pace as well as the
amount of private investments; technical risks would then be lower and economic
returns would be higher.
E. Sub-project Appraisal
Irrigation and Drainage Sub-proiects
3.08      PNDR s sub-projects are appraised by OHDR using criteria and
methodology agreed upon with IDB and submitted to SPP and IDB for approval.
Under current procedures, sub-projects are tested against a B/C ratio of at
least unity obtained by discounting benefits and costs streams at 9%. The
assumptions used by OHDR in the calculations, however, are still those
agreed upon in the early stages of PNDR, with yields and development pace
that were then considered prudently conservative but, in the light of
experience, have turned out to be severely underestimated. An analysis
during appraisal of about 25 sub-projects (para 3.02) demonstrated that,
with the use of more up-to-date cost and benefit assumptions, the ORDR
cut-off point was in fact equivalent to an ERR of about 12%. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that, for each irrigation and/or drainage
sub-project to be financed under the proposed loan, SARH would furnish to
the Bank for approval a "Summary Sheet" according to the outline presented
in Annex 1, Table 6. Only sub-projects with an economic rate of return of
at least 12% would be approved by the Bank.
Livestock Infrastructure Sub-projects
3.09      For the reasons pointed out in paragraph 3.07, the Bank would conduct
a desk appraisal of each livestock infrastructure sub-project. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that OHDR would furnish to the Bank for approval
a full feasibility report (Expediente Integrado, para 2.07) for each sub-project
of this type to be financed under the proposed loan; only sub-projects with an
economic rate of return of at least 12% would be approved by the Bank. The
Bank and OHDR would seek that adequate design and evaluation criteria for
livestock infrastructure sub-projects were developed and systematically
applied, with a view to eventually vest responsibility for appraisal in OHDR
so that, as in the case of irrigtion and drainage sub-projects, the Bank could
generally be satisfied with the information provided on a summary sheet that
would be designed in the course of supervision.



- 19 -
F. Project Implementation
3.10      The project would be executed in a period of four years (1979-82)
and its activities would be carried out according to the project cycle shown
in the chart on page 16. Acquisition of equipment for studies and construction
of civil and on-farm works would take place in the early months of the first
year. Irrigation and drainage sub-projects would be executed at an approxi-
mately uniform rate. For livestock development sub-projects, however, due to
the technical and economic reasons above mentioned (para 3.07), completion of
on-farm works would generally require longer periods of time than the expected
disbursement period; thus, while execution of these sub-projects would be
undertaken on about 58,000 ha, project cost estimates and financial arrange-
ments are based on a "time-slice" approach covering invest-costs incurred
during the four-year project execution period. Livestock development sub-
projects approved by the Bank for inclusion in the project, but not completed
during the disbursement period, would be eligible for supplementary financing
under the expected (para 2.21) subsequent project. In any event, the Govern-
ment would complete all sub-projects initiated under the proposed loan.
G. Cost Estimates
3.11      Project cost estimates were based on a detailed analysis of the
final designs and bills of quantities of the six sub-projects mentioned above
(para 3.02) from which relevant unit costs were obtained and then applied to
the quantities estimated for the entire project. Unit costs were further
disaggregated in labor, materials and equipment on which local and foreign
components were determined and then worked back to the main unit. Following
this procedure, a cost table was prepared for each type of sub-project (Annex 1,
Tables 7 to 10), thus arriving at the estimated execution cost, net of contin-
gencies and OHDR's administration expenditures. These tables were later
aggregated into a general table (Annex 1, Table 11) in which:
(a) to avoid double counting (under civil works and equipment sub-
headings), the cost of construction equipment (US$8.9 million)
was deducted from irrigation infrastructure (US$7.3 million)
and drainage infrastructure (US$1.6 million) proportionally to
their civil works costs;
(b) given the advanced status of project design, physical contin-
gencies were estimated at 5% of engineering cost and 10% of
infrastructure works and equipment;
(c) civil and on-farm costs do not include farmers contribution
toward project cost, through labor during construction period;
the estimates are as follows (in US$ million): irrigation,
3.2; drainage, 1.6; livestock, 1.5; total, 6.3;



- 20 -
(d)  administration costs were estimated at 15% of execution costs,
a coefficient obtained by OHDR from actual data of 1977; and
(e)  price contingencies were based on a four-year execution period
at 7% for 1979 and 1980 and 6% for 1981 and 1982.
3.12          Including contingencies, project financial cost 1s estimated at
US$143.7 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$60 million (42%).
By type of sub-projects, irrigation, drainage and livestock would account
77, 12 and 11% respectively. A summary of the total project cost is
presented below:

H.  Financing
3.14      Bank participation in project financing would be US$60 million,
equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange component. Project bene-
ficiaries would finance, through funds available under on-going credit
programs, the full cost of pumping sets, which, including contingencies,
would amount to US$13.5 million equivalent. The remainder, US$70.2 million
equivalent, would be financed out of budgetary allocations to OIIDR. When
contingencies are allocated to proper investment categories, the financial
scheme is as follows:
Government   Users   Bank   Total   Percentage
------------ US$ million --------
Engineering                  4.6           -      0.7    5.3         3.7

The Bank loan would be made to Nacional Financiera S.A. (para 3.01), for a
term of 17 years, including four years of grace, at the interest rate of
7.35% p.a. Nacional Financiera would pass the funds on to the Government
of Mexico, which would guarantee the loan.
I. Procurement
Civil Works
3.15      Currently, OHDR executes by force account all engineering studies
and about 30% of the irrigation and drainage networks and on-farm works.
Construction of wells, pumping plants and dams and the balance of the irri-
gation and drainage networks and on-farm works are contracted out following
satisfactory local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures, or negotiated
contracts, which are appropriated when the small size of the works or the
remoteness of the area would result in higher construction cost if LCB proce-
dures were followed. Mexican laws set forth an upper limit of Mex.$500,000
(US$22,000) for negotiated contracts; in practice, however, appropriate
justification on a case-by-case basis has increased that limit up to Mex$3
million (US$130,000), which appears reasonable in view of the present level of
costs and prices. Under this set of circumstances, contracts for civil works
would be let under OHDR's ordinary procedures.
Equipment
3.16      Regarding equipment to be partly financed by the proposed Bank
loan, procurement procedures would be as follows:
Equipment for            Cost Estimate            Procedure

J. Disbursements
3.17      To símplify administrative procedures, the proceeds of the Bank loan
would be disbursed under two categories, applying the appropriate disbursement
percentage to the total cost of each category. Definition of categories,
allocation of Bank loan and percentage disbursement would be as follows:
Total Amount              Bank Loan
US$             US$         Disbursement
Category                         million          million        Percentage

Total                                                  60.0
3.18      Disbursement request for works carried out by force account would
be made against certificate of expenditures; the documentation for these
expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank but would be retained by
the Borrower for inspection by the Bank during the course of project super-
vision missions. Disbursement request for acquisition of equipment or works
carried out by contract would be fully documented.
3.19      The Bank loan is expected to be disbursed over a períod of four
years (calendar years 1979-82). The estimated schedule of disbursements
is in Annex 1, Table 15.
K. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.20      The PNDR, as presently organized, includes an effective system
for monitoring and evaluating the sub-projects. Data reflecting the physical
progress of project execution are compiled by the Subdirectorate of Monitoring
and Statistics of ORDR (para 2.05). The proposed project would be monitored
through these existing institutional arrangements. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that SARH would furnish promptly to the Bank annual
Project Implementation Reports to cover physical and financial progress of
procurement of equipment and execution of civil and on-farm works. Regarding
agricultural development, SARH and the Bank would agree during the course of



- 24 -
project implementation, on defining a representative sample of sub-projects
on which monitoring and evaluation of project impact would be carried out.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SARH would furnish to the
Bank annual Agricultural Development Reports (period October 1-September 30)
on or before March 31 of the following year on the sample of sub-projects
agreed upon, the first of these reports to be presented not later than March
31, 1981.
L. Accounts and Auditing
3.21      The Subdirectorate of Administrative Services of OHDR (para 2.03)
is in charge of the accounting functions and, therefore, would be responsible
for the accounts of the proposed project. Assurances were obtained during
negotiatíons that separate accounts would be established and kept for the
proposed Bank project with appropriate identification of sources (Government,
users or Bank) and application of funds.
3.22      SARH accounts are subject to the internal control of its Directorate
General of Auditing, which is satisfactory. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the separate project accounts would be audited annually
in accordance with the Government's procedures and that such audited accounts,
together with the auditor's statement, would be promptly furnished to the
Bank.
IV. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
A. Irrigation Sub-projects
4.01      Four sub-projects were selected to represent the irrigation compo-
nent--the most significant one--of PNDR. Two sub-projects are based on
groundwater development: one, Valle de Canindo (Michoacan), represents the
shift from rainfed to irrigated agriculture in the central region, where
annual rainfall averages about 900 mm generally concetrated during the June-
October period, which permits one cropping season; the other, Los Laguneros
(Baja California Sur), is an example of the arid conditions of the vast
northern and northwestern regions of Mexico, where without irrigation, agricul-
ture provides only a marginal subsistence. The third irrigation sub-project,
Dos Rayas (Veracruz), which is based on a pumping plant taking water from a
tributary (Tempoal river) of the Panuco river, is located in the low lands of
the basin, a region where the annual rainfall fluctuates around 700 mm, but is
very erratic and the average yields of basic crops (maize and beans) are well
below one ton per ha. The fourth sub-project, Santa Teresa (Zacatecas), is
based on a storage dam that would regulate the flow of the Montescobedo river
(Lerma basin), in the high lands (1,915 m.a.s.1.) of the Central Region, where
annual rainfall is about 500 mm and its unfavorable and unreliable distribution
does not permit commercial agriculture.



- 25 -
4.02      In projecting agricultural development, actual data from on-going
similar sub-projects were considered. With few justified exceptions, crops
projected under future conditions would be the same as presently grown,
without dramatic shifts toward high value crops but with substantial increases
in yields and cropping intensities brought about by irrigation and, in addition,
by improvements in farming techniques and use of credit; as experience demon-
strates, such results are very seldom achieved by small farmers under rainfed
conditions due to the risks derived from an unreliable and often insufficient
rainfall. Based on the current status of PNDR, construction periods for
groundwater and pumping plant sub-projects were estimated at one year where
the irrigation area was less than 300 ha and two years if larger.  Storage
dams are usually built in two years, and, including completion of the area
development works, the construction period was estimated at three years.
Full agricultural development would be reached in three to four years after
completing the infrastructure works. Investments, agricultural development
and farm budgets of irrigation sub-projects are presented in Annex 1 (Tables
16 through 31). A summary of the technical assumptions supporting the projected
agricultural development of irrigation sub-projects is presented below:

Total    160
B.  Drainage Sub-Projects
4.03     In extensive zones of the south, the Isthmus and Peninsular Region,
rainfall is excessive so that vast areas otherwise suitable for commercial
agriculture suffer from floods that prevent use of the land during the heaviest
rainy season (May-December), introduce a severe risk element in crop production
during the rest of the year, or force farmers to use their lands as natural
pastures with a low level of productivity. Given the uniformity of technical
features, the selected sub-project, Nacajuca (Tabasco), provides adequate
representation of the PNDR drainage component.
4.04     Projected agricultural development would consist of introducing
rice, a crop well suited to the conditions of the area, as a second crop in
a rotation following beans, and improving the natural pastures now existing
on rangelands. Investments, agricultural development and farm budgets of
drainage sub-projects are presented in Annex 1 (Tables 32 through 35); tech-
nical assumptions are summarized below:

Total             110
C. Livestock Sub-projects
4.05      Most of the projected infrastructure schemes for supporting livestock
development would be for dual-purpose cattle, although a few dairy, beef and
small species operations are also foreseen. To represent the livestock
component of the project, a dual-purpose cattle development sub-project,
Miguel Hidalgo (Quintana Roo), was selected. The sub-project would consist of
the rehabilitation of existing pastures on about half of the ejido lands and
establishing new pastures on lands today unproductive. The livestock operation
would be started with the acquisition through credit, over a period of three
years, of about 60% of the maximum number of cows that the pastures could
support at full development. Thus, the initial herd would gradually grow to
reach its maximum size over eight to 10 years. To optimize the return on the
iírvestments, infrastructure works--pasture development, fencing, corrals and
installations--would be phased according to the herd's build-up; thus, actual
animal load would be, even during the first years, approximately equal to the
ranch's carrying capacity. The on-farm works investment program would be

V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Production, Demand and Marketing
5.01      The proposed project would assist in expanding the area under
irrigation and drainage and would result in increases in the production of
basic foodgrains, oilseeds and milk and meat. Based on projected land use and
production of the selected sub-projects (Annex 1, Tables 18, 26, 30, 34 and
37), and taking into account the area represented by each of them (para 3.01),
the incremental project production, at full development, is estimated as
follows:
('000 m ton)
Maize                                             59.5
Beans                                             25.0
Sorghum                                           13.3
Rice                                              10.8
Wheat                                             53.6
Tomato                                            13.4
Barley                                            25.0
Chile                                              2.3
Milk                                              15.1
Beef                                               4.6
Based on average 1977 farmgate prices, the annual value of incremental output
of project production at full development would be approximately Mex$520.8
million (US$22.6 million). The distribution of these production gains would
be the result of increased productivity among the beneficiaries of infrastruc-
ture provided under the project.
5.02      Given the shortfalls in the production of major crops experienced
in the recent period, the domestic demand prospects for project output are
favorable. Increases in current agricultural production have not been
sufficient to meet the rising demands of a rapidly increasing population,
particularly for basic foodgrains.
5.03      Domestic beef prices, which fluctuate freely, have increased from
Mex$6.5 per kg in 1971 to Mex$13.8 per kg in 1977 reflecting the continuing
strong domestic market demand for beef. With rising per capita incomes, a
high income elasticity of demand and rapid population growth, the long-term
prospects for the domestic market are bright. In addition, the improvement
in export prices in US dollar terms for both feeder cattle and boneless beef
in 1976 has resulted in a rapid recovery of exports. Per capita consumption
of milk has also registered a strong increase, growing at the rate of 5.9%
annually during the 1970-75 period while production increased at only 4.8%
annually. Domestic demand has thus been met by supplementary imports of
milk powder. Future demand is expected to continue to be strong and, coupled
with recent increases in the price of milk, indicate good prospects for milk
producers. Based on the present annual growth rate of Mexico's population of



- 28 -
about 3.3%, an increase in per capita income of about 3% per year and an
income elasticity of demand of about 0.4, an increase in the demand for
foodstuffs of about 4.5% p.a. can be expected. Incremental project production,
particularly of basic foodgrains, could substitute for imports otherwise
needed to meet rising domestic demand.
5.04      Given the size of individual sub-projects, their geographical
dispersion and the nature of their output (mainly basic crops), it is expected
that most of the project's production would be marketed through the National
Marketing Corporation (CONASUPO), which admínisters a farm price support
program for basic grains, state retail distribution outlets for foodstuffs,
and several major agroindustries. The CONASUPO system is particularly
beneficial to small farmers due to its extensive network of rural stores that
collect produce and pay for it promptly.  The government has sought to use the
CONASUPO price support system as a mechanism to provide greater incentives for
the production of basic foodstuffs such as wheat and maize. Support prices
for these commodities have risen during the 1970-77 period and are generally
in line with world prices, with the exception of maize, which is substantially
higher.
5.05      Beef prices are not guaranteed nor does the government have a
national procurement grid.  The domestic beef market has been traditionally
dominated by a supply of lean animals in the immediate areas of consumption
which are processed in local slaughterhouses. In recent years, packing plants
have begun to market quality meat principally through the direct sale of
refrigerated meat to supermarkets.  This new marketing channel has been
closely associated with the growing supply of finished cattie from the tropics.
In addition, exports of beef to the United States constitute an important
market channel, principally for feeder calves from northern Mexico or for
boneless beef. Project output would, therefore, be handled through these
existing private market channels, depending on regional location and other
factors.
5.06      Milk prices to the farmer, pasteurizing plants and the consumer are
set by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  Only about 25% of marketed milk
is pasteurized, with 4% sold as cheese and 2% as cream or butter. Current
official regional prices to the producer vary throughout Mexico and have been
increased by the government some 40% since 1975 as an incentive to farmers and
pasteurizing plants to increase production. It is expected that most of the
project output will be marketed as raw milk for local consumption in regional
markets.
B. Beneficiaries
5.07      By bringing some 56,000 ha under irrigation, providing drainage to
about 36,000 ha and developing 58,000 ha for livestock, the project would
benefít about 30,000 families of low-income farmers well within the poverty
target group, generating substantial increases in income levels as indicated
in the table below. As a further reference, the table presents also the



- 29 -
estimated level of income of hired workers in each region, based on the
legal minimum salaries and the employment opportunities, as measured by the
coefficients (para 5.14 c) used to shadow rate labor in the rural sector
throughout the country.

/1   Represents income from livestock production only.
To ensure that project benefits would accrue to low-income farmers and that
the number of beneficiaries would be as large as possible, assurances were
obtained during negotiations that: (a) project beneficiaries would have
a pre-project annual income from farming activities not higher than US$2,500
per family; and (b) for each sub-project, average investment per family
would not exceed US$10,000.
5.08      The project would also make a substantial contribution to employ-
ment in the rural sector. Approximately 8,300 man-years of on-farm employment
would be created, plus an additional 11,700 man-years of employment during the
construction period of project works.
C. Project Charges
Operation and Maintenance
5.09      Following current practices under PNDR, project beneficiaries,
through their users' association, would be fully responsible for the opera-
tion and maintenance (0 & M) of sub-project facilities (para 2.08). As a
part of the active role played by the users' associations, O & M activities
are actually carried out by the beneficiaries themselves; full cost of labor
is either paid in cash or credited to the individual worker. Additional
expenditures (such as power, repairs, administrative costs and the like)
are met through O & M charges imposed and efficiently collected by the
users' associations. In groundwater and pumping sub-projects, O & M charges,
which usually include a provision for major repairs and replacements, are



- 30 -
related to volumetric consumption (generally a tariff per hour) while in
surface sub-projects are estimated on a per ha basís. The present level
of annual 0 & M charges fluctuates around Mex$300 per ha for storage-
dam-type sub-projects, Mex$900 per ha for pumping plants and Mex$1,000
per ha for groundwater. While no previous experience exists with drainage
and livestock sub-projects, beneficiaries of these projects would also
pay for the full 0 & M costs, which are expected to be much lower
(between Mex$150-200 per ha for drainage sub-projects and around Mex$50
for livestock sub-projects).
Investment Recovery
5.10      While the principle of users' participation in project financing
is explicitly set forth and quantified in the Participation Agreements
(para 2.08), actual practices vary according to the different types of
sub-projects as follows:
(a) groundwater sub-projects: users' contribution toward investment
cost consists of financing, through on-going credit programs for
low income producers, the purchase of the pumping sets for
equiping the wells; and
(b) other type of sub-projects: contribution through labor during
construction period is credited to the users; the remainder up
to 30% of investment cost, bearing an interest rate of 3.5%
p.a., is to be met through annual payments over a period of
25 years including four of grace (identical terms and conditions
than the IDB loan of January 1975).
5.11      The above practices would apply to the proposed project.  To that
aim, assurances were obtained during negotiations that, for each sub-project,
water charges would be imposed and collected to fully cover O & M costs and
recover a proportion of investment costs in accordance with current practices
under PNDR, taking into account both the beneficiaries' payment capacity and
the need to maintain an incentive for them to make the best use of land and
water resources.
Cost and Rent Recovery Indices
5.12      Cost and rent recovery indices (CRI and RRI) were calculated according
to the criteria outlined above. For groundwater sub-projects, long-term loans
for financing the acquisition of pumping sets were considered at the prevailing
terms and conditions for low-income producers: up to 15 years, including up to
four of grace, at the rate of 11% p.a. For all other type of sub-projects
farmers contribution through labor was estimated at 10% of investment; cash
payments were calculated to repay the remaining 20% under terms and conditions
defined in 5.10(b) above. In all cases annual payments covered full 0 & M
costs and a contribution toward investment (Annex 1, Tables 19, 23, 27, 31
and 35). Results are presented in Annex 1, Table 40 and summarized as follows:

D. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
5.13      In calculating the rate of ,eeturn to the economy, the following
assumptions and adjustments were made:
(a) Investment and operating costs were calculated using 1978
prices and were assumed to remain constant in real terms;
(b) Output prices utilized were farmgate prices for the economic
analysis, except for maize, wheat, soybeans, sorghum, rice and
cotton, which were recalculated according to international
prices and adjusted for handling, processing and transport
costs to reach a farmgate equivalent. The future prices in
constant terms of these commodities and for beef were assumed
to fluctuate in accordance with an index of EPD projections
for 1978-85. These prices appear in Annex 1, Table 41;
(c) Shadow wages for labor were estimated for representative
models on the basis of regional variations in unemployment
and underemployment for unskilled labor in the rural sector.
Rates utilized are as follows:
Sub-project (State)
Valle de Canindo (Michoacan)                         0.6
Los Laguneros (Baja Calif. Sur)                      1.0
Dos Rayas (Veracruz)                                 0.8
Santa Teresa (Zacatecas)                             0.5
Nacajuca (Tabasco)                                   0.6
Miguel Hidalgo (Quintana Roo)                        0.5
(d)  The exchange rate utilized was the average market rate of
Mex$23 = US$1. No attempt was made to shadow price this rate;
(e) Since taxes are transfer payments within the economy, they
were excluded, to the extent possible, from the economic rate
of return calculations;
(f)  Incremental herd values were credited to the benefit stream of
the livestock development model; and
(g)  Costs and benefits were phased to reflect the estimated rate
of project implementation; economic life of sub-projects was
estimated at 25 years.



- 32 -
5.14      Based on these assumptions, the economic rates of return of repre-
sentative sub-projects are calculated in Annex 1, Table 42 and summarized
below.
Sub-project                    Type                     ERR (%)
Valle de Canindo               Deep Wells                   24
Los Laguneros                  Deep Wells                   32
Dos Rayas                      Pumping Plant                30
Santa Teresa                   Storage Dam                  18
Nacajuca                       Drainage                     26
Miguel Hidalgo                 Livestock Development        16
When weighted according to investment cost aggregated bv type of sub-project
the overall rate of return of the project is estimated at 23%.
5.15      Sensitivity analysis was performed on individual sub-projects with
the results summarized in Annex 1, Table 42. In all cases, rates of return
are more sensitive to variations in benefits. With the exception of livestock
and drainage models, returns are relatively more sensitive to changes iír invest-
ment costs than to changes in operating costs, which indicates the necessity
of keeping the investment costs per ha as low as possible, and the concurrent
need to tie infrastructure development to on-farm improvements in yields and
cropping patterns.
E. Project Risk
5.16      OHDR has a proven record as a successful implementing agency for
small-scale irrigation works. The risk of shortfalls in the attainment of
project goals is thus highest in sub-projects for drainage and livestock
development, which constitute relatively new components of the program.
However, given the strength of the institution and the low technical
complexity of these types of sub-projects, this constitutes an acceptable
risk for the project.
F. Environmental Impact
5.17      As a side benefit of the project, potable water and electrification
would be brought to small villages in selected rural areas. No negative
effects are foreseen, given the small size of individual sub-projects and
their geographical dispersion.

VI. ASSURANCES OBTAINED DURING NEGOTIATIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that SARH would:
(a) furnish to the Bank, for approval, a "Summary Sheet` according
to the outline presented in Annex 1, Table 6, for each irrigation
andlor drainage sub-project to be financed under the proposed
loan (para 3.08);
(b) furnish to the Bank, for approval, a full feasibility report
(Expediente Integrado) for each livestock infrastructure sub-
project to be financed under the proposed loan (para 3.09);
(c) furnish promptly to the Bank annual Project Implementation
Reports to cover physical and financial progress of procurement
of equipment and execution of civil and on-farm works (para 3.20);
(d) furnish to the Bank annual Agricultural Development Reports
(periods October 1-September 30) on or before March 31 of the
following year, on the sample of sub-projects agreed upon, the
first of these reports to be presented not later than March 31,
1981 (para 3.20);
(e) establish and keep separate accounts for the proposed Bank
project with appropriate identification of sources (Government,
users or Bank) and application of funds (para 3.21);
(f)  have the project accounts audited annually according to its
ordinary procedures and furnish promptly to the Bank the project
accounts, together with the auditor's statement (para 3.22);
(g) select project beneficiaries with a pre-project annual family
income from their farming activities not higher than US$2,500
equivalent (para 5.07);
(h) for each sub-project, limit the average investment per family
to a maximum of US$10,000 (para 5.07); and
(i)  impose and collect annual charges so that the beneficiaries'
total contribution would fully cover O & M cost and recover a
proportion of investment costs in accordance with present
practices under PNDR (para 5.11).
6.02      With the above assurances, the proposed project would constitute
a suitable basis for a Bank loan to Nacional Financiera S.A. (NAFINSA) of
US$60 million, for a term of 17 years, including a grace period of four
years, with interest at the rate of 7.35% p.a.; the loan would be guaranteed
by the Government of Mexico (para 3.14).
