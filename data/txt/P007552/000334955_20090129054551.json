Of the total cost of the\n            project, US$143.7, about 77 percent was going to be invested\n            in irrigation, 12 percent in drainage and 11 percent in\n            livestock infrastructure. Beneficiaries were going to\n            participate in financing construction of the works, and they\n            would also cover the full cost of operating and maintaining\n            the schemes. About 22,300 rural families benefited directly\n            as a result of the project, with indirect employment of\n            another 10,000 expected. The estimated economic rate of\n            return (ERR), excluding the livestock component, was 12\n            percent. The result is lower than the ERR of 23 percent\n            estimated at appraisal because of the following differences:\n            (a) economic prices during the project implementation period\n            were lower than those projected at appraisal; (b) the total\n            area benefited by investment on irrigation and drainage was\n            smaller by about 25 percent and the project total cost\n            somewhat higher by about 20 percent than those estimated at\n            appraisal; (c) about 15 percent of tube well investments\n            were lost due to unproductive wells; and (d) subproject\n            investments, specially storage dams, took longer to\n            construct than expected at appraisal."}, "docdt": "1988-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
