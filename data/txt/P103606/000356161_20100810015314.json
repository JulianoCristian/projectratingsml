{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Sustainable Health\n            System Development Project for Madagascar were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: project management on the Bank side needs\n            to be sufficiently thought through and adequately funded to\n            ensure that there is sufficient support to implementation.\n            An important contributing factor to the success of project\n            implementation was the strong management of the project by\n            the Bank and the implementing agency. With the Government\n            firmly in the driver seat, the investment was seen as the\n            next logical step in Bank support and was tailored with a\n            comprehensive view of the sector in mind. The project was\n            able to jump start implementation right after effectiveness\n            because it took advantage of the capacity built in the areas\n            of procurement and financial management. The implementation\n            arrangements took advantage of Ministry of Health, Family\n            Planning and Social Protection (MOH) staff in these areas\n            that had been working on Bank projects. The project\n            implemented pilots as a strategic way to test interventions\n            with the intention of scaling up models that worked.\n            Therefore, baseline data was collected and there was\n            financing for proper evaluations. This should be considered\n            good practice in the context of Bank operations."}, "docdt": "2010-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
