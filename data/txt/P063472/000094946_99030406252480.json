          Project assists the government of Sri Lanka, on an urgent\n            basis, in its efforts to prevent possible business\n            disruption in the country's economic and financial\n            sectors as a result of the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem. This\n            project has two main components. The financial sector\n            component provides onlending, through the central bank\n            (CBSL), to the public banks and a few private banks for\n            their eligible Y2K-related expenditures including the cost\n            of consultants and equipment. It also finances technical\n            assistance for CBSL to conduct its scaled up Y2K monitoring\n            and supervision of banks. The government agencies component\n            finances the cost of required equipment, experts (local and\n            international) for various technical tasks, and short-term\n            training for staff of the institutions mentioned. A project\n            coordination unit will be set up to closely monitor\n            concerned agencies and to assist the planning and\n            implementation of their Y2K remediation activities."}, "docdt": "1998-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
