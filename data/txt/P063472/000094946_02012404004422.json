Some lessons drawn from the project\n            include: 1) The Y2K project shows that projects with focused\n            objectives and a clear scope have a better chance of\n            success. 2) The project was demand-driven and therefore\n            there was a firm commitment at the highest level in the\n            country. This shows that for successful project\n            implementation, leadership, management, and commitment are\n            the keys to success. 3) Part of success can be attributed to\n            good project preparation and project management. 4) Putting\n            the implementing agencies in the drivers seat and giving\n            them full responsibility for project implementation and\n            monitoring added to the project success and proved to be\n            beneficial in achieving the project objectives in a timely\n            manner. 5) Other elements of the project which contributed\n            to successful project implementation were rapid recognition\n            of the skill gaps and timely training programs/workshops and\n            independent testing, development of contingency plans,\n            effective project execution, widespread cooperation and team\n            work, effective communication, and involvement and\n            commitment at all levels. 6) In crisis or emergency\n            situations, there is an opportunity to accomplish what would\n            seem impossible under normal conditions."}, "docdt": "2001-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
