                                 Restructuring Paper12

1. The closing date for Afghanistan, Sustainable Development of Natural Resources Project
   1 (SDNRP1), H2380 & H5030, P0198118 will be extended from December 31, 2012 until
   May 31, 2013.

2.       In its fifth year of operation, the Afghanistan Sustainable Development Natural
Resources Project (SDNRP 1) continues to make satisfactory progress towards meeting its Project
Development Objective (PDO) of assisting the Ministry of Mines in improving its capacity to
effectively regulate Afghanistan's minerals and hydrocarbon resources sector in a transparent
manner and foster private sector development. Perhaps one of the most significant achievements
of the project includes stimulating private sector investment in Afghanistan by facilitating the
successful tender of the Aynak copper deposit, one of the largest such deposits in the world. The
government has concluded the contractual agreements with China Metallurgical Group
Corporation (MCC) which was awarded the tender. The total amount of the investment will be
around US $10 billion over the next 5 to 10 years, and an initial payment of US $80 million has
been received by the government.

3.       Other major achievements under the project to date have included:

     a. Establishing a transparent and accountable in tender processes, highlighted by the
        successful Aynak and Hajigak transactions which was supported at all stages by the
        International Advisory Panel (IAP);

     b. Supporting the implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
        and the complementary disclosure of mining-generated revenues;

     c. Increasing oversight and enforcement capacity of agencies such as the Mines Inspectorate
        and the National Environmental Protection Agency;

     d. Strengthening of the MoM departments responsible for cadastre and mine title
        management;

     e. Supporting archeological activities and cultural preservation at Mes Aynak;


4. The project objectives do remain achievable. The proposed extension is necessary to allow
   the project to meet select core results indicators (see Annex 1) prior to closing. The Ministry
   of Mines has drafted an action plan to meet those objectives and complete the project.

5. The audit report for SDNRP 1 was submitted to the World Bank on December 7, 2012.

6.     This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension was for a period of 17
months, from the original closing date of July 31, 2011 to the current date of December 31, 2012.
