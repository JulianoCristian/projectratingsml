The project has four components:\n            1. improving Ministry of mines' internal efficiencies;\n            2. developing regulatory capacity; 3. developing mineral\n            resources; and 4. improving sector governance. The Ministry\n            of mines has submitted an updated implementation action plan\n            which takes into account some of the difficulties, primarily\n            with regard to strengthening its procurement capacities. An\n            improvement of disbursement rates is already visible since\n            FY 2011. This will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
