                         The project is making good projects with respect to its original Project Development Objectives of assisting the Ministry of Mines in improving its capacity to effectively regulate
                         Afghanistan's minerals and hydrocarbon resources sector in a transparent manner and foster private sector development. The individual components, i.e. the improvement of

                         administrative efficiencies, the development of regulatory capacities, the promotion of private sector led development of mineral resources and the building up of sector governance
                         are progressing well.
                         Given the stepped up activities around the Aynak copper deposit development, the project has reacted and is putting stronger emphasis around environmental and social capacity
                         building and regulation. Therefore the project will lend more support to the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) through training and the provision of a Board of Experts,
                         collaborate more closely with the Government to maintain high social standards in the resettlement process of villagers in the Aynak valley, and, finally, support the archaeological
                         rescuing process to safeguard Buddhist relics around the planned coper mine.
