                         of effectiveness, SDNRP1 continues to make satisfactory progress towards meeting its Project Development Objective (PDO) of assisting the Ministry of Mines in improving its
                         capacity to effectively regulate Afghanistan's minerals and hydrocarbon resources sector in a transparent manner and foster private sector development. Major achievements with
                         regard to the development objectives of SDNRP include:
                         1) Drafting a new mineral law based on international good practice, which has undergone extensive consultations and is currently under review at the Ministry of Justice,

                         2) Ensuring transparency and accountability in tender processes, highlighted by the successful Aynak and Hajigak transactions which was supported at all stages by the International
                         Advisory Panel (IAP),
                         3) Implementing EITI and the complementary disclosure of mining-generated revenues,
                         4) Substantially increasing in the capacities of key sector institutions such as the Ministry of Mines, the Cadastre office and the Geological Survey, and
                         5) increasing enforcement capabilities of agencies such as the Mines Inspectorate and the National Environmental Protection Agency.

                         Private sector development is being supported through the adoption of policies, such as a good practice Resettlement Policy Framework, the continuous availability through the IAP
                         which has expanded its expertise to include transport infrastructure, and the ability of the regulating agencies to answer on a variety of social and environmental issues. Furthermore,
                         the project has put in substantial effort to promote the Aynak operation with a parallel emphasis on safeguarding the Mes Aynak antiquities, in close collaboration with cultural experts
                         and scientists.

                         The project has also made satisfactory progress towards meeting its intermediate results, with most of them already having been met. Progress has been made in the following areas:
                         1) the recent transactions for both mining and oil were reviewed by the Ministry with additional support by the IAP,
                         2) the number of both exploration licenses and actual operations is continuing to increase, including for the petroleum sector.

                         Other key highlights during the recent months include substantial progress: i) around the archaeological recovery works in Mes Aynak; ii) significant improvements in the
                         Government's monitoring capacity, reinforced by training of mining inspectors; iii) the modernization cadastre; and iv) the successful recruitment of a firm which will monitor the social
                         and environmental contractual obligations of the Aynak operator. In addition, the project-supported tender process for the Hajigak mine has reached another milestone with the
                         Government working on the ancillary infrastructure agreements. Compliance on environmental and social standards is on track, with two public workshops having been conducted for
                         the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), which is currently in the final draft phase with the Ministry. The Ministry has also submitted the Resettlement Action
                         Plan to the Bank, and the grievance redress mechanisms and institutions, including an ombudsman are being currently set up. The project remains also effective regarding the
                         improvement of sector governance by increasing transparency, mainly through support to the EITI initiative. The latter is now in a very active phase, conducting the process towards
                         production of its first independent reconciliation report, and also preparing the validation process.

                         However, given the complexities of working in the country and the need to adapt to continuously changing circumstances, procurement has been slow and disbursements low. For
                         these reason ratings for progress towards achievement of the PDO and overall implementation progress has been downgraded. Plans are being developed to overcome those factors
                         effecting procurement and disbursements that are under the projects control.
