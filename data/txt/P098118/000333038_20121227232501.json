The closing date for the project\n            will be extended from December 31, 2012 until May 31, 2013.\n            The major achievements under the project to date have\n            included: 1) establishing a transparent and accountable in\n            tender processes, highlighted by the successful Aynak and\n            Hajigak transactions which was supported at all stages by\n            the International Advisory Panel (IAP); 2) supporting the\n            implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency\n            Initiative (EITI) and the complementary disclosure of\n            mining-generated revenues; 3) increasing oversight and\n            enforcement capacity of agencies such as the Mines\n            Inspectorate and the National Environmental Protection\n            Agency; 4) strengthening of the Ministry of Mines (MoM)\n            departments responsible for cadastre and mine title\n            management; and 5) supporting archeological activities and\n            cultural preservation at Mes Aynak. The extension is\n            necessary to allow the project to meet select core results\n            indicators prior to closing. The MoM has drafted an action\n            plan to meet those objectives and complete the project. This\n            will be the second extension of the project. The first\n            extension was for a period of 17 months, from the original\n            closing date of July 31, 2011 to the current date of\n            December 31, 2012."}, "docdt": "2012-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
