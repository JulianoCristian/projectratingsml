The\n            main objectives of Power V were to: continue ongoing sector\n            policy reforms, which had begun to help improve the\n            technical and commercial efficiency of Electricity\n            Corporation of Ghana (ECG), enhance ECG's capability to\n            deliver a reliable, economic supply of electricity to its\n            customers, and assist Government of Ghana (GOG) in\n            developing a long-term power sector development strategy and\n            an electrification program. The project's outcome\n            overall was satisfactory with respect to most of its\n            technical and institutional objectives. International\n            Development Association (IDA) performance overall was\n            satisfactory. The performance of GOG and ECG was\n            satisfactory overall. The major lessons learned in project\n            implementation were the following: (a) Promoting\n            commercialization in an adverse structural environment; (b)\n            Performance management contract; (c) Structuring\n            co-financing arrangements; (d) Streamlining the procurement\n            process; and (e) Utility Finances."}, "docdt": "1997-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
