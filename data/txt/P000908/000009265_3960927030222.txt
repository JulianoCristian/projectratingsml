FIFTH POWER PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                    Republic of Ghana
Beneficiary:                 Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG)
Amount:                       SDR 30.3 million (US$40 million)
Terms:                       Stan%dard IDA, with 40 years maturity
Onlending Terms:             The Credit would be onlent for 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period at the
prevailing Bank of Ghana discount rate. The
onlending rate would be reviewed annually.
Government would bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Project Description:         The proposed project would continue the ongoing
sector policy reforms started under the Power
Rehabilitation Project, Credit 1628-GH, so as
to help establish ECG as a commercially-
oriented entity, capable of delivering a
reliable and economic supply of electricity to
its customers. The project would also assAst
the Government to develop a comprehensive
sector development strategy and long-term
electrification program.
The proposed project would comprise
institutional development, investment, and
sector planning components. Institutional
development would focus on the
commercialization of ECG through: (i)
completion of the management reorganization;
(ii) financial restructuring; (iii) a
performance "contract" with GOG to improve
ECG's efficiency as a power utility, comprising
performance targets for the period through 1993
and incentives to reward improved productivity;
(iv) a manpower reduction (about 202 of the
labor force), staff development and training
program; and (v) a program of technical
aesistance from a mature power utility. The
investment would consist of: (i) ECG's total
capital expenditure through 1992, comprising
subtransmission, distribution and
telecommunications equipment, tools and
materials, vehicles, and staff housing. A
sector development strategy would be formulated
through studies of long-term subtransmission
and distribution expansion needs.



- ii -
Project Benefits & Risks    An adequate and reliable supply of power is
essential for continued economic recovery and
growth and to provide basic value-for-money to
customers. Funding for the ongoing
rehabilitation of ECG and its distribution
system is now fully committed. The proposed
project is essential to entsure the availability
of foreign exchange and avoid any interruption
to the present program. There are no unusual
physical risks attached to the project.
Institutional risks would be minimized through
the ongoing technical assistance program from
the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland.

ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. Energy Resources and Consumption
1.01     Ghana has substantial energy resources, of which fuelwood and
hydropower are the most important. About 18.3 million hectares are under
tree cover, equivalent to three quarters of the country's land area, of
which about 8.8 million hectares is forest. The high forest zone is
concentrated in the southwest, where most of the t1.mber industry is
located. The northern savanna woodland has less timber potential, but is
the most important source of domestic fuelwood. Deforestation is a growing
problem in this area and fuelwood scarcities are beginning to develop as a
result.
1.02     Ghana's hydroelectric poteiLtial has been the subject of many
studies, some dating from the 1920s but which have mainly covered specific
projects or regions. The country's total technically exploitable hydro
potential is estimated at 10,000 GWh annually (2,000 MW), derived mainly
from three major river systems (Volta, Tano, Pra) in the central and
western regions. The presently installed hydro plant capacity is 1,072 MW,
based on two dams on the Volta River. Other sites on the Black Volta, Pra,
Tano and Oti rivers have been studied to pre-feasibility stage and one of
these, Bui (450 MW and 1,175 GWh) has been studied to full feasibility
level. However, the cost of developing these sites is higher than that of
thermal alternatives at present fuel prices. There has been no
comprehensive, country-wide survey of small hydro potential, although some
of 40 recently identified sites could possibly provide an economic supply
to isolated centers.
1.03     Offshore deposits of both crude oil and natural gas have been
identified at Saltpond, Tano and Cape Three Points, but their size remains
to be confirmed. Further field evaluation work is being carried out under
the ongoing Energy Project (Credit 1373-GH, May 1983). Ghana has no known
deposits of solid hydrocarbons. Solar energy is plentiful with most
regions receiving in excess of 1,900 hours of annual sunshine. This
potential has not yet been exploited to any extent. Wind regimes are
moderate, and insufficient for er,ergy purposes based on existing
technology.
1.04     Net energy consumption in 1987 is estimated at 3.4 million toe,
rather low given the structure of the economy and its favorable energy
resource endowment. The bulk of consumption is woodfuel (66%) followed by
petroleum products (20%), electricity (10%) and agricultural residues (4Z).
Commercial energy consumption increased steadily throughout the 1970s and
early 1980s despite the deteriorating economy, spurred by subsidized



- 2 -
petroleum products and low real prices for electricity. However,
consumption declined sharply after 1982 becauae of shortages of both
petroleum and electricity, but have since recovered as supply conditions
returned to normal. The transport (34Z), industry and mining (26z) and
household (222) sectors account for most commercial energy consumption. An
overall energy balance for Ghana is contained in Annex 1-1. Energy sector
issues were examined in considerable detail as part of the UNDP/World Bank
Energy Sector Assessmer,t Program (ESMAP). This sector review report (Ref.
No. 1) 1 was discussed with the Government of Ghana (GOG) in September 1986
and, subsequently three ESMAP projects are underway in an effort to improve
industrial and household energy efficiency.
B. Energy Sector Organization
1.05     The Ministry of Fuel and Power (KFP) has principal responsibility
for petroleum and electricity; it establishes and implements sector policy.
To strengthen overall energy sector planning, GOG has created a National
Energy Board (NEB). MFP supervises the state-owned Ghana National
Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), Ghana Oil Corporation (GOIL), and the
refining company Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Corporation (GHAIP), as well as
the two power sector entities -- the Volta River Authority (VRA) and the
Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG). VRA supplies electricity in bulk
to ECG, the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), several mines, the Akosombo
Textile Company, and Akosombo Township. VRA also exports electricity to
Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB) and Energie Electrique de la Cote
d'Ivoire (EECI). Under the ongoing IDA-assisted Northern Grid Extension
Project (NOGPEX) (Credit 1759-GH) of February 1987, the responsibility for
generating and distributing electricity in northern Ghana was transferred
to VRA from ECG. ECG distributes the electricity it receives from VRA
throughout the rest of Ghana, and also operates five isolated diesel
stations, four of which would be eliminated under the proposed project.
1.06     Since its foundation in 1961, VRA has operated as a quasi-enclave
within Ghana, is relatively small, has been well-managed and has enjoyed a
high degree of autonomy. ECG, on the other hand, is a much larger
organization, set up in 1967 to succeed the Electricity Division of the
Ministry of Works and Housing, but has never satisfactorily made the
transition from a Government department. It has suffered from ineffective
manageme-nt and has failed to establish itself as an autonomous and
effective public utility. In an effort to improve performance of the power
sector, the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland (ESB), acting as consultant
to GOG, studied the situation in 1985 and concluded that a merger of 'IRA
and ECG offered the best prospect for the future development of the sector
(Ref. No. 2). GOG, with the concurrence of IDA, considered that a merger
would have strained VRA's capabilities, particularly at a time when it was
embarking upon a major expansion program in northern Ghana. ECG's position
was extremely weak, both financially and managerially, and required major
reforms and external assistance to establish it as a sound public utility.
Consequently, the merger did not proceed but was retained as one of several
1/ Selected documents available in the Project File are listed at Annex
3-1, and are referred to in this report by their reference numbers in
that listing.



- 3 -
sector organization options, to be considered in the light of ECG's
performance in the next few years.
1.07     In the short term, attention has been focussed upon sector reforms
and other measures needed to strengthen ECG. ESB was commissioned to carry
out a complete diagnostic study (Ref. No. 3) of ECG's organization,
management, operations and personnel needs, under the ongoing Power System
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1628-GH), of September 1985. The study
provided a satisfactory basis for improving ECG's performance and ESB is
currently assisting ECG to implement the agreed recommendations. While a
sound start has been made in reforming ECG, the task will take several
years and, consequently, its continuation would constitute a major
component of the proposed project. Progress would be monitored through a
performance contract which would focus on key institutional and operational
areas for improvement and which would establish monitorable targets (para.
1.37).
C. Energy Policy and Pricing
1.08     Government policy in the energy sector is designed tot (i) reduce
the cost of energy supplies to the economy through rehabilitation and
proper maintenance of installations in the petroleum and electricity sub-
sectors; (ii) reduce dependence on petroleum imports through accelerated
exploration of Ghana's basins and the promotion of more efficient ener-v
use and proper pricing; (iii) improve forestry management to provide a;
adequate long-term supply of fuelwood; and (iv) strengthen sector
institutions through a program of public enterprise reform focusing on
commercialization.
1.09     Prices of petroleum products and electricity fell sharply in real
terms from the mid-1970s till 1983, as a result of high domestic inflation
and over-valued exchange rates during that period. After the major
devaluation of the Cedi in 1983, domestic energy prices were increased very
sharply to bring them back into line with their international equivalents.
Subsequent increases have generally kept up with the successive
devaluations. Petroleum product prices are now above international levels
and are unsubsidized. Some inter-product price distortions exist,
particularly with regard to kerosene. Based on recent studies,
satisfactory pricing arrangements have been established for both
electricity and petroleum products. Electricity pricing is discussed below
(paras. 1.21-1.23).
D. Existing Electricity SupplY Facilities
1.10     Ghana's total installed public generating capacity is about 1,122
MW of which 1,072 MW (95Z) is hydroelectric from two stations on the Volta
River at Akosombo (912 MW), and Kpong (160 MW).  Both stations are owned by
VRA and are capable of providing firm energy (in 49 years out of 50) of
4,792 GWh/year and can deliver 6,055 GWh/year on average.  Total diesel
capacity is about 50 MW of which Tema (30 MW) is the largest and is
currently being rehabilitated with U.K. financing. The remainder comprises
a slumber of small stations most of which will be retired under the NOGREX
and the proposed projects.



- 4 -
1.11     Ghana's transmission system is shown on Map 21155, and comprises
over 1,300 km of 161 kV lines with a further 800 km now under construction
to improve supply in northern Ghana. Eight circuits of 67 km each connect
the Akosombo and Kpong hydro plants to the VALCO smelter at Tema and to
other industrial loads, while a 650 km transmission loop supplies ECG and
mines in southern Ghana. A 161 kV dovble circuit line provides an
interconnection with CEB, connecting Akosombo to Lome, Togo. The Cote
d'Ivoire was interconnected in 1983 through a 225 kV transmission line
capable of supplying a demand of 100 MW.
1.12     ECG distributes power in the urban centers located within an
interconnected grid in the southern part of Ghana. ECG's facilities
comprise a number of 33 kV subtransmission systems, feeding power from
VRA's transmission system, and a number of 11/0.4 kV distribution systems.
In recent years, service within the distribution system has deteriorated
due largely to poor maintenance and inadequate reinforcement of the
distribution system. The isolated systems serving small towns have even
more serious problems, arising from the age of the generating units and
lack of fuel and spare parts.  Most of these centers do not have 24-hour
supply and there is a high level of suppressed demand. These problems are
being addressed under the ongoing prcjects and the distribution system
rehabilitation would be completed under the proposed proiect.
1.13     Total captive generating capacity is estimatei at about 30 MW, of
whici about 23 MW is installed in six organizations in the mining and
timber industries, hospitals, the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation
(GWSC) and some commercial enterprises. With the notable exception of Mim
Timber Company (installed capacity 2.3 MW) captive capacity is mainly used
for standby purposes in the event of power failures.
E. Access to Electricity Service
1.14     In Ghana about 15X of the population has access to electricity.2
ECG has about 230,000 customers, 702 of whom are concentrated in the five
cities of Accra, Kumasi, Tema, Takoradi and Cape Coast. VRA has about
20,000 customers in northern Ghana and also supplies a small number of
major customers directly from the grid. About 75X of ECG's customers are
classified as residential and, although they account for about 47Z of
sales, most of them are low-income householders who consume under 200 kWh
monthly. About 5X of ECG's customers generate about 65% of its sales
revenues.
F. Trends and Pattern of Electricity Consumption and Exports
1.15     Domestic and export sales of electricity since 1978 are detailed
in Annex 1-2. Until the severe drought of 1982/84, when electricity
supplies were seriously curtailed, about 75% of sales were for export to
neighboring countries and to the enclave VALCO aluminum smelter. During
the drought the latter was completely shutdown and supplies to CEB and to
ECG were reduced. Total system sales fell from 5071 GWh in 1981 to 1594
GWh in 1984. Since 1985 supplies have been restored to all customers.
While exports have falleM somewhat as a result of the commissioning of
2/ Using a total population of about 13.5 million and a 10 person
household.



-5-
CEB's Nangbeto hydro-station and VALCO's lower demand (para 1.23), they
still constitute 70Z of the sector sales.
1.26     ECG's sales fell sharply as a result of supply restrictions from
1005 GWh in 1981 to 723 GWh in 1984, but have since recovered to 995 GWh in
1987, about 5% above the 1986 level, assisted by the improvements under the
ongoing rehabilitation project. Recent studies have shown that this upward
pressure of demand at an annual rate of about 5S is expected to continue
through the mid-1990's, as the system is progressively improved (Annex
113).
1.17     In the early 1980's ECG's system losses averaged about 122 but, as
a result of system deterioration and weaknesses in customer accounting,
have since risen to about 22Z. Under the ongoing and proposed projects
system lo3ses would be reduced progressively to 1O0, which is acceptable by
industry standards. System rehabilitation would reduce technical system
losses, while non-technical losses would be reduced progressively as
improved revenue management programs are put in place (para. 1.54).
G. Power Sector Objectives, Strategy and Development
1.18     Government has embarked upon an ambitious program of economic
recovery, a major element of which is the reform of the public enterprise
sector. Under this program ECG and VRA are key public utilities to be
commercialized. VRA is already a highly autonomous, financially viable and
well-run entity and attention is now focussed upon bringing ECG to a
similar standard. MFP has demonstrated a considerable commitment to this
process in the last two years. Responsibilities of ECG and VRA have been
redrawr, in such a way as to stimulate competition in the delivery of
electricity to consumers. A new ECG Board was appointed, top ECG
management was replaced, sector financial objectives and targets were
agreed and appropriate tariffs were approved. The ultimate objective is a
financially viable, well-managed sector, whose institutions enjoy a high
degree of autonomy and are capable of delivering a reliable and economic
supply of electricity.
1.19     Now the economic crisis is past, the medium-term strategy of GOG
is focused upon economic expansion. The power sector is a potential
constraint on economic development because of under-investment in recent
years, particularly by ECG in subtransmission and distribution facilities.
Improving the sector's efficiency and delivery capability is now of the
highest priority. As a result of a renegotiated contract with VALCO in
1984, VRA is now better able to protect the domestic market against power
restrictions than in the past, by reducing supplies to VALCO in years of
poor rainfall. However, current system planning etudies indicate that VRA
will need to invest in additional generating facilities if it is to meet
demand through 2000. The optimal expansion program, currently being
finalized, comprises a first phase of thermal (100-150 MW of gas turbines)
which should be commissioned by 1992 to meet expected demand through 1995.
A second thermal increment of 100-150 MW by 1996 would enable VRA to meet
expected demand through the year 2000. The combined cost of these
investments at current prices is about US$130 million. VRA also need to
undertake a major retrofitting of the 25 year-old Akosombo hydroplant



- 6 -
(US$70 million) by the early 1990's to avoid the risk of major breakdowns.
To assist in financing the latter and the first phase of thermal VRA has
requested IDA assistance and a VRA Sixth Power Project is currently being
prepared. From ECG's perspective, substLntial investment is needed to
complete the rehabilitation of its system and to provide for economic
growth in demand over the next four years. This would be the focus of the
proposed project.
1.20     A major GOG long-term (30 year) goal is the provision of
electricity to most of the population, by extending the interconnected
transmission grid to towns and villages throughout Ghana, and especially to
substitute the existing diesel generation by hydro power. Some MFP-
sponsored electrification schemes are already underway, with financial
assistance from India and Japan (about US$10 million). ECG is the
implementing agency. Othcr bilateral donors have expressed to GOG an
interest in financing regional electrification studies and, thereafter, in
funding regional electrification projects. However, any major new
initiatives would be taken in consultation with IDA (para. 1.55). In order
to establish a sou-id framework for such development, GOG has agreed with
IDA to prepare a long term (30 year) National Electrification Plan. This
would establish policies and uniform standards and identify ptiority
programs for the extension of the grid to unelectrified areas of Ghana. It
would also complement VRA's long-term generation and transmission plan.
The study would be financed under the proposed project.  Terms of reference
for the study have been agreed (Annex 1-4) and suitably experienced
consultants identified.  GOG agreed during negotiations that the
consultants' report would be reviewed by GOG and IDA and satisfactory
economic/financial criteria adopted for future electrification programs.
H. Power Sector Financial Oblectives and Tariffs
1.21     GOG's goal is the provision of an efficient, economic, and
affordable supply of electricity to the whole country. To this end, a high
priority is accorded to the mobilization of resources from within the
sector by charging tariffs sufficient to cover supply costs, to contribute
a reasonable portion of investment costs and to earn a reasonable return on
invested capital. Under their respective statutes, ECG and VRA are
required to operate in a commercial manner, consistent with the objective
of adequate sector resource mobilization. In recent vears, electricity
tariffs have not kept pace with the substantial 3-..reases in costs
associated, in particular, with major Cedi devaluations. ECG has been
unable to meet its financial obligations, including those to VRA, whose
position has been cushioned by its substantial foreign currency earnings
from VALCO, CEB and EECI.
1.22     In an attempt to put the sector on a sound financial footing,
consultants (Coopers and Lybrand, U.K.) were commissioned in 1986 to
undertake a tariff study of the power sector. The objective was to develop
tariffs which reflect the economic i.e. long run marginal costs (LRMC) of
supply, are affordable, generate sufficient revenue to ensure financial
viability, and are easy to administer. In their report (Ref. No. 4), the
consultants identified, as part of the LRMC of electricity supply in Ghana,
the opportunity cost to the economy of lost export revenues resulting from



- 7 -
higher Ghanian demand. This factor represents about 402 of LRMC and, to
recover it from Ghanian customers, constitutes a tax on electricity
consumption. The consultants also identified a serious problem of
affordability in applying LRMC tariffs to many residential customers and
recommended phasing-in full LRMC over 25 years. Following agreement
reached between GOG and IDA on the study's recommendations, a uniform
national tariff structure, based on LRMC principles, was introduced. For
1988, the level of tariffs recommended by the consultants were
substantially adopted following a review by MFP, ECG and VRA and
approximated to about 75Z of LRMC. While there is some cross-subsidization
in the tariff structure, tariffs for non-residential and high-consumption
(over 600 kWh monthly) residential customers are comparable to those in
many developed countries. Ghana's tariffs are much below those prevailing
in Western Africa but this is largely a reflection of the relative low
costs and efficiency of the country's hydro system. In order to ensure the
financial viability of the power sector, GOG has also established a target
rate of return of at least 8X on currently valued net fixed assets in
operation. The current tariff schedule is shown at Annex 1-5. GOG is
seriously concerned, however, at the prospect of further major adjustmel.ts
to domestic tariffs to reflect recent devaluation and inflationary
pressures at a time when the service remains unreliable.  While maintaining
its commitment to previously agreed tariff objectives, GOG wishes to re-
examine certain aspects of the 1986 tariff study and to phase-in the 8%
rate of return on ECG's curently valued net fixed assets. Consequently, it
was agreed, during negotiations, that the 1986 tariff study would be
updated in 1989 under the proposed project and that ECG's target rate of
return would be 6X in 1989, 72 in 1990 and 82 annually thereafter (para.
1.44).
1.23     While VRA is required to achieve an overall financial target of
not les than ,n 8Z rate of return on its revalued fixed assets, export
tariffs to VALCO, CEB and EECI are determined by negotiation. VRA has
supplied electricity for VALCO's aluminum smelter since Akosombo was
commissioned in 1966. In 1984, the VALCO 1962 contract was renegotiated to
include provision for quinquennial reviews and for increases in the price
of electricity supplied, originally fixed at 2.625 US mills/kWh. The
renegotiated rate approximated to the world average price of power supplied
to smelters in the early 1980's. Under the amended contract VRA supplies
to VALCO are determined by a formula which guarantees priority of supply to
the Ghanaian market and enables VRA to manage its reservoirs more
efficiently, maximizing sales and avoiding spilling water in wet years.
Maximum energy assigned to VALCO is now 2760 GWh, for four potlines at the
negotiated rate, with the right of first refusal over any additional
available energy, at a price to be negotiated. In 1988, VALCO was supplied
2488 GWh (plant energy efficiency has been improved since 1984) yielding
revenues of about US$53 million, an increase from about US$30 million in
1987. The price VALCO pays (currently about US¢2.11KWh) is linked both to
its purchases from VRA as well as world aluminum prices, which have been
rising recently. The VALCO contract will be renegotiated in 1989. VRA
also pioneered electricity supply across national boundaries in Western
Africa and established links with CEB in Togo/Benin (1972) and with EECI in
Cote d'Ivoire (1984). VRA supplied CEB with 270 GWh in 1988, a significant
reduction on the 1987 level (410 GWh) following the commissioning of CEB's
Nangbeto hydrostation. The contract with CEB was recently renegotiated
with an increase from about US¢4 to 4.8/kWh. At present, there is no long-



- 8 -
term agreement w'th EECI. VRA fell somewhat below its 8X of return rate
target in 1986 (6.6Z) and 1987 (6.8?) but improved revenues from exports
and from ECG enabled it to exceed that target in 1988 (about 11X).
I. ECG - The Implementing Agency
1.24     ECG was established by Government Decree in 1967 (Ref. No. 5) with
the object of supplying electricity throughout Ghana, excepting certain
specified customers who are supplied by VRA. The 1967 Decree requires ECG
to conduct its affairs on sound commercial lines but such an approach has
been lacking in recent years. Reforms are now underway to establish ECG as
a sound public utility and this program would be reinforced under the
proposed project.
1. Organization and Management
1.25     The 1967 Decree provides for a Board, appointed by GOG, to govern
ECG and in particular, to formulate policy. The Board comprises a
Chairman, ECG's Managing Director (Chief Executive) appointed by GOG, VRA's
Chief Executive, and other persons representing government, industry and
consumer interests. A new Board was appointed in 1987 and is functioning
satisfactorily, under a good Chairman.
1.26     Following a review by ESB, (Ref. Nos. 6 and 7), a revised
organization structure (Annex 1-6) was agreed which will provide a
satisfactory basis for ECG's medium-term development along conventional
utility lines. A start has been made on implementing the new structure. A
new Managing Director and new Directors of Administration, Engineering,
Finance, Operations and Internal Audit have been appointed. All are
appropriately qualified, experienced Ghanaians. ECG has also obtained the
services of an expatriate Financial Advisor, funded by the Commonwealth
Fund for Technical Cooperation. The new Directors are now appointing their
respective staffs. Outside the corporate headquarters, ECG is organized
into seven regions, each headed by a Regional Director, responsible to the
Director of Operations at headquarters. The new regional organization is
being implemented initially in Tema. Based on experience obtained there,
it will be progressively extended to the other regions by end-1989. In the
meantime, key regional personnel are being appointed and emphasis placed on
improving maintenance practices and revenue collection. In the short-term,
the structure needs to be sufficiently flexible to enable ECG to deal in an
ad-hoc manner with special problems as they arise.
1.27     The Accra region presents such a special problem.  Following a
major ECG system collapse in Accra in January 1988, GOG set up a Committee
of Enquiry which, inter alia, pointed out serious deficiencies in
maintenance and poor discipline and management control. In view of the
political sensitivity of power supply to Accra, the operation and
maintenance of the 33 kV subtransmission system (the interface with VRA's
transmission system) is a key task. Accra constitutes over 40? of ECG's
business, and is currently organized on the same lines as the other, much-
smaller regions. ECG proposes to modify these arrangements and has
appointed a Senior Manager, reporting directly to ECG's Director of
Operations, to be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the



Accra 33 kV lines and 33/11 kV substations. The remaining customer-related
services would be devolved to three districts, under the overall
supervision of the Accra Regional Director. This would be a satisfactory
solution and ECG is finalizing these arrangements.
1.28     A second major problem facing ECG is the management of its
revenues. At present, there is no clear direction nor control from
headquarters of this critical aspect of ECG's business. ECG has agreed to
strengthen meter reading, billing and collection arrangements (para. 1.54)
and has appointed a Senior Manager (Revenue), reporting directly to the
Managing Director, to organize this function.
2. Manpower Planning, Staff Development and Training
1.29     ECG currently employs about 3660 staff.  As with many similar
utilities, ECG is seriously overstaffed at the unskilled level but is short
of graduate-level staff. If ECG is to develop successfully as a commercial
entity, the skills-mix of its staff must be upgraded through better
recruitment, and training policies and a staff redundancy program must be
introduced. In taking over responsibility for distribution in northern
Ghana, VRA was able to reduce staffing levels by about 40Z but found itself
short of key commercial staff.
1.30     With assistance from local consultants, ECG recently prepared a
preliminary manpower plan as an input to its corporate plan (1988-92), and
which identified a shortage of 110 skilled staff in certain key accounting,
commercial and engineering areas and surplus, largely lower skilled, staff
totalling 930. ECG plans to reduce staff numbers by the net 820. Affected
staff would be fully compensated and assistance would be gi.ven in seeking
alternative employment. The cost of the redundancy program, which ECG will
fund from its own resources (para. 1.55), is estimated at about ¢1235
million. In order to miniaize possible disruption, ECG has prepared a
timetable to implement the redundancies in 1989 and 1990, and to recruit
key personnel (paras. 1.33 and 2.07). In order to improve its image as ani
employer and to recruit and retain good quality staff EGG is planning to
introduce incentives in the form of bonuses and improved housing. The
latter is a necessary feature in Ghana where housing costs are high and
public service salaries are low. The costs of such incentives would be
financed from internally generated funds, and have been included in ECG'S
financial projections (para. 1.55).
1.31     ECG plans to continue to develop manpower planning with assistance
from local consultants; job descriptions will be prepared and staff history
records computerized, as the basis for identifying the development and
training needs of its staff. ECG has never adopted satisfactory staff
development and training programs in the past and arrangements have tended
to be ad hoc. However, using the facilizies of its new Tema Training
Center and those of local academic institutions, ECG is now in a position
to develop comprehensive programs. Under the ongoing project (Credit
1628-GH) an ESB report of December 1986 addressed this issue (Ref. No. 8);
ESB has also been responsible for the training of ECG instructors in
Ireland and currently is staffing senior positions at the Tema Training
Center. Under the proposed project, comprehensive staff development and
training programs would be established and implemented with IDA financing.

3. Technical Assistance
1.32     ESB was selected from a short-list of consultants to examine the
institutional problems of Ghana's power sector under the ongoing project.
Following a comprehensive diagnosis of ECG's problems, for the past two
years ESB has provided a technical assistance team to help implement the
agreed reforms. This comprised a Managing Director, Project Manager, and
Director of Operations in executive roles, supported by other ESB staff on
shorter assignments. The Director of Operations has now completed his
assignment but the other two ESB staff are remaining through end-1989 in
advisory roles, as Ghanaians have now been appointed, along with an ESB Co-
Principal for ECG's Training Center. In addition, a number of short-term
ESB consultants are assisting ECG in various operational and functional
areas. ESB has also provided training and familiarization courses in
Dublin for ECG Directors and newly recruited finance staff. The technical
assistance program has been generally very effective and an extremely
cordial relationship has developed between the two utilities.
1.33     ECG wishes to continue with the services of ESB under the proposed
project. ECG has identified a number of areas where ESB would be asked to
supply executives to fill key vacancies, to substitute for ECG managers who
would be seconded to Ireland or elsewhere for training, and to provide
particular expertise on a short-term basis. These assignments would cover
a wide range of commercial, engineering, financial and operational
functions for periods of up to two years. The technical assistance
program, details of which are being finalized, would be financed by IDA
under the proposed project.
1.34     Although senior Ghanaian staff are now in position, ECG will need
technical assistance from a mature utility for several more years. VRA has
for 25 years maintained a close relationship with Ontario Hydro, Canada
which has brought many benefits in terms of obtaining both specialist
expertise and training facilities for VRA staff, often at short notice.
ECG should develop a similar relationship. At this time, in view of their
familiarity with ECG's problems and satisfactory performance, it would be
reasonable for ECG to continue the association with ESB.
4. Corporate Plan (1988-92) and Performance Contract
1.35     ECG is one of 14 public enterprises asked to prepare corporate
plans under the IDA-assisted public enterprise reform program. With
assistance from ESB, ECG's Board has adopted a Corporate Plan for the
period 1988-92, which would be rolled forward annually. This is ECG's
first attempt at systematic planning and provides a sound basis to
improving ECG's performance over the period of the proposed project. The
Corporate Plan represents a realistic assessment of where ECG should be in
five years time and is supported by regional business plans, which focus on
eleven key performance areas with forty-four performance targets. A draft
performance contract between GOG and ECG has been prepared, which is
satisfactory to IDA and which incorporates key performance targets and
specifies mutual obligations of the parties. The signing of the
performance contract would be a condition of credit effectiveness.   During



- 11 -
negotiations, it was agreed that IDA would review annually with GOG and ECG
their respective obligations under the performance contract. To assist in
future planning and monitoring of its performance, ECG needs to establish a
better computerized management information system. This would be financed
by IDA under the proposed project.
1.36     The eleven key areas of the corporate plan are summarized below:
a)   Collect billed revenue;
b)   Ensure the long term success of the business through optimum sales
growth and tariff structuring;
c)   Design and construct a distribution capability to give an economic
and secure supply;
d)   Operate and maintain the distribution system to give an adequate
and reliable supply to ECG consumers;
e)   Maintain a quality manpower of a size appropriate to the
management and operational needs of ECG and which is committed to
giving consumers a good standard of service;
f)   Establish and maintain an effective and efficient organization
structure;
g)   Design and introduce effective systems, procedures and information
flows for critical areas of ECG business;
'l)  Secure an acceptable level of system losses;
i)   Restore and maintain ECG viability through sound financial systems
and effective financial management;
J)   Maintain effective internal auditing throughout ECG; and
k)   Create a government and public awareness and understanding of
ECG's position on major issues affecting the business.
1.37     The following critical indicators included in the performance
contract, would be used to monitor ECG's performance. Some targets would
need to be re-examined before the performance contract is signed and would
be further reviewed annually.
a)   Market electricity, with emphasis on efficiency use and value for
money, so as to achieve the following energy sales and consumer
revenues:
1988     1989      1990      1991       1992
GWh Sales              1040      1087     1135       1187       1240
Revenue (¢million)    7800       8900    10000      10900      12400



- 12 -
b)   Achieve revenue collection targets which reduce progressively the
debtors/sales ratio as follows:
1988     1989      1990      1991       1992
42Z      40%       35%       29%        22Z
i.e., from 22 weeks to 11 weeks billings.
c)   Achieve a manpower profile appropriate to management, operational,
organizational and consumer service needs as follows:
1988     1989      1990      1991       1992
No. of employees       3660      3260     3040       2940       2840
d)   Achieve with Government approval, the necessary capital restructuring
to restore and maintain financial viability.
e)   Operate and maintain the distribution system to ensure an adequate and
reliable supply to consumers in accordance with standards and targets
set out in the Corporate Plan.
f)   Complete the distribution rehabilitation program, under Credit
1628-GH, to cost and time targets set out in the Corporate Plan.
Complete the appraisal of the distribution expansion program and
achieve the physical commencement of the program by mid-1990; maintain
project implementation schedule for timely project completion.
5. Accounting, Audit and Insurance
1.38     ECG's accounting and budgeting has suffered in recent years as a
result of poor systems and a lack of discipline arising from the problem of
recruiting and retaining qualified staff. This resulted in delays in
preparing accounts, which were heavily qualified by ECG's auditors (Coopers
and Lybrand, Accra), and in submitting audited accounts to IDA. With ESB's
assistance, new accounting and budgeting systems are being installed
leading to improved financial controls, better and more timely management
information and accounts which meet acceptable standards. Furthermore, ECG
has recently been able to recruit several young, qualified staff to
strengthen its accounting and internal audit activities. ECG would
continue to improve its financial systems with ESB assistance under the
proposed project.
1.39     The 1967 Decree requires ECG to provide accounting information
similar to that required of a private company and to submit its accounts,
with the report of an independent auditor, within four months of the year
end. Present auditing arrangements are satisfactory. With the
improvements to accounting systems and staff, ECG's audited accounts for
1987 were submitted on time and were unqualified. In future, ECG will be
able to submit to IDA satisfactory audited accounts within six months of
the year end, as agreed during negotiations. Future audits would cover the
Special Account to be established under the proposed project (para. 2.09).



- 13 -
1.40     ECG is required to insure with the State Insurance Corporation.
Some insurance (e.g., vehicles) is mandatory, but insurance against other
risks is optional. ECG is currently reviewing current insurance practices
and the extent of coverage.
6. Recent Financial Performance
1.41     The 1976 Decree (Section 11) requires ECG "to conduct its affairs
on sound commercial lines". In particular, ECG is required to ensure that
its revenues are sufficient to produce a reasonable return on the "fair
value" of its assets, having regard to the need to service its debt and
contribute to expanding and improving its services. In the absence of a
"fair value" (by end-1986 the book value of ECG's gross fixed assets was a
mere US$2 million equivalent), it was agreed under Credit 1628-GH that
ECG's fixed assets would be revalued. This has now been done
satisfactorily (Ref. No. 9) and the results incorporated in ECG's 1987
accounts. In the meantime, it was agreed that ECG should contribute 25X to
its investment program, have debt service coverage of at least 1.5 times,
pay off its arrears to VRA, and reduce progressively the level of its
customer receivables. However, ECG was unable to meet these obligations
and between 1984-87 its financial position deteriorated dramatically.
Major Cedi devaluations (from 3 to 176 Cedis to the US$ between late 1983
and late 1987) had a serious impact on the cost of electricity supplied by
VRA and on ECG's debt servicing obligations. These increases were not
fully compensated for in retail tariff increases. Consequently, ECGv
incurred heavy losses which, by end-87, had accumulated to about US$57
million equivalent. Escalating receivables, as a result of poor billing
and collection procedures, exacerbated the situation to a point where ECG
was unable to meet its obligations to Government and to VRA. Recent
financial results are summarized in the following table. Detailed audited
results for 1987 are at Annex 1-7.

7. Financial Recovery Program
1.42     The new management is acutely conscious of ECG's financial
problems and is making serious efforts to reverse the situation. In
particular: the poor collection trend have been reversed by concentrating
more resources on this key task; accounting has been brought on to a
current basis, which has provided ECG a much clearer view of its problems;
tariffs were increased from January 1988; and proposals were submitted to
Government to restructure ECG's capital and to resolve the mutual-
inKdebtedness problems which have plagued the sector for many years.
However, much remains to be done to turn ECG into a financially viable
entity. Financial recovery is an integral, but highly significant, part of
ECG's institutional development program, and has to be viewed in the
broader context of improved performance.
Tariffs
1.43     The tariff increases from January 1988 were designed to r sure
both ECG and VRA an 82 return on net fixed assets in 1988. VRA's increase
was staggered, to take effect from July 1988, to allow ECG an opportunity
to improve its collection performance. ECG's average 1988 sales revenue
was somewhat lower (d7.7/kWh) than projected (j8/kWh), reflecting some
customer resistance to the large tariff increase, and produced a 62 return
on net fixed assets. For the future, MFP, which is responsible for
presenting tariff proposals for Government approval, has indicated a
preference for more frequent tariff adjustments related to inflation and
improved ECG performance. This is a reasonable approach and, in planning
its financial recovery, ECG has reflected these factors in its financial
projections (Annex 1-7).
1.44     In order to assist ECG's financial recovery, it was agreed with
GOG during negotiations that: firstly, ECG's tariffs would be adjusted, as
necessary, to achieve a rate of return on its currently valued net fixed
assets in operation of not less than 62 in 1989, 72 in 1990, and 82
annually thereafter; and secondly, ECG would not incur additional
borrowings unless its debt service was covered at least 1.5 times from
internally generated funds.
Capital Restructuring
1.45     ECG is seriously undercapitalized.  GOG's equity in ECG at end
1988 was a mere 017 million (US$74,000). As a result of heavy losses in
recent years, at end 1986 ECG's total equity was negative.  Following the
revaluation of its fixed assets, the position improved in 1987. However,
with a debt/equity ratio of 70/30, a negative debt service coverage, a need
to improve its working capital, and a heavy capital investment program
through 1993, ECG's capital needs to be urgently restructured. A debt
equity ratio of about 60/40 over the next decade would be more appropriate
and would enable ECG to meet its debt service obligations without
difficulty. VRA's debt/equity ratio in recent years has been about 30/70.
1.46     Most of ECG's existing debt is in the form of Subsidiary Loan
Agreements (SLA's) in respect of IDA and KfW credits.  ECG is current in
servicing its IBRD loan (1381-GH) but is substantially 'in arrears in
servicing its SLA's, several of which have now expired. At end 1988, the
position was as follows:

Unexpired SLA's                            1093        1896          2989

US$ million equivalent                                               58.2
As a result of discussions between GOG, ECG and IDA, ECG's capital has been
restructured satisfactorily as follows with effect from end-1988:
(a)  the overdue debt and accrued interest on expired SLA's (¢10404
million), after writing-off GOG overdues to ECG of 01478 million,
has been converted to equity (¢8926 million);
(b)  the overdue debt and accrued interest on unexpired SLA's
(02989 million) would be repaid at 2 1/2Z interest over 10 years;
and
(c)  future loan repayments and interest on unexpired SLA's would be
serviced as scheduled.
1.47     ECG owed VRA ¢3623 million (about US$16 million) at end 1988.
One-half of this amount has been converted to Government equity (in lieu of
VRA's dividend payments to Government) and the balance would be paid, by
monthly installments of 030 million, into a National Electrification Fund.
Finally, GWSC's arrears (¢1361 million) to ECG would be recovered through
the 'clearing system' (para. 1.50), at ¢21 million monthly.

Customer Receivables
1.49      ECG's customer receivables remained at an excessively high level
for several years. By end 1986 they were equivalent to 13.5 months current
billings. Improved collection efforts in 1987 and 1988 reduced receivables
to the equivalent of 8.6 months. Of the total outstanding (07.6 billion)
at end 1988 t2.8 billion due from GOG and GWSC has been dealt with under
the capital restructing (para. 1.47), leaving a balance due mainly from the
private sector of t4.8 billion. As a result of more detailed investigation
of the state of customer accounts ECG has identified a very substantial
amount of doubtful debts, resulting from past inaccurate billings and the
age of many debts. Consequently, ECG has included in its accounts a
provision for bad and doubtful debts equivalent to 50X of the balance of
customer receivables. While this was prudent, a careful investigation of
each account is needed before the amounts are finally written-off.
Following these various actions, receivables at end 1988 were equivalent to
about 4.3 months billings. Through improved revenue management programs
(para 1.54) ECG expects to reduce customers receivables to about 2 1/2
months by end 1992 (para 1.37).



- 17 -
1.50     To prevent a recurrence of the problem of public sector mutual-
indebtedness in the power sector, GOG has established, with effect from
January 1989, a clearing system to settle each month the current mutual
obligations of Government, ECG, GWSC and VRA, in respect of electricity and
water bills and utility servicing of Government debt. Under this
arrangement, ECG would contribute about ¢295 million monthly and GOG about
¢116 million, VRA would receive about ¢331 million and GWSC about t8O
million.
Revenue Management
1.51     ECG's current monthly billings are about t650 million.  Under the
clearing system about ¢90 million of this amount would be automatically
credited to ECG leaving ECG the task of collecting ¢560 million each month
for current billings, and of reducing its public corporation (other than
GWSC) and private sector receivables. For the past year ECG has made
considerable progress in improving its monthly collections, by establishing
monthly targets for its regions and by making arrangements for payment with
major customers. However, present efforts depend too heavily upon special
task-force arrangements. ECG's revenue management function - meter
installation, meter reading, billing, collection and recovery procedures -
need to be strergthened, both at headquarters, where there is no clear
responsibility, and in the regions. A Senior Revenue Manager has recently
been appointed (para. 1.28) to organize this vital function, responsible
directly to the Managing Director.
1.52     Revenue management has been neglected for many years in ECG:
unmetered connections have been permitted, thereby increasing system
losses; meter readings are unreliable as many meters are broken and meter
reader productivity is low; meters are often unread over long periods; many
illegal connections exist; the quarterly billing system, based on estimated
consumption is inappropriate to Ghanaian customers; and recovery efforts
have been uncoordinated. Recent disconnection campaigns have left many
small customers without supply and the reconnection rate has been no higher
than 50%. It is possible that, with the higher tariffs now being charged,
ECG may lose many small customers.
1.53     About 52 of ECG's non-Governmental customers contribute about 65%
of its revenues, and 8Z (which would include all residential customers
using over 600 kWh monthly), contribute 702 of its revenues. In future,
ECG is planning to bill this critical body of customers each month, on
actual meter readings. Special units will be established to handle this
task with priority resources, including new meters and transport.
1.54     Monthly meter reading and billing of the bulk of ECG's customers,
whose consumption is below 600 kWh monthly, will require careful planning
and will take time to implement. The present computer is being enhanced to
facilitate monthly billing but the existing billing programs will need to
be modified. This is now under investigation. However, a major problem
arises from malfunctioning meters and inaccurate readings. A large meter
replacement program is planned under the proposed project. As for meter
readers, whose quality and discipline needs to be enhanced, ECG is already
experimenting with incentive schemes to increase their productivity.

During negotiations, it was agreed that ECG would submit, by September 30,
1989, a program acceptable to IDA designed to improve the management of its
revenues and achieve the revenue targets in the performance contract.
8. Financing Plan (1989-93) and Future Financial Positio.a
1.55     Financial projections for ECG through 1996 are set at Annex 1-7;
the assumptions made in preparing the projections are set out as Annex 1-8.
In summary, it is assumed that ECG meets its performance targets through
1992, including the critical revenue collection target to reduce customer
receivables below the level of three months' billings, that the proposed
capital restructuring is approved by GOG, and that tariffs are raised to
meet agreed rates of return on average net fixed assets. The financial
projections include provision for: ECG's redundancy program; staff
incentives in return for higher performance; a limited staff housing
program outside the proposed project, in order to encourage recruitment;
setting-up funds for the replacement of transport, equipment and meters;
and future system expansion from 1993. As the proposed project comprises
ECG's principal investment through 1993, it was agreed during negotiations
that, except for the ongoing self-help and district capital electrification
schemes, ECG would not incur any other capital expenditure above the
equivalent of US$2 million annually without prior consultation with IDA.
1.56     On the above assumptions ECG would be able to contribute 25? of
its total capital investment requirements from 1989 through 1993, the
proposed project period, and at the same time strengthen its underlying
financial position (para. 1.57). A financing plan for ECG is summarized in

1.57     Salient features of ECG's projected financial recovery from 1989
through 1996 are summarized below. Tariffs would increase significantly
from 1992 onwards, in constant US$, as a result of the agreed rate of
return target. ECG'so operating ratio would decline from 89Z in 1989 to 782
from 1993. Debt service coverage would be satisfactory (i.e. not below
1.5): it would fall to 1.6 in 1994, when servicing of project loans
begins, but would rise thereafter to about 2 times earnings. Debt/equity
would be satisfactory at about 60/40 during project implementation, falling
thereafter to 53/47 by 1996. Liquidity would be satisfactory, with
receivables reducing to lees than 3 months billings by 1992.

J. Bank Group Role in the Power Sector
1. Past Lending
1.58     The Bank Group has been closely involved in the development of
Ghana's power sector, with eight lending operations in the past 30 years.
Since 1961, three Bank loans to VRA have assisted in the financing of the
Akosombo and Kpong dams and power plants and a recent Credit (1759-GH) is
helping VRA to extend grid supply to northern Ghana. Lending to ECG began
soon after its formation in 1967 and the ongoing Power System
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1628-GH) is the fourth lending operation.
The amount of Bank Group lending for power projects in Ghana to date
(US$150 million) exceeds that for any other sector and has helped finance
virtually all the major sector investments since Ghana's independence. The
Bank's participation in the Akosombo and Kpong hydro generation projects
and the ongoing NOGREX project was especially important in mobilizing the
large amounts of cofinancing needed for these ambitious projects.
1.59     Two Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) have been prepared on
Ghanaian power projects. An early PPAR covered the first four projects.
The second PPAR of June 6, 1985, covering the fifth (VRA's Kpong
hydroelectric project, Loan 1380-GH) and sixth (ECG's Third Power project,
Loan 1381-GH and Credit 689-GH), emphasized the need to fully utilize
existing facilities before investing in additional capacity. This is a
major objective of both the ongoing and the proposed power projects.
2. Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement
1.60     IDA's continued association with the sector would complement our
efforts under the public enterprise and economie reform programs. It would
secure the full implementation of the policy changes needed to establish
ECG as an autonomous and accountable power utility. IDA involvement would
ensure orderly and 'timely sector development, based on a sound long-term
strategy, and would assist Government to obtain appropriate financing for
sector investment priorities through the mid-19909.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Project ObJectives
2.01     the proposed project would continue the ongoing sector policy
reforms started under the Power Rehabilitation Project, Credit 1628-GH, so
as to help establish ECG as a commercially-oriented entity, capable of
delivering a reliable and economic supply of electricity to its customers.
The project would also assist the Government to develop a comprehensive
sector development strategy and long-term electrification program.
B. ProJect Description
2.02     Thp pcoposed project would consist of the following components
which are detailed in Annex 2-1:
a)   an Institutional development program focusing on the
commercialization of ECG through: (i) completion of management
reorganization; (ii) financial restructuring; (iii) a performance
'contract" with GOG to improve ECG's efficiency as a power utility
and containing performance targets for the period through 1992 and
incentives for improved productivity; (iv) a manpower reduction
(about 202 of the labor force), staff development and training
program; (v) a program of technical assistance from ESB; and (vi)
the development of computer-based management information and
accounting systems.
b)   an Investment program comprising of ECG's total capital
expenditure requirements through 1993 -- subtransmission,
distribution and telecommunications equipment and works, vehicles,
staff housing and buildings and working capital in the form of
tools, materials, spare parts, and office equipment;
c)   a Sector Development strategy formulated through studies of long-
term subtransmission and distribution expansion needs.
C. Project Cost
2.03     The total project cost is estimated at US$117.7 million
equivalent, excluding interest during construction (IDC), of which the
foreign exchange component is llS$97.0 million (822 of total cost). IDC on
work-in-progress would be capitalized, and included in ECG's fixed assets
on commissioning. The cost estimate is based on 1988 prices. Physical
contingencies of 102 and price contingencies, based on current inflation
trends 3 were added. The detailed project cost estimate is shown in Annex
2-2 and is summarized below:

D. Project Financing Plan
2.04     A detailed project financing plan is set out at Annex 2-3.  An
IDA credit of US$40 million equivalent is proposed to the Republic of
Ghana. Under an SLA between GOG and ECG, the Credit would be onlent to ECG
for 20 years, including 5 years grace at an interest rate based on the Bank
of Ghana's discount rate (currently about 18X) and reviewed annually with
IDA. GOG would bear the foreign exchange risk. The signing of a SLA,
satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of effectiveness. The proposed
credit would finance 100Z of the foreign exchange costs of the following:
Accra District #1 - 33 kV, 11 kV and L.T. lines and substations;
telecommunications, office and miscellaneous equipment and tools;
engineering and technical assistance services; training; studies; spares
and materials to replenish ECG's inventories; and vehicles. The IDA credit
would also finance 40Z of the cost of housing and buildings included in the
proposed project and 80Z of the cost of services of consultants domiciled
in Ghana.



22-
2.05     Adequate project cofinancing is available to cover the rest of the
foreign exchange cost and a part of the local cost, as indicated below:
a)   The Government of Austria has agreed to provide a credit to GOG of
up to 200 million Austrian shillings (about US$15 million
equivalent) to finance 1002 of the foreign exchange cost (US$10.5
million) of the subtransmission and distribution rehabilitation
and expansion in Cape Coast and Takoradi. Austria is also willing
to finance the Supervisory Control System (US$3.7 million).4 The
credit would be for 30 years, including 10 years grace, at 32
interest and would be onlent to ECG on the some terms.
b)   CCCE (France) has agreed to provide a credit to GOG of up to
US$13.7 million equivalent to finance 1002 of the cost (US$10
million equivalent, including US$1.2 million local costs) of the
subtransmission and distribution rehabilitation and expansion in
Kumasi and Tema (including 33 kV/llkV substations) and the
Supervisory Control System. The Credit would be for 20 years
including 10 years grace, at between 3.75-52 interest and would be
onlent to ECG on the same terms.
b)   CDC (UK) has agreed to provide the sterling equivalent of up to
US$15 million to finance a part of the foreign exchange cost of
the U.K. package in Accra. The loan would be made to ECG, with a
GOG guarantee and would be repayable over 13 years from June 30,
1994 at 8.5Z interest.
C)   The UK government has agreed to provide to GOG up to US$22.7
million equivalent to finance 1002 of the foreign exchange cost
of: substation works, subtransmission and distribution system
rehabilitation and extension in Accra (Districts No. 6 and No. 3),
in Koforidua and in Ho; the supply of distribution materials for
the districts rehabilitation and extension; and the Supervisory
Control System. The UK financing would comprise a 351 ODA grant
on the total UK package (including the CDC-financed portion) and
an export credit to ECG repayable over 8 years at 8.3? interest.
d)   ECG would meet most (US$19.5 million equivalent) of the local
costs together with all IDC (US$7.1 million equivalent) from
internally generated funds.
A condition of effectiveness of the IDA Crel.J  would be the
effectiveness of the CDC and ODA financing.
E. Project Implementation
1. Status of Preparation and Execution
2.06     The proposed project was prepared by ECG, with the assistance of
ESB and local consultants, with financing from Credit 1628-GH. In
particular:
4/ The Supervisory Control System may be financed by either Austria, France
or U.K. (para. 2.11).



- 23 -
a) a corporate plan was prepared which provides the basis for
targeting and monitoring ECG's performance for the period through
1992;
b) a manpower plan has identified future staffing requirements and
staff development, training and technicpl assistance programs are
being finalized by ECG;
c) a system planning study for the reinforcement and extension of
ECG's power system, for the period through 1995 was completed in
June 1988 (Ref. No. 10), under the ongoing technical assistance
arrangements; and
d) a study for the rehabilitation and reinforcement of the district
distribution systems is underway, to define a program of priority
schemes which will be agreed with IDA before implementation.
2.07     ECG would implement all aspects of the proposed project with
assistance from consultants. ECG has engaged ESB to complete detailed
engineering (through bid evaluation stage) of the subtransmission and
distribution components. ECG also plans to use ESB to assist in
construction supervision. While it would be possible to seek proposals for
this task from other consultants, this would pose a serious risk of
delaying the project, the timing of which is critical to Ghana's economic
recovery. Furthermore, a new consultant would most probably wish to re-
examine all engineering, thereby risking further delay. As ESB's work to
date has been of a satisfactory quality the continued use of ESB's services
for project engineering and management is acceptable. ECG has established
a project management unit, responsible for the preparation of detailed
system engineering and for the supervision of the rehabilitation and
extension of the subtransmission and distribution systems in all regions.
The project management unit is headed by ECG's Director of Engineering, who
reports directly to the Managing Director, and consists of ECG staff
assisted by expatriate and local consultant personnel. ECG is also
rationalizing and generally improving its stores arrangements in Accra and
in the regions, in line with the reorganized structure. The project
management organization is set out at Annex 2-4. Project completion is
expected by June 30, 1993; an implementation timetable is set out at Annex
2-5.
2. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
2.08     The proposed project would require careful coordination within ECG
and frequent IDA supervision. The Director of Engineering would be
responsible for physical works. Monitoring of institutional performance
would involve the Managing Director and all Corporate Directors; a small
Corporate Planning Unit is being established to strengthen ECG's capability
in this area. Overall coordination and report preparation would be carried
out by the Project Management Unit. Quarterly progress reports would be
made to ECG's Board, MFP, IDA and other financing agencies. Detailed
reporting requirements were discussed during appraisal. An annual review
of the implementation of all aspects of the proposed project, including
achievement of the agreed performance targets, would be undertaken by ECG,
GOG and IDA (para. 1.35).



- 24 -
2.09     During negotiations, it was agreed that the project accounts, the
special account, and the SOE's would be audited annually by independent
auditors satisfactory to IDA according to acceptable auditing standards.
The audited accounts and the auditor's report would be submitted to IDA
within six months following the end of the fiscal year (para. 1.39). SOE's
will be reviewed by IDA on a regular basis.

2.11     The supply and erection of materials for the rehabilitation and
extension of the subtransmission and distribution systems will be procured
in four separate contracts, with single responsibility:
a) the IDA-financed lot in Accra (US$10.0 million) will be procured
through ICB, in accordance with IDA guidelines;
b) the CDC/U.K. financed lot (US$41.9 million equivalent) will be
procured from a single U.K. source;
c) the CCCE-financed lot (US$10.0 million equivalent) will be
procured following CCCE procurement procedures; and
d) the fourth lot, financed by Austria (US$13.0 million equivalent),
will be procured following Austria procurement procedures.
The Supervisory Control System will be procured from and financed by either
Austria, France or U.K., with the contract awarded to the lowest evaluated
bidder.
2.12     IDA-financed tools, telecommunications, office and miscellaneous
equipment, vehicles, and spares needed to rebuild ECG's inventory levels,
will be procured in a combination of ICB and international shopping,
following the receipt of at least three quotations from different
geographical areas as shown in the above table. Procurement under
international shopping will be packaged in lots of under US$100,000 to a
maximum of US$4 million. IDA-financed civil works for housing and
buildings will be contracted following LCB procedures acceptable to IDA.
LCB documents and procedures will be reviewed by IDA prior to release of
documents, to ensure that these include advertising, public bid opening,
clarity of evaluation criteria and award to the lowest evaluated bidder and
that foreign bidders are not excluded from participation. Except to the
cxtent discussed at para. 2.07, consultants will be selected in accordance
with IDA guidelines and would be employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. All IDA-financed contracts for amounts of US$100,000
equivalent or more will be subject to prior review (59Z); other contracts
will be subject to selective post-award review. A PPF advance of US$1
million has been approved to finance consultant services and technical
assistance activities prior to credit effectiveness.

TOTAL                              40.0
2.14     The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed by December 31, 1993
in accordance with the schedule shown at Annex 2-6. This corresponds
closely to the former East Africa Region Power Sector Investment profile.
ECG would be expected to bear any cost overruns, including any extra costs
associated with a lengthened implementation schedule. To facilitate
project implementation, it is proposed that a Special Account of US$2
million be established and replenished periodically to finance eligible
expenditures financed by IDA. Disbursements of the IDA credit would be
fully documented, except for expenditures of less than US$50,000
equivalent, which will be disbursed against Statements of Expenditures
(SOE's).
5. Environmental Aspects
2.15     The proposed project would have a positive impact on Lhe
environment. By 1990, four of the five towns now served by diesel units
owned and operated by ECG would be interconnected to the main grid; this
would eliminate air and noise pollution caused by the diesel generation in
these towns. The rehabilitation of the distribution network, using



- 27 -
standards acceptable to IDA especially as regards safety, would also have a
positive environmental impact. Concerning the utilization of wooden poles
produced in Ghana, an environmental impact statement will be prepared by
ECG and reviewed and accepted by IDA prior to the authorization of the use
of local wooden poles. The proposed project does not involve any
resettlement.
F. Proiect Justification and Risks
1. Justification
2.16     The performance of the subtransmission and distribution system in
Ghana has deteriorated in recent years as a consequence of old and
inefficient equipment, inadequate maintenance, and over loading of the
existing substations and distribution facilities. Although there is
adequate supply of electricity available from Akosombo, power supplies to
consumers are often interrupted because of breakdowns in the
subtransmission and distribution network. Funding for the ongoing sector
reforms, commercialization of ECG and rehabilitation of its system is now
fully exhausted. The proposed project is essential to avoid any
interruption to the present program, provide better value-for-money to
customers facing higher electricity bills, and take advantage of VRA's
present capacity to supply power to the domestic market. Similar efforts
are being undertaken by VRA in northern Ghana to provide a more reliable
and economical supply of electricity. The proposed project would also
compensate for the past under-investment in the distribution network to
meet the growing demand by the existing and new customers generated by the
country's economic recovery. An adequate and reliable supply of
electricity is needed to sustain Ghana's economic recovery and without the
proposed project that recovery could be seriously jeopardized.
2.  Economic Rate of Return (Annex 2-7)
2.17     The main benefits of the proposed project are to improve
reliability of power supplies, meet the growing demand for electricity, and
improve the operational efficiency of ECG. The latter is measured by
reductions in technical system losses, which are valued at the LRMC for
calculating the economic benefits of the proposed project.
2.18     The proposed investment would meet the demand through 1995 which
is projected to grow at the rate of about 52 per year. The incremental
demand served is valued by the consumers' willingness to pay for the
electricity consumed. The most conservative estimate of consumers'
willingness to pay are the tariffs which consumers are currently charged
for electricity. The estimated Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR)
based on ECG's average tariff of about 8 Cedi/kWh (about USf3/kWh) is 20Z,
which exceeds the opportunity cost of capital in Ghana (about 15Z),
indicating that the proposed investment is justified. In this calculation,
no attempt has been made to quantify either the considerable benefits
derived from a more reliable power supply or the surplus arising from
customers' willingness to pay over and above ECG's current average tariff.
Consumers' willingness to pay could easily be as high as 6 US¢/kWh, the
mid-point between the current average tariff and the estimated cost of
autogeneration, which is still less than one-half of tariff levels in
neighboring countries. Using 6 USO/KWh to capture more of the consumer



- 28 -
surplus, produces an IERR of 39Z. The impact on the IERR of a lower growth
in demand (4.5Z p.a.), or a lesser (by 10Z) improvement in technical losses
is small enough to still justify the project.
3. Risks
2.19     There are no unusual risks associated with the proposed project.
The major risks relate to possible project delays and to the achievement by
ECG of its plans to improve efficiency. However, GOG is fully committed to
strengthening the power sector and the presence of a strong technical
assistance should minimize such risks. Furthermore, ECG's new management
team is fully aware of the need to re-establish the credibility of ECG in
the eyes of the public.
III. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
3.01     The following agreements were reached during negotiations:
a)  review of National Electrification Planning Study and adoption of
economic/financial criteria for future electrification programs
(para. 1.20);
b)  performance contract between GOG and ECG and annual review of
performance (para 1.35);
c)  ECG audit arrangements (paras. 1.39 and 2.0S);
d)  ECG to earn a 6Z (1989), 7? (1990) and 8Z (from 1991) rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets and ensure minimum 1.5 times
debt service coverage (paras. 1.22 and 1.44);
e)  ECG to submit, by September 30, 1989, a revenue collection
improvement program acceptable to IDA (para. 1.54);
f)  ECG not to incur additional capital expenditure in excess of US$2
million annually without prior consultation with IDA (para. 1.55);
and
g)  ECG to establish a d-.strict distribution program in consultation
with IDA (para. 2.06).
3.02     Conditions of Effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit are:
a)  signing of the performance contract and the subsidiary loan
agreement between ECG and GOG (paras 1.35 and 2.04); and
b)  effectiveness of CDC and ODA cofinancing (para. 2.05).
3.03     On the basis of the above agreements, the proposed project is
suitable for an IDA credit of US$40 million to the Republic of Ghana.

'TERMS OF RZFERIENCL FOIR THE
NATIONAL ELECTIR FICATION PLANNING S'T'UDY
A.   I NTROl)UCTIO-
T'hle  Government  of  Ghana,  in  close  cooperation with the
Ellectricity Corporation of Ghana (LCG) -- the power distribution
utility in southern Ghana -- and the Volta Rliver Authiority (VRA)
-- thc ceneration and  transmission  utility  in  Ghana,  and the
distribution utility  in northern  Ghana - wishes to consider the
exualnsion of electricity surmAies to  all  parts  of  the country
within  thirty  y^ars.        To  this end, the Government of Ghana
intends   to   uncertake   a   study   to   prepare   a  National
Electrification rlaster Plan.
B.   EX-ISTrING GEN'ERATIO'N AND Tl'RA-Se;ISSION FACILITIES
The total installec' qenerating capacity in Ghana is about
1130 '-!W,  of  which  95%  is  hydro  electric.       The remainder
comprises diesel units installed in several stations varying in
size frorrm 51 kti to 30 11Wi, which arc generally  in poor condition.
Hydro capacity is installcd in two stations owned by VRA on the
Volta River -- the Akosombo plant (912 M1W), commissioned in the
micd-1960s, and the Koong Plant (160 Pill) commissioned in 1982.
Both hv(yro plants are in good operating condition.
As a first steD to a thermal comolementation process, the
existinq 10 x 3 ;MW diescl generatinc station at Tema is to be
rehabilitated to serve as  standby and  complement Akosombo/Kpong
hydro generation.
The VRA  161 kV  transmission system  totals over 1,300 km.
Light circuiits of 67 km connect the Akosor;mbo and Kpong  plants to
the VALCO  smelter at Tema and other industrial loads.   A 650 km
transmission loop supplies ECG areas and mines in southern Ghana.
VRA has pioneered electrical power supply across national
boundaries in Wecst Africa, and has so far supplied power to Togo,
Benin and Cote d'Ivoire, and hopes to link up with Nigeria and
Burkina  Faso.       A  161  kV  interconnection  with  Communaute
Electrique du Benin (CEB) connects Akosombo to Lome (Togo). In
1983, Cote d'Ivoire was also interconnected through a 225 kV
transmission line.
VRA presently is also undertaking an extension of the 161kV
system in Ghana from Kumasi through Brong Ahafo to the Northern,
Upper East and the Upper West Regions of Ghana.   This  will take
over the local generation in the major towns in these regions.
An extensive electrification is also beinq developed to major
districts and key areas of economic activities in thcse Regions;

Takorac.i -- anri in other ur'ban centres locatedA within the inter-
conlnect-(' qric' which. covers  t'c southern part of Ghana.   About
9.,% of T,ECGIs electricitv rocruirenrent is purchased from VRA.   ECG
also  operites  a  numober  of  isolated stations on behalf of the
.CGvern,-.cnt, which suhsicizes th^ oporation of  these facilities.
ECM,  un6er  a  world  Ban'  finance  rehabilitation  prograr., is
nlanni.nq  to  rctire  fivo   of  its   six  dicsel   stations  by
intercon-ecting  the  towns  supnlied  by  them  to  the national
notwtor'; .
The  Northern  Electricity  Department   (NED)  of   VRA  is
resnonsible for eiectricity distribution in the northern section
of the country.   The NED's distribution  networks  arc currently
isolated,   taking   supplies   from  its  thirteen  (13)  diesel
generatinq plants which are also generally in poor operational
condition.
D.   PRESENT D)EVELOPMENT
Tihero is an existing Governmnent Policy that encourages
communities throuqh self help to purchase  distribution poles for
erection in  their towns  and villages.         Government after that
provi(des transformiers, conductors and  other line  accessories to
enable  commuinities  enjoy  electricity.    The study should take
note of all such towns which should receive high priority in the
exnansion programme.
E.   OBJECTIVE OF TIlE STUDY
The objective of the study is to prepare a master plan to
extend the electricity supplies  to  the  Ghanaian  population at
least  cost  and  within  bu dgetary  constraints  imposed by the
Government.   In order to  achieve this  objective the consultant
shall:
(i) Dctermine the least cost expansion scheme to provide
electricity supply to towns and villages in Ghana from
extension of the existing network, diesel generation,
mini/micro hydro generation, solar sources, indigenous

energy source such as biomass, wood rcsidues or others,
in or(der to meet the load demands of existing and new
consumers in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020.
(ii) Dcvelop a method to cvaluate the provision of power
supply to different parts of Gharia based on economic,
technical anc' social criteria.
(iii)  Develop the  optimal distribution  scheme for different
load densities in Ghana.
F.   PLAN PERIOD AND COVE,RAGE
The National Electrification  Scheme  will  cover  a 30-yrear
period which starts in 1989 and is divided into five-year
intervals for planning purposes.   All poplulated/developed areas
of Ghana or those with potential for development :ill be
considered  for  expansion  of  electricity  supplies   based  on
economic   activities   (such   as  trade,  agro-based  business,
industry, mining, tourism, etc.) as well as on social facilities
(such as education, health, recreation, etc.).   The study should
be completed within approximately 15 months.
G.   SCOPE OF WOR1K
The study will be carried out in four phases as described
below.      Each  phase  will conclude with submission of a draft
report.   The draft report  will be  reviewed and  commented upon
within 30 days after submission.    The comments will be included
in the final version of the phase report, as well as in the
preparation of next phase reports.
I.   PHASE ONE
The consultant will:
(i)  become familiar with the VRA/ECG power system;
(ii) collect and review the studies done on the power sector
in Ghana (Annex I gives a list of studies already done
in the power sector);
(iii) compile a list of all towns and villages that have
erected poles and then prepare quantities of materials
required to bring power to each community, provided
that the supply from the nearest source will not be
prejudicial to the proposed study;
(iv)   arraiige  for  any local support/subcontracting required
and begin collecting data for load forecasts; and



- 35 -              Annex 1-4
Page 4 of 5
(v)   identify the next steps to bc taken.
This phase shall take three months to complete.   The report
at thc end of this phase will summarize the results of all
studies carried out in the power sector pertinent to this study,
and will outline the economic and deemographic parameters that
will be used in prenaration for the load forecast.
II.  PTINSE TWO
The consultant will:
(i) prepare the load forecast;
(ii) outline the different transmission and distribution
schemes that will be analyzed in the next phase; and
(iii) identify the technical, social and economic parameters
to be used in the analysis in the next phasc.   This
phase is to be completed in two months.
III. PHIASE THIREE
The consultant will:
(i) carry out economic analysis to determine the optimal
system  expansion  scheme  and   define  the  technical
characteristics  of   such  a   system  throughout  the
planning period.  This should include definition of:
(a) voltagc levels;
(b) substation sizes and specs;
(c)  0/l- circuits including wire and poles; and,
(d) system configurations including distribution
schemes for different load densities.
(ii) develop and outline in detail a method to evaluate the
system  expansions  to  any  area.       This method will
include criteria such as:
(a) populations;
(b) economic activity;
(c) expected revenue using existing tariffs; ,and,
(d) minimum revenue requirements to recover investment
costs.

Page 5 of 5
This phase should be carriod out in four months.
IV   PhIASE FOUIR
The consultant will prepare:
(i)  the  optimal  (least  cost)  expansion  scheme  for the
VRA/ECG      transmission,       sub-transmission,       and
distribution system in terms of voltaqg levels, size of
substations, single- versus thrce-phase, and other
technical options available; and
(ii)   the   optimal   (least   cost)   power  generation  and
distribution scheme for any isolated system that has
been recommended.    'The study  will apply the methods
developed in Phase Three to corme up with the optimal
sytem expansion for 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2020,
including all costs and financial implications for the
sector.
This phase should he carried out in three months.
H.   ON ThE JOB TRAINING
The Government will make available 6 engineers/economists to
work with the Consultants during preparation of the study. The
Consultants  should   allow  for  necessary  travel  and  related
expenses to provide for about 18 man-months of on-the-job
training in Ghana and/or overseas as appropriate.
I.   USE OF LOCAL CONSULTANTS
The Consultants are encouraged to use (under their guidance)
local consultants as counterparts  in  the  study.    This, among
other factors, will be considered in the evaluation of the
proposals.
J.   DELIVERABLES
1.   Proposals should allow for  necessary computer  hardware and
software to update the Master Plan and carry out the
evaluation methodology for the electrification of towns and
villages.
2.   Phase reports will be issued in draft form, 15 copies each.
3.   The Consultant will provide 50 copies of the Final Report.

GHANA
ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
General
1.       ECG's unaudited 1988 accounts have been restructured to reflect
Government's agreed restructuring of ECG's capital, as detailed at paras.
1.46-1.47 above. The restructured 1988 accounts and ECG's 1989 budget
provide the basis for the financial projections.
2.       The auction exchange rate of US$1 = ¢260, prevailing at the time
of negotiations, was used in the preparation of the project costs and for
the financial projections.  Future inflation rates used are as follows:
Local     Foreign
1988                 21.8Z         5.4Z
1989                 15.22         5.4%
1990                  9.1X         5.4Z
1991                  6.6Z         3.6%
1992-1995             5.02         3.6Z
1996-2000             5.0X         4.6Z
Profit and Loss Account
Revenues
3.       Sales Revenues:  ECG's GWh sales have been increased by 5X
annually. Tariffs are assumed to increase from 1989 onwards to enable ECG
to achieve the following rates of return on its average revalued net fixed
assets: 6Z in 1989, 7% in 1990 and 8% thereafter.
4.       Street Lighting Levy:  ECG is responsible for all expenses related
to public street lighting, and is authorized to add a charge of 1% to all
billings to help defray these expenses. ECG assumes 20% of this income
will be used for street-lighting maintenance, the balance being the cost of
electricity consumption.
5.       Other Income:  This consists primarily of disconnection and
reconnection fees, overhead services for customers, sales of stores, and
miscellaneous receipts. The 1989 budget has been adjusted by local
inflation for future years' projections.
6.       Consumer Contribution A.mortization:  See para. 25.

ANNEX 1-8
Page 2 of 4
Operating Expenses
7,       VRA Bulk Supply:  VRA purchases have been assumed to increase by
the projected 5X annual sales growth rate, less efficiency improvements
(loss reductions) as set out at Annex 1-3. The purchase price for VRA
supply is based on the 1989 budgetted rate of 03.1/kWh, adjusted for future
years by local inflation.
8.       Generating Expenses:  ECG's 1989 budget has been increased by
local inflation until 1990. By then most of the system will be connected
to the grid, four stations will be de-commissioned, and only one generating
station will remain in service.
9.       Distribution Repairs and Maintenance:  grossly inadequate
expenditure in the past, due to ECG's financial situation. Expenses for
1989 reflect ECG's budget provision; from 1990 on they are projected at
0.52 of gross fixed assets, which is a more appropriate level.
10.      Transportation:  Costs have been calculated based on historical
maintenance and operating unit costs per vehicle, adjusted by local
inflation, and for changes to the vehicle fleet number (Attachment 1).
11.      Salaries:  Based on end-1988 average wages for 3,660 employees
adjusted for proposed staff reductions to 2,840 employees by 1990
(Attachment 1), and for local inflation. The salaries expenses also
include normal retirement benefits.
12.      Other Adhinistrative Expenses:  ECG's 1989 budget, increased by
local inflation. These are comprised of typical overhead items such as
office rentals, maintenance, supplies, and other expenses not directly
related to operations.
13.      Bad Debts Written Off:  These projections have been based on
significantly improved revenue collections targets, per the Corporate Plan,
which will result in a reduction from almost 15% of sales in 1987 when an
extraordinary provision for bad debts was made, to 1X in 1988-90 and 0.5Z
thereafter.
14.      Depreciation:  Depreciation has been charged on a straight-line
basis over the expected life of the assets, at an average rate of 4Z on the
opening balance of gross fixed assets in operation. All rehabilitation
expenses have been treated as deferred maintenance. Cumulative
depreciation has been reduced in 1989 (after completion of the
rehabilitation under Cr. 1628 project) and in 1994 (after completion of
Power V) by 50% of the total cost of fixed asset rehabilitation, to reflect
the extended life of certain fixed assets following their rehabilitation.
The balance of rehabilitation costs will be written off, starting in 1991,
over the 15 years' repayment period of the IDA subsidiary loans.
15.      Consultancy and Training Write-Off:  Expenditures under the
proposed Power V project will be written off over the five years following
project completion.

ANNEX 1-8
Page 3 of 4
16.      Interest.  See ECG's Loan Summary at Attachment 1.
17.      Foreign Exchange Losses Written Off:  See Loan Summary at
Attachment 1. ECG's foreign currency loans, and subsidiary loans on which
it bears the foreign exchange risk, are revalued every year-end at
prevailing exchange rates. Foreign exchange losses on loans from 1989
onwards related to fixed assets in service have been written off against
the Revaluation Reserve at the end of the year in which they occur.
Foreign exchange losses related to loans for on-going works are added to
Work in Progress, and capitalized. Cumulative foreign exchange losses not
written off at end 1988 (¢9241 million) have been partly (02500 million)
written off in 1988, reflecting the debt/equity conversion, and the balance
is written off over the 10 year life of the Government loan in respect of
the rescheduled debt.
18.      Staff Redundancy and Performance Incentives:  Costs of the Staff
Redundancy Program reflect severance payments and accrued retirement
benefits payable to 820 affected staff, a reduction from 3660 to 2840.
Performance incentives are calculated at 5OZ of base benefits, to reward
perfoLmance and efficiency improvements of ECG staff under the performance
contract.
19.      Welfare Fund Contribution:  ECG is required to contribute up to 5X
of its net profits to a fund to benefit staff.
Funds Flow Statement
20.      Working Capital Changes relate to movement in inventories,
debtors, and creditors which are explained below (paras. 28-30).
21.      Debt Repayment:  See ECG's Loan Summary, at Attachment 1.
22.      Capital Investment:  Power V investments are in accordance with
Annex 2-2. From 1993, a global provision has been made for future system
expansion at the rate of 5% per annum - about US$16 million annual capital
investment.
23.      Housing, Transport, Meters Funds:  ECG have agreed not to
undertake new investments in excess of US$2 million annually during the
project period. However, certain moderate recurrent investments will be
required, which ECG must finance from its own resources:
(a) The Housing/Office Building Program is incremental to that
provided in the proposed project, to assist in the recruitment and
retention of key staff and to improve working conditions.
(b) The productive life of vehicles in Ghana is about 4 years, and ECG
will still be paying for vehicles provided under the on-going
project long after they have been written off. The
Transport/Equipment Replacement Fund has been designed to provide
internal funds for necessary additional/replacement vehicles to
carry out ECG's operations beyond the small number incladed in the
proposed project.

ANNEX 1-8
Page 4 of 4
(c) The Meters Replacement Fund is designed to provide internal funds
for replacement of approximately 1,000 meters per year (excluding
those not already covered by Cr. 1628 and the proposed Power V
project).
24.      Borrowing:  See Loan Summary at Attachment 1.  New borrowings,
based on the agreed project financing plan, are assumed at US$98.2 million
equivalent for Power V, and at 80X of the cost of new works from 1993
onw&rds (loans for 20 years, with 5 years grace at 7.51 interest).
25.      Consumer Contributions:  Consumer contributions are based on the
1989 budget, increased by the sales growth rate of 52; contributions which
relate to capital investment are amortized over 25 years.
Balance Sheets
26.      Fixed Assets and Accumulated Depreciation:  See Fixed Assets
Schedule, Attachment 2. Fixed Assets and Accumulated Depreciation have
been revalued on the opening balance each year by a factor comprised of 20Z
of local inflation and 802 of foreign inflation. This reflects the
historic relationship of foreign to local investment costs. The surplus is
carried each year to ECG's revaluation reserve.
27.      Deferred Charges:  See Attachment 2.  Delayed Maintenance is the
written-down balance (see para. 14 above) of expenditures on rehabilitation
works under Cr. 1628 and Power V. Consultancy and Training charges relate
to Power V only.
28.      Debtors have been assumed, as a result of revenue collections
improvements, to reduce from 8 months' billings in 1987 to 5 months in
1988, and progressively to 2.6 months' billings in 1992 and thereafter.
29.      Inventories are projected at about 18 months requirements, in
light of procurement/shipping conditions in Ghana.
30.      Payables have been assumed at 1 month's cash operating expenses.

GHANA
ELECTRICITY CORPORATION OF GHANA
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Project Description
1.       The proposed Project comprises three major components namely:  an
institutional development component, an investment component, and a sector
development strategy component.
I. Institutional Development Component
2.       This focuses on the commercialization of ECG through:
a)  Completion of the wAnagement reorganization that started under
Credit 1628-GH and addressing especially the Accra region by:
i)   nominating a qualified officer at headquarters to be
responsible for all the 33 kV system and the 33 kV/l1 kV
substations, thereby separating the highly technical
functions from the less technical and administrative
responsibilities in Accra; and
ii) subdividing Accra region into three districts, each to be
headed by a District Manager responsible for the commercial
aspects of the business.
b) A performance contract, to be signed between ECG and GOG, to
improve ECG's efficiency as a power utility and comprising of
multi-year programs, budgets, and targets for each year through
1992, to be monitored by performance indicators in five key areas
of operations -- sales/revenue, collections, manpower reductions,
quality of supply and physical project implementation;
c) Financial restructuring of ECG through conversion of debt to
equity, and settlement of cross-debts;
d) A staff development and training program. This will identify all
personnel requirements year by year through 1992 and the staff
profile to fill the different tasks. A detailed training program
is then derived focusing on special training needs to upgrade
staff level. Training is identified as in-house, through other
institutions in Ghana, or overseas. This component aims at
achieving the necessary complement for ECG to fulfill its mission
by mid-1990's; and
e) A staff redundancy program to reduce staff numbers from 3,660 to
2,840 by 1992;



- 49 -
Annex 2-1
Page 2 of 4
f) A program of technical assistance from a mature power utility to
fill key positions where special skills are needed, or where staff
members of ECG are on training. The technical assistance for the
next four years ending 1992 is estimated at about 25 man-years.
This includes short term assignments ranging from four days to
several weeks to address particular and specific tasks, as well as
long term technical assistance;
g) The development of computer-based management information systems.
II. Investment Component
3.       The investment component consists of ECG's 1989-1993 investment
program, addressing the needs in the areas listed below. (They have been
grouped, where possible, according to the Investment Program givei. at
Annex 2-2).
A. Subtransmission System
4.       Reinforcement and extension of the subtransmission system in
Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi, Koforidua, Tema and Cape Coast. This includes:
a)   Supply and erection of 70 km 0/H kV lines and 35 km of U/G cables.
b)   Supply and erection of two 1OMVA 33/llkV substations, and
extension of nine existing 33/llkV substations by one IOMVA
transformer and associated switchgear.
c)   Extension of the subtransmission system to Adeiso, Asikuma and
Axim to provide hydroelectric power to these towns and retire the
existing diesel generators.
d)   Conversion of the operating voltage of the lines Akwatia-Akimoda
and Koforidua-Tafo from 11 kV to 33 kV to improve voltage
conditions and reduce losses, by adding step-up and step-down
transformers at each end. These lines were designed for 33 kV and
were operating at 11 kV.
e)   Consultancy support for engineering and construction supervision.
B. Distribution System
5.       Completion of the rehabilitation reinforcement and extension of
the distribution system in Accra, Kumasi, Secondi/Takoradi, Koforidua,
Tema, Cape Coast and Ho in order to meet the load growth to mid-1990's.
This includes:
a)   Supply and erection of distribution transformers and substations
totalling about 50MVA, for extension of networks and replacement
of burned out transformers



- 50 -
Annex 2-1
Page 3 of 4
b)   Supply and erection of about 144km of 11 KV O/H lines and
rehabilitation of about 71 km of lines
c)   Supply and erection of about 81km of llkV U/G cables and
replacement of about 6 km of cables.
d)   Supply and erection of about 38km of L.t. circuits and replacement
of about 360km L.T., mainly of customers erected network.
e)   Supply and erection of materials for the rehabilitation,

FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Economic Analysis
Economic Costs
1.       The economic costs of the proposed project consist of:  (i) the
capital investment in sub-transmission and distribution system (including
1OZ physical contingencies) and the associated operation and maintenance
costs; and (ii) the opportunity cost of lost exports, due to the increase
in Ghanaian consumption of electricity. The latter cost is incurred by the
economy when an increase in local demand reduces the opportunity to export
electricity to VALCO and the neighboring countries. In a 1987 tariff
study, Coopers & Lybrand, U.K. (SAR para. 1.22) estimated the value of lost
exports at 2.2 USt/kWh and this figure has been used in the economic
analysis.
Project Benefits
2.       The proposed project would rehabilitate and extend the ECG system
in the existing service areas enabling ECG to: (i) meet the growing demand
for electricity through 1995; (ii) reduce technical losses to an acceptable
level; and (iii) connect a few small isolated networks to the system. The
economic benefits associated with these improvements are included in the
analysis. The project would also significantly improve the reliability of
power supplies but no attempt was made to include these benefits in the
analysis because they are difficult to quantify and the project is
economically justified without them.
3.       The demand for energy is assumed to grow at 52 per year through
1995. This is based on a demand forecast prepared by ECG's consultants
which estimates that the demand for energy will grow at 4.72 per year
during the 1987-1997 period. The annual growth rate during the first half
of the projection period is more than 52 because of the suppressed demand
that cannot be served adequately by the existing distribution network. The
benefit of serving the additional demand is calculated by valuing the
incremental consumption at the consumers' willingness to pay for
electricity (para. 6 below).
4.       Technical losses are expected to decline from the present
estimated level of 18X of energy purchased from VRA to 82 by 1993. The
reductions in technical losses are valued at the Long Run Marginal Cost
(LRMC) of about 6 US¢/kWh for inclusion in the benefit stream of the
project.
5.       Four small isolated networks would be connected to the grid under
the proposed project. This is estimated to save about US$0.45 million
annually due to the difference in the cost of supply from the grid versus
diesel generation plus value of the additional sales.

ANNEX 2-7

Economic Rate of Return
6.       The incremental demand served is valued by the consumers'
willingness to pay for the electricity consumed. The most conservative
estimate of consumers' willingness to pay is the tariffs currently charged
for electricity. This is based on the argument that the price willingly
paid for electricity by a consumer indicates the minimum estimate of the
electricity's benefit to the consumer. Taking ECG's average tariff of
8 Cedi/kWh (about 3 US¢IkWh)l as the consumers' willingness to pay for
electricity results in an Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) of 201.
However, it is recognized that the average tariff understates consumers'
willingness to pay and therefore an element of consumer surplus is not
included in the project's benefits.
7.       The consumers' willingness to pay could easily be as high as 6
US¢/kWh which is halfway between the existing average tariff level of about
3 US¢/kWh and an estimated 9 USf/kWh2 for autogeneration by diesel. The 6
USM/kNh is a rather low estimate of consumers' willingness to pay when
Ghana is compared to the neighboring countries where consumers are actually
paying at least twice this amount to purchase electricity. The IERR
increases to 39Z with consumers' willingness to pay 6 US¢/kWh.
Sensitivity Analysis
8.       The sensitivity of the base case IERR (202) to a lower growth in
demand, or a lesser improvement in system losses are as follows. If the
demand for energy shows at 4.5Z instead of the projected 52, then the IERR
is reduced to 192. If the technical losses are reduced by 92 rather than
the expected 10?, that is 10 less than the set target, the IERR would
decline to 192. Since all IERR calculations are based on investment cost
with 1OZ physical contingencies, no attempt was made to check for the
sensitivity to cost overruns. Sensitivity of the IERR to the opportunity
cost of lost exports is demonstrated by valuing exports at 1.3 US¢/kWh
which is about the price paid by VALCO for electricity in 1987. Valuing
the exports at 1.3 US¢/kWh,3 which is 402 lower than what was assumed in
the base case, increases the IERR to 24Z.

(corresponding to US$15/barrel for crude oil), with 100X reserve margin
and 552 load factor.
