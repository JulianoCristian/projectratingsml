This project is a continuation of these efforts.\n            The main objectives of the project are : a) to avoid future\n            declines in yields and agricultural production; b) to reduce\n            the operation and maintenance  cost of the pumping stations;\n            and c) to strengthen the institutional capability of MED.\n            Project components include : 1) rehabilitation of pumping\n            stations; 2) supply of workshops, electrical laboratories\n            and miscellaneous equipment; 3) civil works ( e.g.\n            construction of new pumping stations, workshops, stores,\n            offices etc ); 4) institutional support; and 5) technical\n            assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1990-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
