  OED Mission: Enhancingdevelopmenteffectivenessthrough excellenceand independencein evaluation.


About this Report
      The Operations Evaluation Departmentassesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience.As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are
innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevantto upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons. The projects, topics, and analytical approaches selected for assessment support larger evaluation
studies.
      A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the Implementation Completion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to
validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
OED studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management approval. Once cleared internally, the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the OED Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work,
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies).Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Sustainabilify: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutional DevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutional arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.
      Borrower Performance:The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievement of development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This is the Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) preparedby the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) for the EgyptNational Drainage Project andthe Second
Pumping Stations RehabilitationProject. The National Drainage Project was approved in
November 1991 for an IBRDLoan o f US$45 millionand an IDA Credit o f US$75 million
and was cofinancedby Germany (KfW) for US$30 million and the Government o fthe
Netherlands for US$10 million. Itwas closed one year behindschedule and fully disbursed.
The Second Pumping StationsRehabilitationProject was approved inMay 1990for an
IBRDCredit US$31millionandclosed inDecember 1997, five months behindschedule
whenUS$0.3 millionwas cancelled. ParallelUSAIDfinancing ofUS$l.l millionto assist
MED's institutionaldevelopment was reallocatedto theMinistry ofWater Resources and
Irrigation for other uses.

        This report is basedon the ImplementationCompletion Reports (ICR) prepared
bythe MiddleEast andNorthAfrica Region, the MemorandaandRecommendations of
the President, Staff Appraisal Reports, loan documents, project files, and discussions with
Bank staff. An OED mission visitedEgypt inFebruary-March 2003 andmet stakeholders
to discuss the effectiveness o f the Bank's assistance with development and financing
partners, project implementingagencies, private sector agencies, and nongovernmental
organizations. The cooperation and assistance o f central government and regional
officials and staff, nongovernmental stakeholders, cofinanciers, and other interested
parties are gratefully acknowledged.

        While OED's earlier desk evaluation o fthese projects at exit mostly endorsedthe
Region's satisfactory outcome ratings, the experience o f five earlier drainage projects
since 1970 indicated that there have beenmajor problems over implementation delays,
deferredmaintenance, inadequate attention to institutional strengtheningand
development, and cost recovery. A major task for the assessment was to determine if
these systemic weaknesses have beenovercome.

        Following standard OED procedures, a draft PARwas sent to the borrower and
cofinanciers for comments but none were received from the government. Comments
received from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau(KfW) are attached as Annex C of this report.
Inaccordance withthe Bank's disclosure policy, the final report will be available to the
public following submission to the World Bank's BoardofExecutive Directors.

Summary

         The EgyptNational Drainage Project (NDP) andthe SecondPumping Stations
Rehabilitation Project (PSR2), approvedin 1991and 1990respectively, both supported
an overall objective to improve agricultural productivity. The particular objective of the
NDP was to remove excess water and salts from undrained areas, thus reversing land
deterioration. The objective of PSR2 was to rehabilitate pumpsto maintain irrigation,
ensure drainage, and reduce the cost of operations and maintenance. Bothprojects had
secondary institutional objectives to build capacity and make the Egyptian Authority for
Public Drainage Projects (EPADP) and Mechanical and ElectricalDepartment(MED)
more efficient and effective.

         The NationalDrainage Project achievedall its objectives with few shortcomings
and its outcome is rated as satisfactory. All the major targets for national drainage were
either achieved or exceeded. Institutional development, financed primarily by Germany
(KfW) andthe Netherlands, built significant capacity withintheEgyptian Authority for
Public Drainage Projects (EPADP). Training improved skills, not only within the
government but also among private sector contractors. Innovation was fostered, and
drainage implementation now benefits from a geographic informationsystem, laser land
leveling and controls, and state-of-the-artdrainage pipe installation. Most importantly, a
viable monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was establishedand is working well to
identify and prioritize new works as well as monitoringthe impacts of investments.
Institutional development is ratedas substantial and sustainability is rated as likely.

        The outcomeofthe SecondPumping StationsRehabilitation Project (PSR2) is
ratedas moderately unsatisfactory.Although it exceededits objective, covering 70
pumping stations serving 1.7 million acres, there is little evidencethat the MEDhas
improved its way of working. Although two new Directorates were formed, that for
Technical Inspectionswas chronically understaffedincontrast to that for Civil Works.
Modernmanagementinformation systems andmonitoring and evaluation of pumping
stationperformanceto improve operationand management (O&M) andincrease
organizational efficiency were introducedbutwere only partially institutionalized inthe
precedingFirstPumping StationsRehabilitationProject. The PSR2's objective was to
makethese management systems hllyoperational.This effort failed underPSR2andthese
objectives are now part ofthe follow-on project that was approvedin 1999. Computerized

managementremains the norm (apart from a few small areas where water levels are
transmittedto a centralmonitoring point). Attempts to systematically monitor andevaluate
pumping station performancehaveproducednegligible results. While rehabilitation of
pumping stations reducedtheir O&M costs inthe short to mediumterm, there is no
evidence of a system-wideadoption of improved management.Emergency repairs and
rehabilitation appear to be the norm. Studies on costs recovery hadno effect on government
policy which is to fully subsidize O&M. Institutional developmentis thus ratedas
negligible and sustainability is ratedunlikely.

         Bank performance i s rated as satisfactory for NDP, but unsatisfactory for PSR2.
While institutional development was givenhighprominence inthe NDP and Bank
partnerships were established with KfW and the Netherlands to achieve this, similar
attention was not givenunder PSR2. While preliminary arrangements for institutional
support were agreed with USAIDat appraisal, they fell apart during supervision. When
MEDsaid it couldnot meetits institutional targets, the Bank allowed themto rollthem
over to the follow-on project.

         Borrower performance, similarly, i s rated satisfactory for NDP and unsatisfactory
for PSR2.

         After project closure, the Ministryof Water Resources and Irrigation(MWRI)
established an Institutional Reform Unit.The unit i s charged with strategic coordination
and detailing o f the Ministry's 2001 "Vision o f Institutional Reform" before initiating
and implementingdecentralizationand privatization o f water management and O & M
activities. While there has been notable progress toward integration o f the management o f
irrigation and drainage (supported by the Bank inpartnership with bilateral donors), little
attention has been givento addressing reform o f MED.Expanding the focus on
institutional development o fthe MED i s a priority. Continued support to the MWRIfor
institutional reform and integrating irrigation and drainage operations i s important given
that there are strong Egyptian champions for change. Recovery o f O&M costs, however,
while needingextensive sector policy dialogue, is unlikelyto be successful without a
challenge to the government's broader role as welfare provider.

        The project experience offers two lessons:

    0   Disbursementandphysical achievements are not always good indicators ofproject
        success. Failure to address systemic institutionalproblems may adversely affect
        operational efficiency and sustainability o fproject works, andmake lending
        ineffective. This not only hampers the Bank's reform agenda, but it also causes
        concem among the Bank's development partners who see the Bank as the only
        interlocutor with any leverage withthe GOEto introduce institutionaland policy
        reforms.

    0   In-countryBank partnershipwith bilateral development agenciesi s a powerful
        instrumentfor institutionalreform. Typically, bilateral agencies develop long-term
        institution-buildingrelationships with government inspecific sectors, which may
        significantly increasethe utility, relevance, andleverage o fBank assistance.InEgypt,
        bilaterals bringdiffering perspectives to the water andagriculture subsector andare

 1.       Background

 1.       Agriculture has beenand remains an important sector o fthe Egyptian economy,
althoughit now only accounts for about 17percent o f GDP because o fthe growth o f
industry, manufacturing, andservice industries.'Evenso, agriculture provides 36 percent of
national employment. Almost two-thirds o fthe poor live inrural areas and are primarily
dependenton agriculture andrelated industries for survival. Agriculture, except for the
Mediterranean littoral and desert oases, i s almost totally dependent on the Nile and the
irrigation and drainage it provides.Water availability, governed by the Egypt-Sudan water
treaty, i s limited, and a major planning goal i s to maximize the returns from this resource in
an environmentally sustainable manner.

2.        Efficient land management i s key to Egypt's agricultural productivity. O fthe 7.5
millionfeddam of cultivated land, 5.4 million are relatively well-managed `old lands', while
the balance o f 1.9 millionare `new lands' that have beenreclaimedsince 1952 fromthe
peripheryofthe Nile Delta and the desert.' Apart from improved irrigation supply canals and
subsurface drainage, over 1,000 pumps are requiredto keep the water moving. Thus, for
example, inUpperEgyptmore than 200 pumping stations are requiredto irrigate higher
lands, while inthe Delta, 228 pumpingstations provide irrigation and almost 100 large
pumpingstations are requiredto excavate drainage effluent to the sea.

3.        Inthe period 1952-90, Egyptpursuedaninvestmentstrategy that was largely public-
sector ledand inward-looking andthat led to highgrowth inoil boom years. However, this
strategy delivered less than optimal allocation o fresources and created large fiscal and
current account deficits, a situation made worse by a number o f external shocks inthe second
half o f the 1980s. By 1990, external debt had reached US$51 billion (144 percent o f GNP).
Consequently, investmentinagricultural and related irrigation and drainage infrastructure
declined from 25 percent o fthe public sector budget inthe 1960s to 13 percent inthe mid-
1980s. And untilthe late 1980s, inresponse to self-sufficiency concerns, pervasive
government intervention inagricultural pricing, production, marketing, and trade severely
distorted market forces and reduced the overall efficiency o f agricultural production despite
highland-use intensities3Inconsequence, the low level o finvestment indrainage could not
keep pace with more intensiveandextensive irrigation, and agricultural productivity was
further hinderedby waterlogging and soil salinization. Thus, bythe late 1980s, about 2
millionfeddans or almost 40 percent of the `old lands' lackedmodern subsurface drainage.

4.        The two projects being assessedwere formulated ina period o f structural adjustment
and agricultural transition. The government initiated substantial agricultural policy reform in
1986, and a second roundstarted in 1990 when an ambitious economic reform and structural


1. Agriculture's share o f GDP has steadily declined from 25.5% in 1980, to 19.9% in 1990 and 16.7% in 1998.
2, A feddan is 1.037 acres or 0.420 hectares (ha).
3. Inthe 1990s, Egypt's cropping intensity was about 180 percent-that is, two crops were grown on most of
the area. Major crops were wheat, maize, rice, berseem, cotton, broadbeans, sugarcane, vegetables, and fruit.
Rice is confined to the Delta and sugarcane to the valley. New landstend to be planted with high-value
groundnuts, fruits, and vegetables.

adjustment program was la~nched.~Controls on crops, planted area andprices, and state
procurement,were eliminated on all crops except cotton and sugarcane, thus allowing room
for a growing private sector. Publicly owned farms were divested and subsidieswere reduced
for livestock and most feed inputs, fertilizer, andpesticides. However, restrictions remained
on the import of agricultural equipment.There remained strong government resistance to
establishing a structure for irrigation and drainage service fees, as well as revisions of rural
landtax policy to bring inthe majority of farmers -most ofwhom own 2-3 feddansofland.

5.         Inresponseto these challengesEgypt's agricultural sector has, since 1960, attracted
the secondbiggest share ofBank investments(US$825 million) after the power andenergy
sector (US$2,056 milli~n).~         Including the assessed projects, this agricultural investment
comprisedseven major drainage, one channel maintenance, andtwo pumping station
rehabilitation projects (see Annex B for details). Additionally, the African Development
Bank, USAID,Germany, andtheNetherlandshave beenlong-term cofinancing partnerswith
the Bank inthe drainage subsector. The EU, USAID, CIDA, andthe Netherlands have
maintained strong bilateral assistance to the agricultural sector.

6.        The Bank's agricultural development strategy for Egypt at the time the assessed
projects were formulated emphasizedimprovement inthe efficiency ofthe agricultural
resource base through improved infrastructure and capacity utilization, and expansion of
agriculture through reclamation. All assistance for irrigation and drainage was implemented
through the line agencies ofthe Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation(MWRI, as the
Ministryof Public Works and Water Resourceswas renamedin 1999). Inearly 1991, a Food
andAgricultural OrganizatiodWorld Bank Cooperative Program assistedthe Egyptian
Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP) to identify a 12-yearNationalDrainage
Program that would complete installationof modern agricultural drainage throughout the
country. The first six-years of the program was the NationalDrainage Project. The
Mechanical andElectrical Department(MED) was responsible for continued rehabilitation of
pumping stations that was identifiedas a priority inthe 1981Irrigationand Land
Reclamation Subsector Review (Report No. 3371-EGT). Although completion of the first
Bank-financed pumping station rehabilitation program was delayed from 1989untilJune
1992, the SecondPumping Stations Rehabilitation Project (PSR2) was approved in 1990.6




4. The macroeconomicstabilization program was primarily supportedby an IMF Standby Arrangement (SBA)
and the World Bank provided a US$300 million Structural Adjustment Loan (Loan 3553-EGT) in June 1991,
The first tranche of US$I50 million was fully disbursed by August 1992 and the second tranche was cancelled
by the governmentwhen IMF's stand-by arrangements became available,
5. In this context, investmentsincludes Bank loans and credits.
6. IrrigationPumping Stations Rehabilitation Project, to be implemented 1983-89 using IBRDLoan 2561 for
US$40.5 million, was completedthree years late in 1992. An OED cluster audit of 5 agricultural projects
included this first project and rated its outcome as highly satisfactory:

          Financing of the PSR2 was shared by the government, the Bank (IBRD), and

and training component independentlyunder its Irrigation Management Systemsprogram.
Financing o fNDP was more complex and involved four partners ina mixture o f parallel
loans and grants, Table 1. Germany gave 10 percent o f its financing as a grant, which was
usedfor the environmental component and purchase o fvehicles. The Netherlands
contribution was inthe form o f a bilateral grant. As noted inTable 1, $37.8 million was
added to the budgeto f NDP to allow for an urgent procurement o f electromechanical
pumpingequipmentfor use inthe pumpingstations rehabilitationproject. As this was
primarily imported equipment, the Bank, Germany, and the Netherlands provided the
finance, and the Bank's $28.5 million share was transferred from the subsurface drainage
component, which was made good by government.

8.        Objectives. Bothprojects supported an overall objective to improve agricultural
productivity. The NDP's specific objective was to remove excess water and salts from
undrained areas, thus reversingland deterioration. The PSR2's technical objective was to
rehabilitate pumpsthat were essential to maintain irrigation and ensure drainage. Both
projects had also had institutional objectives. Table 2 shows how project components were
designedto support achievement o fthese objectives.

DESIGN   ISSUES

NationalDrainage Project

9.      Bank management indicated early inthe preparationthat they wanted a change from
the established pattern o f repeater projects. They pressed for a programmatic approach that
would give attention to institutional development and environment, promote innovation in
drainage technology, address cost recovery, and develop monitoring and evaluation (M&E).
Inresponse, the NDP was designedas atwo-phase 10-year programbuiltaround a2-year
rollingprogram that allowed the flexibility to redirect finance away from non-performing
project components.

10.     Preparationwas undertaken by FAO/WBCP building on work o f an Egyptian-Dutch
team and ongoing parallel projects and went smoothly. A proposalto further strengthen
EPADP's factories that producedplastic pipe for subsurface drains was criticized as being in
conflict with the SAL. But when staff demonstrated that EPADP was the sole user and that
the scale o fthe exercise -65,000 kilometers o fcorrugated PVC pipe-made import very
expensive, management approved expansion o f EPADP's pipe production capacity. EPADP
was optimistic about improving recovery o f capital costs (it was 50% in 1989/90because the
Bank supported a 7.5 percent incentive fee for tax collectors. However, Bank staff felt there
would be no response from GOE on increasing recovery of O&M costs. It was agreed that
this would be bettercovered under USAID's technical assistanceprogram for the irrigation
sector. Similarly, M&E and other institutional development and training, including
management information systems (MIS), would be financed and managed by Germany and
the Netherlands.

11.     Just before negotiations were approved, Bank management added, without it being
requested by GOE, an additional US$50 million o f IDA credit to the U S 7 0 million IBRD
loan because the level o f overall Bank lendingto Egypt was low relative to Bank
expectations. At negotiations, GOE agreed to increase its borrowing ifthe IDA component
was increased to US$70 million and the more expensive IBRD amount reduced to U S 5 0
million -a proposal the Bank agreed to.

Second Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project

12.     Major problems affecting the implementation o fthe preceding first Pumping Stations
Rehabilitation Project were procurement, slow progress on introducing better operation and
plannedmaintenance, and negligible progress on cost accounting and cost recovery. It took
until 1988-five years after signing-for MED's acceptance of standard Bank-approved
International Competitive BiddingDocuments (ICB) and only then did procurement cease to
be a major obstacle. Significant cost savings comparedwith appraisal estimates allowed
project expansion from 30 to 140pumpingstations. While this was lauded inthe ICR as
indicating improved efficiency and larger benefits, some Bank reviewers o f the first project's
experience felt this only confirmed the lack o f systematic planning and poor inventory o f
MED's pumpingplant. At the time the first project's scope was enlarged, the Bank's Project
Advisor argued that this was an opportunity to add cost-recovery as a condition -a move

                                               6


strongly resistedby project staff given the initiation of agricultural sector reform (para. 4)
andthe probable unwillingness of GOEto agree. Thus, as the first project was drawing to a
close, there had beenalmost no progresson systemic institutional issues andthese were to be
taken up by the secondproject -the subject ofthis assessment.

13.      While agreeingthat there was adequatejustification for further rehabilitation, the
report of the FAO/WBCP preparation team arguedthat the Bank neededto address
unresolved issues -buildingefficient managementinformationandcost accounting systems
-tojustifyitscontinuedinvolvement.TheRegionalProjectAdvisor'sreviewoftheFinal
Executive Project Summary statedthat improved maintenanceproceduresidentifiedin 1986
were not implementedby 1989 andthat there was little evidence that the borrower hada
commitment to putting inplace an effective MIS, noting that the organizational structure for
implementing the MIS had not evenbeendiscussed at MED's senior managementlevel. H e
also felt that there should be a greater focus on long-term planning for O&M, adequate
funding for it, and attention to reorganization of MED.

14.      Cost recovery was a sensitive issue. At and early review stage in 1989, regional
managementbelieved that government commitment to it might not be forthcoming because
there was a defacto cost recovery through landtaxes and government procurementof crops
at less than marketprice. Accordingly, it was agreedthat cost recovery should be pursuedin
the context of amore wide-ranging operation, e.g., a SALor sector loan, butthat inthe
interim,MEDshould initiate cost recovery studies to inform suchloans. Itwas also agreed
that small booster pumping stations should be fully divestedto farmers' groups to operate
andmaintaindespite staff objections that there was no evidence that farmers couldmange
such pumps or were willing to do so.

15.      As a result of these discussions, the appraisalteam gave more emphasisto
institutional support for two new General Directorates for Technical Inspections and for Civil
Works. Additional equipment-over and above that inthe first phaseproject -was added
to strengthenthe MIS system. Technical assistance to buildcapacity to operate the MIS and
provide training was to be independently financed by USAID.And inthe absence of firm
criteria to select pumping stations for rehabilitation -a repeat ofthe situation during
appraisal of the first project -the initial program selected 25 stations after which a two-year
rollingplanwould be formulated starting in 1992. Shortly before the project was negotiated,
the GOE requestedthat the costs be reducedby US$30 million, thus taking it downto
US$49.1 million andthe Bank's loanto US$3 1.1million. As a result, two of the largest
pumping stations, El Max and El Tabiya were dropped. The rationale was that government
inaction on controlling industrial pollution from Alexandria had ledto severe pump corrosion
problems. Even so, an environmental component (water quality monitoring) associatedwith
them was retainedas ameans ofproviding leverageto collect andtreat Alexandria's waste
waters. The project was approved inMay 1990.

IMPLEMENTATION

16.      The effectivenessof bothprojects was delayedbefore they were ratified by the
Egyptian Parliament, the PSR2 by almost 18 months andNDP by 10months.

National Drainage Project

17.      Implementation proceeded with few problems, but there were delays caused by
contractual problems -however, compared with previous Bank projects which had delays
o f three to five years, this was a great improvement. An unresolved issue was the
unwillingnesso f GOE's line agencies to use special accounts to pay contractors. Eventhough
contractors were paid from local EPADP budgets and reimbursedlater by the donors, this
took considerable time and the resultingcash flow problems slowed the physical works.
Delays were exacerbated by nine contracts that had to be rebiddue to non-performance.
Furthermore, farmers did not cooperate becausepayments o f crop damage compensation was
below market prices and was normally delayed until drainage ina contract area was
completed -a problem that i s still not res01ved.~

Second Pumping Stations Rehabilitation

18.      The second project, like the first, encountered significant problems with standardizing
biddingdocuments and procurement and took almost two years to resolve. A Bank
procurement mission found that capabilities inMEDwere not adequate to develop acceptable
documents -there        had beenlittle progress infinalizing draft documents on the basis o f
Bank review comments six months earlier. The surprising aspect i s that MEDmust have
encountered and overcome similar problems inthe first project (para. 12) -clearly this
illustratedMED's weak institutional memory and the Bank's failure to address an obvious
issue before negotiations.8Technical specification was also problematic as MED was not up
to date with the latest developments. As a result, most bidders included several (better)
alternatives to the equipment beingtenderedand this complicatedtechnical evaluation.
Eventually, the Bank, abdicating its quality assurance role, pragmatically advised MEDto
look only at bids meeting their specification, even ifthe specification was out o f date or
superceded. Other delays were caused when main civil works contractors sub-let construction
to incapable subcontractors, particularly for foundation works inthe Delta area. The quality
o f work was furtherjeopardized by fixed-cost "ceiling-type" contracts that allowed no
variations, and it was only in 1993 that unitrate and bill o f quantity-type contacts were
approved.

19.      The amount spent on pumpingstation rehabilitation, US$39.7 million, was almost 40
percent more than planned. The total number o f pumpingstations inthe firm plan was
reduced from 26 to I 8 at mid-termreview due to start-up delays that caused alternative
donor-financing to be used for some stations needingurgent rehabilitation. Additionally, in
some cases full rehabilitation was found to be too costly and spare parts were provided
instead. As the rolling two-year plans were developed it was found that urgent rehabilitation



7. A survey in June 1999by EPADP showed 70 percent o f farmers were dissatisfied by the compensation
system and payment delays rangedfrom 2 to 5 years. An additional problem was that the Ministerial Decree
(402/96) governing payments did not cover all crops.
8. For example, inNovember 1991, MED respondedto the Bank that they could not use FIDIC conditions as
these contradicted Law 9 ofYear 1983, and they suggested hybrid documentation satisfying both or waiting
three years until law 9 was modified to accordwith FIDIC. Inthe event, the Bank allowed the first option.

                                                   8


needs far exceeded the project budget.So much so, it swallowedthe sum allocated for the 14
mobile workshops. To meet this shortfall, only 7 mobile workshops were procured under the
NDP, from the US$37.8 million that was transferred to MED.' And the technical assistance
to designthe mobile workshops was provided independently by DFID.

20.       In1992MED,independentlyofthe project, startedto reorganize to increase the
number of General Directorates from 11to 16and regional centers from 2 to 4, the objective
beingto create smaller unitswith better-definedresponsibilities and smaller geographic
coverage -but there were some adverse effects on the project (para. 40).


3.        Results

NationalDrainage Project

Objective1:Improve the capacity of EPADP to implementdrainage

21.       This objective was fully achieved. Substantial institutional development enabled
EPADP to introduce technical innovations, improve capital cost recovery and successfully
implementnewandrehabilitatedsubsurface drainage and remodel existing open surface
drainage.

22.       Institutional Development. EPADP effectively utilized substantial technical
assistance and training providedby the Netherlands and KfW and supporting transport,
office, and survey equipment financed through the Bank and KfW.Netherlands technical
assistance provided training and built capacity insix areas: (i)       training indrainage
techniques; (ii)  human resources development; (iii) planning and follow-up department;
                                                          the
(iv) the field investigation andresearch department; (v)management information systems;
and(vi) support for a newmechanicaldepartment which was established duringthe project."
KfW supportedthe establishment o famonitoring andevaluationsystemthat was usedby
EPADP to prioritize management decisions on maintenance and rehabilitation o f drainage. It
also providedproof o fthe efficacy o fthe drainage program through "before and after
comparisons" of agricultural productivity and groundwater levels.

23.       The training centers established underthe project benefitednot only government staff
but also private sector contractors. The Tanta Drainage Training Center provides training to
about 500 participants per year about a third o fwhom are from outside EPADP. To June
2002, about 7,400 trainees hadgraduated from DTC whose courses have expanded from
relatively straightforwardtechnical content inthe mid-1990sto include higher-levelseminars
and tailor-made courses. Private contractors' staff are trained at Tanta on equipment

9. It was intendedthat the additionalfunds would provide MED with 4 completelynew pumpingstations, spare
parts for 3 pumpingstations, 23 emergency pumps,25 electrical generators, 10mobileworkshops, and 2
telescopic cranes.

The vertical drainage component of the
project was droppedbecause of adverse               Source: EPADP 2003

researchfindings. However, research
continues on innovations to install drains inunstable soils and piloting of a trenchless
installation of sub-surface drains continues over 4,000 feddans of the Hares Pumping Station
command area inthe Deltaregion.

25.      Environmental issues were dropped from the project as it would have duplicated
existingactivities. This small component was somewhat of an orphan inthe NDP because
EPADP had no line-management responsibility for improving environmental quality, which
i s sharedamong three ministries to achieve very similar objectives assisted by USAID, the
African Development Bank, the Netherlands, andthe Bank's National Schistomiasis Project.

26.      Cost-Recovery. Capital cost recovery from farmers improvedsubstantially during the
project and exceededtarget levels. It rose from 60 percent oftarget in 1991 and achieved 100
percentby 1996, thereafter ithas averaged 108 percent (as the earlier shortfall was collected).
Therewas no progresson agreeingservice charges for operation andmaintenancealthough
this is being actively discussed withinthe MWRI.

27.      Drainage. The target area for new subsurface drainage was fully achieved, and that
for rehabilitated areas and surface drainage remodeling was exceeded.I2As a result, water
tables were controlled and lowered over an area of about 740,000 feddans. The impact of
these improvements was monitored by EPADP's new M&E unit in 15 monitoring zones of
1,000 feddans each (Figure 1). Crop production inthese areas, independently monitored by
the Ministry of Agriculture and LandReclamation, show significant improvements invalue
and annual farm incomes increasedby EP 300-600 per feddan(Figure 2).



11. This included 106junior technical staff, 20 middle management, and 18 senior managers.
12. New subsurface drainage served 590,500 feddans and rehabilitated subsurface drainage served 151,650
feddans. 1,344 kilometers of surface drains serving 510,000 feddans were rehabilitated as were 672 bridges, 19
siphons, and 202 aqueducts. Many other minor structures were also rehabilitated.

Second PumpingStationsRehabilitationProject

Objective1:Avoid loss of agriculturalproductivity

28.       Physical achievementswere impressive.By project completion, 70 pumpingstations
serving 1.7 millionfeddans, or about a thirdofEgypt's cultivated area, hadbeeneither rebuiltor
rehabilitated. The firm programcovered 0.3 million feddans -about halfthe appraisal target-
o fwhich90 percent was for drainage. The rolling two-year program eventually covered anarea
four times larger thanplanned, some 1.1 millionfeddans, while 24 pumpingstations supplied
withspare partscoveredanother0.6 millionfeddans.

29.       H o w far the rehabilitationworks avoided loss o f agricultural production i s unclear. At
appraisal it was assumed the pumpingsystemswould gradually deteriorate inthe absence of
the project, and that agricultural productivity would steadily decline by 5 percent between
1991 and 2006, the assumedlifetime ofthe benefit stream. Identification of agricultural
benefits i s conjectural because the project did not include a component to monitor and
evaluate agricultural prod~ction.'~       Thus it is impossible to make WitWwithout comparisons
and determine agricultural benefits.I4

14. The economic analysis for the follow-on Third Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project (approvedJuly
1998) notes "it should be notedthat there are limitations in drawing precise conclusions on the relationship
betweenwater table levels, irrigationdeliveries, drainage performanceand yields. It is therefore difficult to
come up with any precisecalculation ofthe effects on agricultural production of the declining performanceof
pumping stations." (page 48, para4(i).)
15. All large pumping stations are designed with standby capacity, thus the failure of one pump would not be
critical ifthere is an adequate program for systematic maintenance.

ofmotors and pumps andreducedthe level andcost o fmaintenance requiredresultingin
immediatecost savingsofabout US$2millionayear.I6Newpumphousesmayhave reducedthe
maintenance demands intheory, butinpractice, as the new construction was primarilyto redress
deferredmaintenance,there is noreduction inmaintenance costs. Additional staff housing and
offices providedbythe project is an addedoperationandmaintenance liability o f about
US$160,000 a year that would bepartlyoffset by lowered O&M costs onnewreplacement
buildings.

31.       Adequate maintenanceis a problem.Beyondthe short-term, however, net cost
savings will disappear ifadequate adjustment and maintenance o fmotors and pumps i s not
routinely ~ndertaken.'~    Major losses o fpumpefficiency occur if,for example, the pump
impellerclearance is not correctly adjusted for seasonalfluctuations inwater temperature;
vibration causes wear on the drive shaft; impellersrub on the pump bowl; debris i s sucked into
the pumpcausing wear or abrasion; andwater pollutioncauses damage and corrosion.
Similarly, power surges or voltage reductionmay cause motors to burnout, or pumps to
operate at inefficient speeds. Thus, regular preventivemaintenance can only occur ifpumps
and motors are equippedwith a full range o f monitoring and protection equipment, appropriate
tools and maintenance manuals, stocks o fthe right spare parts andtrained personnel.

32.       The Bank's biannualsupervision reports and observations duringthe assessment
missiondidnot provide assurancethat adequate maintenance occurred or that it i s sustainable.
A lack o f standardization andoutdated specifications (para.17) make acquisition ofspare parts
andmaintenance difficult. The age and diverse origins ofequipmentinstalled-rangingfrom
Soviet-era plant from the USSRandHungary to modernplant from Switzerland, the United
States, and Japan-places a tremendous demandon inventory control, specialized tools,
knowledge, and staff capability. As noted by the supervision team andverified by OED,
inventorycontrol is poor: requests andordersfor spareparts were changedwhenthey are
found to exist elsewhere. To add to these problems, maintenance manuals inArabic are
generally not suppliedby manufacturers or made available to staff manningthe pumping
stations -although about 130 staff benefited from one-offtrainingsupplied duringinstallation
o fnew equipmentby manufacturers and some were trained overseas.

33.       Inaddition, MEDstaffhaddifficulties inestablishing a flow o fmanagement
information from the Regional Electricity Authorities and were unable to effectively plan
power settings andpower-out schedules. The difficulty dfworking with the REA caused
MEDto install 2 megawatt generators to solve theproblem. AndwithinMEDthe

1997at 43 percentoverallenergy efficiency comparedwith 62 percentefficiencywith the project.Similarly, in
the same period, irrigationpumpswould improve from44 percentwithoutto 62 percent with the project.
Overall, basedon these data, the ICRestimatedenergy savings stemming fromthe projectwould increasefrom
US$0.9million a year in 1999to US$I.3 milliona year in2006. Savedmaintenancecosts were estimatedat 5

States this reducedroutine service costs over four years from US$4 millionto US$1.4million. (Ref: http://em-

supervisionteam noted that the difficulties encountered were entirely due to lack o f
recording and control practices associated with electrical works. OED's assessment mission
noted that most recording equipmentwas either missing, damaged or inoperable except inthe
largest pumpingstations.

34.      Standardequipmentfor monitoringequipment utilizationand conditionis missing

large numbero finspections conductedbythe newDirectorate o fTechnical Inspection,Bank
supervisors noted the number o finspections would have been muchreduced ifthe DTIhadhad
the equipmentandinstrumentsto undertakemeasurementsofequipmentperformance. Overhauls
and maintenance, except for the major stations, are conducted bythe regional workshops. These
were found inadequate duringappraisal ofthePSR2 andmobileworkshops were foundto bethe
solution. However, only seven, or halfthe numbero fmobile units required,andonly four o fthe
six central electrical laboratories were providedbythe project; thus maintenance is still hampered
by inadequate facilities. MEDstaffalso informedthe assessmentmissionthat most maintenance
was generally inreaction to a problem-not as a result o fcarefblly plannedprograms of
preventivemaintenance.

35.     Water qualityand debris incanals remainmajor problems.BothMEDandEPADP
staff identifiedthese as the largest unresolved issues affecting maintenance o fpumpingstations,
issues that are beyondtheir mandate to control. Considerable damage to pumps occurs from
ingesteddebris andpoor water quality causes corrosion. This putsapremium onmaintaining
trash rackshcreens andproviding adequatecleaning (as most automatic screencleaning
equipmentis defective), amajortask that MEDmanageswell. Inthe lower Delta, water quality

Objective 3: Strengthen the institutional capability of the MED

36.     Institutionalstrengtheningand trainingeffortswere modestwith negligible
improvementsin capability.They werejeopardized by inadequate MED attention and
funding-only 3 percent (US$0.06 milliono fthe US$l.7 million) planned at appraisal was
utilized by the project. New Directorates o f Technical Inspection(DTI) and o f Civil Works
(DCW) were created but they were never elevated to General Directorates as covenanted with

19. There are 19,000 km o f open drains inthe Nile Delta and Valley. Pollution prevention is coveredby Law 48
of 1982 and monitoring is done by EPADP and the DRI who report violations to the EgyptianEnvironmental
Affairs Agency. While the number of annualviolations has remained fairly constant (1500-2000), the number
remediedhas declined from an average of 52 percent over the period 1993-99, to about athird inthe period
2000-02.The main constraints include lack of information on polluters and the needto involve the police.

inadequate transport. The D C W provided a central in-house unit for activities that hadbeen
formerly farmed out to other line agencies o fMPWIandprivatesector consultants.20

37.       The monitoringand evaluationstudy ofwater qualitywas completed.
Observations at the El Max and El Tabya pumping stations were successfully completed
through a subcontract with the Drainage Research Institute.Its findings were useful in
definingthe environmental management problems caused by industrialand urbanpollution
and they supported passing o f Environmental Law 4 for 1995, which regulatedpolluting
industries. Since the project closed MEDhas established an Environmental Directorate under
the Bank's follow-on project.

38.       The cost recoverystudy yielded no usefulresults.MEDprovided a report in 1991
that was heavily criticized by the Bank. And in 1995 MED stated that the work was being
done under the USAIDIMSproject (para. 8) and agreed that the Bank's recommended
improvements would be addressed duringthe appraisal o fthe follow-on third project. This
would focus on analysis o f O&M costs and recommendations to increase the efficiency o f
O&M. A later study would cover cost-recovery aspects as these were items under discussion
by MWRI. As the Bank's 1998 appraisal ofthe follow-on projectnotes: "During the past five
years, many workshops were heldunder the auspices o f USAIDon the recommendations o f
such detailed [O&M] studies.For socio-economic reasons, none o fthese recommendations
were [sic] feasible" and further study was recommended. In2002 this was still the case.2'

39.      MED'smanagementinformationsystem(MIS) receivedadhoc supportbutits
effectiveness did notimproveunderthe project.MEDwas supposedto addressthese issues
inthe first two years o ftheprojectbutdidnot. Inparticular, the trainedmanager ofthe
Management Information System (MIS)was transferred in 1992, and there were insufficient
computers to support the larger number o f MED offices (para. 19). As a result, the interest in
MISthroughout MEDdwindled-especially inUpperEgypt-andthe few staff allocated
to the MIS tendedto be untrained. The Bank's 1992 review o f the MIS indicated that this
could delay full system effectiveness by 4 to 5 years as the MIS was considered an added
burdenwithno visible returnfor staff efforts. To make matters worse, the US$l.1million
from cofinanciers for computers andtelecommunicationsnever materializedmainly because
USAID directeditto MWRIas MEDwas unsuccessful inmaking its case.

40.      Subsequently,MEDstatedthat itwouldredress this shortfall on MIS out o fthe
proceeds o fa thirdphase repeater project for US$212 millionto which the Bank gave a green
light in 1995. At the endo fthe project, the MISwas generally unintegrated andrequireda
parallel manual recording system-only a few offices are fully computerized. While some
telemetry hadbeeninstalled independentlyo fthe project ina trial area, it only serves
hydrologic monitoring needs. At completion o fthe PSR2 the MEDwas usingthe MIS as a tool
for data collectionrather than as an effective management tool to facilitate daily activities and


20. While DCW reduced MED's transactioncosts, it was an outdated creation given an active and capable
private sector and the Bank should not havepromoted it. Instead, it should have arguedfor rationalization of
existing resources and greater use of private sector contracts.

to improve decision-making. The MIShad some shortcomings inthat there was little
information concerning operating cost and water discharge measurement. DuringOED's 2003
mission, the team was told that there were few data on M&Ecosts, andthat they would have to
bemanually collated -nine months later it was still not available.

41,       Divestiture of booster pumps to farmers and cooperativeswas partially
successful. Inmany cases farmer-managed O&M ran into problems even though advised by
MED, andownership of some pumpshadto revertto MEDto guarantee continued operation
(para 13).



4.        Ratings

Outcomes

42.       The outcome ofthe NationalDrainage Project is ra,jd satisfactory as the project
fully achieved its relevant objectives efficiently. Incontrast, the outcome o fthe Second
Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project is rated moderately unsatisfactory because its
relevance and efficacy -the power to produce results -was rated modest, even though its
economic efficiency i s ratedmodest. The overall outcome rating i s based on the relative
importance o fproject objectives and achievement o f them. These ratings are summarized in
Table 3 and elaborated inthe following sections o fthis chapter.

Relevance

43.       The overall relevance o f projects' objectives to Egypt's priorities and the Bank's
country assistance strategy was highat appraisal and i s highat present. This i s affirmed by

                                                15


the importance givento efficient water and agricultural landmanagement inthejointly
produced land reclamation subsector reviewo f 1990 and the agricultural strategy developed
for the 1990s. These reports also highlightedthe need for development of agricultural
institutions and markets to enable the sector to reap the rewards o f its structural adjustment
process then initiated. The priorities were reaffirmed inthe Bank's 1997 CAS, in OED's
Country Assistance Evaluation o f 2000 and the latest 2001 CAS. Indeed, the 2001 CAS,
cognizant o f GOE's requirementthat all new operations should have a grant element o f 40
percent, indicates that more attention should be givento closer partnerships with other
donors, particularly for capacity-building and reform o f government institutions. Giventhat
two-thirds o f the poorest people live inrural areas, and that sound water managementi s
essential for Egypt's rural economy, both projects are important incombating poverty.

44.     Despite the accord with the government's andthe Bank's country, agricultural and
rural strategies, the overall relevance of the PSR2 i s rated as modest because it gave
inadequate attention to institutional development despite acknowledgement inthe
Memorandum to the President that a lesson o f previous projects was that priority shouldbe
given to strengthening institutional capability. The provisional arrangement with U SAID
should have beenfirmed-up at appraisal or alternative arrangements made.

Efficacy

45.     The efficacy of the NDPis rated as substantial, Institutional capacity buildingwas
given priority and enabled EPADP to redress past failings and generally exceed physical
targets. These, inturn, increased farmers' incomes and ledto increased recovery o f capital
costs. As noted at appraisal, neitherthe NDP nor PSR2 were appropriate instrumentsto bring
about reforms that would enable explicit mechanisms for payment o f irrigation service and
drainage fees. Similarly, neither project was administratively well placed to bringabout
improvements inwater quality and pollution prevention -but they didfacilitate the process
through monitoring andevaluation.

46.      The efficacy of the PSR2is rated as modest. The impact o fthe project on
agricultural productivity i s not known andthe claims made inthe Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) are conjectural. This leads to a ratingo f modest for the first
objective. The largest impact o f the project was to reduce the cost o f operating and
maintaining MED's pumpingplant inthe short termthrough new parts and equipment and
this leads to a ratingof substantial for the second objective. Attempts to strengthenthe
institutional capability o f MEDhad a marginal impact -as inall previous projects to assist
MED-andthe efficacy ofthe thirdobjective is negligible.

Efficiency

47.     The efficiency of the NDPis rated as substantial. This assessmentendorses the
ICR's estimated economic rate o f return (ERR) o f 19 percent baseduponincremental crop
production achieved. Although lower than that estimated at appraisal (24 percent) the reasons
are valid and exogenousto the project -commodity prices are now lower. Funds for

                                               16


technical assistance were highly leveraged and produced excellent results, thus indicating
highlevels o f efficiency.

48.     The efficiency of the PSR2 is ratedas modest. The ICR estimated the incremental
production (or losses avoided) attributable to the project was estimated to be about US$10
million a year. Inaddition, energy savings over the same period due to rehabilitation were
estimated to be US$l.1 milliodyear and saved maintenance costs US$1.2 milliodyear.
Taken together, this benefit stream yielded an ERR o f 22 percent over 15 years (Annex B3).
This OED assessment believes that the agriculturalbenefits are conjectural giventhat there
was no M&E, and that actual benefits are probably smaller (para.29). Ifthe agricultural
benefits are omitted from the benefit stream, the ERR becomes negative (-1 percent) over 15
years. It i s probable therefore that the actual ERR lies between-1 and +22%, where i s
unclear.

49.     Simply claiming 5 percent of lost production is notmethodologically convincing
since to assess incremental returns one should be looking at the next bestwithout project
alternative, which i s not likely to be simply sitting back and allowing a 5% production
decline. The opportunity cost o f an investment i s the forgone returns inthe next best
alternative. Inthis case, the next best alternative use o f resources inthis sub-sector probably
had a better ERR than the project through improving the efficiency o f the institution itself.
However, here there may be a questionabout scale. An institutional efficiency improvement
project alternative may have beena smaller project and it i s difficult to compare different
sized projects. ERRScannot rank different sized projects. The most likely best alternative
would have probably beena combined institutional reform project aimed at measures to
increase O&M efficiency with a smaller and more self-sustaining traditional pumping
stations investment project. For these reasons, this assessment rates efficiency as modest.


InstitutionalDevelopment

50.     The overallinstitutionaldevelopmentimpactof the NDP is rated as substantial.
The project efficiently utilized technical assistance to bringabout innovation, capacity
building,and higher levels o forganizational efficiency. Senior management was proactive in
reforming the way inwhich EPADP worked not only with its staff but also with its private
sector contractors. On these factors, institutional development i s ratedhigh. While the PVC
pipe factories worked efficiently, they were anachronistic becausethe Bank's financing
fostered continued public sector capture o f activities that should have beendivestedto the
private sector. Not surprisingly, EPADP's attempts to divest ownership o f these factories i s
proving difficult primarily because they are located inrural areas -thus, purchasers are
willing to buy the pipe-forming equipment and remove those to larger urban facilities which
show greater efficiencies and economies o f scale. There remain problems with coordination
among the various directorates and line agencies of the MWRIthat the project was unable to
resolve. As MWRIincreasingly faces a shortfall o f funds for O&M, it i s only now after the
project considering reorganization o f its over 8000 staff to cut costs, increase
communications, and enhance productivity.

51.     Institutionaldevelopmentof the PSR2is ratedas negligible.Inpart this was
becauseonly $60,000 o fthe $1.6 millionplannedwas utilized. MEDdid not reform its way o f

                                                  17


working and paid insufficient attention to upgrading its management informationsystems to
enable itto function more efficiently. As with the earlier project, attention to key institutional
reforms and capacity buildingwas low, and have beenrolled over to the follow-on project.
Five years into the thirdproject (2003), MEDhas still not finalized its MISsystems andhas
considerable problems with puttingtogether biddingpackages. Thus the latest supervision
missionrates institutional development and procurement components as unsatisfactory.
Seventy percent o fthis follow-on project has elapsedand only 28 percent o fthe loanamount
has been disbursed.Itappears that little has changed since the mid-1980s andthat systemic
institutional problems remain unresolved.


Sustainability

52.      Sustainability of the NDP is rated likely. Farmers are paying the capital costs o f the
drainage installed and EPADP continues to provide drainage maintenance services
efficiently. At present there i s no sign that the government wishes to relinquishthis role. The
training institutes created and the M&Eunits are working efficiently and productively and
are adequately funded. Considerable donor support for EPADP continues and thus it i s likely
that these activities will continue to be supported and receive external financing as needed.

53.      Sustainability of the PSR2 is unlikely. The evidence shows a culture that has a
triage mentality, only repairing that which i s broken or just about to break down. There i s
poor planning and lack o f a systematic approach to O&M. Facilities are only functioning
now because they are new or have been repairedand inadequate attention to O&M i s hidden
by lavishand unconditional subsidies. Ifexternal and internal fundingbecomes more
strongly regulated and conditioned on systemic institutional reform, the chance o f improving
sustainability through greater institutional efficiency would increase.


Bank Performance

54.     Bank performance on NDP is rated as satisfactory. The Bank paid attention to
institutional reform and partneredwith the Netherlands and Germany to ensure that this was
implemented.Supervision was satisfactory and quickly resolved most problems that arose.
Relationships with the development partners were good although the Bank should have been
more proactive on sector-wide issues, as its strategic focus o f the early 1990s faded as the
project was implemented. Possibly too much reliance was placed on USAID'Sresources and
USAID's willingness to take a sectoral view.

55.     Bank performance on PSR2 is rated as unsatisfactory. The Bank took the easy
option and did not give enough importance to institutional development. It was clear that this
was identifiedas a major problem duringproject design, but the remedy agreed was totally
inadequate. A root problem was that GOE would not use expensive Bank funds for capacity
buildingandinstitutional development. USAID was to have fundedinstitutional
development, but the Bank had no control on this input.Ideally, the Bank should have
leveraged its investmentfor capital equipment on the results o f institutional reform, but it did
not do so.'Eventhen, appraisal documents indicate that there only appeared to be a
"gentlemen's agreement" on the use o f USAIDfunds, not a firm commitment, and inthe

                                              18


event, these potential institutional development funds were usedelsewhere by U SAID. Inthe
circumstances, the Bank would have beenwiser not to give additional lendinguntilreforms
had beenimplemented.

Borrower Performance

56.      Borrower performance on NDP is rated satisfactory. EPADP efficiently carried out
the project and effectively coordinated the inputso fthe donors. Itwas receptive to reforms
introduced duringthe project, which improved its institutional capacity and i s now muchbetter
served to manage Egypt's drainage. Government provided timely and adequate counterpart
fundingand was fully supportive ofthe project's objectives and facilitateddonor coordination.

57.      Borrower performance on PSFUis rated unsatisfactory.MED acts as an
autonomous body and i s immuneto reform. It appears to resist external attempts to try to
make it more accountable, as the attempts to establish integrated and effective management
information systems have failed to date. MED's organizational behavior i s incomplete
contrast to the relative efficiency o f EPADP. This i s clearly a problem for the MWRIto
address.



5.       Findings, Conclusions and Lessons

Findings

58.      The outcomes o fthe two projects are inmarkedcontrast and emphasize the key role
institutional development plays inproject outcomes. The National Drainage Project has had a
tremendous impact on agricultural productivity and farmers' incomes inthe Nile Delta. The
concerned directorate and its agencies are fairly dynamic, catalyzed by the reforming zeal o f
Ministerof Water Resources andIrrigationwho is tryingto bringabout the integrationofthe
irrigation and drainage subsectors. This inturn, has ledto the establishment o f a number o f
small units inthe M o W I charged with investigatinghow to bringabout institutional reform and
streamlining-not an easy task where 88,000 staff andmany vested interests are involved.

59.      Incontrast, the pumpingstationrehabilitationproject is atypical example ofeasily
targeted money sunk into deferred maintenance with almost no attention beingfocused on
systemic institutional issues. Except at the top, malaise and overstaffing are endemic, and in
UpperEgyptplannedcoordinationwiththe irrigationdirectorate is very weak.

60.      While there has been notable progress on recovering irrigation infrastructure capital
investment costs from farmers, this does not occur for mechanical and electrical works.
Above the turn-out level, operation and maintenance costs for irrigation and drainage are
fully subsidized by government whose paternalistic concernprecludes charging farmers. In
consequence, the extensive debate on water charging has made negligible progress as both
government and farmers are satisfied with the status quo.

                                                 19


61.     Butthe large water sector expenditures-for example the $3-5 billion for the Toska
project -i s crowding out essential government investmentinexisting irrigation and
drainage infrastructure, and divertingattention from reform efforts, particularly for the
electrical and mechanical subsector. Inconsequence, the time i s soon coming when
government will have to face up to the fact it cannot expand irrigation and continue its high
levels o f subsidy for O&M.

62.     Since PSR2 was completed, the Ministry o f Water Resources and Irrigation has
established an Institutional Reform Unit.The unit i s charged with strategic coordination and
detailing o f the Ministry's 2001 "Vision o f Institutional Reform" before initiating and
implementingdecentralization and privatization o fwater management and O&M activities.
While there has beennotable progress toward integration o fthe management o f irrigation
and drainage (supported by the Bank and bilateral donors), little attention has been given to
addressing reform o f MED.Expanding the coverage o f drainage improvement and focusing
on institutional development (instead o f investment)o fthe mechanical and electrical
department are priorities inthe near term.

63.     Continued support to the MWRIfor institutional reform and integrating irrigation and
drainage operations i s important giventhe opportunity o f a strong champion for change.
Recovery o f O&M costs, while needing extensive sector policy dialogue, i s unlikely to be
successful without a broader challenge to government's role as welfare provider.

64.     There are several alternative and cheaper sources of non-Bank finance and assistance
to support Egypt's agricultural development programs. IfBank money i s used, it should be
usedwhere the Bank has a comparative advantage -identifying reform and building
financing packages to effect these reforms. Whenthe Bank fails to do this, its lending i s
ineffective.

        The project experience offers two lessons:

    0   Disbursement and physical achievements are not always good indicators o f project
        success. Failure to address systemic institutional problems may adversely affect
        operational efficiency and sustainability o f project works, and make lending
        ineffective. This not only hampers the Bank's reform agenda, but it also causes
        concern among the Bank's development partners who see the Bank as the only
        interlocutor with any leverage with the GOE to introduce institutional and policy
        reforms.

    0   In-country Bank partnership with bilateral development agencies i s a powerful
        instrumentfor institutional reform. Typically, bilateral agencies develop long-term
        institution-building relationships with government inspecific sectors, which may
        significantly increase the utility, relevance, and leverage o f Bank assistance. InEgypt,
        bilaterals bringdifferingperspectives to the water and agriculture subsector and are
       notably strong at capacity buildingindrainage and community development.

5. Sensitivity analysis for ERR b/
a. In line with the economic analysis in the SAR, this table covers only the firm program. Because of other
sources of financing, several stations of the firm program have been removed and, hence, the command area
and number of stations in the ICR estimate is smaller than the SAR estimate. The total achievements of the
rehabilitation program, i.e. the indicative and firm program, however, far exceed those of the SAR report (see
Annex C for details.
b. The period covered by the economic analysis has been extended in a sensitivity analysis to reflect the true
economic life of pumping stations of 30 years with reinvestment in cost of pumps conservatively taken every 15
years, with area covered reflecting actual achieved area benefiting (1.47 million ha) and does not include the
addition benefits from work done on further number of stations by supplying urgently required spare parts
benefiting a further 500,000fed.

Dear Mr. Barbu,

Thank you very muchfor the Project PerformanceAssessment Report.whichwas sent to us
with your letter dated January 13,2004, and the opportunityto comment.After our review, we
havethe following comments.



General comments

We vecy muchagree with the PPAR summary of findingswhich are given in paragraphs 58to 64.
The comparison of the two projects clearly shows the importance of combining investments
with institutionalimprovements.This needs particular attentionin project design to set realistic
targets for the institutionalimprovementsand to carefully design the consultant support which
is needed for this, Furthermore, it needs a cinccrc commitment to change on the sido of tho
implementing institution. NDP 1 / EPADP show how this was achieved and that it has yielded
good results, whereas PSR2 /MED show the negativeeffect if this is not included.

Inthis contextwe also agree with the PPAR recommendation"IfWorld Bank moneyis used,it
should be used where the World Bank has a comparative advantage identifying reform and
buildingfinancing packages to effect these reforms."

                                              38                                    Annex C




Coiicet-niny the process of the PPAR we appreclate the OED effort to discuss the findings,
information and views already at an early stage of the audit with the co-financiers. We would
welcomethis intensiveand early dialogue also in any future OED assessments on World Bank
 KWV co-financedprojects.

We very much appreciatethe comprehensive and also critical review which OED has under-
taken.


National Drainage Project (NDP)

For NDP, as objective is listed Improvethe capacity of EPADP to implement drainage in ar-
eas where water logging and salinity  ...".Inour  view ltiis wvuld be an appropriateobjectlve for
a capacity building project but was not the main objectivefor an investment project. The main
objective for NDP 1was to reduce groundwater levels for 720.000feddanthrough drainageto
avoid water logging and salinisation. This objective has been achieved. We agree with the
PPPAR assessment that also the second objective conceming improving EPADP's capacity
has beenachieved.

This is our only comment on the NDP 1 assessment. In all other aspects we find the assess-
mentwell done and also agree with the findings.


SecondPumpingStations Rehabilitation Project

Ratingof Objectives:

Objective 1: Avoid loss of agricultural productivity

The rating "ModeratelyUnsatisfactory"is mainly based on the argument that thc magnitudc of
avoided loss is unknown as the project did not include a component to monitor and evaluate
agricultural production, while at appraisal it was assumed that agricultural productionwould
steadily decline by 5 % between 1991 and 2006. Furthermore it is statedthat it is certain that
only part of the total area covered would have been at risk from complete pumping station
failure.

These rather general assumptionsdo in our view not sufficiently considerthe selection criteria
appliedfor the pump stations to be included inthe program,Le. running hours above 100.000,
age of more than 20 years, insufficientcapacity, change of demand pattern, severe technical

or rehabilitation, Mere there was a stated additional demand or a high risk of failure existing.
problemselc., This means that only slaliurw weie included lor new wrisliudiuri, replaement

Therefore. we would not intotalfollowyour generally pessimisticview.

Objective2: Reducethe cost of operating and maintaining plant

We are in line with your rating "satisfactory, but referring again to the selection criteria we
would not follow your statement, that in practice, as the new constructions were primarily to
redress deferredmaintenance, no reduction in maintenance costs was achieved. Givenespe-
cially the lifetime and demand criteriathis statementdoes not hold true in its generality. How-
ever, we fully agree with you that inthe absence of an adequate monitoring system 08M can-
not be conducted in a technically and financially sound manner, reducing the possible effects
achievahle cansiderably.

Objective3: Strengthenthe institutionallycapacity of the MED

While from own experience we can only fully underline your assessment, we wish to draw
your attention to the consequencesto be drawn for the ongoing projects,which obviously suf-
fer from issues not addressed earlier, as a missionfor the preparationof a Training Program
to befinanced by KMIhas revealedthe followingstartlingfacts:

       Acute manpowerconstraintsin MED'sCentral ProjectsDirectorateand excessivework
       load on the existing work force makes it impossiblefor MED to cope with the current
       and forthcoming donor funded rehabilitationprojects.

    L  The assignment of further professional staff to the tasks of project planning and man-
       agement is a crucial prerequisiteto the creation of a manpower base sufficient to ab-
       sorb future work loads along with training programs to improve staff qualification and
       operational procedures.


As a prerequisite prior to the start of any Training Program the following preconditions are
mappedout by the experts:

    0  Creation of the task force as earlier requested by Worldbank (WB), but never estab-
       lishedwith a sufficiently broadbase.

    0  Setting of realistic work targets in relationto the pumping station projectsfor rehabilita-
       tion and new constructionfor the next five years.

    I  Determination of the manpower capacity in the Central Projects Dlrectorate quantity
       andqualitywise inorderto copewith the work program.

       Reactivation of the TrainingDepartment,which has practicallybecome non-existent.

The aforementionedtindings and proposalsmay lead one to draw the following conclusions:

       A6 the build-up of a work forcc sufficient in numbers end properlytrained to cope with
       all the projectswill take considerabletime, the donors are advisedto insist on full time
       consultancy support for their projects. The massive delays in implementation as ex-
       perienced by all donors leave little doubt, that there is an urgent needfor this. An ear-
       lier World Bank statement back in 1998, that "a full time consulting firm imposed on
       them may be counterproductive and may create unnecessary friction with the Imple-
       mentingAgency"shallhave been overruled by events in the meantime.

       As the task force newly to be establishedwill have to serve all donors, size and work
       plan shall agreed upon between the donors and MED, in order to avoid any kind of
       competitionfor Ilmltedresources.

       The Training Programs under preparation may also be harmonisedto the extent pos-
       sible.

       Giventhe existingweaknesses of MED to prepareand implement investment projects
       the tender proceduresneedto be modifiedin order to enablethe tendering of pumping
       stations (rehabilitation and now construction) on a turnkey basis, thus reducing sub
       stantially the work loadon MEDfor planningand coordination.
