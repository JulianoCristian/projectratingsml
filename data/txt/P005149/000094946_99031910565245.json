The key lessons learned are: a) A flexible\n            program approach has been keen to guaranteeing project\n            success, as it allowed the Bank and the implementing agency\n            to respond adequately to changes in rehabilitation\n            priorities during project implementation. b) The appraisal\n            team did not take into account the slow system in Egypt of\n            awarding contracts for procurement of goods and the slow\n            pace of civil work construction for pumping stations. c)\n            Monitoring and evaluation capacity needs to be enhanced at\n            Mechanical and Electrical Department (MED) to enable the\n            tracking of project costs, benefits, and impacts. d)\n            Although not part of the project, it was realized that an\n            environment unit is needed at MED to monitor water and other\n            related environment quality and alert authorities about\n            problems for corrective action. e) In the case of new\n            stations, close coordination by MED of the\n            electro-mechanical equipment contracts and related civil\n            work contracts is key to reducing implementation delays. f)\n            There are considerable benefits to having repeater projects\n            with the same implementation agency. This allows the\n            building of a core professional team at MED that is familiar\n            with World Bank requirements for project implementation, and\n            that can save effort and time because it is well established\n            and operational."}, "docdt": "1999-02-08T00:00:00Z"}
