                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Project extension
                         The possibility of a further project extension was discussed at the CEP Steering Committee meeting held on Thursday 20 January. There was unanimous agreement that a further
                         extension would not be beneficial.
                         The need for establishing a four month disbursement grace period for payments of activities completed prior to the project's closing date was discussed and has now been
                         established
