In 1995, the government sold\n            the mines to private investors. Although privatization\n            brought many benefits to the economy, the new mine owners\n            did not want to take care of the environmental liabilities\n            left over by previous mines\u2019 owners. In 2003, fifty thousand\n            residents of Kabwe\u2019s population were affected by high lead\n            levels in the soil, due to naturally occurring\n            mineralization as well as the impact of the smelting and\n            mining operations. Although mining has been the single\n            greatest contributor to economic growth in Zambia, it has\n            also had significant adverse effects on the environment. Its\n            effect on the environment had been largely ignored, thus\n            leaving a trail of uranium, lead and other base metals whose\n            by-products were not properly disposed of and administered.\n            CEP determined and controlled lead blood levels in affected\n            areas. It also helped to strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of delegated authorizing agencies to improve future\n            compliance of the mining sector with environmental and\n            social regulations. The International Development\n            Association (IDA) financed environmental project helped to\n            clean up lead and uranium tailings from mines in Zambia and\n            enabled the residents of Kabwe live in safety."}, "docdt": "2012-04-13T08:09:02Z"}
