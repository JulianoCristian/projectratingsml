"Ratings for the Copperbelt Environment\n            Project for Zambia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: It was appropriate for the Bank to\n            focus on providing financing for the remediation of\n            large-scale mining-related environmental liabilities and\n            obligations under the first Project. In light of the\n            profitability of the mining industry, though, Bank financing\n            in the case of a second Project should play more of a\n            leveraging role, i.e. mobilize substantial financial\n            contributions from the Government, ZCCM-IH (Zambia\n            Consolidated Copper Mines Limited- Investments Holdings\n            Plc), and mining companies. Under the first Project, mining\n            communities in the Copperbelt Province and Kabwe did not\n            adequately benefit from the thriving mining sector. To this\n            day, they continue to struggle with adverse mining-related\n            environmental and public health impacts, poor access to\n            basic social infrastructure services, and poverty. Mining\n            companies should contribute to a fund that would enable\n            communities living adjacent to mines and mineral processing\n            plants to be proactively involved in the design and\n            implementation of small-scale community-level investments\n            that would improve local living and environmental conditions\n            and livelihoods. Explicit emphasis should also be placed on\n            addressing gender issues. More emphasis should be placed on\n            fostering social accountability: (i) 'supply side'\n            governance through more access to information, in particular\n            data on environmental compliance and revenues of mining\n            companies; and (ii) 'demand side' governance by\n            which civil society plays an active role in pollution\n            monitoring and holding the Government accountable for\n            enforcing environmental laws and regulations and holding\n            mining companies to environmental standards."}, "docdt": "2011-10-22T00:00:00Z"}
