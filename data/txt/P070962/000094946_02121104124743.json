Project will\n            address the environmental liabilities associated with the\n            mining sector, following the privatization of the mining\n            assets. However, in order to fully attain its objectives, of\n            protecting the public health, and safety of local\n            communities, prevent or reduce environmental degradation,\n            and allow a productive re-use of the land, either to its\n            pre-mining use, or an acceptable alternative as applicable,\n            land acquisition, and therefore relocation, will occur. This\n            Resettlement Action Plan sets the principles for social\n            impact mitigation, as regards compensation for loss of\n            property, livelihood, and resettlement related issues.\n            Compensation for loss of, and access to land will be in the\n            form of land for land compensation, at replacement costs to\n            project affected peoples (PAPs). Economically marginalized\n            PAPs, with reduced access to land, will be provided with\n            land in order to enhance their living conditions. Housing\n            will be provided, improved, or at least restored, with\n            appropriate access to sources of water. Property assets,\n            crops, and tree losses will be paid at market value\n            determined by, and agreed with Government Valuation.\n            Monitoring criteria, and grievance mechanisms will ensure an\n            appropriate resettlement process, and resolve potential\n            conflicts should they occur."}, "docdt": "2002-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
