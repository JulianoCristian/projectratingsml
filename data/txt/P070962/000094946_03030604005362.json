Project in\n            Zambia, will address environmental liabilities, associated\n            with the mining sector, following the privatization of the\n            mining assets, and, will improve future compliance of the\n            mining sector with environmental, and social regulations.\n            Through the environmental management facility (EMF)\n            component, environmental and social problems resulting from\n            the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd. (ZCCM) operations\n            prior to privatization (including the Government's\n            permanent obligations), will be addressed in accordance to\n            the country's environmental laws and regulations. A\n            consolidated environmental management plan (CEMP) will be\n            prepared, to identify priority financing, and provide the\n            criteria for funding subprojects. Moreover, this CEMP will\n            form the basis for managing environmental issues related to\n            the Copperbelt, and Kabwe over a 25 year period, within the\n            broader context of environmental, and social sustainability.\n            The second component, will strengthen the environmental\n            regulatory framework, by providing assistance to the\n            Government, to ensure that historical, and future\n            environmental liabilities arising from mining activities,\n            are handled in compliance with national environmental, and\n            social safeguards. To this end, capacity building will be\n            supported, namely at the Environmental Council of Zambia,\n            and authorizing agencies, so as to review environmental\n            impacts assessments, negotiate management activities with\n            investors, issue pollution permits, monitor compliance, and\n            collect fees and fines. This component will also provide\n            assistance to strengthen nongovernmental organizations, and\n            training institutions, to increase national capacity in\n            addressing environmental issues related to the mining sector."}, "docdt": "2003-02-14T00:00:00Z"}
