The primary environmental health issue in the\n            Copperbelt mining sector is exposure to sulfur dioxide and\n            particulate emissions in Mufulira, Kitwe, and Chambishi.\n            Copper is found in excessive quantities downstream from mine\n            sites. In Kabwe lead contamination in soil presents an\n            immediate health concern. This EA provides the following\n            recommendations: a) Clear definitions of responsibilities\n            need to be set among the different institutions involved. b)\n            ZCCM-IH (an investment holding company), private sector mine\n            operators, and regulatory authorities will need to form a\n            consensus regarding priority environmental issues to be\n            addressed by their respective site-specific environmental\n            management plans. c) Expenditures of the Environmental\n            Mitigation Fund (EMF) should be focused towards priority\n            impacts as identified in this EA. d) The various\n            institutions involved have basic mandates and technical\n            competency, but require an organizational focus and training\n            to enable them to adequately discharge their functions. e)\n            The EMF will be required to establish procedures for\n            screening, implementing EA, preparing resettlement action\n            plans, and consulting with affected publics and NGOs and\n            disclosing safeguard documents."}, "docdt": "2002-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
