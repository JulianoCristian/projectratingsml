The first component - Participatory Development and\n            Natural Resources Management, will support MAFF's main\n            assistance program to upland and coastal communities, by\n            promoting improved self-reliance, and natural resources\n            management to strengthen communities' resilience, and\n            make them less vulnerable to external shocks (such as\n            periodic droughts and chronic food insecurity). Component 2\n            - Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management, will support\n            MAFF's main assistance program to farmers in lowland\n            irrigated areas, targeting about 4,000 rural families in all\n            13 districts, of which some 20 percent of members of Water\n            User Associations (WUAs) are expected to be women. The third\n            component - Services to Farmers, will help institutionalize\n            three basic MAFF services to farmers: Information, Animal\n            Health, and Agribusiness support. Finally, component 4 -\n            Program Management, will help MAFF in project management,\n            continue to develop key national policies, and, strengthen\n            the Ministry's managerial and technical capacity."}, "docdt": "2004-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
