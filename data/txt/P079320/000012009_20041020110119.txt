 A. Strategic Context and Rationale
 1. Country and Sector Issues: (see Annex I)
 Timor-Leste faces the double challenge of cementingits new politicaland socio-economic structure while
 meetingthe risingexpectations of its people. Nearly40 percentof the populationremainspoor, and some
 50-70 percent o f the rural households suffer from chronic food insecurity.These problems are partially
 natural - caused by periodic droughts and floods - and partially institutional; a legacy of the
 disempowerment and dependency that prevailed during the Indonesian administration. Despite
 rehabilitationof much of the infrastructuredestroyed in 1999, employment in rural areas remains scarce
 (especially for the youth), markets are under-developed, and prices have fallen for major agriculture
 commodities such as rice and coffee. This places considerable pressure on the new Ministry of
 Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) which currently operates with a staff of 180 and an annual
 budgetofjust US$1.8million.

 MAFF's goals are closely aligned with those o f the 2002-07 National Development Plan (NDP): to
 reduce poverty in all sectors and regions, and to promote equitable and sustainable growth. In order to
 halve poverty within 25 years, Timor-Leste will need to achieve agricultural growth rates close to 6
 percent a year, promote broad-based participation in economic opportunities, and reduce population
 growth. To address these challenges and encourage further national stability, MAFF prioritized all its
 programs in 2003 according to the "Road Mapfor Implementation of NDP Programs". The Road Map
 assigned highest priority to policy development; natural resources legislation and strategies; support to
 rural communities; information services; and coordination with donors and nongovernmental
 organizations (NGOs).         The Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP 111) was designed in
 accordance with these prioritiesas well as lessons learnedfrom previous ARP implementationphases.
I 2. Rationalefor BankInvolvement: (see Annex I)
  This project is the third phase of the Agriculture Rehabilitation Program in Timor-Leste (ARP), a
  US$17.8million grant from the multi-donor Trust Fundfor East Timor (TFET) executed by MAFF and
  supervised by the InternationalDevelopment Association (IDA). ARP has been the major program of
  donor assistance to MAFF since 2000, starting with the then-Division o f Agriculture Affairs. By
  emphasizing flexibility and periodic adjustments based on lessons learned, ARP helped MAFF adjust to
1 the challenges posed by the reconstruction phase (ARP I),                 transition phase (ARP 11) and now the
  sustainabilityphaseof post-conflictrecovery (ARP 111).

  Since early 2001, donors such as AusAID, UNDPAJNOPs, FAO, Portugal, Japan, GTZ, CIDA and
  USAID initiated programs in rural development, specializing by district and/or topic, and operating
  generally within a programmatic framework discussed annually during Joint Donor Missions. Total
  donor disbursements to ruraldevelopment in FY04 are estimated at US$14million. This providedneeded
  supplementto MAFF's limitedbudget (US$1.8millioninFY04),but also stretches its capacity andraised
  the need for further donor coordination. By pooling European Commission (EC) and TFET resources
  under the ARP program umbrella, the project will further help build staff capacity, coordinate donor
  assistance, and institutionalizekey priority programs withinthe Ministry.


  3. HigherLevel Objectivesto Which the ProjectContributes(see Annex 3)
  Timor-Leste's agriculture goals are (a) to attain food security and improve self-suflciency; and (b) to
  generate rural employment and increase income, through farming system diversification and agro-
  industrial development. The project will contribute to these goals by strengthening MAFF's main
  programs of assistance to ruralcommunities, while deliveringessentialservices inthe areas of agriculture
  information,animalhealth, andagri-business support.Together with other donor-fundedprojects,ARP

I11will also help MAFFdevelop key agricultural and naturalresources policies neededto clarify the roles
o f the government, rural communities and civil society inthe sustainable management o f the sector.

Although no Country Assistance Strategy exists yet for Timor-Leste, the project is consistent with the
2000 Transitional Support Strategy (IDA/R2000-193), which recommended a short-term focus on social
safety nets, agricultural recovery, and local ownership at all levels. It also follows closely the conclusions
o f the 2002 Joint Donors Agriculture Mission, which recommended strengthening community-based
organizations and farmers' associations, further integrating MAFF services and policies, improving
coordination, and promoting environmentalsustainability and natural resources management.


B. Project Description Summary
1. ProjectInstrument
The project will follow a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) instrument, disbursed as a grant. This
instrument was selected because the current IDA-managed Transitional Support Program, which provides
budgetary support to the Government, contributes relatively little to the agriculture sector (MAFF
received less than 2.5 percent o f the total public expenditures - US$74 million in FY04). At the same
time, a sectoral investment instrument would have duplicated the role o f the Transitional Support
Program, and it would not have sufficiently targeted the MAFFprograms which ARP supports.

2. ProjectDevelopmentObjective and Key Indicators (see Annex 3)
The first Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP I;2000-02; US$6.8 million from TFET) focused
primarily on the rapid restoration o f agriculture assets, irrigation infrastructure and restoration o f
vaccination services.
The Second Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP 11; 2002-2004; US$8.0 million from TFET)
continued irrigation rehabilitation, but also piloted a program o f assistance to upland and coastal farmers,
and expanded services to farmers in information dissemination, animal health and farmers associations. It
also supported policy studies and capacity building for MAFF staff.

The proposed Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project aims to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and its key development partners to assist rural communities in
increasing their production and income in a sustainable way. The project was designed as ARP's
consolidation phase, with an emphasis on sustainability o f activities, impact of achievements, and quality
o f outputs. The estimated total costs are US$11.4 million equivalent, including  6,854,530 (US$6.9
million equivalent) from the EC, US$3.0 million from TFET, and US$1.5 million from the Government
o f Timor-Leste. Key project outcomes will be measured through the following major impact indicators:
      All major project activities integrated into MAFF programs and funded by the Governmentby the end
      o f the project.
      Average rice yields inrehabilitated irrigated areas increasing from 1.5 to 2.0 metric tons per hectare
      per crop by the endo fthe project (EOP). Cropping intensityin Caraulun scheme at 160% by 2008.
      70 percent o ffarmer beneficiaries satisfied with the services received.

The sustainability and integration o f project activities into MAFF will be assessed through the FY08
budget allocation. MAFF is conductinga crop yield survey which will serve as a baseline to determine the
 impact o f rehabilitated irrigation schemes. MAFF will also design a farmer servicing survey to measure
 farmers' satisfaction for services provided.

3. ProjectComponents (see Annexes 4 and 5)
The project will include four major components:
    Participatory Development and Natural ResourcesManagement (US$1.3 million)
    Irrigation Rehabilitationand Management (US$3.5 million)
o Services to Farmers (US$4.2 million)
o ProgramManagement (US$2.4 million)

The first component will be funded fully by TFET. The remaining components will be co-financed by
EC and TFET (see Annex 5, and Tables B and C, Annex 7).

Component I - Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management, will support MAFF's
main assistance program to uplandand coastalcommunities.It will promote improved self-reliance and
natural resources management to strengthen communities' resilience and make them less vulnerable to
external shocks (such as periodic droughts and chronic food insecurity),It targets an estimated 50 villages
inseven districts' - Dili, Lautem, Liquiqa, Manufahi, Covalima, Baucau, and Oecussi, or approximately
10,000 rural households        (8 percent of Timor-Leste's rural families). About 30 percent of direct
beneficiaries will be women.
The project will finance small group grants, services, training for farmer groups, MAFFstaff, facilitators,
and partner NGOs, workshops and cross visits, vehicles, office equipment, and incremental operating
costs in support o fthe following activities:
0   Continuing technical and facilitation support to 30 pilot villages initiated duringARP 11;
0   Expansionto about 20 new villages, includingprovision of grants to small groups of farmers.

Component 2 - Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management, will support MAFF's main assistance
program to farmers inlowlandirrigated areas, based on procedures developed duringARP Iand 11.The
component will target about 4,000 rural families inall 13 districts. About 20 percent of members of Water
User Associations (WUAs) are expected to be women.
The project will finance civil works, construction supervision, services, training, cross visits, farming
inputs, office equipment, vehicles, and incremental operating costs insupport o f
0   Community rehabilitationof small irrigation schemes and rural access roads;
0   Rehabilitation o f the Caraulun irrigation scheme inManufahi district;
0   Support to Water User Associations (WUAs) and capacity buildingfor MAFF staff;
    Survey and mappingof selected irrigation schemes.

Component 3 - Services to Farmers, will help institutionalize three basic MAFF services to farmers:
Information, Animal Health, and Agri-Business support.

Sub-component 3,l. Information to Farmers, will increase MAFF's capacity to provide information tc
farmers (targeting most o f the 450,000 people with radio access), and foster two-way communicationwit1
rural areas. The project will fund technical assistance, information materials and programs, equipment
small works, training and cross visits, translation services, and incrementaloperating costs in support o f
0   Information programming, including face-to-face communication and mass media;

 hb-Component 3.2. SustainableAnimal Health Services, will target the estimated 567,000 rural people
living inhouseholds which own livestock, a major determinant o frural incomes. The project will finance
technical assistance, vaccines and veterinary supplies, equipment, vaccination campaigns, vehicles,
training and cross visits, and incremental operating costs for:
0   National vaccination campaigns
0    Replacement o f cold chain equipment;
0    Training and regulatory support to a network o f private Village Livestock Workers (VLWs);
0    Capacity building for livestock staff.

Sub-component 3.3. Support to Agri-businesses, will strengthen MAFF's advisory services to rural
producer organizations, as well as help promote key niche markets targeting some 1,200-1,500 grain seed
growers (mostly rice and maize), and about 210 farming families involved in niche market commodities
(such as candlenut and coconut oil production). The project will finance technical assistance, small works,
agriculture and office equipment, farm inputs, training, and incremental operating costs for:
0    Support to seed producers;
0    Support to priority niche market commodities;
0    Strengthening o f agri-business support services inMAFF.
Component 4 -Program Management, will help MAFF to manage the project, continue to develop key
national policies, and strengthen the Ministry's managerial and technical capacity.
Sub-component 4.1, Policy and Strategy Development, will fund high-level advisors and consultative
workshops to help MAFF develop priority sectoral and institutional policies and strategies. These are
expected to include an exit strategy for the ARP program (see Annex 1).
Sub-component 4.2. Project Management and Capacity Building, will provide technical assistance,
office, computer equipment and furnishings, workshops, training, study tours, and incremental operating
costs insupport o f the following activities:
0    Priority equipment and furnishings for District, Regional, and Central Agricultural Offices;
0    Priority management and technical training for MAFFstaff; and
0    Project management support, including auditing o f project accounts.

Though the project is complex, the activities are for the most part a consolidation o f previous ARP
phases, for which there is already experience inMAFF.Continuation o f support isjustified giventhe long
lead-time neededto institutionalize programs within an emerging institution.

4. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design (see Annex I)

ARP I11is based on key lessons from ARP Iand I1and from the reconstruction period (2000-01):
o The needforflexibility andperiodic evaluations. Ina fluid, post-conflict environment, there is a need
     to adopt a phased, flexible approach to implementation, with periodic evaluations to document
     lessons o f experience and adjust the program to emerging conditions.
     A `Farmer First' approach. Since the needs o f rural households are diversified and not focused on
     any single sub-sector, service delivery must respond to their multiple needs in a timely and effective
     manner. This `farmer first' approach emphasizes inter-sectoral, demand-based assistance, and further
     strengthening o f farmers' groups and community-based organizations. As an example, rehabilitation
     o f larger irrigation schemes under ARP Iand I1proved insufficient to raise yields without parallel
     WUA and extension support to farmers.
     Balanced investments between irrigated and upland areas. While ARP Ifocused primarily on
     irrigated areas, subsequent assessments stressed the need to also assist upland areas and promote food
     security through farm system diversification and strengthened self-reliance.


Timor-LesteThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -ProjectAppraisal Document,October 7, 2004     4

    Direct grant assistance to communities. During the rehabilitation phase (2000-0l),MAFF faced
    major difficulties distributing a small number o f valuable inputs to a large number o f needy farmers.
    By contrast, community irrigation, which relied on contracts with farmers' groups, was well received
    and helped foster local ownership. The 2001 Donors' Mission recommended a shift from input
    provision to direct grant assistance to rural communities.
    Ensuring sustainability. Many donor-funded projects duringthe rehabilitation phase paid highwages
    for rural labor. While this may have been necessary to help create cash-earning opportunities in rural
    areas, it also promoted further dependence on external assistance. Lessons learned point to a need to
    promote further community self-reliance, and not pay for activities that communities are expected to
    maintain or support on their own once the project ceases.
    Policy and strategy support. ARP I1has proved the value o f reservinga pool o f funds for MAFF to
    contract high-level policy advisors. However, the scope o f advisory services needs to remain flexible
    to meet evolving needs.
    Monitoring droughts andfloods. The chronic effects o f droughts and floods on food security makes
    it important for MAFF to collect reliable agro-meteorological data and strengthen its contacts with
    international monitoring systems, as well as promote `no regrets' adaptation2 practices amongst
    vulnerable communities.
    Capacity building. Lessons from ARP Iand I1 indicate that foreign advisors may be needed for
    longer periods than originally envisaged, particularly in specialized fields such as project
    management, procurement and financial management.                           In addition, capacity transfer cannot be
    ensuredby single training events, as staff turnover is high. Sectoral and farmer training are also best
    left to MAFF divisions to closely integrate with their operational programs.

5. Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection
The following alternatives were considered and rejected by the project:

    MAFF - such as provision o f inputsto farmers - was rejected in favor o f shifting responsibilities to
    Government vs. communities ' implementation. Direct implementation o f many project activities by

    farmers' groups and private operators (such as VLWs). MAFF capacity - in both number o f staff and
    training -will remain limited in the near term. A community-based approach, on the other hand, will
    help farmers participate more actively in matching project assistance to their specific needs.
    Continuedfocus on irrigated areas. A continued focus on irrigated areas, as initiated under ARP I,
    was rejected due to emerging evidence that upland areas tend to be the poorest and most vulnerable.
    Hence, the project continues to support the Participatory Development and Natural Resources
    Management piloted under ARP I1for upland and coastal areas.
    Investment on low-cost, high maintenance solutions.
    communications and agro-meteorological units - such as posters and manual data collection - were
                                                                                      L o w investment cost options for

    considered and rejected due to the needto involve a large number o f staff and difficulty o f access to
    remote areas. Instead, the project will invest in suitable mass media technology (radio and e-mail)
    and automated systems to minimize the recurrent costs to MAFF.
    Capacity building through long-term training. The project considered the option o f providing degree
    training to enhance long-term MAFF capacity. However, this was rejected in favor o f short-term
    training due to the project duration, current staff limitations, and the needto establish solid criteria to
    ensure the return o f trained staff to the civil service.



 -`No regrets' adaptationare measures- such as watershed management that decrease local vulnerability against climatic
                                                                            -
events, and which are beneficial regardless o f the exact impact o f the event inthat location.

    New activities vs. consolidation.          Consideration was given to supporting new activities, such as
    research. However,this was rejectedinfavor of consolidationof activitiesalready startedunder ARP
    11, to help build upon lessons of experience and ensure sustainability. The only new activities -
    irrigation survey, support to agri-businesses, pilot community information, and agro-meteorology
    network - build upon previous components supported under ARP I1(Irrigation, Agriculture Service
    Centers, and Informationto Farmers). Giventhat privateretailersare becomingactive in rural areas,
    investmentinnew Agriculture Service Centerswas no longer considerednecessary.

C. Implementation
1. PartnershipArrangements (See Annex 6)
The project will be co-financedby the EuropeanCommissionandTFET and supervisedby IDA. The EC
has negotiated an Administration Agreement with the World Bank under the Trust Fund and Co-
financing Framework Agreement between the Commission and the World Bank, signed on November 8,
2001 and revised on March 17, 2003. IDA will then negotiate separate Grant Agreements for the TFET
andEC grants with Timor-Leste.
The project will promote several partnerships: MAFF will involve NGOs in implementation of
Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management component, and establish an Advisory
Committee with interested donors and NGOs to share lessons of experience. An IrrigationNetworkwill
be also promoted to share experiences in irrigation.Under Information to Farmers, MAFF will further
strengthen partnerships with internationalresearch organizations and re-activatean InformationForum;
underSupport toAgri-Business, MAFF is expectedto partner with ACIAWSeeds for Life for provisiono f
certified seeds, and with GTZ for support to coconut and candlenut oil production. A Policy Advisory
Group and Livestock Network are also expected to be established with interested partners. A project
indicator has beendevelopedto monitorthe progressofthese partnerships(see Annex 3).

2. Institutionaland ImplementationArrangements (see Annexes 6, 7 and 8)
MAFF will be the executing agency. Project components are already being implemented by different
MAFF Divisions, thus reducingthe number of activitieseach Division is responsible for. The only new
activities considered (see above) will be contracted out or, in the case of agri-business support,
implementedby trainedMAFF staffand advisors.
To further institutionalizethe program, the Project Management Unit formed under ARP Iand I1will be
absorbed into the MAFF structure. The Project Director (currently the Permanent Secretary of MAFF)
will be responsible for project management and coordination, supported by a Project Management
Advisor, and Financialand Procurement Advisors assistingthe MAFF's Budget and ProcurementUnits.
The MAFF Management Team (comprising all Director Generals and Directors) will continue to be
responsiblefor policy andmanagerialdecisions.

Project activities will be implemented at 3 levels: at the village level, by the villagehub-village
(suco/aldeia) andfarmers' groups; at the district level by district agriculturalstaff andtheir partners (e.g.
NGOs and facilitators); and at the central level by the MAFF divisions responsible for each program
(see Annex 6).

MAFF has recruited 180 national and district staff, and plans to increase its staff to 261 in 2004-05.
Many have received training under various donor-funded projects. However, their capacity needs to be
further strengthened, particularly in technical, managerial and facilitation skills. To supplement their
capacity, international advisors will be contracted in specialized areas, and evaluated periodically with
emphasis on their effectiveness in capacity transfer. Annex 6 includes a capacity analysis matching
projectrequirementswith the availablestaff, and identifyingareas for future strengthening.


Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    6

The financial management, fund flow, procurement and reporting will follow Government and IDA
procedures already tested and establishedduringARP Iand 11, with further refinementsto reflect lessons
of experience (see Annexes 7 and 8). MAFF has recruitedfull-time financial and procurement staff, and
will appointa monitoringandevaluation specialist prior to projecteffectiveness.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation of Outcomesmesults (seeAnnex 3)
The MAFF Divisions implementing project components will prepare Quarterly Project Monitoring
Reports, using simple monitoring forms and field data checklists updated from ARP 11. MAFF's
Monitoringand Evaluationofficer, assistedby the ProjectManagementAdvisor, will integratethe reports
into 6-monthlyProgressReports as an inputto supervisionmissions.
During ARP Iand 11, MAFF Divisionshave developed some capacity for field monitoringthe technical
aspects of the program. However, this needs further strengthening duringARP I11to shift attentionfrom
physicaloutputs to quality and impact monitoring.The project will also seek to institutionalizequarterly
program reviews, to enableMAFFto assess past effectiveness andplanthe next quarter of activities.

Most project indicators are baseline-independent and will be monitored quarterly. For impact indicators
requiringa baseline, MAFF will carry out a benchmark study prior to the start of the field activities, and
commission an independent impact study at the end to determine project outcomes. MAFF will also
organize a project launch, mid-term review and participatory impact evaluation workshops, involving
nationalanddistrictagriculturestaff, NGOs, donors and communityrepresentatives.

4. Sustainability (See also Section D.1 and Annexes I and 9)
MAFF designed the project based on its past ARP experience and its emerging priorities. The Ministry
earmarkedUS$1.5millionin counterpart fundingto the project (about 29% o f its annual budget) as a sign
of its continuingcommitment and integrationof ARP activitiesin its core programs.Recurrentcosts were
realisticallyestimatedand agreedwith MAFF management(Annex 9).

The project was designed with a focus on sustainability. Grant funding for national vaccination
campaigns, communityirrigationandroads, and incrementaloperating costs will be progressivelyphased
out: EC/TFETwill fundthem at a decliningrate of 75%, 50% and 25%, duringyears 1to 3 of the project,
with the Government funding the remaining expenditures. Component 1, though initially reliant on
contractedfacilitators,will carry out a review at mid-termto evaluatethe options to progressivelydevolve
responsibilitiesto field staff, partner NGOs and regional government staff under the new governance
structure. Relianceon externaltechnical assistance is also expectedto decline as the pilot projects mature
and technical manuals are prepared. The budget for the component is consistent with a planned post-
projectexpansionof 10-13villages a year (1per district).
Component 2 places a strong emphasis on WUAs to help ensure future operation and maintenance
(O&M). Rehabilitation of the major irrigation scheme will only proceed after a network of WUAs is
,established.The O&M burdento the Government is beingincorporated intoforwardbudget estimates.
Component 3 was designed to meet MAFF's severe extension constraints. By training a network of
privateVLWs to provide simple animalhealthservices to farmers for a fee, MAFF will help address its
critical staff shortages. By establishing partnerships with CGIAR centers and investingin radio and e-
mail communication, MAFF hopes to access global specialized advice on a least-cost basis. Fully
automatedagro-meteorologicalequipmentwas selectedto minimizeoperatingcosts.
Sub-component 4.1 (Policy and Strategy Development) will help MAFF formulate a long-termsectoral
strategy and exit strategy for the ARP program (see Annex 1). Reliance on foreign advisors remains a
risk to sustainability, but the project will invest heavily on capacity building and on-the-job training of
countemart staff.

 5. CriticalRisks and PossibleControversialAspects
 As a project operating in a fluid post-conflict environment, ARP I11entails substantial risks but also
 potentially high benefits. To address these risks, the project will follow a programmatic, flexible
 implementation, with an intensive supervision schedule and a 11 % contingency rate on expenditures.
 This will facilitate periodic evaluations and adjustments to emerging risks.

 There are no major controversial aspects associated with the project. Most activities are a consolidation o f
 those started under ARP 1-11.However, two activities merit close monitoring:
Rehabilitation of Caraulun Irrigation Scheme. At 1,030 hectares (ha), Caraulun is the second largest
 irrigation scheme in Timor-Leste. Even though the rehabilitation works are technically simple and the
 project will re-establish pre-existing infrastructure and WUAs, many farmers have since left the area due
 to the damage to the scheme. About 291 ha o f land have unclear land ownership status: 64 ha were used
 by Indonesian transmigrants which have now left the area; 165 ha were used by the church for a now
 discontinued youth program; and 62 ha were government land currently used by local farmers. The
 project will address this issue by carrying out a detailed survey o f farmer plots, and requiring customary
 land use agreements as part o f re-establishing the WUAs prior to the commencement o f the rehabilitation
 works. Any tertiary canals proposed by communities will follow the mechanisms for voluntary land
 donation applicable to the rehabilitation o f community irrigation and roads, specified in the land Policy
 Guidelines for ARP 111. In the unlikely event that the Government would need to acquire land to
 rehabilitate the scheme, the provisions for compensation under the Guidelines would apply (Annex 10).
 Village Livestock Workers. The private VLWs network started during ARP I1is still new to Timor-
 Leste. Possible controversial aspects include farmers' ability to pay for VLW's services, and MAFF's
 capacity to adequately oversee the quality o f the services. The project has considered this by ensuring that
 the VLW program is introduced gradually, and as a complement (rather than a replacement) o f essential
 vaccination campaigns, which would continue to be funded by the Government. MAFF will also help
 establish a National VLW Association to ensure adequate certification and service quality monitoring.

Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    9

D. Appraisal Summary
1. Economic and FinancialAnalyses (seeAnnex 9)
Economic Analysis
The project's total economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated conservatively at 17.7% with a net present
value (NPV) at 12% of US$2.32 million. The economic analysis is a combination o f cost benefit and cost
effectiveness. Each component was assessed independently. The estimates were then combined to
produce an overall rate of return. Potentialsocial and environmental benefits, as well as benefits resulting
from strengthening MAFF's capacity to implement future projects, were not included inthe analysis.

Participatory Development Natural Resource Management.                  The computations were based on the
expected Small Group Grants (US$200,000), and theoretical analyses o f similar projects in Timor-Leste,
where ERRSrange from negative to in excess o f 100%. An average ERR o f 15% was assumed. In
practice, some projects (e.g. vegetable gardens) may deliver highbenefits immediately, while others (e.g.
agro-forestry) may take much longer.
Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management. Community irrigation schemes involve the rehabilitation of
schemes that have fallen into disuse. Based on experience from ARP 1-11, limited investment will be
required to bring previously irrigated land back into production for potentially large returns. The
combined ERR for community irrigation and roads i s estimated at about 47%.                    This assumes
(conservatively) an average yield o f 1.8 MT/ha/crop, a single crop, and a price o f US$130/MT o f paddy
rice. Rehabilitation o f the Caraulun irrigation scheme will potentially benefit an area o f 1,030 ha. The
economic analysis for this scheme estimates an ERR o f 20% for an investment o f US$1.6 million (about
US$932/ha).     The current yields are about 1.9 M T h a with a single crop. The with-project benefits
assume two crops a year (160% cropping intensity) with yields increasingto 2.5 MT/ha for the first crop,
and 2.0 M T h a for the second crop after five years. A price o f US$130/MT o f paddy was assumed.
Information to Farmers. The benefits o f information through mass media cannot be easily measured due
to the lack o f baseline data. Usinga cost-effectiveness analysis (based on an alternative o f more extension
officers for face-to-face communication) the estimated ERR is 17% for mass media and 22% for
community-based information services.
Animal Health Services. Provided MAFF can sustain funding for vaccination campaigns or farmers are
prepared to pay for future vaccination, the ERR o f vaccinating pigs, chickens or cattle/buffalo against
common diseases could reach 234% because the main capital outlay (cold chain upgrading) is relatively
small compared to the benefits.
Agri-Business Support. The specific benefits o f seed multiplication and niche market processing will be
evaluated through a planned feasibility study. ARF' I and I1gave significant assistance to agriculture
associations, and while they have yet to break even, they have only been trading for a year and furthei
technical advice to these and other farmers' organizations is consideredjustified.

Program Management.          The benefits for this component were not assessed, though they could be
substantial through new policies andtraining. The costs were included inthe overall ERR.

Sensitivity Analysis. The overall ERR is robust to changes in most project assumptions. The ERR
sensitivity is highest for changes inrice prices, as well as prices of vaccinated pigs. World rice prices arc
currently at low levels and are projectedto increase by about 10% over the next decade. A 20% increast
in rice prices above the base price would increase the overall ERR to 20.5%, while a 20% decline in rice
prices would result in an ERR o f 14.6%. A 20% decline in the price o f pigs would reduce the ERR to
14.6%.    Iffarmers inCaraulun failed to increasetheir yield above 1.9 MT/ha or plant a second crop, the
project ERR would be reduced to 15.6% (the ERR for Caraulun would fall to 8.1%). Similarly, if
community information services failed, the ERR would decline to 16.3%.


Timor-LesteThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -ProjectAppraisalDocument, October 7, 2004      10

Financial Analysis. The financial rate o f return for the project is the same as the ERR (17.7 %) as
existing tariffs on agriculture products have little effect on prices o f domestically produced commodities.
The estimated recurrent cost associated with the ARP program are about US$737,000 a year, excluding
staff costs (see Annex 9). This is equivalent to 26% o f MAFF's forward budget estimates for FY07.
Given the high degree o f integration o f ARP I11with MAFF's programs, this is considered sustainable.
The major recurrent costs are the annual vaccination campaigns (US$310,000 a year), and O&M for the
16,500 ha o f irrigated land served by schemes which will have been rehabilitated under ARP 1-111by 2007
(US$234,000 a year).

2.  Technical (see Annex 13)
The Participatory Development and NRM Component relies on a `farmer first' approach, based on well
:ested principles o f collaborative natural resources management, community-driven development, and `no
:egrets' adaptation. It i s also consistent with the Government's focus on strengthening local governance.
The approach relies on direct grants to farmer groups to carry out their own proposals. The revised
?ositive list o f potential activities (see Annex 4) offers technically simple options - such as forage
production, higher yielding staple crops, and simple agro-forestry - designed to promote community
resilience to food insecurity, droughts and floods. It also introduces NRM principles which take into
sccount farmers' economic needs.
The community rehabilitation o f small-scale irrigation schemes and access roads will follow the
zstablished technical standards developed during ARP Iand 11. The investment costs - US$160/ha for
Community irrigation schemes and US$3,200 per km for access roads - compare favorably with similar
schemes in the region. The importance o f these works for food security was shown in 2003, when they
helped boost the rice harvest by 12% at the same time as the yield o f other staple crops (maize and
cassava) declined due to drought. Amongst the four major-damaged irrigation schemes in Timor-Leste,
the repair o f Caraulun proved the most viable (Annex 13). The proposed rehabilitation (US$598/ha for
headworks and US$335/ha for canals) involves a free intake with flume, enabling the scheme to work as
originally designed and thus minimizing the risk o f failure. Works in Caraulun will only proceed after
WUAs are established. To help ensure O&M, the project will also invest on strengthening existing WUAs
and on organizing one WUA per district amongst community schemes with highest demonstration value.

Information to Farmers will build upon past ARP lessons, experience from other developing countries,
and the urgent need to strengthen two-way communication between MAFF, district staff, and farmers in
remote areas. The project will promote face-to-face contact with farmers and mass media (particularly
radio) which have proven the most efficient communication methods in the past. The CGIAR Liaison
Secretariat at MAFF will develop a rapid response system for most frequently asked questions, and help
MAFF liaise with international centers of excellence ina cost-effective manner. Inaddition, ARP I11will
pilot e-mail communication with district centers opened to local agricultural stakeholders, based on the
successful experience o f the People FirstNetwork inremote areas o f the Solomon Islands.


the most common diseases - Hemorrhagic Septicemia amongst cattle and buffaloes, hog cholera amongst
MAFF will continue to support the vaccination campaigns started duringARP I,to prevent outbreaks of

pigs, and Newcastle disease amongst chickens.             The Government's decision to continue to provide free
vaccination over the short-term is based on the inability o f very poor households to pay for vaccines,
which could place the livestock population at risk.

The Village Livestock Workers program started under ARP I1-based on the successful Cambodianmodel
o f village para-veterinarians - will be expanded under ARP I11to help address the severe shortage of
trained veterinarians in Timor-Leste. At full implementation, the program will train 265 VLWs (two per
three villages), covering all 498 villages in Timor-Leste. To ensure regulatory control, the project will
provide refresher training bi-annually, help establish a National Association to certify VLWs, and help
them procure veterinary supplies inbulk.

Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004     11

 The project will also help strengthen agri-business support services in MAFF to meet the increasing
 demand from farmers' associations for technical advice and regulatory support. It will support two
 promisingniche markets: (a) certifiedseed production;and (b) small-scaleprocessing (expectedto focus
 on candlenut and coconut oil). Farmers in rice producing areas are constrained by the availability of

 partners - will help key farmers test new varieties suitable to Timor-Leste, and help establish a Seed
 certified seed, which is now obtained primarily from Surabaya (Indonesia). MAFF - through key

 Growers' Association. Based on the results of a feasibility analysis conducted by GTZ and IDA'S
 ongoing niche market study, the project will also help farmers develop priority niche markets, e.g. by
 providingsmall oil mills and helpinglink processorsof candlenut and coconut oil with retail outlets. The
 oil mills will be providedto an establishedfarmer association or directly to farmer groups with a lease-to-
 buy option.

 3. Fiduciary (see Annex 7 and 8)
 The financial management system and procedures are satisfactory and adequate for the project
 implementation. MAFF's Finance and Budget Support Services will be responsible for financial
 management. Accounting, internal controls and audits will build upon ARP Iand ARP I1procedures
 which have beenprogressivelystrengthenedover the last 3 years. MAFF's Finance and Budget Support
 Services maintain an adequate accounting system to record project resources and expenditures. The
 annual financial statements for ARP Iand I1have been unqualified,with no significant irregularitiesor
 fiduciary accountability issues.        Previous weaknesses - primarily on responsiveness of the accounting
 systemto Freebalance (the accounting software adoptedby the Government), lack of adequate fixed asset
 register, budget procedures to track expenditures against funds, delays in submission of quarterly
 Financial Monitoring Reports, and inadequate capacity transfer to Timorese counterparts - are being
 addressed.The FinancialAdvisor is expectedto be appointed on a full-timebasis as of February 2004.
 The project will follow standard Bank procurement procedures. The procurement risk is highbecause of
 continuing weaknesses in Timor-Leste's counterpart procurement capacity. This risk will be partially
 mitigatedby the appointment o f an internationalprocurement advisor on a full-time basis for at least 24-
 months(a conditionfor effectiveness). While the advisor will be responsiblefor processingprocurement,
 hidher performance will be measuredby success in capacity transfer. At present, MAFF has recruiteda
  local procurement officer and a trainedprocurement consultant. The adequacy of these arrangements will
 be carefully monitoredduringimplementation. The EC and TFET GrantAgreements will include, as an
 Annex to the Procurement Schedule, mandatoryprovisionsfor nationalcompetitivebidding.

I 4.   Social (see Annex II)
  With the expected issuance of an Autonomy Law at the end of 2003, Timor-Leste is in the process of
  establishing its system of localgovernance from the districtsto the village (sum) level. This presents an
  opportunity for MAFF to institutionalizecommunity-drivenapproaches in agriculture,throughthe direct
  grant approachused incomponent 1 (for upland and coastalareas), andthe communitycontracts usedfor
 small irrigation and road rehabilitation (for lowland areas).              A potential risk in component 1 is the
 communities' capacity to absorb and manage small grants efficiently and sustainably. Based on ARP I1
 experience, the project has reduced significantly the size of the grants and adopted tighter guidelines to
  ensure community in-kindcontributionsof free labor, land, and local materials.

 ARP I11 reflects the combined experience of MAFF, as well as partner NGOs, farmers, and private
  service providers. MAFF incorporatedthis feedback duringthe ARP I1Mid-TermReview, the evaluation
  of ARP I,a May 2003 stakeholder meetingto discuss component 1, and an ARP I11stakeholder workshop
  inAugust 2003. An extensive social appraisalwas also carriedout inMarch 2003. Thesereviews




  Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004     12

  identified, among other issues, the need for further technicalback-up to the pilot communities, and for
 greater participationandpartnershipswith civil society. Inresponse,the projectwill strengthenpost-grant
 technical assistance to community projects, involve NGOs in facilitation and external evaluations, and
 strengthen partnerships with other donors and NGOs in the areas of agriculturepolicy, NRM, irrigation,
 livestock, information, and agri-business. The VLW program will also respond to farmers' needs for
 further animalhealthservices.

 Beneficiary targeting remains unchanged from ARP 11, focusing primarily on poor upland and coastal
 communities as well as lowland irrigated areas. Vaccination, VLWs, information, and agri-business
 support will be national in scope. Decisions over the use of grants in component 1 will be made
 collectively, with no benefitexpected to accrue to particular individuals(in the ARP I1pilots, the grants
 benefitedon average 65 % of the village population). Women's participationhas been strengthenedby
 increasingthe numberoftargetedwomen's group beneficiaries andwomen facilitators,trainingwomento
 vaccinate chickens, and increasing the number o f female VLWs. Vaccinators will recordthe levels and
 reasons for farmer non-participationin vaccinationthrough a newly introducedvoucher system, so the
 program can be adjustedprogressively to achieve greater coverage.

 DuringARP 11, questions were raisedabout community user rights over natural resources -reforestation
 activities in particular. Whilst no specific conflicts were reported - all activities are carried out in land
 which was voluntarily providedby their recognizedowners -ARP I11is expectedto fund a study (under
 Component 4.1) to inform how natural resources management policies should address community user
 rights andtraditionaltenure inthe future.

  Social monitoring will be particularly important in component 1, and will be part of the regular
 monitoring carried out by project facilitators and district staff. Emerging issues should be discussed
 during monthly facilitator meetings and remedial action taken. Villages which breach financial
 management procedures, show a concentration of beneficiaries, or poor achievement o f development
 targets will be identified,providedwith remedialsupport, and excluded from the program if they fail to
 respond. Village leadership will be crucial in identifyingnegative social impact, providing guidance to
 facilitators in its resolution, and ultimately, deciding and applying sanctions (particularly in relationto
 traditional laws governing NRM). Importantly, selection of villages will include consideration of the
 strength o ftraditionalleadership. The project will also contract out external evaluations to determine the
 desirability and optimalpace of expansionto new villages.
I 5. Environmental (see        Annex 12)
  Duringpre-appraisal,IDA conducteda field reviewto assess how environmentalsafeguards were applied
 to ARP I1 activities. ARP I1 also funded a major feasibility study in Caraulun, including an
 environmental and social analysis, which was reviewed by IDA at pre-appraisal. The environmental
 review confirmedthe absence of major environmentalimpacts under past ARP projectsand was usedto
  adjust the environmental mitigation measures already adopted under the program, in order to improve
 their applicability (see Annex 12and SectionD.5). Basedonthis review, ARP I11is not expectedto have
  significant, complex, or irreversibleadverse environmentalimpacts.

  Both component 1 and 2 are expectedto help reduce community vulnerabilityto environmentalchanges
 (floods and droughts). For component 1, simple best practices criteria (Annex 12, Table 1) will be
 followedand monitoredfor each smallvillage grant, as specifiedinthe OperationalManual andmaterials
  for community facilitators. Some of the NRMactivities may include rehabilitating denuded communal
  areas within the villages, to ensure the quality and quantity of water supply for domestic and agriculture
 use, andthis is expectedto result in positiveenvironmentalbenefits.

All irrigation and access roads rehabilitation will be carried out in pre-existing schemes, and no works
will be supported inside critical or important natural habitats or protected areas.                 As part o f the
Operational Manual for community irrigation and roads, MAFF will monitor compliance with simple
environmental best practices and, if required, organize simple training in environmental best practices to
communities involved in the works. The rehabilitation o f the Caraulun scheme will follow an
environmental management plan, which includes mitigation measures and monitoring. These measures
will be included inthe terms o f reference o fthe supervisory engineer.

MAFF will be responsible for supervising the environmental mitigation measures and social safeguards.
The Division o f Environment (DOE)will be consulted as required to advise on the effectiveness o f
mitigation measures and propose alternatives. The bi-annual progress reports will include a section on
environmental and social issues, a copy o f which will be provided to DOE.

6. Safeguard Policies (see Annex 10)
                                      Policy                                                   Triggered

The project's Safeguard Screening Category is S2. Some safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are
limited intheir impact and are technically and institutionally manageable. The project's Environmental
Screening Category is B (see Annex 10 and 12).
Aside from OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), the project triggers the following safeguard policies:
(a) Natural Habitats; (b) Forests; (c) Pest Management; (d) Involuntary Resettlement; and (e)
International Waterways.
Natural Habitats: All community based irrigation and farm-to-market access roads proposed for
rehabilitation under the project will be located outside protected areas (one o f the criteria used in their
selection). Component 1, however, may be carried out in and around natural habitat areas. The negative
list excludes any activity which may impact adversely on important or critical natural habitats, including
those at altitudes above 2000 meters, inmangrove areas, wetlands or coral reefs.
Forests: Component 1 will include community-based forest management activities, such as reforestation
o f community-owned forest land, and sustainable utilization o f non-timber forest products in natural
forests within village boundaries (e.g. bamboo or honey).              It will not involve harvesting timber from
natural forests.
Pest Management: This policy may be triggered in limited occasions. Under the Irrigation Rehabilitation
component, and Agri-business support to seed producers, farmers may use limited amounts o f pesticides
to control pests or diseases. In case pesticides need to be provided by the project in support o f these
activities, MAFF will exclude all Class Itoxic pesticides and Class I1moderately hazardous pesticides
(see Tables 2, Annex 12). MAFF will also provide training on Integrated Pest Management principles
and safe dimosal methods.

Involuntary Resettlement: N o involuntary resettlement or land acquisition which results in loss o f
income is expected to take place as a result o f project activities. However, as small amounts o f
community landmay be requiredfor community-based and owned activitiesunder Component 1and 2.1
(Community Irrigation and Roads) the Policy Guidelines for the Negotiations over the Use and
Development of Land for ARP I11have been adopted to ensure that voluntary land donations are not
made under duress, andthat appropriatecompensationis providedfrom within the community(Annex 10,
Attachment 1). In the rehabilitation of the Caraulun scheme (sub-component 2.2) there is a remote
possibility that small areas of land around the existing intake and canals may be acquired by the
Government. Should this be needed, the Guidelinesprovidefor state compensation. Incase communities
in Caraulun decide to establishtertiary canals under community irrigationcontracts, the same process as
for Sub-component2.1 wouldapply.Agro-meteorologicalstations will be located ingovernmentland.
International Waterways: Some community irrigation schemes proposed for rehabilitation may be
located in the six internationalwaterways which Timor-Leste shares with Indonesia (see Annex 10).
Given that the rehabilitation works will not involve any major additions or alterations of existing
schemes, and that no impacts are foreseen on the quantity or quality of water to/from Indonesian
riparians, an exceptionto the requirement to inform Indonesian riparianswas granted on September 17,
2003. During implementation, any proposed community schemes that may potentially fall under the
policy will be reviewedin consultationwith IDA to ensure that they qualify for the exception. The need
for notificationwill be reconsidered ifrequiredunder futuretreatieswith Indonesia.
The social appraisaland final EnvironmentalAnalysis have beenprovidedto the Infoshop,and disclosed
in-country.In addition, MAFF has confirmed disclosure of the Policy Guidelines for the Negotiations
over the Use and Development of Landfor ARP I11 inDili andthe 13 district centers. Other assessments
-includingtheFeasibilityStudyforMajorDamagedIrrigationSchemes-areavailableatMAFF'soffice
in Dili. Past ARP supervision reports are summarized in the publicly available TFET Report to the
Trustee. MAFF will ensure adequate public disclosure of project activities, and availability of relevant
documents inpubliclyaccessible locations.

7. Readiness and Compliance
The project is ready for implementation,and complies with all applicable Bank policies. MAFF has
completeda ProjectImplementationPlanwhich is satisfactory to IDA.Key fiduciary and implementation
arrangementsare inplace.Project staffandkey consultants have or are inthe process of beingmobilized,
and sufficient counterpart budget is available to support FY04 activities. Crop yield baseline data for
irrigation schemes are being collected and will be completed prior to the start of the works. Bidding
documents will follow procedures andtemplates already established under ARP 11, which are satisfactory
to IDA. Operational Manuals for Component 1, Community Irrigation and Roads, and Procurement
Manual, satisfactory to IDA, have been completed and adopted by MAFF, meeting the conditions for
projectnegotiations.

An Administration Agreement between IDA and the European Commission has been signed for
financingprojectcomponents supportedunderthe EC grant.

                         Technical Annex 1: Country and Sector Background

                      TIMOR-LESTE: Third Anriculture Rehabilitation Proiect


Timor-Leste- the world's newest nation (Population925,000 in 2004) - faces the double challenge of
and cementingits new politicaland socio-economicstructures while meetingthe risingexpectations of its
people. During the Indonesian administration period, agriculture and its support industries employed
about 75 percent of the workforce, contributedto 26 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and
accounted for 90 percent o f the foreign exchange. Exports included coffee, some sandalwood and live
cattle. Government subsidies on fertilizers, fuel and rice helped low-lying rice producingareas, but little
was done to assist the uplands where the majority of the ruralpoor live. The overstaffedand underpaid
government service contributedto disempowerment and dependence of rural communities, with a heavy
bias towards centralizedandtop-downplanning.Traditionalmechanismsof natural resource management
andself-reliance, suchas tara bandu,were activelydiscouraged.

In the violence that followed the August 30, 1999 referendum, over 75 percent of the population was
displaced, andnearly 70 percent of the physicalinfrastructurewas destroyed.Livestock (up to 29 percent
of the buffaloesand 38 percent of the pigs), tools, andfarm machinery were destroyed, andfood and seed
stocks were looted. Delayed maintenance resulted in damage to much of the 19 large and 346 small
irrigationschemes in Timor-Leste,and the lack of road maintenance made it very difficult for farmers to
move agriculture products to markets. As a consequence, the agriculturalcontributionto Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) fell by 49 percent in 1999 relative to the previous year, with food crops, livestock and
fisheries registering the most important losses. While upland farmers remained the poorest, lowland
farmers suffered significantlosses in assets.

The United Nations Transitional Administration and, after independence, the new Timor-Leste
Government curtailed assistance to agriculture support services significantly. This was partially a
strategic choice (to invest most public expenditures on healthand education) as well as a fiscal necessity,
given the expected size of domestic revenues. From a staff of 6,000 and an annual budget of about
US$1.9million equivalent during Indonesian times, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
(MAFF) now operates with a staff of 180 (expected to increase to 261 in FY04/05) and a budget of
US$1.8million. This operational budget is expectedto levelat aroundUS$2.0-2.5 million ayear over the
short term. Pendingfurther revenues from oil and gas, MAFF will needto rely on partnerships with the
privatesector, NGOs, ruralcommunities, andbilateraldonors operating at the districtlevelfor agriculture
service delivery. Lessons from other developingcountries indicatethat such an approach will, over the
long-term,be more effectivethan a heavy relianceon government subsidies and disempowerment of rural
communities that characterizedthe Indonesianrule.

Some of the problems Timorese farmers face are chronic in nature. Geologically a very young island,
Timor has a system of meandering rivers and frequent landslides that make it difficult to carry out
traditional watershed management or sustain fixed irrigation structures.                The island is also prone to
periodic droughts and floods associated with El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These natural
phenomena, accentuatedby a loss intraditions of adaptation and self-reliance, contributeto chronic food
insecurity. Accordingto the 2001 village (suco) survey, about 70-80 percent of the sucos report having
insufficient food during the traditionalfamine months (December and January), a period which follows
the end of the rice harvest and precedes the maize harvest (Figure 1). As many as 30 percent o f the
households experience food shortages for up to 4 months a year. They cope with it by decreasingthe
amount o f consumed food, switchingto less desirable foods, and to a lesser extent by borrowingfunds
and sellinglivestock. Major diet deficienciesappear to be primarily inprotein, fats andvitamins.

The Agriculture Rehabilitation Program (ARP) started in 2000 as a US$17.8 million contribution from
the multi-donor Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), managed by the International Development
Association of the World Bank. ARP phases were designed to respond to the evolving needs of the post-
conflict situation:

             o Rehabilitation: ARP I.
             o Transition: ARP I1
             o Sustainability: ARP I11

                                  The Rehabilitation Phase and ARP I

The Rehabilitation Phase (2000-01) was characterized by a focus on restoration of assets and rapid
rehabilitation of services, infrastructure and supplies to help farmers jump-start agricultural production.
The first Joint Donors' Mission (November 1999) identified the following priority areas for agriculture
rehabilitation: (a) support to vulnerable groups (including victims of violence and those who lost their
productive assets); (b) restoration of basic agricultural infrastructure, including irrigation systems and
access roads; (c) restoration o f livestock; and (d) provision of agricultural services.

ARP Iwas designed to respond to these priorities. The project (2000-2002; US$6.8millionfrom TFET)
financed the following:

        Priority Productive Asset Restoration - restoration of annual national vaccination campaigns for
        buffaloes, cattle, pigs and chickens, distribution of cattle and buffaloes to 2,552 farm families,
        and chickens to 14,134 families, and agriculture tools to 20,658 farm families.
         Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure - rehabilitation of 1,090 ha o f land served by light-to-
        medium damaged irrigation schemes and 7,742 ha served by community schemes (equivalent to
        37 % of the irrigated area inneed of rehabilitation) and 109 kmo f farm-to-market access roads.

Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004         17

    o Pilot Agriculture Service Centers - establishment o f 3 pilot agriculture service centers in
         Bobonaro (specializing in rice), Aileu (coffee and maize), and Viqueque (candlenut and copra),
         distribution of 1,000 radios to communities in 4 districts, and design o f soil analysis laboratory.
    o Project Management Unit Strengthening-training o fabout 90 MAFFstaffand district officers.

A joint evaluation by IDA and the Government in June 2002 rated the project outcome as Satisfactory.
Major achievements included the restoration o f vaccination programs, and improvements in farmers'
livestock and irrigation assets. Overall, the project created an estimated 120,000 person-days o f labor at a
time o f scarce cash opportunities for rural families, and helped place irrigated areas back into production.
On the other hand, the chicken distribution was unsatisfactory due to highmortality, the pilot agriculture
service centers were still at their early stages o f implementation, and institutional development was
viewed as marginal due to continued reliance on foreign and local consultants.

The rehabilitation phase and ARP Iyielded the following key lessons:

         Flexibility and Periodic Evaluations. The rehabilitation phase demonstrated the value o f a
         phased, flexible approach to program implementation, with time to study lessons o f experience
         and adjust the program to emerging conditions.
         Balanced Investments between Irrigated and Upland areas. While ARP Iwas designedto focus
         primarily on irrigated areas, subsequent joint donors missions reiterated the need to also focus on
         upland areas and target the most vulnerable sucos to promote further food security through farm
         system diversification and self-reliance.
         Direct Grant Assistance to Communities. During the rehabilitation phase, the Government
         experienced major difficulties distributinga small number o f valuable inputs to a large number o f
         needy farmers. By contrast, the community irrigation schemes - relying on direct contracts with
         local communities to undertake the works - were well received and fostered local ownership.
         The Joint Donors Agriculture Mission o f November 2001 recommended a shift from input
         provision to direct grant assistance to rural communities.
         Ensuring Sustainability. Many donor funded projects during the emergency phase paid high
         wages for rural labor and provided imported inputs and food. While this may have provided a
         much needed cash infusion into rural communities, it also promoted further community
         dependence. Lessons learned point to a need to promote community self-reliance, and not pay for
         activities that communities are expected to maintainthemselves once the projects cease. The need
         to strengthen Water Users Associations in irrigated areas was also emphasized.
         StressingInter-sectoral, Demand-basedAssistance. Joint donors agriculture missions repeatedly
         stressed the need for better integration o f rural development efforts, both within MAFF, as well as
         with donors and civil society.
         Establishment of Legislative and Regulatory Frameworks. There was an urgent need to develop
         legislative and regulatory frameworks suitable to the conditions of Timor-Leste.
These lessons were taken closely into account inthe design o f ARP 11.

                                 The Transition Phase and ARP I1

During the Transition Phase (2001-2002), donors focused on helping to establish essential agricultural
and natural resources policies and regulations, and to smooth the transition from a heavily subsidized
sector to one with limited government funding. ARP I1 (2002-2004, US$S.O million from TFET)
responded to the above needs through substantial design adjustments in its components:


Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004      18

        Pilot Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management - This new component,
        implemented by MAFF's Forestry and Fisheries Divisions, aimed to strengthen the resilience o f
        upland and coastal communities to external shocks. It provided small grants and facilitated
        assistance to farmers' groups. The component focused first on 14 pilot villages in 7 districts, to
        be expanded to 30 villages after an evaluation o f lessons learned. AusAID, UNDP/UNOPs and
        the Portuguese Government startedsimilar community-based programs inthe other 6 districts.
        Rapid Infrastructure Rehabilitation - This component targeted the rehabilitation o f 7 light-to-
        medium damaged schemes, 2,100 ha o f irrigated land covered by community schemes, 100 km o f
        access roads, and establishment o f Water Users Associations in all larger schemes.
        Services to Farmers - This new component included: (a) support to agriculture information
        programs and establishment o f a CGIAR3Liaison Secretariat at MAFF; (b) continued support to
        vaccination campaigns, and establishment o f a program o f private Village Livestock Workers;
        and (c) continuedsupport to farmers' associations, through the Agriculture Service Centers.
        Program Management - This component included (a) strategy and policy support to MAFF; and
        (b) capacity building and support to the Project Management Unit (PMU).
ARP I1has been under implementation for 2 years, and has remained satisfactory. The mid-termreview
(January 2003) confirmed the continued validity o f the project design. While the project met or exceeded
most o f its mid-term output indicators, further efforts were needed on strengthening its impact, quality
and sustainability. Key lessons learned include:

        The Need to Strengthen Assistance to Farmers. The mid-term review stressed the need to
        strengthen the organization and training o f farmers' groups, and sending inter-sectoral teams to
        the field. It recommended a stronger selection and training o f facilitators incomponent 1, as well
        as an emphasis on technical backstopping.                    For component 2 (Irrigation)  the review
        recommended improved assistance in crop production and strengthening o f Water Users
        Association to enable farmers to increase crop yields following irrigation rehabilitation.
        Monitoring ENS0 Events. In2002-03, production o f maize and other food crops declined due to
        a prolonged drought. This was partially offset by a 12 percent increase in rice production as a
        result o f irrigation rehabilitation. Given the recurrence o f ENS0 events, the mid-term review
        recommended that MAFF strengthen its monitoring o f drought and floods through its Agriculture
        and Geographical Information System and Information units, and liaise closely with the National
        Disaster Management Office on the need for targeted food distribution.
        Institutionalize Information to Farmers.             The specialization o f MAFF Divisions made the
        operation o f the inter-sectoral information team particularly challenging. MAFF addressed this
        by placing the Information Team and the CGIAR Secretariat directly under the Director of
        Research and Extension Center. Continued feedback from farmers about the timeliness and
        appropriateness o f the information material stressed the need for further communication training
        amongst the team.
        Cold Chain Improvementfor Vaccination Program. The mid-termreview identified the need to
        replace old cold boxes and invest in generator or solar-powered refrigerators at the district level
        to preserve the quality o f vaccines, and to replace motorcycles damaged during previous
        vaccination seasons.
        Expansion of Marketing Network. The three pilot agriculture service centers are now active, but
        there is further need for training management committees, and expanding marketing networks
        with farmer members as well as between the centers to buildeconomies o f scale.

         Policy and Strategy Support. ARP I1has proventhe value o f having a pool o f funds for policy
         and strategy support. However, the scope of advisory services needs to remain flexible to meet
         evolvingneeds. Moreover, any policy studies needto be extensively discussedwith stakeholders
         priorto their formaladoption.
         Capacity Building. ARP Iand I1providedseveral key lessons on capacity transfer: first, foreign
         advisors may be neededfor longer periods than originally envisaged, particularly in specialized
         fields and key areas such as project management, procurement and financial management.
         Second, capacity transfer cannot be ensuredby training only a few staff, as they can easily move

         effectively making it attractive for them to join the public service - many former consultants
         on to other posts. Third, MAFF management wisely loweredthe fees for national consultants,

         engaged under ARP Ihave now been hired by MAFF. Finally, centralizing training under
         MAFF's trainingunit hasnot beeneffective inthe past-sectoral and farmer trainingare best left
         to MAFF Divisionsto manageand closely integrate with their operational programs.

                             The Sustainability Phase and the Road Map

The SustainabilityPhase(2002-now) focusedon long-termsustainable agricultureand ruraldevelopment,
income generation and natural resourcesmanagement.Assistance duringthis phasewas to be targeted at
participatoryprogramsto encourage community self-reliance, provide options for diversifiedcash income
sources, and enhance traditional institutional arrangements for natural resources management4 These
principles were adopted in the design of ARP I1and 111, although ARP I1also focused on transitional
phasesupport (primarilythroughrapidinfrastructurerehabilitationandthe agricultureservice centers).

The August/September 2002 Joint Donors Agriculture Mission agreed with MAFF on a policy of sew-
reliance for the agriculture sector, based on the principles that Timorese farmers should gain the
economic meansto be food secure - either by growingtheir own food or by beingable to purchase it. A
key to strengthening self-reliance and improving rural incomes was the further integration of MAFF's
sub-sectors and promotiono f a diversified, demand-drivenapproach. Developinglinkages with partners
working with community groups (e.g. NGOs) was to contributeto this goal, as was improvedskills and
effective communication betweenproducer groups andMAFF.

Amongst the overarching recommendationof the missionwas to adopt a `farmers first' approach. Since
the needs of rural households are diversified and not focused on any single sub-sector, service delivery
must respondto these multiple needs in a timely and effective manner. This approach emphasizedthe
role of key farmers in extension, collaboration between MAFF and other government agencies, and
further strengthening of community-based organizations and farmer groups.                            A proper enabling
environment with key policies in place was also seen as critical for environmental sustainability and
naturalresources management, with an emphasis on co-management approaches with local communities
andtraditionalleaders. Theserecommendations were taken closelyinto account inthe formulationofthe
RoadMap (see below) andthe designofARP 111.

The NationalDevelopment Plan and Road Map

In2002, Timor-Lesteadoptedits first 5-yearNationalDevelopmentPlan, with two major goals:

     P Reductionof povertyinall sectors andregions; and
         Promotionof economic growththat is equitable and sustainable, improvingthe health, education
         andwell-beingo feveryone inTimor-Leste.


 The three phases o fagriculturesector assistance to Timor-Leste were identified inthe Joint DonorsAgriculture Mission Report
o f March-April 2001.

MAFF's major goals of attaining food security, improving self-sufficiency, and generating rural
employment are intrinsically linked with the National Development Plan.

The riots o f December 4, 2002 highlighted the fragility o f the social fabric in Timor-Leste, and the
urgency o f meeting immediate expectations for greater economic growth and employment, particularly
among the youth. As a result, the Government adopted in January 2003 a Stability Program which
emphasized strengthened governance and legal systems, job creation, a stronger focus on agriculture as a
pillar for food security, and enhanced access to markets and distribution. Also emphasized was trade
development through cooperatives.

In February-March 2003, all Government Ministries were asked to help develop the Road Map, a
framework for the implementation o f the National Development Plan. MAFF ranked all of its programs
inaccordance with the following criteriaand weights:

                   The Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (ARP 111)

With this background in mind, MAFF designed ARP I11as the consolidation phase o f the Agriculture
Rehabilitation Program, following the key themes o f sustainability o f activities, impact o f achievements,
and quality o f outputs. The project follows closely the priorities o f the Road Map and National
Development Plan, as well as lessons learned from ARP Iand 11. It aims to strengthenthe capacity o f the
Ministry to assist rural communities inincreasing agriculture productionand income in a sustainable way
-which are intrinsic to the sectoral and national objectives defined inthe National Development Plan.

All ARP I11activities - with exception o f project management - are integrated into MAFF Road Map
programs, and most rate relatively highly in MAFF's prioritization and sequencing (see Table 2, below).
Activities which are identified as being o f medium priority - such as village livestock workers, and agro-
meteorologicalservices - are expected to become increasingly important over the long-term.


all levels - from MAFF staff, to NGO partners, to farmers-beneficiaries - was therefore stressed. To
InARP 111, special attention was givento Timor-Leste's low capacity and budget. Capacity building at

address MAFF's acute staff shortage, community-based project planning and implementation were
reinforced based on the principles o f self-reliance and sustainability. The project also placed further
emphasis on strengthening partnerships with alternative service providers (private village livestock
workers, NGOs, and mass media for information dissemination), and on establishing networks with
interested partners working in agriculture policy, natural resources management, irrigation, information,
agri-business and livestock.

     fluctuations in external markets) through improved natural resources management. The component
     builds upon well tested principles of community-based management, `no regrets' adaptation, and
     communitydevelopment assistance inthe Asia-Pacificregion. By institutionalizingthis approachwithin
     MAFF, it is hoped that ARP I11will help create an institutional shift towards integratedand demand-
     basedassistance to farmers, andpromote further partnershipswith NGOsand local governance structures.

     The component will build upon lessons of experience from pilots initiated under ARP 11: MAFF has
     strengthened the selection and training o f facilitators, and increased technical backstopping o f small
     farmer groups. An experienced, full-time community development specialist was mobilizedto strengthen
     community organization and facilitator training. MAFF will also form an inter-sectoralNRM team

composed o fstaff from other divisionssuch as livestockandcrop productionto helpbackstopcommunity
activitiesinthese areas.

The second component -Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management - will support MAFF's program of
assistance to communities in low-land irrigable areas. Similarly to component 1, it will rely on small
contracts with community groups and strengthening o f farmers' groups to maximize impact and
sustainability. The project will continue to assist Water Users Associations (WAS)in larger irrigation
schemes, but support will be expanded to include advice on crop production and diversification, in
accordance with lessons learnedfrom ARP 11.A crop productionstaff has beenassignedto the Irrigation
Division on a full-time basis to meet this need. MAFF will also help organize WUAs in community
schemes selected in accordance with their demonstration value to surrounding areas. The community
irrigationandroadprogram-now in its 3rdyear -will be gradually transferredto Government financing.

The third component - Services to Farmers - will support three basic MAFF services (Information,
Animal HealthAssistance, and Agri-Businesssupport), while promotingpartnershipswith privatesector,
NGO and community associations to help ensure sustainability. The Information to Farmers sub-
component will continue to strengthen MAFF's delivery of information programs through mass media
(e.g. radio) and simple materials, while establishing networks with internationalcenters of agriculture
research(CGIAR). At the same time, it will strengthenthe flow of informationto farmers by promoting
electronic networks at the district and community radio levels. This is based on successful pilots
introduced in similar remote areas of the Pacific Islands to improve services to farmers. Particular
attention will be paid to strengthening information timeliness and appropriateness, two weaknesses
identifiedinprior ARP I1reviews.

The Sustainable Animal Health Services sub-componentwill continue support for vaccinationcampaigns
-to be funded by the Government on an increasingscale                  -while strengtheningthe coldchain and
transportationof vaccines by investing in solar-powered refrigerators and replacement motorcycles (in
accordance with ARP I1lessons at the mid-termreview).It will also expandthe trainingof privateVillage
LivestockWorkers initiatedunder ARP I1to cover all villages inTimor-Leste.
The Support to Agri-Business sub-component will institutionalize agri-business support services within
MAFF, to help support farmers associations and cooperatives. It will also seek to promote further
domestic productionof grain seeds (particularly rice and maize), and promote marketing networks in
priorityniche marketcommodities (such as coconut andcandlenut oil).

The fourth component - Program Management - will provide overall capacity building assistance to
MAFF and help manage the project. The Policy and Strategy sub-component will support MAFF's new
Policy, Planningand Program Services (formerly the Policy and PlanningUnit), ratedhighest in priority
inthe Road Map, and allow MAFF to contract high caliber advisors without nationalityrestrictions. It
will provide MAFF with key advisory services to help MAFF formulate a long-termsector strategy, as
well as priority agricultureand natural resourcespolicies and legislation.Building upon the lessons from
ARP 11,the range of policy studies has beenleft flexible to meet evolvingpolicyneeds.

The Project Management and Capacity Building sub-component will carry out overall project
management,while supportingMAFF's core procurement, financialand monitoringunits. Inrecognition
of the integration o f ARP activities within MAFF's programs, the Project Management Unit will be
abolished. Instead, the project will continue to be managed by the Permanent Secretary of MAFF, and
MAFF Directors responsible for the various components. In accordance with past lessons, all training
relatedto specific projectactivities has beendecentralizedto the respective MAFF Divisions. A training
evaluation processwill be introducedin2004.
Many ARP I11activities are a consolidationof activities started under ARP Iand ARP 11. Hence, while
the scope might be excessive in a new project, sufficient lessons, experience and staff capacity exist to

implement it within MAFF's programs. Moreover, the fact that project activities are clearly divided
amongst established divisions within MAFF will help facilitate implementation, effectively limiting the
number o f activitiesthat eachdivisionis responsible for. Mechanismshavebeenbuilt into projectdesign
to ensure effectivecoordinationof projectmanagement.


              An Exit Strategy for the Agriculture Rehabilitation Program
SinceARP I11will be the last agriculture projectfunded by TFET, extensive discussions were heldduring
appraisal to assess how the project could help MAFF formulate a long-term strategy for the sector and
prepare an exit strategy for the ARP program.

MAFF is inthe process of preparing its Sectoral Strategy, with assistance from the GermanGovernment,
USAID, AusAID, FAO, JICA, Oxfam, and EC/TFET (through ARP 111). In addition to a summary
sectoral strategy (includingMAFF's vision, key sector indicators,and programs)the strategy is expected
to include a public expenditure analysis, basic sector statistics, and a review of field experience. The
strategy is expected to be finalized by June 30, 2004, serving as a useful input to strengthen donor
coordination in the sector. It was agreed that ARP I11would support (under the Policy and Strategy
Development sub-component) the follow-upefforts of PPPS to develop andconsolidate this strategy.

With the appointment of its first agriculturaleconomist to headPPPS, MAFF is also keento collect basic
economic data on key crops. This is being proposed as a study under USAID and JICA financing,
servingas a first step for MAFF to develop its future data analysis capabilitiesand potentiallydeveloping
an agriculturalcensus.

The exit strategy for ARP involves both preparation of post-program sector investments, as well as
ensuring sustainability of field activities. ARP sustainabilitywithin MAFF is not a concern at this stage,
giventhat programactivitiesare already well integratedwithin the Ministry's structure(see Annex 6).

The strategy and policy studies funded by ARP I11will be reviewedperiodically to ensure a sound exit
strategy for the post-ARPperiod. One option is that they would help support the preparationof relevant
background studies for a Global EnvironmentalFacility operation. Thus, the fisheries and land studies
currently proposed by MAFF could be adjusted to cover marine biodiversity or land degradation
assessments neededto prepare a follow-up operation inthese areas. They could also be oriented towards
future priority investments supportedby other donors.

MAFF started using quarterly review workshops as a way to periodicallyreview and adjust ARP. These
review workshops - complementedby the partnership fora promoted by ARP I11- will help MAFF gain
lessons of experience and adjust project activitiesto help maximizetheir field impact and sustainability.
Of particular importance will be a mid-termreview o f options to decrease reliance on hired facilitators,
andalignthe programwith the emergingregionalgovernance structure.

 MAFF designedARP I11basedon a close assessment of lessons learnedduringthe post-conflictperiod.
At the same time, Timor-Lesteremains a nation intransition, and this calls for a flexible, programmatic
approach that can continue to be periodically evaluated and adapted. While the project design includes
estimatedtargets, these will be examinedduringregularsupervisionmissions and adjustedbasedon need.
Contingencies of about 11.4 percent have been built into the project costs to permit such adjustments.
Projectactivitieswill continue to be plannedbasedon base costs, with projectcontingencies(reserved for
unexpectedcost increases, change inactivity scope, or approvedchange in cost items) subject to approval
by the ProjectDirectorandMAFF Management Team.

' This is an aggregate indicator for compliance with environmental mitigation measures for all community sub-projects. The
  mitigation measures are identified for each type of community sub-project (see OperationalManuals for Component 1 and 2.1).
  The indicator aims for 90 percent achievement in the number of community sub-projects that either do not require mitigation
  measures, fully comply with them, or partially comply with them but are receivingtraining to improve mitigation.

                           Technical Annex 4: Detailed Project Description

                      TIMOR-LESTE: Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project

A. Project Summary

This Annex providesa description ofthe proposedThirdAgriculture RehabilitationProject (ARP 111).

The project's objective (purpose) is to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries (MAFF) and its development partners to assist rural communities to increase their
agriculture production and income in a sustainable way. It consists of four major components:

        ParticipatoryDevelopmentandNaturalResourcesManagement (US$1.3 million)
        IrrigationRehabilitationandManagement(US$3.5 million)
    P Servicesto Farmers (US$4.2 million)
    P ProgramManagement (US$2.4 million)

The estimated total costs of ARP I11 are US$11.4 million equivalent, including 5 percent price
contingencies and 7 percent physical contingencies. About US$3.O million will be funded by TFET,
 6.854 million by the European Commission (US6.9 million equivalent), and US$1.5 million by the
Government of Timor-Leste. MAFF will be fully responsible for project implementationand funding
execution, under the supervision of IDA.The projectdurationis estimatedto be 3.5 years, from January
2004 to June 2007.

B. Project Oescription by Component

   Component 1. Participatory Oevelopment and Natural Resource Management
                              (TFET: US$1.2million; CFET: US$O.I million)

This component aims to increase community resilienceto chronic threats to food security, through the
promotion of sustainable natural resources management (NRM) and mechanisms of self-reliance. It
targets an estimated 50 upland and coastal villages in 7 districts - Baucau, Lautem, Covalima, Dili,
Liquiqa, Manufahi and Oecussi - or approximately 10,000 rural households (8 percent of Timor-Leste's
rural families). At least 30 percent of the direct beneficiariesare expectedto be women.           Subject to a
favorable independent review and IDA'Sagreement, additional districts could be considered during
supervisionmissions.
The component is a continuationof activitiespilotedduringARP 11. It will buildthe capacity of MAFF,
contracted facilitators, NGOs and local government to facilitate and providetechnical support to upland
and coastal communities. The target beneficiaries - SmallGroups o f farmers -will be assistedto identify
their priorityneeds, managesmall group grants, and implementtheir approvedactivities.

The projectwill includethe following activities:
         Support to ARP I1pilot villages
    o Expansionto new villages

Component implementation will be guided by the Operational Manual for ARP Participatory
Development and Natural Resources Management, which will be adjusted from time to time to take into
consideration lessonslearned.

Activity 1.I.Support to Pilot Villages (TFETGrant only)

This activity will continue MAFF's support to the 30 pilot villagestargetedunder ARP 11. During 2002-
03, MAFF provided small group grants to 103 farmers groups in 14 pilot villages (2 per district) to
support local activities such as village nurseries, reforestation, fish ponds, live fences, and vegetable
gardens. The pilot villages will continue to require technicalsupport and capacity buildingduringARP
111, as many of the activitiesare seasonal, and some involve multiple crop or breeding cycles. ARP I11
will also provide continued managerial support to ensure equitable distribution of the post-harvest
benefits,as well as technicaladvice on marketing. ARP I1will be extendedfor an additionalyear (to end-
December2004) duringwhich activitieswill commenceinthe remaining16pilot villages.

ARP I11will fund technical assistance, community facilitators, NGO involvement, training, workshops
and study tours (for beneficiary farmers, MAFF staff, NGO partners and facilitators), computer
equipment, minor inputs for demonstration plots, and incremental operating costs in support o f the
following tasks:

         Continuedplanningand implementationo f SmallGroupActivities inthe 30 pilot villages;
         Follow-uptechnicalandmanagementtraining
         Technicalandmanagerialsupportto Village ImplementationTeams and Small Groups;
         Monitoringandevaluationofthe first pilots.

Fundingfor SmallGroup Grants for the 30 pilot villages is budgetedseparately under A W 11.

Activity 1.2. Expansion to New Villages (TFET Grunt only)

This activity will expand participatory development and natural resources management assistance to
about 20 new villages in the seven districts. Thus, the program will be expanded to cover about 50
villages-an average o f 7 per district.

The decisionto expand to new villages will be made following a detailed participatoryevaluationof the
first 30 pilots conductedby an external evaluator, which will be discussedat a nationalworkshop. At this
stage, the number of Districts could also be re-considered. MAFF's NRM Management Team will
prepare detailed terms of reference for this evaluation, which will include measurable indicators as
benchmarks for success. These will take into account the activities' physicalprogress, the adequacy o f
financial and management systems and their relatedtransparency, level of community participation,and
(as far as possible) the technical soundness o f the activities. This will determine the optimal number o f
new villages which can be supported before expanding. MAFF will then take into account lessons
learnedandrecommendedadjustmentsto the OperationalManual.

The projectwill fundtechnicalassistance, communityfacilitators,NGO involvement,training, workshops
and study tours, field vehicles, small group grants, minor agriculture inputs for smalldemonstrationplots,
and incrementaloperatingcosts in support ofthe followingtasks:

Implementation Responsibilities. The component is integrated into MAFF's Forestry and Fisheries
National Directorates - specifically the Divisions for Reforestation and Forest Rehabilitation, and
Fisheries Resources and Marine Environment.                  They will establish an NRM Management Team
responsible for overall management and decision-making, as well as for developing policies in support o f
community-based natural resources management. Inrecognition o f the need to broaden the component's
focus to include sustainable food crops and livestock management, MAFF will form an NRM Advisory
Committee with representatives from other MAFF Divisions (including Crop Production and Livestock),
other Government agencies, and selected NGOs and donors active in natural resource management.
Experience in other NRMprojects will be shared through this forum at bi-annual meetings, and relevant
members will be consulted on the technical aspects o f the activity plan approval. It is anticipated that
responsibility for the management and monitoring o f community-based activities will be passed to the
relevant MAFF divisions at project end to ensure they continue to receive the necessary support. MAFF
will also continue to engage an NRM Advisor and a Community Development Specialist to improve
participatory planning and provide training in community organization.

At the District level, implementation will carried out by a District Implementation Team headed by the
District Agricultural Coordinator. The district will also establish an NR7M Advisory Panel, consisting o f
staff from the District Administration, and representatives o f NGOs and donors active in NRM. This
panel will be responsible for selecting the pilot villages, and providing technical support and guidance.

Given the present scarcity o f trained extension workers, MAFF will continue to rely on contracted
facilitators to facilitate community activities. The facilitators (2 per district) will be selected following
improved procedures developed under ARP 11. Although quality recruits will be sought, facilitators are
likely to continue to need a high level o f support. MAFF will contract NGOs partners to supply and
manage facilitation services, as well as provide technical back-up to the community groups. A target o f 50
percent women facilitators has been set under ARP 11, and its effectiveness will be monitored
progressively. The facilitators will work as far as possible with the newly appointed Sub-District
Development Officers and Forest guardianExtension officers, who will also be trained in participatory
planning. At mid-term, the relative effectiveness o f using contracted facilitators, NGO partners, MAFF
and District Administration staff as service providers will be assessed. Recommendations will then be
made on a phase-out strategy for external facilitators aimed at maximizing the program's sustainability.

Village Selection. The criteria for the selection o f new pilot villages by District teams will be as follows:
         Preference will be given to villages with degraded natural resources;
     o Preference will be given to a mixture o fthe relatively poorest upland and coastal villages;
     o The potential contributiono fsustainable management o fthe resource to the development ofthe
         overall area;
         The potential o fthe locationto serve as a pilot (accessibility);
         Strong local leadership; and
     o Willingnessto contribute voluntary labor, land and locally available materials.

Small Group Selection Process.              A balanced number o f men's, women's and mixed farmer groups
(Small Groups) will be selected at the hamlet (aldeia) level, the most culturally and geographically
appropriate level for farmer collaboration in Timor-Leste. Approximately 5-8 Small Groups per village
(suco) will be selected, averaging 25-30 households each. Group formation may vary between villages,
with some electing to maintain existing groups (in the limited cases where they exist) or to form new
ones. The advantage o f forming new groups i s that the inclusion o f women and the poorest can be

promoted duringthe initial educationand informationcampaign whichwill establishprinciplesof gender
participation and benefit sharing. The project will establish a minimum o f one women-only group per
village to improve women's management and leadership skills. Village leaders (Village and Hamlet
heads and traditional leaders) will be encouraged to become group members to ensure support for
activities (a lesson learnt from ARP 11) but should not automaticallybecome group leaders unless elected
by their members. Small Group membershipwill be loosely defined for the initial planning and activity
identification, but then formalizedprior to activity implementation, where membershipmay be extended
to householdsnot thus far involved.Each group will elect a leader, treasurer and/or secretary to promote
transparency and accountability (see Annex 7). Previous ARP I1pilots benefited some 65 percent of the
village population; hence elite capture o f benefits is unlikely. At the village (suco) level, a Village
Implementation Team will be established to provide overall coordination and monitoring support.
Members will be nominated from each Small Group to ensure representativeness, with a minimum of
three womenper team.

Small Group Activity PlanDevelopment and ApprovalProcess.The SmallGroup Activity plans will
be geared towards solving problems o f resource management and vulnerability rather than overly
focusingon income generation -with the exceptionof productsthat people can store for times of scarcity
to strengthen food security. Project facilitators will raise environmental awareness, explain the project
criteria(includingthe voluntary natureo f land, local materials and local laborcontributions)and facilitate
data collection and participatory planning and proposal development at the Small Group level, using
Participatory Rural Appraisal methods. This process is further detailed in the OperationalManual and
trainingmanualfor communityfacilitators.

Small Group Activity plans will include a justification for the proposed activities relative to their
contributionto vulnerability reductionand improvedNRM;the inputsrequired; the communities in-kind
contributions; the expected outcomes; implementation responsibilities; maintenance and monitoring
plans; andmechanisms for distributingbenefits amongst group membersand ensuringsustainability. The
approvalprocessfor SmallGroup Activity plans is describedinFigure1below:

At each assessment stage, facilitators will assist the Small Groups in making any recommended
improvements to their activity plans. The District implementationteams will play an important role in
working with the communities and facilitators, and ensure that environmental and social mitigation
measures are taken into account (includingverifyingthat any landusedby the Small Groups is provided
voluntarily andagainst community-agreedcompensation).

Capacity Building. A major focus of Component 1 is to buildthe capacity of MAFF staff, facilitators,
and NGOs to identify and respond to farmers' needs. The project will assist farmers' groups in
identifyingproblems and potentialsolutions specific to their resource base, and developingthe technical
and organizationalskills to address them. Where technical capacity exists within MAFF, the project will
conduct Training of Trainers courses to help them transfer technical skills to facilitators, or directly to
farmers. MAFF's ResearchandExtensionDivisionwill help develop the trainingmaterials.

Where appropriate skills do not exist internally, MAFF will contract external trainers. A series of
technical manuals will be developed for the most common types of projects proposed by communities
(e.g. agro-forestry, nursery management, fish pond maintenance, vegetable gardens). The manuals will
include, amongothers, impact indicatorsspecificto each activity-such as survivalrates for seedlings, or
fish yield - and will be progressively updated based on lessons of experience in various geo-climatic
areas. The bulk of farmer training should be delivered directly to farmers within their own village
environment to avoid dilution of techniques and emphasize practical applications. Where promising
environmentalconservation or rehabilitationmeasures are identifiedby members of the advisory panels
but not included in the Small Groups Activity Plans, MAFF may introducethem to model farmers and
fund them as demonstration activities under a separate budget to the Small Group Grants. The project
will also organize study tours to enable new pilot communitiesto learn from successful sites. MAFF staff
and facilitators will be encouragedto attend key seminars on the principles of community-basedNRM
and `no regrets' adaptation. Where possible, invitationsto the various trainingevents will be extendedto
partnerNGOsto act either as resource persons or participants as part o f overallcapacity buildingefforts.


                 Component 2. Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management
                 1EC: 2.5 million: TFET: US$0.4million: CFET: US$0.5 million)

This component will support MAFF's program of strengthening rural communities' food security and
sustainable economic development in lowland, irrigated areas. The project will rehabilitate community
based irrigation schemes serving 3,000 hectares of irrigable land, and 150 kilometers of rural access
roads; rehabilitatethe major-damagedirrigationscheme in Manufahi(Caraulun) covering 1,030 hectares
o f irrigableland; and strengthenor establishabout 24 Water User Associations (WUAs). All together, the
component will target some 4,000 rural families, about 29 percent of the area in need of rehabilitation
under small irrigationschemes, and 27 percent o f the area covered by damaged large irrigationschemes
inTimor-Leste. Some 20 percent ofmembers of WUAs are expectedto be women.

Component 2 will be implemented by the Irrigationand Water Management Division o f MAFF. It will
includethe followingactivities:
             Community irrigationandroadsrehabilitation
             Major irrigationrehabilitation
          P Capacity buildingandWUA support

Activity 2.1. Community Irrigation and Roads Rehabilitation (EC Grant only)
The activity will follow the successful model o f community contracts started under ARP Iand ARP 11,
and now institutionalizedby MAFF.               Since rehabilitation o f community schemes is expected to be
required for several years, it would be gradually transferred to full government financing by project
conclusion. The EC Grantwill support 75%, 50% and25% ofthe costs o fthe schemes inyears 1to 3 of
the project, respectively, with the Government funding the corresponding balance.                The project will
finance   small civil works contracts with communities, technical audits of the works, and incremental
operating costs in supportofthis activity.

Rehabilitation of Community-based Irrigation Schemes. This activity will continue the rehabilitation
o f small-scale irrigation schemes under ARP Iand I1that has brought about 9,900 hectares back into
irrigated rice production. ARP I11will target further rehabilitation o f 3,000 hectares where productivity is
affected by structural failures inall 13 districts.
Local communities will carry out the remedial works directly, following the model developed under ARP
Iand 11, and in accordance with the Operation Manualfor Community Irrigation and Roads
Rehabilitation(which will be updated from time to time to incorporate lessons o f experience). The project
will sign a Memorandum o f Agreement for the identified works with community-designated entities, who
will be responsible for ensuring that the works are completed satisfactorily. The irrigation schemes will be
selected annually from the submissions made by the scheme representatives, after scrutiny at the District
level, and technical review by MAFF Irrigation staff. To ensure that rehabilitationworks start inthe early
part o f the dry season (May) the District Irrigation Officers will be encouraged to carry out early surveys
o f community proposals and maintain a pipelineo f plannedprojects for follow-up seasons.

To encourage ownership and sustainability, beneficiaries will be required to contribute part o f the total
rehabilitation costs either in materials or labor, the amount contributed on each sub-project increasing
gradually from 5% to 15% (or higher depending on experience). The overall procedures have been
successfully tested by MAFF over three seasons o f works, and are considered adequate for ARP I11(see
Annex 7). The project will also finance an independent technical audit o f community irrigation schemes
to provide lessons o f experience to MAFF from which to further strengthenimplementationstrategies.

Rehabilitation of Community-based Access Roads. This activity will target the rehabilitation of a
further 150 kilometers of minor access roads requiredby communities to link agricultural project areas
and irrigation schemes to national or district roads. Communities will rehabilitate the roads using the
same procedures for community contracting, payment and technical supervision as for the small irrigation
schemes.     The technical audit will include access roads rehabilitated under the project.

Activity 2.2. Major Irrigation Rehabilitation (EC Grant only)

Based on the detailed feasibility study carried out under ARP 11, this activity will rehabilitate the
Caraulun irrigation scheme in Manufahi District to provide controlled and equitable water supply to an
estimated 1,030 hectares o f land. In addition to civil works, the project will finance technical assistance,
engineering supervision services, and incremental operating costs.                  With project assistance in re-
establishing WUAs and MAFF extension inputs, the project should help ensure that farmers achieve rice
production levels o f 2.5 tons/hectare/crop by 2008 (from current levels o f 1.9 todhectare), and increase
their cropping intensity by producing two crops per year.

Due to the scope o f the works, MAFF will contract out the rehabilitation to a qualified contractor. The
head works and irrigation area i s located in Betano village which has an estimated population o f 3,930 or
810 households. Before the scheme was damaged by floods in December 2001, it had about 600 hectares
under cultivation, with two crops produced each year over an estimated 25% o f the area. About 14 Water
Users Associations were active in the scheme before 2002. The civil works required for rehabilitation
include the remodeling o f the head works with a new approach channel and gates, irrigation intake works
and repairs to structures and canals inthe project area, including rehabilitation o fthe main, secondary and
select tertiary canals and service roads within the Caraulun irrigation scheme. A detailed feasibility
study, including social, economic, and environmental analysis, was completedunder ARP 11.

A number o f preconditions must be fully satisfied before the works on Caraulun would be allowed to
proceed (see Annex 13). These preconditions include (i)            the issuance o f a Ministerial Order defining the
responsibilities o f the Government and communities for operation and maintenance o f irrigation schemes;
(ii) completion o f detailed topographic surveys, detailed designs, and bill o f quantities for Caraulun; (iii)

re-establishment of local WUAs and agreement on land use; and (iv) adequate staff allocations from
MAFF for construction supervision. Completion of these requirements would be necessary before the
civil works couldproceedand is a conditionfor disbursement underthe EC Grant Agreement. A detailed
actionplanfor these conditions is includedas an Attachment o fAnnex 13.

At present, the rehabilitation plan only envisages work on the main canals. Once WUAs are re-
established in Caraulun, iflocal farmers agree on the need for secondary or tertiary canals, they could
carry out the works under separate community irrigation Memorandaof Agreement, usingthe processes
adoptedunderthe Community IrrigationandRoadsRehabilitation.

Activity 2.3. Capacity Building and Water User Associations' Support (EC and TFET)

The project will establishone pilot WUA per district (for a total of 13 WUAs) in smallcommunity-based
irrigationschemes. The W A Swould be selected from amongstthe schemes targeted under ARP 111, as
well as those already rehabilitated under ARP 1-11, with a view of maximizing their success and
demonstrationvalue to other communitiesinthe district.

The projectwill also providefurther training and strengtheningto the 10 WUAs formed under ARP I1in
rehabilitated light-to-medium damaged irrigation schemes, and increase extension support to crop
production to stimulate improved productivity. Training will be provided in irrigation operation and
maintenance as well as general agriculturalproduction,ifrequired. A smallallocationhas beenbudgeted
for minor farm inputs (such as improvedseedvarieties) to helpthe WUAs optimizetheir yields. During
the first year, the project will also support the establishment of a network o f WUAs in Carulun. Four
WUA local consultants will be mobilized to this end, covering the East, West, Central and Caraulun
regions.

The project will finance vehicles, computer equipment, minor agricultureinputs, consultingservices, and
training, workshops and study tours, and incrementaloperating costs in support of this activity. ARP I11
will continue in-country training of MAFF staff in irrigation, focusing on design, construction
supervision, operation andmaintenance.


Activity 2.4. Survey and Mapping (TFET Grant only)

The project will contract a specialist survey firm to prepare detailed topographic surveys and mappingof
up to 12,500 hectares of land, covering the Caraulun major irrigation scheme, as well as the light- to
medium-damaged schemes rehabilitated under ARP Iand ARP I1 and selected community irrigation
schemes. The surveys will complementthe detailed feasibility study of Carauluncompletedunder ARP 11
by enablingdetailed designs for the commandareas. It will includefeatures such as roads, canals, drains,
bridges, tube wells, urbandevelopment areas, andthe location ofvillages.

                                 Component 3. Services to Farmers
                  (EC:  2.7 million; TFET: US$0.8million: CFET: US$0.7 million)

This component aims to strengthen and institutionalize MAFF's service delivery to farmers in three key
areas: (a) information services; (b) animal health services; and (c) agri-business support.

                  Sub-component 3.1. Information to Farmers (US1.4 million)

This sub-component aims to increase MAFF's capacity at the central and local levels to deliver timely
and relevant information to farmers, and foster two-way communication flows.

In a country where 34 percent of the population is illiterate,8 face-to-face information delivery is the
preferred option for communicating with farmers, followed closely by the use o f mass media such as the
national public broadcaster and community radios. Latest estimates indicate that 60,000 radio sets have
been distributed by various donors in Timor-Leste since 2000, covering some 450,000 people. Radio
stations are concentrated in Dili, but there i s now one operational community radio station per district.
Most o f them have a 30 kmradius transmitter, but their coverage varies depending on topography.

Farmers have consistently identified access to appropriate and timely information as a major need,
particularly in the present context where extension support is scarce. Better information also allows
communities to participate in the planning and implementation o f activities affecting their livelihood,
thereby increasing their sense o f ownership and the sustainability chances.

The project will support the following activities:

     o Information Programming
          Strengthening o f the CGIAR Liaison Secretariat
     o Pilot Community-BasedInformation ServiceNetwork
     o Agro-Meteorological Services

The sub-component will be implemented by the Research and Extension Center o f MAFF and will be
managed by the inter-sector Information Team established under ARP 11.

Activity 3.1.I.   Information Programming (EC and TFETGrants)

This activity will be a continuation o f the information programming activity supported under ARP 11,
drawing on lessons from the previous project. The project will finance communication equipment,
technical assistance, information programs and materials (including radio and television broadcasts),
training and workshops for MAFF staff and local consultants, and incremental operating costs in support
o f this activity.

Key problems with past farmer information programs in Timor-Leste have included late delivery; non-
responsiveness to farmer requests and feedback; irrelevant material; inappropriate communications
channel; unclear printed material; lack o f basic communication skills among MAFF staff; and weak
planning, implementation, and monitoring. The project will focus on strengthening these aspects. Prior to
implementation, the MAFF Information Team will incorporate lessons learned into a new
communications strategy, including an appropriate monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The team will
also re-establish an Information Forum to share past experiences with other partners involved in
information and communications programs (see Annex 6).

The project will support information campaigns that directly support other components and MAFF
activities. Information campaigns will emphasize face-to-face,                     participatory communications in
conjunction with paid community radio broadcasts, printed materials, television broadcasts, and mobile
audio-visual van demonstrations. Traditional approaches o f information delivery (i.e., farmer field days,
key farmers, village meetings, market days, Chefis do Suco, church groups, schools, and others), utilizing
available resources will be explored. This activity also aims to develop partnerships with other donors,
NGOs and groups that can assist with information dissemination and monitoring, effectively maximizing
options for face-to-face contact with farmers and allowing for external monitoring o f activities.

Activity 3.1.2 Support to CGIAR Liaison Secretariat (EC Grunt only)

This activity, already started under ARP 11, will help MAFF's CGIAR Liaison Secretariat develop a rapid
response system to provide agriculture staff -and            farmers-with     specific technical advice from CGIAR
and other international centers o f expertise. In a country with isolated rural communities and limited
Government resources, electronic links with these centers will become increasingly important.

The project will develop an easy-to-access repository o f most frequently asked questions and suggested
solutions for use by MAFF staff, NGOs and interested stakeholders. In addition to online access, the
database will be stored in Compact Disk and sent to the pilot community-based information service
network for further dissemination. The project will also finance cross visits between CGIAR experts and
MAFF staff, training, translation o f relevant CGIAR materials into local language and continuous access
to Internet. The CGIAR Liaison Secretariat will be assisted by an international advisor to be funded by
UNDPEC.

Cross-visits by MAFF staff to CGIAR or other centers o f expertise will adhere to a strict criteria which
will include approval of the Minister; clear identification o f the activity as a high priority on the Road
Map; short-term duration (Le., a 1-4 weeks); cost-efficiency; lack o f in-country opportunity; and an action
plan to link the result o fthe cross-visits to practical recommendations and MAFF programs upon return.

Activity 3.1.3 Pilot Community-Based Information Service Network (EC Grunt only,

This new activity aims to facilitate the information flow to and from the districts through point-to-point
communications usingaffordable technology. It will promote decentralization o f information services by
building capacity at the district level, effectively locating the information and communication sources
closer to farming communities. The technology is based on the well-documented and successful People
FirstNetwork e-mail system inthe Solomon Islands: as well as case studies documenting the potentialo f
community radio in rural areas and the increasing use o f internede-mail facilities by farmer groups. The
project will finance radio, office, computer and communications equipment, small works, training,
technical assistance and incrementaloperating costs insupport o f this activity.

The project will first introduce pilot community-based information services at the three selected
agriculture centers (likely to be the regional centers in Baucau, Same and Bobonaro). Each information
service network office-comprising            a secured room at or near the agriculture center -will          be equipped
with two desktop computers, software, e-mail facility, and peripherals. Due to the lack o fa reliable power




 - The  People First Network (PFnet) of the Solomon Islands is an e-mail systemthat permits remote locationson islands across
thousands of square kilometersin the Pacific Oceanto have access to Internete-mails usinga simple computer, short-wave radio,
and solar power. For more information,visit http://www.peodefirst.net.sb.

supply, the equipment will be powered by solar-power" and/or generators. Small works will likely be
requiredto increase security o f the equipment in these offices. An assessment of equipment needs was
completedat appraisaland is includedinMAFF's Project ImplementationPlanand detailed costtables.

The office and e-mail will be available to district agriculture staff and community radio staff, NGOs,
teachers, and farmers groups, on a regulateduse basis. The offices will be mannedby district agriculture
staff, where IT capacity is expected to grow with training inputs. The projectwill finance the short-term
inputs of an Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Specialist who will help assess the
most appropriate technology specifications and advise on a planfor cost recovery (based on payment for
services rendered) once a criticalmass of users is reached.Trained MAFF staffwill monitorthe use o f e-
mail and information dissemination activities. They will record the number and type of requests for
agricultural information, develop profiles of e-mail users, and monitor the number of agriculture radio
programs by community radios over time. The strategy will be to start with three pilot network offices,
and then evaluate at mid-termreviewto determine whether an expansionis warranted, as well as how the
services couldbe improved.

To overcome severe communication problems between MAFF and district agricultureoffices, the project
will also finance single-side band (SSB) radios connecting all 13 offices with Dili. These radios are
designed primarily for long range voice communications (whilst short-wave radios can be efficient for
data transmission but are not appropriate for rapid voice communication). The option of sharing radio
networkswith the Ministry of Healthhas been ruledout, as this network of fixed and mobile radios will
be restricted to health posts, district health managers and ambulances.and possibly the police on an
emergencybasis.

Activity 3.1.4. Agro-Meteorological Network (EC Grunt only)

At present, Timor-Leste lacks the means to collect agro-hydro-meteorological data on such basic
parameters as rainfall, temperature, humidity, evaporation, and stream water levels, which are key for
monitoring areas vulnerable to droughts and floods. They are also necessary for planning agricultural
programs: the design of irrigationsystems, for example, requires data on long-termrainfall patterns and
intensities.Under the Portuguesetimes, Timor-Lestehad64 rainfalland 7 climatology stations, butthese
fell out of use duringthe Indonesianoccupation. A feasibility analysis was conducted duringappraisalto
determine the scope and potentiallyrecommendedlocationsofthis network(detailso fthe analysis can be
found inMAFF's Project ImplementationPlan).

The project will support the re-establishment o f a national network of fully automated agro-
meteorologicalstations in the 8 major agro-ecologicalzones of Timor-Leste. This is expectedto include
12 meteorological stations and 20 automatic rain gauges to collect information such as rainfall, air
temperature, evaporation, relative humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, and soil temperature, and
four hydrological stations in major rivers, measuring water levels and rainfall (and therefore capturing
dataon highest discharges andbaseflows).

A short-termtechnicaladvisor will work with the AgricultureLandUse and GIS Unit at MAFF (ALGIS)
under the Research and Extension Center to assist in establishing the system and design simple data
collection and interpretationprocedures. The stations units will be re-establishedwhere possible in pre-
existingsites and in government land close to the District offices. For the meteorologicaland rain gauge
stations, the project will need to construct a small fenced area (about 9 m2)to protect the units against
vandalism. The project will finance small works, agro-meteorologicalequipment, consultant services,
trainingfor MAFF staff, and incrementaloperating costs insupport ofthis activity.

            Sub-component 3.2. Sustainable Animal Health Services (US$2.I million)

This sub-component -a continuation ofARP Iand I1- aims to provide sustainable animal health services
to the estimated 567,000 rural people living in households owning livestock. It will continue to support
essential annual vaccination campaigns, targeting 80 percent o f the pig, cattle, and buffalo population, as
well as some 500,000 chickens a year. It will also improve the cold chain network for vaccine storage,
and continue support to the Village Livestock Workers (VLW) program initiated under ARP 11.

MAFF's Livestock Division and District Livestock Officers will implement the activities. Both the
vaccination and the VLW programs have been institutionalized within the Ministry.

The project will include the following activities:
    o Vaccination Campaigns
    o ColdChain Improvement
         Village Livestock Workers
         Capacity Building

Activity 3.2.1. Vaccination Campaigns (EC and TFET Grants)

Project support for vaccination will continue under a three-year phasing-out formula (75% in the first
year, 50% in the second year, and 25% in the third year), with progressive transfer o f campaign financing
to MAFF. This will help ensure sustainability following project completion. The annual campaigns will
vaccinate about 300,000 pigs against Swine Fever, and up to 180,000 cattle and buffalo against
Hemorrhagic Septicemia and Brucellosis. They will also distributeNewcastle Disease chicken vaccine to
200,000 farming families. District Livestock Officers and VLWs will train lay vaccinators at the village
level to administer this vaccine three times per year. The project could also help support vaccination
against emerging new animal diseases that are judged to pose public health concerns. Communities will
be encouraged to build small corrals to facilitate the vaccination campaigns. The project will finance
vehicles, vaccines, the costs o f vaccination campaigns and monitoring, and incremental operating costs in
support o f this activity.

Activity 3.2.2. Cold Chain Improvement (EC Grant only)
Inthe past, vaccine quality has beenunderminedby frequent power outages inthe districts, which operate
the refrigeration (cold storage) network. The project will seek to maintain the quality o f veterinary
vaccines by procuring solar-powered refrigerators for 37 sub-districts and 13 districts. Replacement o f
cold boxes will also improve transport across mountainous terrain between sub-district cold storage and
vaccination sites.

Activity 3.2.3. Village Livestock Workers (EC and TFET Grants)
This activity will continue to support the VLW Program, a privatized village livestock service modified
from a similar program in Cambodia. ARP I1supported the training o f 200 Village Livestock Workers.
Under ARP 111, an additional 65 VLW will be trained (of which 5 percent are expected to be women).
Together, the 265 trained VLWs are expected to cover all districts at a rate o f 2 VLWs per three villages,
providing simple treatment and advice at cost to livestock owners across the country. The project will
finance veterinary equipment and medications, consulting services, training, workshops and cross visits,
 and incremental operating costs insupport o fthis activity.

MAFF Livestock staff, assisted by an internationaladvisor and qualified NGOs, will provide starter kits,
refresher training, and technical and monitoring support to the VLWs in the field. MAFF will also help
 establish a VLW Association to certify and support its members, procure replacement medications, and



 Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    46

handle disciplinary matters. The VLWs will operate on a privatizedfee-for-services basis, and may be
contracted by MAFF to carry out vaccinations and other MAFF-directed programs. Monitoring and
evaluation of the VLW program will be stressed throughout implementationto strengthen the program
progressivelybasedon lessons learned.


Activity 3.2.4 Capacity Building (EC and TFETGrants)

The project will support capacity building for MAFF Livestock Division staff, District Livestock
Officers, andtheir LivestockNetworkpartners. Identifiedareas for further in-countrytraining include:(i)
epidemiology to support the VLW program, (ii)community-based forage and legume development to
backstop upland villages; (iii)abattoir management; and (iv) annual membership to the Office
Internationale des Epizooties (OIE) and attendance o f annual meetings o f OIE Southeast AsianFoot and
Mouth Disease sub-commission (SEAFMD). The project will provide computer and office equipment,
training, workshops andstudy tours, and incrementaloperating costs in support ofthis activity.

                Sub-component 3.3. Support to Agri-Businesses (US$0.6 million)

This sub-component aims to strengthen and institutionalizeMAFF's agri-business advisory services, in
support of rural producer organizations (a key priority under the Stability Program). The project will
promote key niche markets by targeting about 1,200-1,500 seed growers and 210 farming families
involvedin candlenut and coconut oil production,and continue to provide advisory services to emerging
ruralproducer organizations.

The sub-componentwill be implementedby the FoodCropsDivisionofMAFF.

The projectwill support three key activities


    o Supportto SeedProducers
         Support to Candlenut andCoconut Processors
         Support to RuralProducerOrganizations

Activity 3.3.1. Support to Seed Producers (TFET Grant only)

InTimor-Leste,rice farmers do not use certifiedseeds; they store their ownseeds from previous harvests.
Becauseofthe repeateduseofthe same variety, the seeds lackvigor resultingin low germinationand low
resistance to disease. Procurement of imported certified seeds was attempted by A W I1 under the
AgricultureService Centers, butthis was unsuccessfuldue to highprices and low germinationrates.

The project will build upon existing partnerships with the ACIAR-funded Seeds for Life Project, GTZ,
the Agriculture Service Center in Bobonaro and the InternationalRice Research Institute(IRRI) to help
establisha SeedProducerAssociationin the mainrice growingareas o f Timor-Leste,and train about 30-
45 seed growers. MAFF will organize training, delivery of the initial registered seeds and minor
agricultureinputsto the target farmers.

Rice seed growers in Bobonaro district are expected to use local machinery. However, this may not be
available in more remote rice growing areas such as Viqueque. In that case, the project would help
procure a set of rice seed productionmachinery (thresher, grain cleaner, and dryer), to be providedto a
suitable organized farmers' group with a lease-to-ownoption. This would be carefully considered to
avoid setting a precedent that could compete with micro-credit schemes. Marketing of the seeds is
expectedto be facilitatedthroughexistingoutlets (such as the AgricultureService Center inBobonaro).



Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -ProjectAppraisal Document, October 7, 2004    41

While the initial emphasiswill be on rice seeds, the scope of this component also allows MAFF to assist
corn seed or other priority grain seed producers. Target seed producers will be selected amongst those
with extensive experience, in consultationwith community leaders. MAFF will develop guidelines for
the selection o f seed producers andtarget locations, as well as any productionagreements.

The project will provide technical assistance, seed processing equipment and machinery, training of
farmers and o f MAFF staff (to assist seed producers), and incremental operating costs in support of this
activity.

Activity 3.3.2. Support to Priority Niche Market Commodities (EC Grant only)

A niche market study for Timor-Lesteis currently being carriedout with assistance fromthe World Bank.
Inaddition, GTZ will be financinga feasibility study on candlenutandcoconut oil processing. Basedon
the results of these studies, MAFF is expected to help promote the most promising niche market
commodities by providingspecializedtechnicalassistance, training, and equipmentto key farmer groups.
Experience with the Agriculture Service Centers in ARP Iand I1 points to the need to reach critical
economies of scale inquantities traded, as well as controlquality.

Two promisingniche markets in the districts of Viqueque and Lautemare coconut and candlenut oil. To
encourage value-added production and help generate local employment in these remote districts, the
project will help establishabout 6 small village type coconut oil mills and 6 candlenut oil mills, with an
individual productioncapacity estimated at 16-48 liters of oil per day. This task will be carried out in
partnership with GTZ, who is financing the initial feasibility study and could support future farmer
training in Viqueque. The feasibility study will determine the economic viability and market outlet for
the oil mills. Village mill operators will be trained on the oil processing, operation and maintenance.
Dependingon the resultsofthe study, the smallmills will be providedeither to a large established farmer
association, or directly to farmer operators with a lease to buy option, under clearly agreed terms. Short
term specialists inoil millandoil processingwill assist MAFF inthis activity.

The project will finance technical assistance, small works, agro-processing equipment, training of
farmers, and incrementaloperating costs insupport ofthis activity.

Activity 3.3.3. Support to Rural Producers' Organizations (EC Grant only)
This activity will support the institutionalizationof agri-business support services within MAFF, to help
strengthen rural producer organizations, and coordinate agri-business support. The activity will extend
MAFF advisory andtrainingsupport beyondthe Agriculture Service Centers supportedunder ARP 1-11to
marketing and farmer organizations supported by AusAID, CIDA, FAO, GTZ, JICA, OTI, and
UNDPLJNOPS. To share lessons o f experience, MAFF will establish an Agri-Business Consultative
Group with interestedpartners.

Advisory and training support to Farmers Organizations will be based on demand, and will cover
primarily the following areas:          (i)association formation, operation, and management, (ii)business
planningand feasibility preparation, (iii)market analysis, (iv) business operation and management, (v)
financial management, reportingand auditing. The project will finance office and computer equipment,
trainingandworkshops, technical assistance, and incrementaloperatingcosts insupport ofthis activity.

To prevent potential conflicts of interest between its regulatory and operationalroles, the Agri-Business
Support Services will focus primarily on advising non-governmental or private Rural Producer
Organizations, and its role is expectedto becomeprogressivelyregulatoryinthe future.

                           Project Component 4. Program Management
                 (EC:  1.6million: TFET: US$0.6million: CFET: US$0.2million)

This component will continue to assist MAFF in developing key organizational and sectoral policies,
build further core skills amongst MAFF staff and their partners, and integrate ARP management fully
within MAFF's organizationalstructure.

The project will includethe following sub-components:

        Policy and Strategy Development; and
        ProjectManagementand Capacity Building.

  Sub-component 4.1. Policy and Strategy Development (US$0.5million, EC and TFET)

Among the most highly sought ARP I1activities were its policy and strategy studies. ARP I11will extend
this support to enable MAFF to develop priority organizational, agriculture, rural development and
natural resources policies and strategies, under its new Policy, PlanningandProgram Servicesunit.

The project will continue to provide the services of a Senior Agriculture Policy Advisor and Legal
Advisor. In addition, it will support about four policy and strategy studies. To ensure flexibility and
responsiveness to evolving needs, the subject of the studies will be confirmed further during
implementation.At present, they are envisagedto include (a) support to MAFF's Long-Term Strategy; (b)
a Community-Based Natural Resources Management study; (c) Livestock Industry Development; (d)
Agriculture LandUse Policy; and (e) a Fisheries study. The studies will be prioritised based on MAFF
management priorities, value added relative to other donor support, contribution to the ARP exit strategy
(e.g. the extent to which they will help prepare a follow-up operation), and the willingness of the
proponentDivisions to provide counterpartassistance.

MAFF will contract out high calibre policy advisors to manage the studies. Policy development would
require extensive consultations with stakeholders (agriculture donors, key government departments,
NGOs, district governments, farmer groups, and the church, among others). It is expectedthat the MAFF
will adopt the relevant policy recommendations and integratethese into its policies and regulations. The
project will finance technical assistance, studies, surveys and workshops insupport of this activity.

                Sub-component 4.2. Project Management and Capacity Building
                                      (US1.9million, EC and TFETGrants)

This sub-component will provide overall project management and coordination. It will also support
capacity building of MAFF staff to increase their skills on relevant technical and management topics.

Program management will be coordinated by the ARP Project Director who is currently the Permanent
Secretary o f the Department of Agriculture and Livestock. The MAFF ManagementTeam, consisting of
the National Directors ofthe three MAFF departments andthe Directors of Divisions involved inproject,
will continue to provide overall policy and decision-making to facilitate project implementation. To
ensure sustainability, the Project ManagementUnit establishedunder ARP Iand I1will be abolished, and
the project will be absorbed into the existing structure of MAFF. Incremental operating costs will be
progressivelyfinancedby MAFF at an increasingrate of 25% inyear 1to 75% inyear 3.

EquipmentReplacement. The project will provide minor replacement of computer equipment, vehicles,
and furnishings for District Agriculture Offices, Regional Offices and the central MAFF office. To

improve office equipment maintenance, the project will also hire a full time Information Technology
Specialist.

Management Training. MAFF staff continue to require skill improvements in key technical and
management areas. A Training Plan has been completed for the project. In addition to farmers and
technicaltrainingalready budgetedunder each component, the planidentifiesthe needfor furthertraining
in procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, and overall management. The
Training Plan also includes provision for attendance by MAFF senior staff at priority international
conferences or short-termcourses not available in-country. The status o f training will be assessedevery
six months andtrainingcourseswill be continuedor revisedbasedon the results.

Core Support for Project Management. The Project Director and MAFF Management Team will be
assisted by a full time Project Management Advisor in day-to-day project operations, a Procurement
Advisor and a Financial Management Advisor, who will work with their respective government
counterparts under the Finance and Budget Support Services Unit of MAFF. MAFF's Monitoring and
EvaluationOfficer (already trainedunder ARP 11) will be responsible for the monitoringand evaluation
of project activities, assisted by short-term monitoring and evaluation specialists at key stages of the
project(benchmark study, mid-termreview,and final evaluation).

Insupport ofthis sub-component,the projectwill finance office andcomputerequipment andfurnishings,
vehicles, workshops, training and study tours, technical assistance services, annual project audits, and
incrementaloperating costs.

                             Technical Annex 6: Implementation Arrangements

                      TIMOR-LESTE: Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) will be the executing and implementation
agency for the project. This is the thirdARP projectexecutedby MAFF and its predecessor,the Division
of AgricultureAffairs. The projectwill therefore benefitfrom accumulatedimplementationexperience.

ARP I11will be implemented at three levels: at the village level, by rural communities and farmers'
groups; at the district level, by the District and RegionalAgricultural Offices and their partners such as
nongovernmentalorganizations(NGOs) andprivatesuppliers (e.g.Village LivestockWorkers); and at the
centrallevel, by MAFF Departmentsand Divisionsresponsible for the activities. Project implementation
will be "embedded" into MAFF's organizationalstructure (see Figure 1). This was judged to be the most
efficient arrangement to ensureownership andsustainabilityof projectactivities.

Lessons learned from ARF' Iand I1point to a need to strengthen inter-sectoralcollaborationamongst
MAFF Divisionsto ensure that services to rural communities are integrated and demand-driven. It also
identifieda needto strengthencoordinationacross all levels -with other donors, NGOs and development
partners, other governmentdepartments, and betweenDili-basedand district-basedagriculture staff.ARP
I11 will seek to strengthen these aspects: it will organize formal inter-sectoral teams and periodic
consultation meetings to strengthen links between MAFF divisions, as well as facilitate partnership
groups with NGOs, academic institutions and donors working on specific topics - such as natural
resource managementor agriculturalpolicy (see Section C). This should contributeto further sharing of
lessons of experience amongst MAFF development partners.

MAFF currently has 180staffat the national and district levels. It expectsto recruit an additional81 staff
in 2004-05, bringing the total number to 261. Many staff have undergone short-termmanagement and
technical training under past donor-funded projects. However, their capacity needs to be strengthened
further to ensure sustainability.         An initial capacity analysis was completed at appraisal, matching
existingstaff and skillswith projectneeds, and assessingthe technicalassistance requirements(See Table
2). This analysis identifiedareas for further institutionalstrengthening and training. Giventhe needto
strengthen coordinationamongst MAFF divisions, it is a matter of concern that the NationalDirectorate
of Forestry, and the Divisions of Livestock and Irrigation have been temporarily moved to a different
buildingfrom other MAFF Divisions, due to lack of space. This will needto be monitoredvery closely,
with the objectiveof regroupingthe Ministry in an alternativebuildingas soon as possible.

Another great challenge faced by MAFF is its ability to coordinate the vast donor program in agriculture
and rural development, amounting to close to US$14million in FY04 - close to 8 times the level of its
public expenditures (US$1.8 million). ARP I11 seeks to address this by working on MAFF's priority
programs from within, effectively supplementing the Ministry's scarce budget. It will also help the
Ministry develop a long-termstrategy where donor-fundedprogramswill be closely alignedwith sectoral
priorities(see Annex 1).
To enhanceMAFF's implementationcapacity, the project will continueto engage long-termtechnicaland
management advisors in the areas of natural resources management, community-driven development,
irrigation, communication, livestock, agri-business, project management, financial management, and
procurement. Short-term technical experts will also be contracted for specialized areas. These technical
assistance requirements are summarized in the capacity analysis (Table 2). MAFF will evaluate all
internationaladvisors quarterly to determine their effectiveness at skill transfer to local counterparts. In
addition, the project will seek to improve the English language skills of middle level management to
strengthentheir ability to negotiate with donors, access critical global informationand communicate with
internationalexperts.




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    54

The project will continue to invest heavily on improving MAFF's capacity for project planning,
implementation, and monitoring, as well as providing technical training according to needs. MAFF
prepared a detailed Training Plan for each component as part of the Project ImplementationPlan. To
improve the effectiveness o f training, MAFF will develop training evaluationprocedures and invest in
refresher trainingwith immediateapplicationonthe ground.

Inadditionto technicalassistanceandtraining, MAFF stafflimitationswill be addressedthrougha higher
relianceon NGOs and private partners, such as VLWs and facilitators, as well as community groups to
carry out natural resource management and irrigationand roads rehabilitation. The growing capacity o f
these groups as partners are expectedto be assessedperiodicallyduringthe projectreviews.

ARP I11is expectedto bejointly financed by the EuropeanCommission(EC) andthe Trust Fundfor East
Timor (TFET). Similarly to TFET, EC funds would be managed by the International Development
Agency (IDA) and executed by MAFF, although under separate Grant Agreements. Hence, project
financial, procurement, and reporting will follow Government and IDA procedures. The financial
management, procurement, and monitoringand evaluation systems establishedunder ARP IandI1will be
further enhancedbasedonpast experience.


A. Project Organization

The project will be implementedat three major levels, as outlinedbelow.

1. Rural Communities

ARP I11will continue to strengthenthe ARP I1strategy for participatorydevelopment. This will involve
(i)SmallGroupGrantstouplandandcoastalcommunitiesunderComponent1; (ii)direct civilworks
contracts with communities in lowland areas to rehabilitate irrigation schemes and access roads; (iii)
extendingthe Village LivestockWorkers programto cover all villages inTimor-Leste; and(iv) supportto
seed producers and priority niche market processors. Farmers groups and individuals (in the case of
VLWs) will implement these activities, assisted by facilitators, partner NGOs and MAFF staff at the
central and district levels.ARP I11will target existingfarmers groups or, if they do not exist, encourage
their establishment accordingto the most appropriate socio-economic units: sub-village (aldeia) small
farmers' groups are targeted under component 1, whilst Water Users Associations will be targeted under
component 2.

MAFF will engage civil society groups in the monitoring of project activities. The experience with
community-basedactivities will be discussedwith other donors implementingsimilar programs, such as
AusAID, GTZ, Portugal, UNOPs, Oxfam, CARITAS and CIDA. MAFF's Forestry Directorate is
currentlyestablishing a networkto share lessonsof experience innatural resourcesmanagement.

The capacity of community small groups to undertake natural resource management activities (under
Component 1) varies substantiallyacross villages. In general, the mid-termreview of ARP I1concluded
that technical support to community groups needed to be increased. ARP I11 has taken this
recommendation on board: it will strengthen the technical training o f community groups, and prepare
technicalmanuals for the most frequently selectedactivities.

ARP Iand I1 demonstrated the ability of communities to act as contractors in rehabilitating small
irrigationand access roads. The first technicalaudit -conducted inmid-2002- identifiedsome technical
weaknesses andrecommendedthat MAFF revisitcommunity schemes periodically to assess those inneed
of further assistance. As a result, MAFF providedextra support to about 15 percent of the schemes
previouslyassisted. This processof revisitingtechnicallyweak communities will continue inARP 111.



Timor-LesteThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    55

2. District and Sub-District Level

MAFF's District Agricultural staff will provide technical backstopping and coordinate the
implementation o f project activities at the community and district levels. There are presently an average
o f six staff under the coordination o f a District Agricultural Coordinator, including a District Irrigation
Officer, a District Livestock Officer, a District Crops Officer, a District Forestry Officer, and a District
Fisheries Officer. However, MAFF plans to optimize the deployment o f field staff by creating three
regional extension offices (in Baucau, Manufahi, and Bobonaro), though the precise staff assignation is
still being discussed.

District officers will be responsible for specific components, in close collaboration with MAFF central
divisions. For example, Component 1 will be the joint responsibility o f Forestry and Fisheries Officers,
with other staff assisting on an as-needed basis. Animal Health Services are the responsibility o f
Livestock Officers, and Irrigation Rehabilitation the responsibility o f Irrigation Officers. The District
Agricultural Coordinator will be responsible for ensuring integration o f activities in the district, as well
as for monitoring and reporting.

The District Agriculture Officers should coordinate closely with other partners active at the district level-
NGO partners, church organizations, other donors, and Sub-District Development Officers (SDOs). The
newly deployed SDOs, who are expected to work at the grassroots level, could facilitate the linkages
between project beneficiaries and MAFF implementers, though their specific responsibilities need to be
defined further when the new Autonomy Law comes into effect.

3. Central MAFF Departments and Divisions
MAFF has three national Directorates headedby National Directors under a Permanent Secretary, as well
as twelve technical divisions headed by Directors. The different components o f ARP I11 will be
implemented by the Divisions that are responsible for the associated programs in MAFF (see Table 1).
These same Divisions have implemented ARP I1 and their staff are already familiar with the
implementation procedures. They will be assisted by technical advisors whose terms o f reference have
been expanded to include specialist advice to MAFF management on their areas o f expertise (Le. not only
confined to project activities).

B. Project Implementation Arrangements
In ARP Iand 11, a Project Management Unit (PMU) was established to manage project implementation.
This will be dissolved in ARP I11 and project management will be fully integrated into MAFF's
organizational structure. Overall coordination will remain the responsibility o f the Project Director,
currently the Permanent Secretary o f MAFF. H e will be supported by an international Project
Management Advisor. Based on the implementation experience in ARP 11, a Deputy Project Director
may also be appointed to carry out day-to-day project management on behalf o f the Project Director. The
Project Director will retain full signatory and supervisory authority over all MAFF units and staff
involved inthe project.

The ARP Management Team o f ARP 11, consisting o f MAFF National Directors and Division Directors,
will continue to be responsible for overall implementation achievements and decision-making.

MAFF's Finance Officers, trained under ARP 11, will handle the project's financial management with the
support o f newly recruited financial staff and a full-time international Financial Advisor.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and quarterly reporting will be the responsibility o f MAFF's M&E
Officer with support o f an Assistant M&EOfficer and the internationalProject Management Advisor.

MAFF's Procurement and Tender Services Unit will continue to be assisted by an international
procurement advisor, working together with a full-time Procurement Officer and a contracted
Procurement Specialist.         The suitability of these arrangements will be monitored closely during
supervision- if found lacking, IDA will seek assurances from the CentralProcurement Office that they
will seconda qualifiedprocurement officer to MAFF (see Annex 8)

Activities formerlyunder the PMUwill now be institutionalizedwithinthe appropriateMAFF units:

e     Coordination and supervision of component implementation will be transferred to the MAFF
      ManagementTeam, underthe oversight ofthe ProjectDirector.

e     Monitoring of field activities will fall under the responsibility of the respective MAFF Divisions.

      communication betweenthe project's stakeholders.

L.
fi    Collaboration and Partnership Arrangements

A key lesson from ARP Iand I1 is the need for MAFF Divisions to collaborate more closely in
community-based activities such as Components 1 and 2, as well as in information dissemination. In
addition, collaborationbetween MAFF and development partners at the national and district levels has
remained informaluntil now. MAFF started to implement community-basedactivities, but it could gain
further from lessons of experiences accumulated by internationalNGOs (such as ETADEP, Yayasan
HAK, FAT), and other donor-funded development projects (such as GTZ, JICA, AusAID, ACIAR,


Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004               57

CIDA, FAO, UNDPLJNOPS, etc.).                Most internationalNGOs, for example, already participate in a
Sustainable LivelihoodForum, andMAFF has startedliaisingwith NGOs, particularlyinnaturalresource
management activities. ARP I11will seek to further strengthen collaboration with these partners and
formalize networks where lessons of experienceandinformationcouldbe shared.

1. MAFF Inter-Sectoral Teams
Under ARP 111, the following inter-sectoralteamswill be strengthened:
    o NRMImplementationTeam (withassistancefrom stafffrom Crop ProductionandLivestock, in
         additionto ForestryandFisheries)
         Irrigation Team (with assistancefrom stafffrom CropProduction)
    o Information Team (with participation of staff from key Divisions involved in information
         programs)
         Training Team
These teams will need to be formally designated with a team leader, clear terms of reference, work
schedule, and stafftime allocation. Their effectivenesswill be monitoredduringprojectimplementation.

2. PartnershipGroups
MAFF Divisionshave committedto formthe followingnetwork groups with interestedpartners:
    o A PolicyAdvisoryGroup,ledby MAFF's Policy,PlanningandProgramServices.
         NRMAdvisory Committee,ledby the ReforestationandForest RehabilitationDivisionandthe
         Divisionof FisheriesandMarineResources.
         An Irrigation Network,ledby the IrrigationDivision
         An InformationForum,ledby the ResearchandExtensionCenter
    o A LivestockNetwork,ledby the LivestockDivision
         An Agri-Business Consultative Group,ledby stafffrom the Crop ProductionDivision.
These partnership groups will meet at least bi-annually to exchange information and lessons learned.
Their levelo factivity will be monitoredunderthe project.

3. Collaborationwith International Research Organizations
Under ARP I1 and the Seeds for Life Program, MAFF has established contacts with several CGIAR
centers and specialized organizations. Several cross visits of CGIAR experts to Timor-Leste, and
Timorese staff to the centers have taken place, andthis collaborationwill continue under ARP 111. Inthe
Support to Agri-business sub-component,MAFF is also expectedto partner with IRRI, andACIAWSeeds
for Life in obtainingrice foundationseeds. Inaddition, the LivestockDivision has proposedmembership
for Timor-Leste in the Office Internationaledes Epizootics (OIE) and its regional Southeast Asian Foot
andMouthDisease Sub-commission(SEAFMD).
Ultimately,the project's sustainability will be measured by the degree to which activities are integrated
into MAFF programs and delivered effectively to farmers. Special attention will therefore be paid to
impact and quality aspects, using a programmatic approach that relies on learning-by-doing, periodic
evaluations, and subsequent adjustments. Two key activities - vaccination and community irrigation -
will be progressively transferred to MAFF financing as the project evolves. Other activities will be
supported by increasing shares o f counterpart operational funds to help ensure effective
institutionalization.

          Technical Annex 7: Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements

                         TIMOR-LESTE: Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project


A.     Financial Management Assessment
MAFF's Budget Services Unit will be responsible for the overall financial management of the project.
This permanent MAFF Unit is a natural successor of the Project Management Unit (PMU) first
established in 2000 for ARP Iimplementation. Accounting, internal controls and audit procedures for
ARP I11will thus be a continuationof systems which have evolved and been progressively strengthened
over the last three years. The financial management o f ARP projects has been supervised regularly in
accordance with IDA procedures.             Problems arising have been adequately identified and corrective
actions followed up during supervision missionand documented inproject files. Procedures and controls
of project expenditures are set out in a Manual of FinancialProcedures which is updated as required.
These procedureshave also beenincorporatedinto the ProjectImplementationPlanfor ARP 111.

The Budget ServicesUnit consists ofthree Timorese staff, assistedby a part-timeFinancialAdvisor. The
Financial Advisor undertakes all the tasks o f a Chief Financial Officer of a project or an entity. In
preparationfor ARP 111,the FinancialAdvisor will becomeavailablefulltime as ofmid-October2003.

Past problems in financialmanagementhave included: (i)modificationsand improvements necessary to
make accounting systems responsive to the requirements o f Freebalance (the accounting software
adopted by the Government for uniform application); (ii)lack of an adequate register of fixed assets
financedby ARP funds and periodic physicalverification of assets; (iii)              modificationsnecessary inthe
budget procedures to enable each project component manager to follow expenditures against the funds
allocated for each component; (iv) inadequate follow up of financial management procedures at
Agriculture Service Centers; (v) delays in conforming to IDA'S recent requirements for quarterly
FinancialMonitoringReports(FMRs) and(vi) inadequateattentionto trainingof Timorese financial staff.
Since the arrival o f FinancialAdvisor in February 2003, these issues are beingaddressed in a systematic
manner. The conversion o f the FinancialAdvisor to full-time basis is expectedto further accelerate the
process.

Project funds will be utilizedeither by direct payments, or through a Special Account at a local Bank,
which will be replenishedperiodically by IDA. MAFF will open and manage separate Special Accounts
for the TFET andEC grants.Directpaymentswill generally be for larger paymentswhich exceed20 % of
the authorized allocation for a Special Account. The Budget Services Unit will be responsible for
managementof the SpecialAccount inaccordancewith IDA procedures and as indicatedunder SectionE
below. All payments to suppliers of goods and services and beneficiaries will be effectedby the Budget
Services Unit in accordance with established procedures, includingapprovals of expenditures by MAFF
managersresponsible for the projectcomponents.

The Budget Services Unit maintains an adequate accounting system to record project resources and
expenditures. The system has now been designed to generate data required for inputting in the
computerizedGovernment accountingsystem(Freebalance).

Annual financial statements of ARP Iand I1have beenpreviously auditedby an internationalfirm (Ernst
& Young, Darwin)with no significantirregularitiesor issues as regardsfiduciary accountabilityreported.
The latest audit report for year ended June 2002 contains an unqualified(clean) audit opinion. Several
recommendationsfor strengtheningo f internalproceduresare beingaddressed.




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004       65

FinancialMonitoring Reports (FMRs). The Finance Unit is now able to produce quarterly FMRs for
ARP I1in accordance with IDA guidelines. Ifthe FMRs under ARP I11are considered acceptable (and
providedother requirements for adequacy o f financialmanagementfor the projectare satisfied), IDA may
allow an optionfor the Governmentto switchARP I11disbursementsonthe basisof quarterly FMRs.
Based on the above and a specific assessment undertakenfor ARP 111,and taking into account the agreed
corrective actions agreed, overall financial management systems and procedures are considered
satisfactory and adequatefor implementation of theproject.

8. Financing Arrangements by Component
The flow of funds andfinancingarrangements by componentare describedbriefly below.
Component 1 Pilot Participatory Developmentand Natural Resources Management
                  -
The financial and accountingprocedures for this component will follow the process pilotedunder ARP I1
and the Operational Manual for ARP Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management.
Payments under Small Group Grants for approved Small Group Activity plans will be in three
installments: an advance o f up to 30 percent, an intermediary payment upon verification of progress of
activities, and a final payment upon verification o f successful completion.Periodic monitoringwill take
place to ensure compliancewith financial reportingrequirements.The flow of funds and accountabilities
for processingthe SmallGroupAgreements is shown inFigure 1below.

Component 2       -Irrigation    Rehabilitation and Management
Community-basedcontracts will use the established procedures developed under ARP 11. Memorandum
ofAgreements (MOAs) will be signedbetweenthe Project Directorand a well-respectedrepresentative of
the community undertakingthe works, selectedby the beneficiaries themselves (insome cases, this could
include a member of the Church or NGOs, depending on communities' preference). The MOAs will be
signed in the presence of community witnesses. The MOA will stipulate a mobilizationadvance of not
more than 20 percent of the contract value. A 30 percent intermediarypayment will be done based on
certification o f progress billings by MAFF irrigationconstructionsupervisions or, if sufficient capacity
exists, the district irrigationofficer, reviewedby the Head o fthe IrrigationDivision and approved by the
ProjectDirector.The final and full payment (50 percent) will only be made upon full completionof the
works, certified, reviewed and approved in the same manner as the intermediary payment. The MOA
accounts and weekly financial reports will be displayed publicly on a notice board at the community
level. In addition, MAFF will undertake periodic technical audits of the community works. Upon the
final payment o f the community contract, MAFF and the community will sign a Memorandum of Turn-
Over which states that MAFF officially turns over, and the community correspondingly accepts,
responsibilityfor the O&M of the rehabilitatedirrigationfacilities or access roads. These procedures are
detailedinthe final Operation Manualfor Community Irrigation and Roads Rehabilitation.

For larger irrigation works, payment will be in accordance with the terms stipulated in the contract.
Followinga standardmobilizationpayment, periodicpayments will be based on certification of progress
billings signed by Project Supervisors, e.g., the consulting firm engaged to supervise the works, and
MAFF Irrigationstaff. The certification will be reviewedby the Director o f the IrrigationDivision, and
approved by the Project Director. Such progress billing shall include, among others, a detailedphysical
accomplishment report. The final payment shall be done upon 100 percent completiono f the works as
certified, reviewed and approved in the same manner as the progress billings. All payments shall be
subjected to 5 percent retention. The total amount retained shall be paid to the Contractor when the
Defects Liability Period, which will be definedineach contract, has passedand all defects that havebeen
notifiedto the Contractor have beencorrected. All other details specifyingpayment shall be stipulated in
each specificcontract.

Component 3 Servicesto Farmers
                 -
This component will fund informationto farmers, sustainable animal health services and agri-business
support services.
3.1. Information to Farmers. Paymentsfor informationcampaigns, informationequipment, and CGIAR
Liaison Secretariat's technical assistance will be inaccordance with terms specified in contracts.

3.2. Sustainable Animal Health Services. Payment to private vaccinators for the implementationof
vaccination campaigns will follow the system institutedduring ARP 11. Each District Livestock Officer
will complete a standard budget estimate, detailing requirements for fuel, transport, materials, and
contracting of private vaccinators (usually 8-12 per district). A 20 percent advance for vaccination
expenses will be paidto a Campaign Coordinator (usually the District LivestockOfficer) in the form of
an `Imprest' for which he has to retire all documents. As the work progresses and accounts are retired,
further payments will be made. Periodicpaymentsto vaccinators will be made based on the certification
by the Coordinator,and confirmedby the Headof the LivestockUnit as to the quantityand quality of the
work done. ARP I11 will also introduce also a new system of vouchers requiring the signature or
thumbprintof animalowners for all vaccinated livestock.

3.3. Agri-business Services. MAFF will procure the equipment, farming inputs, services and small
works required by this sub-component. Payment will be made upon submission o f invoices, purchase
orders or contracts. During implementation, MAFF will explore the best way to provide a set of seed
production machinery and village based oil mills to target beneficiary groups, avoiding potential
inconsistencies with micro-credit schemes. Options include (a) providing it to an established farmers
organization, such as the Agriculture Service Center or a church group; or (b) providing it directly to
farmers' groups on a lease-to-buy option.

Component 4     -  ProgramManagement
Payment for experts' services under the Program Management component will be in accordance with the
terms of their contract, basedon the presentationof invoices for services rendered. The invoiceswill be
authorizedfor payment by the Project Director prior to payment. Payments for goods will be rendered
against purchaseorders or invoices.

C.      Action Plan for Financial Management
As indicated, actions necessary for strengthening of financial management have been identifiedthrough
periodic supervisions and annual audits. This process will continue during implementationof ARP 111.
An important covenant included in the TFET and EC Grant Agreements is that any single project
expenditure will only be charged to a single donor. In addition, MAFF will continue to use the same
format for FMRs as adoptedunder ARP 11, which is satisfactory to IDA, with changesthat will be agreed
with IDA. In particular (a) MAFF will include sufficient details in the FMR to identify separately the
funds received from TFET and the EC, as well as their respective uses; and (b) the annual financial
statements ofthe project-which includea statement onthe Sources andUses of Funds-will identify the
sources anduses of funds separately for TFET andEC.

The only other specific action necessary to ensure adequate Financial Management will be for the
Financial Advisor to become available full time, for a minimum period of 24 person-months. The
appraisalmissionhas receivedassurancesthat this will take place aroundFebruary 2004.

0.       Audit Arrangements
As for previous ARP projects, annual financial statements will be audited by independent auditors and
under auditterms of reference acceptable to IDA. Inadditionto opinionon financial statementsthe audit



Timor-LesteThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    68

will reporton the use of SpecialAccounts, reliabilityof Statement of Expenses used as the basis for IDA
disbursements, and provide a management letter with recommendations on improvements in internal
controls and procedures. The auditors will be requestedto ensure that their report conforms to IDA'S
recently revised policies for project audits "Audit Policies and Practices for World Bank Financed
Activities, July I,2003". Inaddition,the Terms of Referencefor audits will includea specific requirement
to verify (a) that receipts and uses of TFET and EC funds are adequately reported; and (b) that no
expenditure has been claimed from both sources of funds. Annual audit report will be due not later than
six months after the end of eachfiscal year.

E.       Disbursements

The proposedproject is expected to disburse over a period of 42 months from the date o f effectiveness
(expected to be January 2004) to closure (June 30, 2007). Disbursementsmay continue for an additional
four months past June 30, 2007 for expenditures covering goods, services or works delivered to the
projectbeforethe closingdate o fthe Grant.

1. Special Account

MAFF will establish separate Special Accounts for the TFET and EC grants, denominated in U S dollars
under terms and conditionsacceptable to IDA. An initial deposit of US$500,000 for the TFET grant, and
US$750,000 for the EC grant will be made to facilitate project implementation. This could be reviewed
during project implementation if disbursements accelerated beyond current plans. Replenishment
applications should be submitted by MAFF on a monthly basis, or when the balance of the Special
Accounts reaches 20 percent of the initial deposit, whichever comes first. The Special Accounts will be
auditedannually by independentauditors underterms of referenceacceptableto IDA.

                      TIMOR-LESTE: Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project

MAFF's Procurementand Tender Services Unit will be responsible for projectprocurement, MAFF has
also implementedthe two previousARP projects inthe sector.

The estimated project costs are US$11.4million equivalent, of which US$5.5 million will be local costs,
and US$5.9 million foreign costs. IDA, as the Trustee for the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET) will
finance a grant of US$3.0 million. The European Commission will finance a grant of  6.8545 million
(US$6.9 million equivalent), administered by IDA. The Government will finance the remainingUS$1.5
million: Of the portion funded by the TFETEC grant, an estimated US$2.25 million will be for civil
works, US$1.73 million for goods, US$3.99 for services, and US$0.24 million for Small Group Grants.
The remainingamount (US$1.65million) will be for trainingand incrementaloperatingcosts.

The project implementationperiod is from January 2004 to June 2007 (for the TFET grant) and from
September2004 to December2007 (for the EC grant).

A. Summary of Procurement Methods

Procurement of civil works and goods financed by IDA and the EC shall be on the basis of the
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRLI Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995, and revised in
January and August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999. Selection of consultants shall be on the
basis of the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers", dated
January 1997andrevised in September 1997, January 1999, andMay 2002.

1.   Procurement Of Civil Works (US$2.73million, EC Grant and Government Financing;)

(a) InternationalCompetitive Bidding(ICB): The project is expectedto includeonly one large civil
    works contract. Procurement o fthis contract shallbe carriedout throughICB procedures.MAFF has
    completeda detailed feasibilitystudy and designdocuments for the contract.

(b) Procurement of Small Works (PSW): The project will finance a number of small works:
    refurbishing of existing office space and burglar proofing for community-based information units,
    protective fencing for ago-meteorologicalunits and rain gauges (under the Informationto Farmers
    sub-component), and village sheds for small oil processing mills (under the Agri-Business sub-
    component). These works are estimatedto cost less than US$10,000 each, up to an aggregate amount
    not exceeding US$150,000". Procurementof such small works shall be under lump-sum, fixed price
    contracts awarded on the basis o f quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic
    contractors in response to written invitations. The invitationsfor quotation shall include a detailed
    description of the works including basic specifications, the required completion date, a form o f
    agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings where applicable. The award shall be made to
    the contractor offering the lowest price quotation for the work and who has experience and the
    resources to complete the contract successfully.

    Community ParticipationProcedures(CPP): Rehabilitationof smallirrigationschemes and farm-
    to-market access roads under the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management Component will be
    carried out with the active participation of the communities. MAFF will sign a memorandum of
    agreement for the rehabilitation of the works with a well respected community-designated

     representative, selected by the community itself, and signed in the presence of witnesses. This
     community-based contractor will be responsible for the works. Payment will be made against
     satisfactory progress of works, as verifiedby constructionsupervisors and MAFF irrigationstaff(see
     Annex 7, Section B). These procedures have been well tested over the course of three seasons of
     works, and have shown to enhance community ownership and commitment to future maintenance.
     The schemes to be rehabilitatedwill be selected annually from submissions made by the scheme
     representatives, after scrutiny at the district level and technical review by MAFF. The cost of the
     schemes' rehabilitation-materials and labor - will be estimatedby MAFF basedon the scope of the
     works and guidelines developedover the course o f previous seasons.Communitieswill be requiredto
     contribute5-15% ofthe costs of rehabilitationin-kind(to be increasedprogressively). The maximum
     value of each scheme shallnot exceedUS$50,000, with a maximum aggregatevalue of US$750,000.
     The project includes provisions for a technical audit of the schemes at mid-term, to enable
     adjustments based on lessons from experience.                   The Government is expected to finance
     approximatelyhalfofthe community irrigationandroadschemes.

II. Procurement of Goods (US$1.89million, EC, TFETGrants and Government Financind
(a) InternationalCompetitive Bidding(ICB): ICB procedures shall be usedfor procurement of goods
     estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more per contract. Goods planned for procurement through ICB
     includeatopographic survey andmapping; procurement of community-basedinformationequipment;
     agro-meteorologicalequipment; refrigerators for the vaccination cold chain; and small oil mills for
     the agri-businesssub-component. The estimated cost of goods to be procuredthroughthis methodis
     US$l.l million.

      NationalCompetitiveBidding(NCB): Goods estimatedto cost morethan US$15,000 but less than
      US$lOO,OOO     per contract up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$250,000 (US$150,000 for
      TFET andUS$lOO,OOO for EC) may beprocuredthroughNCB.

      Shopping: Vaccines estimatedto cost less than US$50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount
      not to exceedUS$150,000 (US$75,000 for TFET andUS$75,000 for the EC grant), and other goods
      estimated to cost less than US$15,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed
      US$250,000 (US$190,000 for TFET and US$60,000 for EC) may be procuredthrough Shopping. If
      such goods are available inthe local market from reputedlocal suppliers, who provide such goods as
      a part o f their normal business, then they may be procured through national shopping. Otherwise,
      they shallbe procuredthroughinternationalshopping.

      Direct Contracting: Veterinary medicines and supplies which are of proprietary nature and
      obtainable from a single source, with IDA'Sprior agreement, be procureddirectly from the suppliers.
      Foundationgrain seeds which are of proprietary nature will be procured directly from the research
      institutes which originally bred the varieties, or their collaborating research institutes testing the
      variety. Direct contractingisjustified on an exceptional basis due to the needto ensurethe purity o f
      the foundation seeds introduced into Timor-Leste, and the fact that foundation seeds are not yet
      commerciallyavailable. The aggregate value o f goods purchasedthroughdirect contractingshall not
      exceedUS$SO,OOO (US$25,000 each for the EC andTFET grants).

      Procurementfrom IAPSO: Vehicles, computers and relatedequipment may be procuredthrough
      the Inter-AgencyProcurement Services of the UnitedNations (IAPSO). The aggregate value shall
      not exceedUS$200,000 (US$150,000 for TFET andUS$50,000 for the EC grants).12

111. Consultants SeWiCeS (US4.23 million, EC, TFET Grants and Government Financing)

The main consultants' services will consist o f individual advisors, both international and local, who will
assist MAFF with the implementation and monitoring o f the project. With regards to firms, the main
contract will be for supervision o f the large irrigation works. In addition, MAFF will contract non-
governmental organizations and training groups to assist with implementation, training, surveying and
monitoring. Visits by experts from specialized institutions (e.g., Consultative Group on International
Agriculture Research-CGIAR) will also be supported.

     Least-Cost Selection (LCS): For the supervision o f the large irrigations works, a qualified
     consultant firm shall be selected through LCS method under the EC grant.                   The assignment is o f
     routine nature and the estimated value o f the contract is small (less than US$lSO,OOO). In addition,
     project auditors will also be selected through LCS method. The estimated value o f consultants and
     auditors selected through LCS method will not exceed US$250,000 (US$50,000 for TFET and
     US$200,000 for EC).
     Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQS):                      Selection o f NGOs and training
     organizations for facilitation, training, surveying and monitoring and evaluation activities under the
     Participatory Development and Natural Resources Component, Support to WUAs, Information
     Services, Vaccination Campaigns, and Project Monitoring and Capacity Building sub-components
     may be through CQS. The estimated cost of each contract will not exceed US$50,000, with a
     maximum aggregate value o f US$300,000 (US$90,000 for TFET and US$210,000 for EC).
     Single-Source Selection (SSS):          With prior concurrence from IDA, CGIAR Research Centers will
     be contracted on SSS basis to provide specialists in selected fields (e.g. rice seed production or pest
     management). Single-source selection is justified as these specialized research centers can provide
     leading specialists in their respective fields, and in some cases, charge only travel costs as part o f
     partnership arrangements with national governments. The aggregate value o f such contracts shall
     not exceed US$105,000 (under EC financing). In addition, where NGOs have established links with
     local communities in the fields of participatory planning and/or have unique advantages in
     monitoring and evaluation (because o f their knowledge o f field conditions), and where their past
     performance is considered to be satisfactory by MAFF, they may be selected on a single-source basis
     with IDA'Sprior concurrence. IDA'Sapproval could be given against an aggregate list o f selected
     NGOs with contract values and justification for their single source selection, and a pro-forma
     contract agreement. Such selection is justified as these NGOs will be continuing their established
     activities and, because o f their links with the communities, they will be providing services o f
     exceptional worth. This is expected to be required for facilitation and training in Component 1,
     information services, vaccination monitoring, and project monitoring. The maximum value o f each
     individual NGO contract shall not exceed US$50,000 and the aggregate amount shall not exceed
     us$110,000.
     Individual Consultants: International advisors as well as local consultants, including facilitators
     and vaccinators, will be appointed by MAFF to assist in project implementation. They should be
     selected through a comparison o f qualifications o f at least three qualified consultants among those
     who have expressed interest in the assignments or have been approached directly by MAFF. The
     total estimated cost o f the individual consultants to be selected through a competitive process is
     US$2,350,000. In addition, with appropriate justifications and afier concurrence by IDA, individual
     consultants may be selected on a sole-source basis in exceptional cases, such as (i)            tasks that are a
     continuation o f previous work that the consultants have carried out and for which the consultants
     were selected competitively, (ii)assignments lasting less than six months; and (c) when the
     individual is the only consultant qualified for the assignment. The maximum aggregate value o f
     such consultants i s US$1,200,000 (US$500,000 under TFET and US$700,000 under EC). This takes
     into account potential extensions in contracts o f current MAFF advisors, as well as Timorese
     vaccinators and facilitators whose performance i s evaluated as satisfactory by MAFF management,



Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004          16

      and in cases where such extension is deemed important for the continuation o f ARP activities. The
      minutes o f negotiations will include a clause specifying that for the hiring of individual consultants
      under sole sburce basis which are not subject to prior review, the unit rates will be based on
      prevalent rates established during ARP 11, or on any official guidelines, acceptable to IDA, adopted
      by the Government o f Timor-Leste in the future, with allowances for annual inflation as determined
      by the Timor-Leste National Statistics Directorate. Any additional rate increases will be subject to
      prior approval by IDA.

IV.Small Group Grants (US$0.24million, TFETonly)

Small Group Grants under the Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management
Component will comprise o f a broad spectrum o f activities to be undertaken with the direct participation
and in-kindcontribution o fthe beneficiary communities. The main purchases will consist o f construction
materials for very small works, such as plant nurseries, woodlots, seed storage, fences, and water
retention facilities, small equipment, materials and supplies not available locally (such as introduced
seeds, fish fries), and payment for external specialized labor and technical support. Materials available
locally within the villages, land, and local labor will be expected to be provided voluntarily by the
communities. The grouping o f these purchases would not be feasible because they involve different
operators and scattered beneficiaries invery remote areas. The maximum amount o f such grants for each
village is US$lO,OOO. Selection criteria and the process for allocation, procurement and disbursement o f
the small group grants shall be in accordance with an Operational Manual satisfactory to IDA. MAFF has
prepared such a manual for ARP 11, but it has been revisedto incorporate lessons o f experience from the
first pilot communities. The revised Manual was a condition for negotiations. Because o f the small size
of the individual purchases and since a comparison o f prices may not be practical due to quality and
distance considerations, procurement o f materials costing less than US$2,500 may be through direct
contracting from local markets or suppliers. For all other items, a comparison o f three quotations shall be
required. MAFF will assist the communities by compiling a list o f local suppliers and prevailing prices.
Most community projects involve only minor earth works which communities carry voluntarily. In case
skilled labor is required, communities will contract them directly on a daily rate or output basis,
whichever is most prevalent locally. Disbursement o f the small group grants will be done in three
installments based on the progress o f activities. MAFF shall carry out the monitoring o f the use o f the
grants.

B. Procurement Manual and Procurement Documents
MAFF will prepare and submit to IDA for review a revised Procurement Plan and Procurement Manual
prior to project negotiations. The Manual shall outline the agreed process for the procurement o f works,
goods and consultants' services, and also include sample documents, where standard procurement
documents are not available. Once cleared by IDA, MAFF shall follow the Procurement Manual and the
Procurement Plan for all its procurement. The Procurement Plan should be adjusted periodically (at least
every 12 months) with IDA'Sconcurrence to meet the evolving needs o fthe project.

For the procurement o f works on the basis o f ICB, MAFF shall use the Standard Bidding Documents for
Procurement of Works -Smaller Contracts,dated January 1995, revised June 2002 and March 2003. For
the procurement o f goods on the basis o f ICB, MAFF shall use the Standard Bidding Documentsfor the
Procurement of Goods, dated January 1995, revised on March 2000, January 2001, March 2002 and
March 2003. MAFF shall also use the Standard Requestsfor Proposals - Selection of Consultants,dated
July 1997, revised on April 1998, July 1999 and March 2000. While using these documents, MAFF shall
ensure that the latest revisions to the above documents are incorporated. These revisions are available in
the Bank's external website at www.worldbank.org. Even though the procurement o f the topographic
survey is a goods ICB contract, given the nature o f the contract and on an exceptional basis, the bidding
documents will be based on the standard biddingdocuments for small works.

For procurement on the basis of NCB, until new ProcurementRegulations are enacted (see below), the
mandatory provisions outlined in the Attachment to this annex, shall be included as an Annex to the
Procurement Schedule of the Grant Agreement. Oncethe new regulationis enacted, these provisionswill
be reviewedand amendedas necessary.

For Procurement o f Small Works and Community Procurement Procedures, Shopping, and Direct

In the preparation o f evaluation reports for procurement for ICB and NCB, MAFF shall use IDA's
Standard Bid Evaluation Form -Procurement of Goods or Works, April 1996. Inthe case of consulting
firms, MAFF shalluse IDA's SampleForm of Evaluation Report Selection of Consultants. For all other
cases, simple sample forms for evaluationshall be usedand includedinthe Procurement Manual.

C. Summary Capacity Assessment
An assessment o f the procurement capacity o f MAFF was carried out in accordance with World Bank
procedures (dated July 15, 2002). The assessment involved a review of the procurement policies and
procedures adoptedby MAFF andtook into consideration the experience inthe implementationof ARP I
and ARP 11, as well as the findings and recommendations o f the Timor-Leste: Country Procurement
Assessment Report of June 2003.

Legal Framework The primary instrument governingpublicprocurement inTimor-Lesteis Regulation
2000/10 on Public Procurement for Civil Administration in East Timor. This Regulation is to a large
extent based on the Model Law of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law.
However, there are several provisions and approaches that diverge from the Model Law and the World
Bank's Procurement Guidelines. They include: (a) restrictionto payments in US dollars; (b) greater
emphasis on nationalsources of procurement; (c) exceptions to the use of open tendering; (d) publication
of invitationsto bid or to apply for pre-qualificationin the Official Gazette, rather than in the national
press; (e) expression of non-priceevaluationcriteriain non-monetary terms; and (0apparent compulsory
extension of bid validity periods at the discretion of the procuring entity. Regulations 2000/10 also
expressly provide that in the case of donor funded procurement; the procurement rules of the donors will
prevail over the Regulations in the case o f any conflict.                 Accordingly, MAFF followed IDA's
Procurementand Consultant's Guidelines for ARP IandARP 11.

The Government is aware of IDA'S concerns and, with financing under the Administrative Services
Capacity Building Project, has appointed a consultant to assist in the preparation of manuals relatedto
procurement. The third draft of the new Procurement Regulations has been submitted to the Government
and IDA for comments. The Government is also inthe process of appointingconsultants to assist inthe
preparationo f manuals related to procurement. Since these manuals will not be available before the
commencementofthe proposedproject,MAFF will haveto use its ownProcurementManual(see above).

Procurement Thresholds: Regulation 2000/10 has very high levels of thresholds for shopping
(US$200,000), small works (US$350,000), and ICB (above US$l.O million). In a country where the
procurement risks are considered to be "high" (see below), the high thresholds for shopping and small
works cannot bejustified. Further, the highthresholdfor ICB cannot bejustified consideringthe capacity
of local contractors and the limited local manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, consistent with the




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    78

recommendations of the Country Procurement Assessment Report, lower thresholds will be applicable
underthe proposedproject(see Table B).

Procurement Capacity: MAFF has established a Procurement and Tender Services Unit (reportingto
the Headof Administration) to assist in processingall procurement. However, it is inadequately staffed,
with only one nationalregular staff with very limitedexperience in procurement, a nationalprocurement
consultant with some experience gathered during the implementationof ARP Iand ARP 11, and a part-
time internationalprocurement advisor. Lack of procurement capacity is one of the greatest challenges
confronting Timor-Leste. This also extends to MAFF and there will be a continued need for MAFF to
engage an internationalprocurement advisor on a full-timebasis for at least the first two years of project
implementation. The advisor will assist in the processing of procurement, and will mentor and train
national staff. Further, in addition to the one regular national staff assigned to the Procurement Unit,
MAFF should consider recruiting another regular staff to enhance its capacity and avoid delays in
processing of procurement. The appointment of the international procurement advisor shall be a
condition o f effectiveness of the Grant. Procurement capacity will be monitored closely during
implementation. One possibilitywould be for the Government's Central ProcurementDivisionto second
an experiencedprocurementstaffto MAFF.

Procurement Processing and Filing: In view of the limited national capacity available in the
Procurement Unit, the burden of processing most of the procurement has been vested upon the
internationalprocurementadvisor. As a result of the overload, there were often delays in processing and
the Procurement Unit could not effectively monitor and supervise the performance of the suppliers and
contractors. Filing of procurement documents under ARP I1has improvedand is now satisfactory. It is
expectedthat procurement processingwill improve with staffgainingmore experience.

Risk Assessment: Consistent with the findings of the Country Procurement Assessment Report, the
assessment o f risks for the proposedProject is "high". This conclusion is based on the extremely weak
procurementcapacity. Basedon past experience underARP IandARP 11, corruptionis not consideredto
be an issue. Inorder to mitigatethe risk, as indicatedabove, appointment of an internationalprocurement
advisor will be a condition for effectiveness of the Grant. The terms of reference o f the advisor will
specifically include a provisionfor training and mentoringof nationalstaff, and hisher performance will
bejudged by the success in capacity building. In addition, as an outcome of the Country Procurement
Assessment Report, IDA and the Asian Development Bank are providing financing for training
Government officials in procurement. MAFF staff will be able to avail itself of these training
opportunities.

0. Prior Review Thresholds
Table B indicates the prior review thresholds. Since MAFF has been involved in the implementationof
ARP IandARP 11, where substantial procurementthroughshoppingand small works has taken place, prior
reviewof such contracts is not considerednecessary.Accordingly, prior reviewwill be requiredfor:

    (i)       all contracts for goods andworks that are estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more;

    (ii)      all contracts for consultingfirms andNGOs, estimatedto cost US$lOO,OOO or morel3;

    (iii)     all contracts for individualconsultants, estimatedto cost US$50,000 or more;

    (iv)      all contracts for individual consultants selected through sole source procedures (excluding
              tasks below US$50,000 that are a continuation of previous work for which the consultants
              were selected competitively,suchas vaccinators, facilitators,and local consultants);


l3This appliesto theECgrant only. UndertheTFETgrant, onlyasmallamountofprocurement(estimatedatUS$85,000)
would be through firms. Prior review will apply to those selected on a single-source basis.



Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    79

        (v)      all contracts for goods awardedthrough direct contracting; and

        (vi)     all contracts with consultingfirms, includingNGOs, awardedthroughsingle-sourceselection.
   The total value of contracts subject to prior review is estimatedto be US$6.06 million, or 63 percent of
   the value o fthe two grants.
   E. Post Review and Procurement Supervision
   Since procurement risks are consideredto be "high", duringthe initial stage of project implementation,
   IDA shall carry out ex-post reviews of 20 percent of the contracts that were not subject to prior review.
   With the concurrence o f the Regional Procurement Advisor, this percentage may be lowered if, during
   implementationofthe project,it is determinedthat the processingo f procurement is satisfactory andthere
   is a lower perceivedrisk.

                       Technical Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis

                       TIMOR-LESTE: Third AgricultureRehabilitationProject


The project's overall internal Economic Rate o f Return (ERR) is estimated at 17.7%, with a Net Present
Value o f US$2.32 million.

The project objective is to strengthenthe capacity o f MAFF and its development partners to assist rural
communities in increasing their production and income in a sustainable way. Thus, while the economic
analysis assessed the viability o f individual project activities, ideally project activities should be assessed
based on how they help strengthen the institutional capacity o f MAFF and its partners (particularly in
regardto the implementation o f future projects). As future projects have not been identified, an economic
analysis o f these additional benefits could not be carried out. Furthermore, the economic analysis did not
take into account potential environmental and social benefits, as relevant data were not available. Hence,
the total benefits o f ARP I11are likely to exceed the benefits included in this economic analysis, and the
project is expected to have a continuing impact on MAFF programs well beyond project completion.

The economic analysis was based on the US dollar, the official currency inTimor-Leste. There are tariffs
on several agricultural products. However, as the analysis below shows, there is little evidence to suggest
that these tariffs have a significant effect on the prices o f domestically produced commodities covered in
this economic analysis. Hence, no shadow prices were usedinthe economic analysis. The FinancialRate
of return was considered to be similar to the Economic Rate o f Return.

The economic analysis was first carried out on a component by component basis. This was based on both
cost benefit analysis (for some components) as well as cost-effectiveness analysis (for components such
as information which do not lend themselves to cost-benefit analysis).                The ERR for the project as a
whole was based on an aggregation o f the individual components' analysis. The duration o f the benefits
was assumed to vary between 10 and 20 years, depending on the likely duration o f the technology and its
resultingbenefit stream.

A.    Economic Analysis by Component

Component 1 Participatory Development and Natural Resource Management
                  -
The main activities associated with this component are facilitation and support to upland and coastal
farmer groups for the implementation o f their own Small Group Activities. One o f the criteria for
assessing the viability o f Small Group Activities will be their economic viability. Many o f the potential
benefits, however, may be difficult to measure (such as reduction in environmental degradation).
Furthermore, the benefits will be site and activity specific, and as the activities have not yet been
identified, precise potential benefits cannot be assessedat this time.

The economic analysis took into account the potential ERR o f prototype village activities, akin to those
that may be funded under this component. The Australia East Timor Rural Development Program has
estimated internal rates o f return and returns on capital for similar village activities: vegetable
development, new coffee plantings (starting with nurseries); and post harvest storage o f rice and coffee
processing.    In addition, the economic analysis took into account rates o f return for a hypothetical
community fishpond activity, one o f the activities supported under ARP 11. The results are shown below:

                      Vegetable development                                151%
                      Coffee plantings                                     -4.4%
                      Post harveststorage                                   27%
                      Coffee processing                                    -250%
                      Fishponds                                           > 25% (dependingon size)
                  Source: AusAID Rural Development Program, Timor-Leste

The results suggest that significant rates o f return could be achieved on individual community activities
but that prior analysis would be advisable before proceeding. Some o f the activities may only be viable if
significant environmental benefits could also be achieved. As small village-based activities may be one
o f the main opportunities to increase farmer income, it is important that MAFF staff be trained in advising
farmers on activities likely to yield positive returns. Table 1 shows, for example, that many small coffee
plantation activities may not be viable at this stage, though this could change with a strengthening o f
world coffee prices or inareas with lower production costs.

This approach does not take into account the benefits o f institutionalizing the process within MAFF. If
costs associated with providing the technical assistance under this component were to be taken into
account, the benefits would be underestimated.

For the purposes of the economic analysis, and taking into account the type o f activities likely to be
financed, it was assumed that the Small Village Grants included in this component (US$200,000) would
achieve an ERR o f 15% over ten years.               Actual benefits may be higher, especially as social and
environmental benefits were not been taken into account. For some technologies - such as tree planting -
a ten year benefit stream may be too short while for others - such as fish ponds - it may be excessively
long. The duration o f the benefit stream takes into consideration an average o f the activities expected to
be supported under the project.

Duringimplementation, relevant baseline data should be collected to permit a more precise evaluation o f
individual village activities, and subsequent adjustments in the positive list. This should include, among
others, assessments o f storage losses for grain, current yields for vegetable crops, prices for main
agricultural commodities, mortality (for fish ponds), and processing conversion rates. Indicative financial
viability analyses o f most common village activities should then be included in the respective technical
manuals.

Component 2 - Irrigation Rehabilitationand Management

The main activities under this component are community irrigation schemes and roads, one large
irrigation scheme, institutional capacity building and surveys and mapping. Project benefits were only
estimated for the rehabilitation o f irrigation and farm-to-market road schemes.

CommunityIrrigation and Roads Rehabilitation. Based on experience gained under ARP Iand ARP
11,the average investment cost associated with community irrigation schemes is US$160 per hectare (ha).
A total o f 3,000 hectares will be rehabilitated under ARP 111. These community schemes will be
rehabilitating land that was previously irrigated but is not currently used because o f damaged
infrastructure. The base case scenario is that the land to be irrigated will produce a single rice crop with
similar yields as nearby land that is already irrigated (on average 1.8 tons per ha). The land to be irrigated
is currently left fallow inthe wet season and may be used for grazing duringthe dry season.

The costs associated with growing rice are 100 man hours o f labor per hectare at US$1 per hour with
operation and maintenance costs o f US$20 per hectare. N o fertilizer is used. The rice price is assumed to


Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004     85

be US$O.l3/kg (paddy), US$O.Ol/kg above current prices (at Bobonaro). This takes into account the fact
that international rice commodity prices are at an historic low and are projected to increase by about 10
percent inthe next few years.

Timor-Leste currently has a tariff of 10% on imported rice. Table 2 below shows the estimated imported
parity price if the tariff was fully effective in raising local rice prices. However, selective inquiries about
local rice prices during appraisal suggest little variation in prices irrespectively o f the distance from Dili
or from rice growing areas. Furthermore, local prices are approximately 10% below the estimated import
parity prices. At current prices, therefore, the poor transportation infrastructure and limited marketing
facilities cause rice prices to be determined predominantly by local supply and demand. Hence, the
assumed rice price o f US$O. 13/kg o f paddy is representative of both economic as well as financial prices.

  The costs o f rehabilitating farm-to-market roads have been included in the cost o f rehabilitating the
  irrigation schemes. In the base case scenario, the benefits for this rehabilitation are assumed to be equal
 to the cost o f maintenance. In the economic analysis in ARP 11, the incremental benefit was assumed to
  be 200 Rupiah/km based on the estimates made for similar roads in Indonesia. This approach would
  value the benefits o f the farm to market roads at the equivalent o f US$12/ha rehabilitated or US$4/ha

above the assumed operational and maintenance costs o f roads (5% o f investment cost per year). In this
analysis, the benefits of roads were valued conservatively at the same level as operational and
maintenance costs. Under these assumptions, the ERR per ha for community schemes (over 20 years) is
47%. This relatively high rate o f returnreflects the fact that the project is simply rehabilitating schemes
for which development costs have already been incurred, and may therefore be regarded as sunk costs.
Furthermore, the potential irrigable areas are not currently being cultivated due to the state o f disrepair o f
the schemes. Hence, investment in community irrigation rehabilitation is highly economical. The life
span o f community irrigation schemes was assumed to average 20 years.

Asides from the 3,000 ha o f land that are expected to be irrigated through rehabilitation o f community
irrigation schemes, there remains at least another 7,000 ha that require future rehabilitation by MAFF. If
MAFF can fund the rehabilitation o f some 1,000 ha a year - as currently planned - it will have the
institutional capacity to rehabilitate these schemes after the project ends.                  The benefits and costs
associated with the rehabilitation o f 1,500 ha o f this land have been included in the sensitivity analysis
(but not in the baseline scenario) as indicative o f some o f the capacity buildingbenefits o f ARP I11(see
Table 3).

Rehabilitation of Large Irrigation Schemes. The project is expected to rehabilitate only one large
irrigation scheme, Caraulun, at a cost o f approximately US$1.6 million with contingencies. The potential
irrigable area is 1,030 ha. The feasibility consulting firm hired under ARP I1carried out an independent
cost-benefit analysis for this scheme inMay 2003 (see Annex 13 for further details).

Based on assumptions that reflect current experience, the ERR is estimated at 20.3% over 20 years. The
current yields are about 1.9 MT/ha with a single crop. The with-project benefits assume two crops per
year, with yields increasing to 2.5 M T h a for the first crop, and 2.0 MT/ha for the second crop after 5
years.   The analysis also assumed a cropping intensity (with project) o f 160%14, taking into account the
experience with light-to-medium damaged irrigation schemes rehabilitated during ARP 11. As with
community schemes, a price o f US$O.13/kg o f paddy was assumed. The sensitivity analysis indicates that
iffarmers grewonlyonecroponthenewlyirrigatedareaandtherewasnoincreaseabovecurrentyields,
the ERR would be 8.1%. However, the overall project would remain feasible with an ERR o f 15.6%.
The sensitivity analysis also shows that ifno production increase was achieved inthe first two years after
rehabilitation (as WUAs gained experience in utilizing the improved scheme) the ERR would remain
viable at 13.9%.

For the purposes o f project monitoring, MAFF should collect information on existing yields from a
control site (nearby irrigated land), and then monitor the impact o f the rehabilitation on the area irrigated,
yield, inputs used and prices.

Sub-component 3.1 Information to Farmers
                            -

The primary activities associated with the information component are delivery o f information to farmers
via various media and collection o f meteorological information.                    These activities are considered
separately below.

During the Indonesian Administration period, there were about 700 extension staff in Timor Leste, an
average o f about 2 per village. This compares to a current average o f 5 technical agricultural staff per
district, a reduction o f nearly 50 staff per district. Most villages lack easy access to agricultural
information. ARP I11will use mass media and establish an e-mail information service network to raise the

 l4 This assumption was discussed extensively with irrigation staff during appraisal and is considered to be
conservative based on the experience o f ARP I1schemes.


 Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004          87

capacity o f district staff and other development partners to give relevant advice to farmers, as well as
convey farmers' requests for information and support.

Delivery o f information has a number o f interconnected activities. The economic benefits o f these
activities cannot easily be estimated due to a lack o f baseline data. Nevertheless, provision o f information
to farmers is a primary function o f MAFF. A cost effectiveness approach to the delivery o f information is
therefore an appropriate evaluation methodology. A ten year time horizon was assumed inthe economic
analysis as future technology changes would likely render current interventions obsolete.

There are at least two methods o f providing information to farmers: directly by word o f mouth, and
electronically. Cost effectiveness may be assessedby estimating (i)the costs o f upgradingthe capacity o f
existing field staff by providing them with access to information through computer networks; and (ii)the
cost o f providing more information through various media. The investment and operational costs o f the
proposed project activities can then be compared to the costs o f employing further extension staff for
face-to-face communication. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine what would needto be
the number o f extension officers that could be `replaced' by an effective mass media information system.
This analysis suggests that ifone radio program producedevery two weeks could replace the activities o f
up to 20 extension workers at current salaries (about 1.5 officers per district), the estimated ERRfor mass
media campaigns would be 17% over a ten-year period. In other words, the mass media campaign would
be cost effective under the realistic assumption that each extension worker is only able to visit an average
o f 5 farmers per day, whilst an effective radio program could reach an average o f 1,000 farmers each
fortnight. On the other hand, if less than 500 farmers were positively influenced by mass media on a 15-
day period, a mass media information campaign may not be a cost effective option. A key issue is thus
the number o f farmers likely to be positively influenced by mass media campaigns. As 1,000 farmers i s a
relatively small proportion o f farmers with access to radio (about 450,000 people), there seems a
reasonable chance that an effective mass media campaign will potentially be a cost effective option.

The costs o f the community based information services and links with the CGIAR network were
compared with the costs o f extension officers providing a similar service to farmers.                 The cost
effectiveness o f the information network might be evaluated by recording the network use by district
extension staff on behalf o f farmers.         The sensitivity analysis used a base case scenario where an
extension staff member (without access to an information network) provides advice to an average o f 5
farmers per day. The increasedproductivity o f district staff inthe with-project situation may be measured
by how many requests for information on agriculture problems they could make using the computer
network. At present, district staff spend a lot o f time traveling to Dilito confer with MAFF on problems
encountered in the field. If each o f the four district extension staff member (or, alternatively, local
development partners) were to conduct on average 5 information searches per day (Le. a total o f 20
searches a day per district), then this number o f requests might be considered the equivalent o f each
district officer achieving the workload o f two district officers who do not have access to the information
network (i.e. the five searches represent the additional capacity o f a district officer to assist farmers). The
rate o f substitution (i.e. the average number o f farmers assisted by district officers before and after the
establishment o f the information network) provides the basis for determining the cost effectiveness o f the
use o f computer networks for the provision o f information to farmers. Under the scenario o f 20 searches
per district per day (and 5 farmers assisted per day per district officer without access to an information
network), the estimated ERR for the information network is 22% over a ten year period. This estimate is
highly sensitive to the baseline assumptions: if the average number o f searches were to be limited to 10
per district per day, the estimated ERR would be -4% over the ten year period. It is therefore appropriate
to introduce the network on a pilot basis first, expanding nationwide only after an evaluation o f the
effectiveness o f the first pilots (as currently proposed under the project).

For the purposes o f evaluation, baseline information needs to be collected on current coverage and usage
o f radio programs. Such a survey is expected to be undertaken later in 2003. The survey should include



Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture RehabilitationProject -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004        88

appropriate questions to assess the usefulness o f the radio programs to farmers. As current use o f e-mail
by district officers is very limited, impact evaluation could be assessed based on usage o f the network
over the life o f ARP 111.

The collection o f agro-meteorological information has additional benefits to those accruing to farmers.
One important issue in any economic analysis is the quality o f the technology to be used. A feasibility
study will be prepared evaluating alternative approaches. Implementation o f this sub-component and
assessment o f the economic benefits will depend on the results o f this feasibility study. Only the costs o f
the feasibility study have been includedinthe overall economic analysis.

Sub-component 3.2 SustainableAnimal Health Services
                           -
The primary activities associated with this sub-component that lend themselves to an economic analysis
are the vaccination campaigns for cattle, pigs and chickens. Ideally, the economic analysis should be
based on actual mortality rate with and without vaccination. Livestock numbers, however, are not
accurately recorded in Timor-Leste. The approach adopted was therefore to determine what parameters
would be needed to generate a positive ERR. An assessment was then made as to whether these
parameters are likely to underestimate the actual situation. A twenty year time frame was used in the
economic analysis on the assumption that vaccination will remain the primary means o f protecting
animals against disease inthe foreseeable future.

For all animals - cattle, pigs and chickens, the ERR for vaccination is positive for a wide range o f
reasonable assumptions.       Based on experience in Indonesia, Hemorrhagic Septicaemia is endemic in
cattle and the likelihood o f an outbreak i s 510% in any one year. The effectiveness o f the vaccine could
be around 35%. For pigs, swine fever is endemic and the likelihood o f an outbreak could be at least 20%
in any one year. The effectiveness o f the vaccine could be at least 50%. For chickens, the likelihood of
Newcastle disease could be 35% and the effectiveness o f the vaccine could be at least 50%. This is a
conservative estimate given that the effectiveness of the vaccine in challenge trials in Mozambique
approached 100%.

Key assumptions are associated with the value o f the animals that become infected. When infected, the
animals are likely to be quickly killed and consumed. The economic cost is therefore the additional value
that would have been added to the animal (e.g. in weight and breeding potential) before it is was
eventually slaughtered or died. The economic analysis used conservative assumptions o f US$50 for
cattle, US$30 for pigs, and US$1 for chickens.

Imports o f live animals are subject to a 12% duty, while duties for meat are set at 6%. The impact o f
these tariffs on prices o f animals and meat in local markets is uncertain. Generally, prices o f livestock
products will reflect short-term supply and demand conditions at the local level, particularly when
transportation is difficult and expensive. Thus tariffs are unlikely to have significant effects on local
markets. Economic and financial prices are therefore assumed to be the same. Under these baseline
assumptions, the resulting ERR is 234% over twenty years.

For the purposes o f evaluation, it will not be possible to compare previous mortality from disease. The
most appropriate assessment methodology will be to collect information on mortality through the new
voucher system introduced by ARP 111. Village Livestock Workers will be required to collect information
on the number o f animals in each household and the number vaccinated. The base case scenario assumes
a mortality rate from disease after implementation o f the campaigns o f about 1% for cattle, 8% for pigs
and 6% for chickens. The number of animals assumed to be vaccinated is 275,000 pigs, 200,000 cattle
and 330,000 chickens.

Sub-component 3.3 Agri-BusinessSupport
                           -
The primary activities include support to rural producer organizations; support to seed producers; and
supportto priority niche market commodities.

The benefits of establishing an Agri-Business Support Unit in MAFF were estimated based on the
potential benefits of MAFF continuing to provide technical advice to Agriculture Service Centers
established under ARP Iand I1 (one of the types of rural producer organizations that the unit would
support).

The three existing Agriculture Service Centers (in Bobonaro, Aileu and Viqueque) prepared business
plans prior to their establishment. All three plans significantly overestimated the actual volume of
activity duringtheir first year of operation. Significant funds were invested in the establishment of these
centers. Furthermore, in the absence of well-developed markets and associated infrastructure, many
farmers couldbe without the meansto dispose of surplus productionat reasonableprices inthe absenceof
efficiently functioning centers. Support for rural producer organizations is therefore one strategy that
needsto betrailedas a meansof raisingruralproductionandfarmer incomes. It is still too early to assess
the long-term economic viability of the three pilot Agriculture Service Centers based on current
performance. However, taking the initial investment as sunk costs, continued technical support to these
type of organizations would have potentially high economic benefits. In the economic analysis, the
foreign exchange costs associated with (indirectly) supporting producer organizations such as the ASCs
(US$lSO,OOO)    were assumedto have anERR of 20% over tenyears. A ten year time frame was assumed
as developments in the market economy might lead to more efficient forms of marketing becoming
available.

The viability of the proposedoil mills will be assessedthrougha feasibility study beforeMAFF proceeds
with this assistance. Currentinformationsuggeststhe economic viability of coconut/candlenutoil mills is
very sensitive to assumptions about market prices andthe volume of nuts crushed. Highprices and high
throughput generates very high ERRS. Given that this analysis has still to be carried out, the costs
associatedwith the implementationo foil mills were not incorporated intothe economic analysis.

N o direct benefits were estimated for this component, even though the policy studies and capacity
buildingare likelyto generate long-standingbenefits.


B. Overall Project Economic Returns

The overallestimated ERR for the project is estimatedconservativelyat 17.7% with a Net Present Value
(at 12%) of US$2.3 million(see Table 3). This was basedon a combinationof cost effectiveness analysis
for some components (e.g. information) and cost benefit analysis for other components, as outlined in
Section A above. The overall ERRwas estimatedtakinginto account all projectbaseline costs, except for
the agro-meteorologicalequipment and oil mills for which more complete feasibility analyses are still
pending.

C. Sensitivity Analysis
Table 4 below shows the sensitivity analysis for the project for the most significant assumptions. The
mainrisksthat would significantly lower the projectreturns include:

0   Caraulun farmers unable or unwilling to achieve increased yields andor planting of two crops.


0   MAFF unableto providefunds to cover recurrent costs associated with livestockvaccinationprogram
    andfarmers unwillingto pay for the coast ofvaccination.


0   Farmers unwilling to contribute to the maintenance of community irrigation schemes to ensure that
    they remainoperational.


0   Failure of the community based information services network to improve communication with
    farmers.

These risks would need to be managed carefully during implementation. Nonetheless, the sensitivity
analysis indicatesthat the projectis fairly robustto changes inthe basic assumptions.

0. Fiscal Impact

The estimatedrecurrent costs after ARP program completion (excluding salaries) are US$733,000 ayear,
or about 26 percent of MAFF's forward estimatedbudget for FY06/07. These estimateswere extensively
discussed with MAFF management and are consideredreasonable, given the high level of integration o f
ARP I11with MAFF's current programs.The major recurrent costs will be annualvaccination campaigns
(US$310,000 a year) and operation and maintenance costs for the 16,500 ha of irrigated land that will
have been rehabilitated under ARP I,         I1and I11by 2007. Detailed fiscal estimates by project component
are summarizedbelow.

                               Technical Annex I O : Safeguard Policy Issues

                      TIMOR-LESTE: Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project


A. Introduction

The project is classifiedas Safeguard Screening Category S2: some safeguard policies are triggered, but
effects are limited intheir impact and are technically and institutionallymanageable.

The project triggers the following safeguard policies: (a) Environmental Assessment; (b) Natural
Habitats; (c) Forests; (d) Pest Management; (e) Involuntary Resettlement; and (0 International
Waterways. Potential environmental impacts will be short-term, localized and readily prevented or
mitigated by good engineering design and constructionpractices - as laid out on the prevention and
mitigation measures adopted by the project - reinforced by adequate supervision in the field. In the
unlikely event that landneeds to be acquiredby the Government, it would be located around an existing
irrigationscheme, beminor innature, andwill notresultinpopulationrelocation.

I.EnvironmentalAssessment

ARP I11 is designed to be primarily a continuation and sustainability phase of ARP 11. The project
activities are not expected to have any major significant, complex or irreversible adverse environmental
impacts. No works will be undertaken that could affect protected or vulnerable natural habitats. The
projecthastherefore beenclassifiedas EnvironmentalScreeningCategoryB (see Annex 12).

2. Natural Habitats

This policy will apply to the project. All community-based irrigationand farm-to-market access roads
will be located outside protected areas as defined in Regulation2000/19 on ProtectedAreas (one of the
criteria used in their selection). However, Component 1 (Participatory Development and Natural
Resources Management) may be carried out in and around natural habitat areas.                    The component is
expected to strengthen natural habitat management by introducing improved methods of watershed
management and replanting. The negative list for this component excludes any activity which may
impactadversely on important/protectednaturalhabitats, includingat altitudes above 2000 meters, and in
mangrove, wetlandor coral reefareas (unless for rehabilitationpurposes).

3. Forests

This policy will apply to the project. Component 1 will include activities on community-based forest
management, such as reforestationof community-ownedforest land, and sustainable utilizationof non-
timber forest products in natural forests within village boundaries (e.g. bamboo or honey). It will not
involveharvestingtimber innaturalforests. Communityforests established under the project will not be
ready for harvest for 10-15 years. The OperationalManualfor this component will includeprovisionsthat
requirereplantingo f future trees harvested in any community forestry areas supported under the project,
and conservationplans for areas reforestedto reduce environmentaldegradation.




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004       95

4. Pest Management

This policy may be triggered in limited occasions. Under the on-farm demonstrations of new crop
varieties by Water User Associations in Component 2 (Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management) and
support to certified seed producers in Sub-component3.3 (Support to Agri-Business) it is possible that
the project may need to supply limited amounts of pesticides to control insects or pests. In addition,
farmers in Component 1 may feel the need to use agro-chemicals to protect new varieties introduced
under the small group grants (even though the grants themselves would not finance pesticides or
fertilizers). In these cases, MAFF would ensure that all procurement of pesticides would comply with
OperationalDirective4.09. All Class 1toxic pesticidesandClass I1moderatelytoxic pesticides wouldbe
excluded (see Table 2, Annex 12). MAFF would further provide training to farmers on principles of
integrated pest management to minimizethe use of chemical pesticides, and enhance their awareness on
safe applicationandpesticide disposalmethodswhich discouragedhouseholduse.

5. Cultural Property

This policy is not expected to apply to the project. All community-based Small Group Grants will be
small in scale and will be decided by the communities themselves within their administrative village
boundaries (thereby respecting any existing cultural property). The negative list for Component 1
specifically excludes the funding of activities which endanger cultural property. Rehabilitationof roads
and irrigationwill be on pre-existingschemesonly.

6. Involuntary Resettlement

No involuntaryresettlement or land acquisitionresultingin loss of income is expected to take place as a
result of project activities, as demonstrated under ARP 11. However, as small amounts of community
land may be required for community-based activities under Components 1 (Participatory Development
and Natural Resources Management) and 2.1 (Community Irrigation and Roads Rehabilitation), the
Policy Guidelines for the Negotiationsover the Use and Development of Land for ARP I11were adopted
by the Council of Ministers on November 15, 2003 (see Attachment 1). Part Io f the Guidelines -
incorporated into the OperationalManuals for the components - specifies the process for ensuring that
there has been informed consent for land donations or community-fundedcompensation under voluntary
community agreements.

Inthe case of the Caraulun irrigationscheme under sub-component2.2 (Major IrrigationRehabilitation),
there is a remote possibilitythat the Government may needto acquire land to complete the rehabilitation
works as designed. Inthis case, the provisionsfor involuntary land acquisitionof the Policy Guidelines
for the Negotiationsover the Use andDevelopmentof Landfor ARP I11(Part I1of the Guidelines), would
apply. In case communities or Water User Associations in Caraulun decided to establishtertiary canals
under community irrigationcontracts, they wouldfollow the same process as for sub-component2.1.

Inthe Caraulun major irrigationscheme, the ownership of a small area of land(291 ha) remains unclear
although no disputes have been reported (see Annexes 11 and 13). This involves land previously
occupied by Indonesian transmigrants, the church (who used it for a now discontinued youth program)
and the Government. As part of the pre-conditions to proceed with the scheme's rehabilitation, the
projectwill requiretopographic mappingof all landplots, establishment of Water User Associations, and
resolutionof land use issues accordingto traditionalmechanisms as well as the provisions of the Policy
Guidelines for the Negotiationsover the Use andDevelopment of Landfor ARP 111.

Re-establishment o f agro-meteorological stations would take place primarily in pre-existing sites. The
equipment would require a small (about 9 m2)fence to protect it against vandalism. Where new sites are
needed (e.g. for rain gauges) the replacement ago-meteorological equipment would be installed in
government land.

 7. Indigenous Peoples

This policy would not apply to the project. Timor-Leste is made up of approximately 13 major ethnic
groups and 33 main and sub-language groups. N o single ethnic group dominates, and none are better
placed than others to capture project benefits. As such, there are no specific indigenous minority groups
requiring special attention. Village units are made up o f homogeneous ethnic populations. Since the
project is designed to operate largely within the administrative boundaries o f single villages (including on
irrigation schemes) an Indigenous People's Development Plan would therefore not be required.

Under Component 1 (Participatory Development and NRM), one o f the criteria for the selection o f target
villages will be their level o f poverty, with preference given to the poorest communities. This will ensure
that groups inthe most marginal areas are included.

Although widely spoken, not all ethnic groups speak Tetum or Indonesian. As a consequence, MAFF
will select facilitators and Village Livestock Workers based on their capacity to communicate in the
language of pilot villages, and local interpreters will be used when required. National activities - such as
vaccination campaigns - also rely on locally-employed vaccinators and information i s provided in local
languages through the national community radio network.

8. Safety of Dams

This policy would not apply to the project. N o dams will be constructed or rehabilitated under the project.

9. Projects in InternationalWaters

The only major irrigation rehabilitation (Caraulun) is located in central Timor-Leste and does not involve
internationalwater issues as defined inthe Operational Policy 7.50.

Since the rehabilitation o f community irrigation schemes is national in scope, there is the possibility that
several o f the schemes may be located in the six International Waterways shared with Indonesia. These
are:

0    Malibaka River in Bobonaro District;
0    Talau River inBobonaro District;
0    Motabicco (Lotan) inBobonaro District;
0    Noel Besi River inOecussi District;
0    Kali Tono River inOecussi District; and
0    Tafara River inCovalima District.

While it is not possible to identify up front the location o f all the community irrigation schemes (they will
be proposed by communities for each season) MAFF will adopt the procedure followed under ARP I1to
screen any proposed schemes near the border with Indonesia that may potentially involve international
waters. MAFF would consult with IDA to ensure that they comply with the exception to the requirement
to inform Indonesian riparians for cases where the works involve only minor additions or alterations to
the ongoing schemes, which "(i) will not adversely change the quality or quantity of waterflows to the
other riparians; and (ii) will not be adversely affected by the other riparians possible water use. In cases



Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    97

where this cannot be ensured, the schemes would not be considered for rehabilitationunder the project.
This exception was granted on September 17, 2003. While there are at present no agreed international
waterway treaties, the need for notification will be reconsidered if required under any future treaties
signedwith Indonesia.


B. Application of Safeguard Policies

Most o f the impacts and mitigationmeasures proposed that would apply to EnvironmentalAssessment,
Pest Management andNaturalHabitats are describedin detail inAnnex 12. This section summarizesany
additionalsafeguardrisks and mitigationmeasures involvingthe applicationof the Forestry, International
Waterways, and Involuntary Resettlement policies, as well as the general approach to assess safeguard
issues, consult with stakeholders, andmonitor compliancewith safeguardpolicies.

1. Completed Studies and Assessments
The project carriedout the following studies andassessments:


    o A review of the environmental impacts and monitoring procedures in ARP 11. This review,
        carriedout duringpre-appraisal (June 4-18, 2003) involvedvisits to project sites infour districts,
        as well as discussions with MAFF and Division of Environment and a review o f project
        documents. The resultingrecommendationswere usedto adjust the environmentalsafeguards o f
        ARP I11and improve their applicability (see Annex 12).

    o A social appraisal of ARP I1and 111, carriedout in February 2003. This involvedfocus group
        discussions with upland, coastal and lowland villages, detailed case studies of larger irrigation
        schemes rehabilitatedunder ARP 11, and interviewswith key service providers. MAFF usedthe
        results ofthis assessmentto helpdesignARP I11(see Annex 11).

        An extensive environmental and social analysis of the Caraulun Irrigation scheme area was
        carried out in 2002-03 by SMEC under contract to MAFF (see Annex 12 and 13). The study
        included extensive field surveys in the Betano area of Manufahi where the scheme is situated.
        Recommendationswere taken into consideration inthe project design.

    o The existing ARP I1 Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework was assessed by
        MAFF and IDA'Sappraisal team, with advice from the World Bank Legal and Social Safeguard
        teams. A revised Policy Guidelines for the Negotiationsover the Use and Development o f Land
        for ARP I11was adopted for project implementationwhich better reflectsthe projectactivities.

2. Potential Safeguard Risks
The project is not expected to have major significant, irreversible or adverse environmental impacts.
Potential environmental impacts would be mitigated according to the measures outlined in Annex 12,
Table 4. This section describes primarily other safeguard risks not covered under the Environmental
AnalysisAnnex.

Forestry

ARP I1did not envisage application of the Forestry Policy. Followinga review of ARP I1community-
basedforest activities, however, itwas agreedthat more attentionto forestrypolicy issues was neededdue
to the number o freforestationandplantationactivities proposedby the target villages. The mainareas of
concern are as follows:

                  Status of communal land planted with project-supportedseedlings, including equity o f
                  access within the village;

             0    The intentiono findividualowners oftrees to harvestthem beyondthe life ofthe project.

Although no disputes have yet been observed, ARP I1raised questions regardingthe tenure status of
communal land plantedwith project-supported seedlings. Traditional mechanisms for allocationof land
ownership anduser rightsvary fromvillage to village, providingdifferent degreeso fcertainty.Ingeneral,
sub-villages (aldeias) are inhabited by extended families and land use is distributed within the village
boundary. Openaccess to grazing andforest land is usually grantedto all village members.Insome areas,
plantingof trees signifies ownership o f the land; in others, only the tree is owned by the individualwho
plantedit. Traditionallaws governingthe harvestingof timber products and generally requirepermission
from traditionalleaders.

Target householdsunder Component 1are giventhe opportunityto participatein project-relatedactivities
by formingsmallgroups to planandmanageactivitiesfundedby Small Group Grants. Whilst this process
i s inclusiveof all households, internalvillage selection processes can limit the number of participants.In
addition, some villages have large numbers of households which inhibits their total representation in
projectplanningand inimplementationgroups at least inthe initial stages. This meansthat insome cases,
only a proportion of the community may be making use of communal land to plant project-supported
seedlings. Whilst this has not yet led to conflicts, when the fruits and/or trees are ready to harvest,
disputes over ownership and distributioncould potentially arise. Consultationwith pilot village groups
revealedthat this is not a major issue in the lifetime of individualparticipants,but as they do not "own"
the land legally, they cannot bequeathtrees they planted to their children, as redistributionaccording to
traditionallaw may occur after their death.

Members of existing groups explained that representation of all households had not been achieved
because some hadnot been interestedin participatinginitially, due to disinterest inthe types of activities
proposed; suspicion that the fundingof activitieswould either not materializeor be appropriatedby a few
inthe village; or becausethey were "too lazy" to contributeany labor (inthe words ofrespondents).Now
that activities are under way however, non-group members inthe communityare seeingthe results of the
seedlingproductionactivities,and some haveexpressedan interest inbecominginvolved.

Another problem identified was that the primary focus o f forest rehabilitation activities is to replant on
degraded land. However consultations revealed that communities are motivated more strongly by the
future economic benefits o ftree plantingrather thantheir environmentalbenefits.Whilst some ofthe land
being plantedis indeed degraded, participantson the whole intendto harvest the resultingtrees even in
these areas. Ifcommunities are to participateinplantingtrees on a voluntary basis, it is essentialthat they
benefit economicallyinthe use of project-relatedforest rehabilitationor plantation,while ensuringat the
same time that the use is sustainable. This will require forward planningto include replantingof trees
harvestedifthe integrityofthe forest cover is to be maintained.

InternationalWaterways


As the locations for community irrigation schemes are not yet defined, there is a risk that they may be
situatedon riversthat share a commonborderwith IndonesiainOecussi, Bobonaro or CovalimaDistricts.


The potentialrisksto Timor-Lestecommunity irrigationprojects are two-fold:

      Upstreamriparianscouldextract more water andthus reducethe flow available for downstreamuse.
      Since the generaltopography of the border is unsuitable for large storage dams and the area ofthe
      communityprojects is very small (less than 0.3 percent) ofthe catchment area, the risks of excessive
      upstreamextractionare low.

      Industrialdevelopment projects which may pollutethe water suppliesmay be locatedinthe future in
      upstreamareas. Giventhe difficulties of access andthe topography ofthe border areas, the potential
      riskofthis occurringis minimal.
There is a potentialrisk for Indonesianriparians located below Timor-Leste irrigation schemes that they
may receive reduced water supplies and that the water may be polluted. However, since the proposed
community irrigation schemes are small in relation to the total catchment area, and the community
projects would not be inthe same sub-catchment, the interactionlower inthe system would be minimal.
For most waterways, Indonesianriparians also occupy a smallproportionof the catchment area (less than
20 percent inBobonaro)andare locatedupstreamfromripariansinTimor-Leste.


Land Acquisition

As stated above, the project is extremely unlikely to require involuntary resettlement. Risks associated
with communityactivitiesunder Components 1 and 2.1 relate to the possibilitythat communitymembers
may bring pressure to bear on individuals to donate their land. In this case, an effective consultation,
verification and grievance process is required to ensure that affected people have recourse to appeal.
Land use agreements will involve informed consent for the voluntary donation of land for use by the
community, These procedures are included in the Policy Guidelines for the Negotiations over the Use
and Development of Land for ARP I11(see Attachment). Inthe case o f the Caraulun irrigationscheme
(sub-component 2.2), where a remote possibility exists that the Government may need to acquire small
areas of land involuntarily to implement the rehabilitation works, provisions for involuntary land
acquisitionhave beenincludedinthe Guidelines.

3. Proposed Measures to Address these Risks
Forestry
The forestry regulatory framework remains a combination of existing Indonesian Law and Regulations
2000/17 and 2000/19 o fthe UnitedNations TransitionalAdministration in East Timor (UNTAET). As a
first step indevelopingNational policy and regulations, MAFF carriedout a policy study entitled"A New
Forest for a New Country", in May 2002. This stressed the importance of developing a policy for
community-basednaturalresources management, includingtenure and user right issues. MAFF proposes
to carry out such a study under Component 4.2 of ARP 111. It is expected that this study will make
recommendations for a new Community-BasedNatural Resources Management Policy in Timor-Leste,
which in turn would guide the implementation o f community forestry and fisheries management
activities. It is expected that key principles of IDA'SForestry safeguards policy would be incorporated
intothis study.




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    100

It is not envisaged that the project would become involved in actual decision-making relating to
traditionalmethods o f determiningland use and access. The resultso fthe Natural ResourceManagement
Policy Study would instead contribute to a clearer policy and legal framework. It is however proposed
that the process of planning community-basedforestry activitiesbe strengthenedto incorporate stronger
principleso fequity andsustainable managementprinciples.This will be done intwo key ways:

     For Small Groups in pilot villages that do not have complete household representation, group
     membership will be reassessedfollowing productionof the first batch o f seedlings througha public
     meeting mechanism. Any additional community members willing to participate as a result of the
     success of the initial seedlings will be offeredthe opportunitytojoin groups or establishnew ones as
     a means of accessing project support. This will provide them with seedlings to plant on their own
     and communal land, andreducethe potentialfor conflict over resource access anduse inlateryears.

     Where plantingis beingundertaken on degraded land (that was unstable andproneto landslide prior
     to planting), consideration should be givento banningfuture harvest usingagreed, traditionalclosure
     processes (tara bandu). Community plans for transplantingfrom nurseries to village land should
     ensure some or all of the degraded land is planted prior to planting on more stable land where
     sustainableharvestingcan take place.A planfor continuedreplantingon communityplantationareas
     should be included in the proposals. Communities will be encouraged to reinstate traditional
     ceremonies of tara bandu regulating the use of reforested areas or plantations. This system,
     previously bannedunder the Indonesianadministration, is presently beingrevivedinmany Timorese
     communities andshouldprovidea solidbasis for community-based naturalresource management.

As a principle, rather than providing seedlings, the project is providing training in seed selection and
propagation (from the many locally available seed types) to ensure that beneficiary groups have the
technicalcapacity to continue replantingbeyondthe life ofthe projectusinglocallyprocuredmaterials.

The project has prepared a `positive' and `negative' list which will govern the nature of activities
supported under Small Group Grants (see Annex 4). The positive list includes nurseries to propagate
mainly locally available tree seeds to be used for reforestation of degraded areas, increasing local
fuelwood supply, introducing improved agroforestry techniques, community management of natural
forests, mangrove rehabilitation, and catchment management. It also allows for the sustainable use of
non-timber forest products (such as honey and medicinalplants). All o f these activities are guided by
sound principles of sustainable forest practices. The negative list prohibits the approval of any activity
with significantenvironmentalimpacts, especially inprotectedareas andcriticalor importanthabitats.

InternationalWaterways

IDA management has provided an exception to the notification requirement under the International
Waterways policy, based on the fact that community irrigationworks will only involve rehabilitationof
existing schemes, and therefore that the quantity of water abstracted will not change from the original
design capacity. The community rehabilitation works are also not expected to affect the quality or
quantityo fwater to Indonesianripariansor be affectedby their water use.


LandAcquisition

The Policy Guidelines for the Negotiations over the Use and Development o f Land for ARP I11(see
Attachment) will guide the process related to the voluntary donation o f land, associated community
compensation arrangements, verification, and grievance procedures. In the event of involuntary land
acquisitionby the Government,the Guidelineswouldprovidefor state-fundedcompensation.

4. Mechanisms and Capacityto Monitor Safeguards
MAFF - in close collaboration with the Division o f Environment (DOE)- will be responsible for
supervising the implementation of environmental management and monitoring procedures. Where
required, MAFF may call on the DOEto assist in the identificationof protected area boundaries and
critical or significant natural habitat areas. As the capacity o f both agencies to identify and monitor
environmentalmitigationmeasuresis weak, trainingmay needto be provided.

Projectfacilitators will be trained inthe applicationofthe Policy Guidelines for the Negotiationsover the
Use and Development of Land for ARP 111. Coordinationwith the Division o f Lands and Property
(Ministry of Justice) has been established, and their advice will be sought, as needed, during project
implementation. Inparticular, district staff from Lands and Property will be involved in any grievances
that may require district intervention.Monitoringforms have been includedinthe Guidelines, as well as
inthe OperationalManuals (see Attachments). The project overall indicatorswill recordthe number of
sub-projects requiringland, as well as any grievanceswhichmay occur (see Annex 3).

For Components 1 and 2.1, the district implementationteams will be requiredto apply a checklist of
possible negative environmentaland social impacts, includedinthe Operational Manuals. The mitigation
measures recommended and agreed by the communities will be included in Community Agreements.
Compliance with these will be monitoredby facilitators and by the district implementationteams. The
project includes an overall environmental indicator measuringthe proportionof community sub-projects
which (a) do not requiremitigationmeasures; (b) fully comply with the measures; or (c) partiallycomply
with the measures. The target achievement is 90 percentby end-of-project(see Annex 3).

For Component 1 activities involvingnurseries, project facilitators will ensure that community meetings
are held following the first round o f seedling productionto re-visit group membership and encourage
wider participation. New group memberswill only be accepted ifthey are willing to contributelabor and
locally availablematerials. This will ensure greater equity of access to community forest land. Details of
this processare specifiedinthe OperationalManual.

The Small Groups Activity Plans will include agreements on which areas cannot be harvested (those
planted in areas prone to erosion) and replantingfor areas intended for future harvest. Ultimately, any
harvesting will not occur until some years after project end. Monitoring is therefore expected to be
undertaken by the Forest Guardiardextensionofficers employed by MAFF (currently around 3 per
district). They will be included in project training for facilitatingcommunity proposal development, and
will be aware of the plans made by the pilot villages for management of project-supportedseedlings.
Whilst it cannot be guaranteed that these staff will still be in placed when harvesting is planned, their
current job description includes working with communities to manage their forest resources on a
sustainablemanner andact on andreportincidences of mismanagement.

Village leaders will also be encouragedto participateinlong-termmonitoring,inparticular, inmonitoring
compliance with the agreements surrounding resource use management made through their traditional
tara bandu system.

The environmental mitigation plan for Caraulun will be included in the tender documents for the
rehabilitationcontractors, as well as the Terms of Referencefor the consultants supervisingtheir works.

The quarterlyprogressreports producedinternallyby MAFF, as well as the bi-annualreports submittedto
IDA will include an assessment of the level of compliance with social and environmental safeguards.
DOEand Lands will be provided a copy of this report and invited to provide advice on improving
environmental compliance ifnecessary.

                                           Attachment: Timor-Leste
       Third Agricultural Rehabilitation Project (ARP 111) Policy Guidelines for the
              Negotiations over the Use and Development of Land for ARP 111



Background

The Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project aims to strengthen the capacity o f the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF)to assist rural communities in increasing their production and
income in a sustainable way. The project was designed as a consolidation phase, with an emphasis on
sustainability of activities, impact of achievements, and quality of outputs. The period of implementation
i s January 1, 2004 - December 30,2007. The project contains the following Components:

Component 1 - Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management, will support
MAFF's main assistance program to upland and coastal communities. It will promote improved self-
reliance and natural resources management to strengthen communities' resilience and make them less
vulnerable to external shocks (such as periodic droughts and chronic food insecurity). It targets an
estimated 50 villages in seven districts - Dili, Lautem, Liquiqa, Manufahi, Covalima, Baucau, and
Oecussi.

Component 2 - Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management, will support MAFF's main assistance
program to farmers in lowland irrigated areas. The component will target about 4,000 rural families inall
13 districts. Activities include about 3,000 hectares of community rehabilitation of small irrigation
schemes and 150 km of rural access roads, and the rehabilitation of the Caraulun irrigation scheme in
Manufahi district.

Component 3 - Services to Farmers, would help institutionalize three basic MAFF services to farmers:
Information, Animal Health, and Agri-Business support. Sub-components are as follows:

     0   Sub-component 3-1, Information to Farmers, will increase MAFF's capacity to provide
         information to farmers and enhance links with international agriculture research, pilot district
         information networks and establish an agro-meteorological network.
     0   Sub-Component 3.2. Sustainable Animal Health Services, will target the estimated 567,000
         rural people living in households which own livestock, providing vaccination and veterinary
         services and establishing a network ofVillage Livestock Workers.
     0   Sub-component 3.3. Supportto Agri-businesses, will strengthen MAFF's advisory services to
         rural producer organizations and assist farmers in grain production, priority niche markets and
         candlenut and coconut oil production.
     0   Component 4 - Program Management, will help MAFF to manage the project, continue to
         develop key nationalpolicies, and strengthen the Ministry's managerial and technical capacity.

Giventhe nature of this project, which involves community based planning and implementation of small
scale activities and rehabilitation of a large irrigation scheme (Caralaun), no adverse impacts are expected
as a result o f land use. However, some Project components may require land. The present ARP I11 Policy
Guidelines have been prepared to guide the preparation and implementation of project components
requiring land, These Policy Guidelines are applicable for the implementation of ARP I11only and, by no
means, shall it be considered national policy for all cases of land acquisition by the State. Its objective is
to ensure that the use or acquisition of land for Project-related activities does not result in loss of




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    103

economic opportunity. It will be the goal of the Project to minimize any economic and physical
displacement of people.

These guidelines includeprovisionsfor:

    1. Voluntary donationof land, or land providedagainst compensationpaidby community members,
         for Small Group Activities under Component 1(ParticipatoryDevelopment andNaturalResource
         Management) and community-owned irrigationschemes under Sub-component 2.1 (Community-
         basedIrrigationandRoadsRehabilitation);and

    2. Involuntary acquisition of land for the rehabilitationof the major irrigation scheme under Sub-
         component2.2 (Rehabilitationofthe Caraulun irrigationscheme)

These Policy Guidelinesare divided into two mainparts. Part Iincludes provisions for: (i)         ensuringthat
all participating communities under Project components 1 and 2.1 (option 1 above) are made aware of
their rights relatingto the provisiono f land as voluntary donation or as communitybasedcompensation;
(ii)verify that voluntary donations or community basedarrangementsfor compensationare indeed
voluntary and appropriate; (iii)verify that the donor is the legitimate owneduser of the land/assets; (iv)
verify that the donor is fully informedof the nature ofthe projectactivity andthe implicationsof donating
the property;and(v) providean appropriate avenue for grievances.

Part I1includes provisionsfor land acquisition against compensation paid by the Government of Timor-
Leste shouldany landacquisitionby the Stateby requiredunderthe Projectcomponent2.2.


Key Definitions

Involuntarv Land Acquisition refers to the taking of land by government for public purpose against
compensation where the landowner must surrender their land involuntarily and has only the right to
negotiate and appeal the amount of compensation proposed. This includes land or assets for which the
owner enjoys uncontestedcustomary rights.

Land refers   to agricultural and non-agriculturalland and any structures thereon whether temporary or
permanent andwhich is requiredfor the Project.

Voluntaw Land contribution refers to a process by which an individual or communal owner agrees to
provide landor propertyfor project-relatedactivitieswithout compensation, or with community-provided
compensation. Voluntary contribution is an act of informedconsent, made with the prior knowledge of
other options available and their consequences, includingthe right not to donate nor transfer the land. It
must be obtainedwithout undue coercionor duress.

OrganizationalArrangements

Overall responsibility for the implementationof these Policy Guidelines lie with MAFF. MAFF will
ensure that the Policy Guidelinesare appropriately disseminated and that project staff have the required
skills and receive appropriate training. The Unit is responsible for proper monitoring o f the Policy
Guidelines and will incorporate necessary changes to the guidelines and procedures based on
recommendationsfrom monitoringexercises andwith the World Bankprior agreement.

Projectfacilitatorsand technicians will be trainedand taskedto ensure that requirements and procedures
of the PolicyGuidelines will be followed as prescribed.

PART I: Voluntary Donation of Land

PART 1.A: Project Component 1.ParticipatoryDevelopmentand NaturalResourceManagement.

 Guiding Principle

Where land is required for implementation of Participatory Development and Natural Resource
Management activities, it must be provided voluntarily in accordance with the process specifiedbelow.
No person will be involuntarily displaced by activities financed by Small Group Grants. Under no
circumstance will the Government of Timor-Leste acquire land for the purpose of implementing
activities funded by SmallGroup Grants, or be requiredto providecompensationto communitymembers
for land utilized by the community for the purpose of Component 1 activities.The Small Group Grants
can not be used for the purpose of providingcompensation in cash or in-kind.These principlesand the
following process are embodiedinthe OperationalManualfor Component 1.

Key Additional DeJnitions

Communi@Facilitatorrefers to project-contractedfacilitators who have been contracted for the purpose
of assisting SmallGroups to develop activitiesunder the Projectfor financingby a SmallGroup Grant. It
may also include MAFF field staff and field staff of the District Administrationoffice following review
at mid-term.

SmallGroups refers to the groups basedat the hamlet level(typically along kinshiplines) formed to plan
andmanageNaturalResourceManagementactivitiesusingSmall Group Grant support under Component
1.

Village ImplementationTeam refers to a team made up of elected representatives o f the Small Groups
with overallresponsibilityfor village-levelmanagementandmonitoringof SmallGroup Grants.

1.Securing of Landfor Small Group GrantActivities

Landmay be secured for use by communitygroups through:

    a) Voluntary Land Contributionswithout Compensation: Individualsor community groups may
elect to voluntarily contribute individual or communal land without compensation for use by the Small
Groupsfor the SmallGroup activities;

    b) Voluntary Land Contributionswith Community-generatedCompensation: Where landowners
or community groups require payment of compensation to provide land for use by the Small Group for
Small Group activities, this compensation must be agreed between them and the Small Group members
(Small Group Grant funds cannot be used to pay for compensation in cash or in-kind nor will
compensationbe providedby the Government of Timor-Leste).



 2. Consultation,I nformation Disclosure and Planning Process




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    105

The consultation, informationdisclosure andplanningprocessfor Voluntary LandContributionswith and
without community-generatedcompensationwill be as follows:

        (a) At the initial broad-based community meetings conducted as part of the Educati,on and
             Information Campaign, the Community Facilitators will inform the participating villages
             about the principles relating to the voluntary nature of land donations, the option for
             contributions o f land with compensation resourced by the Small Group, the procedures of
             Part Iof the Policy Guidelines, and a brief description of the grievance procedures and
             mechanism. The fact that the Small Group Grants are not to be used to provide
             compensation, whether in cash or in-kind, will be emphasized.

        (b) As part of the proposal development process (defined in full in the OperationalManualfor
             Component l),     Community Facilitatorsand members of the Village ImplementationTeam
             will facilitate a meeting with each Small Group to assist in the development of proposals.
             This will includedeterminingthe most appropriate location for the activity. The principlesof
             Part Io f the Policy Guidelines will be reiterated by the Community Facilitators prior to
             commencementof SmallGroup discussions relatingto the proposedactivity.

        (c) Proposed Small Group Activities, with the need for voluntary provision of land with or
             without compensation, will need to include the following information in the Activity Plan
             (proposal) which is submittedto the DistrictManagementTeam:

             1. For any voluntary contributions of individual land, a consent form which includes the
                 name of the land donorh, and details of the contribution (type, size, location, specified
                 period of use etc. as appropriate). This should be signed (or thumb-printed) by the land
                 donorh (includingthe male and female heads of the household involved), the Leader of
                 the Small Group, the Chief of the Village and Chief of the Hamlet and the Leader of the
                 CouncilofElders (or nominee). A sample consent form is includedas Attachment A.

             2. For land contributionsagainst compensation, a consent form which includes the name o f
                 the land donor/s, details of the contribution(type, size, location, specifiedperiod of use
                 etc. as appropriate), and details o fthe agreed compensation arrangements. This shouldbe
                 signed by the land donods (including the male and female household heads), a
                 nominatedrepresentativeofthe group providingthe compensation, (e.g. the Leader ofthe
                 Small Group), the Chief of the Village, Chief of the Hamlet and the Leader of the
                 Councilo fElders (or nominee). A sample consent form is includedas Attachment B.

             3.  Where the land donated is communal land, these forms can be signed on behalf of the
                 Small Group by the elected leader.

        (d) For SmallGroup Activitieswhere landis donatedor providedagainst compensation,the
             DistrictImplementationTeamwill, duringits appraisalof proposedactivities: (i)         verify with
             the landdonorhthat the donation is indeedmade on a voluntarily basis, that the donods idare
             the legitimateownerhserof such lands, andthat the landdonods idare fully informedofthe
             natureo fthe activity andthe implicationsof donatingthe property;(ii)assess that the land
             donor does not suffer a substantial loss affectinghidher economic viability as a resultofthe
             arrangement. Where there is substantial loss the activity cannot be approved as proposed(the
             amount donated should usuallynot exceed 10% of his/her land or assets without an
             appropriate compensation); and (iii)assess that the compensationarrangements are
             appropriate. The compensationshouldbe roughlyequivalent to traditionalcompensation
             arrangements. Where demands are excessive, compensationinappropriateandthe landdonor


Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    106

             andthe communitycannot agree, the Community Facilitatorswill encourage alternative sites
             or arrangements.The activitywill not be approved for fundingby a SmallGroup Grant until
             suitable alternative sites are identifiedand landhas beenvoluntarily made available through
             the process describedabove. Ifno suitable landis made available throughthe VoluntaryLand
             Contributionprocessthe activitywouldnotbe further processed.

        (e) In all cases o f voluntary land contributions,the Recipientshall furnish copies o f all the duly
             signed consent forms to the Directorateof Land and Property of the Ministry of Justice, for
             reference andrecordspurposes.

 3. Complaintsand Grievances

The Community Facilitators will be responsible for ensuring that Small Group discussions during
proposal development - in particular relating to voluntary donation o f land - are transparent and
conducted in a fair manner. During proposal development, the following process for complaints and
grievanceswill be reiteratedto communitiesandfollowed:

    (a) The District ImplementationTeam will invite and address any grievances duringthe verification
        and appraisal process. If a suitable solution is not found, the District Implementation Team
        cannot verify the consent forms and the proposalwill not be submitted for assessment. The issue
        will then go back to the community for discussion. The Small Groups and the Village
        Implementation Team may request the assistance of the Suco and Aldeia Leaders and any
        relevant traditionalleadersto mediate inthe compensationprocess.The mediationprocesswill be
        implementedaccording to traditional methods of mediatiodconflict resolution. The resolution
        will then be documentedon the relevant consent forms and verified following step 2.d above. If
        no resolution is forthcoming, the district office of the Directorate of Land and Property may be
        invited by the Recipient to assist in the mediation process. Until a resolutionis arrived at, the
        SmallGroup Activity planwill not be submittedfor approval.

    (b) At their discretion, the National Management Team may elect, as part of the overall proposal
        assessment process, to re-confirmany consent forms as requiredthrough a verification dialogue
        processas definedabove.

    (c) After a proposal has been completed and verified, the land donods as well as other members of
        the community may raise any concerns they may have with the District ImplementationTeam,
        National Management Team, Suco and Aldeia Leaders, relevant traditional leaders or other
        appropriate authoritieswithin 30 days after the verification meeting. The resolutionwill then be
        documented and the proposaland consent form changed, if needed, and verified by the District
        ImplementationTeam. Ifno resolutionis forthcoming,the activity planwill not be approved.

4, Monitoring

Duringactivity implementation,monitoringwill be conducted by the CommunityFacilitators,the District
Implementation Team and the National Management Team. This will be integrated into the overall
monitoring of Small Group Grant activities. Facilitatorswill be principally responsible for identifying
any adverse outcomes as a result of landdonation. Where disputes occur, either becauseinformedconsent
has been withdrawn or compensation agreements have been reneged on, any further Small Group Grant
disbursement to the affected Small Group activity will be postponed until such time as the dispute has
been resolved.Ifnecessary, the SmallGroup can choose to relocate the activity which would requirethe
re-negotiationof a consent form andverificationas outlinedabove.

 PART 1.B: ProjectComponent2.1 CommunityIrrigation and RoadsRehabilitation

Guiding Principle

Component 2 focuses on the rehabilitationof existingroads and irrigation works proposed and
done by communities and is, therefore, not expected to involve land acquisitionor resettlement.
The specific requirements for Community Schemes (under Activity 2.l),not requiring
Involuntary LandAcauisition, are set out below. These principles and the following process are
embodiedinthe OperationalManualfor Community-basedirrigationrehabilitation.


 Key AdditionalDefinitions

Communitv Contractor refers to the nominated manager of the community contract for
infrastructurerehabilitationandthe community liaisonpointwith MAFF.

Water User Association(WUA) refers to a collectionof ricefarmers sharing a commonirrigation
scheme who are responsible for the managementandminor maintenanceofthat scheme.

1.Securing of Land or OtherAssetsfor Community Contracts

For rehabilitationof community irrigationand roads landmay be secured for use by community
groups through:

   a) Voluntary Land Contributions without Compensation: Individuals or community
groups may elect to voluntarily contribute individual or communal land or assets without
compensation;

    b) Voluntary Land Contributions with Community-generated Compensation: Where
individuals or community groups are not willing to donate land and require compensation for
providing land, they will be eligible to be providedwith compensation in an amount and form
agreed to and provided by the participating community or Water User Association. The
communitycontract funds can notbe usedfor the purpose of providingcompensationwhether in
cashor in-kind, nor will the Government of Timor-Lesteprovidecompensation.

 2. Consultationand I nformation DisclosureProcess

The consultation, informationdisclosure and planningprocess for Voluntary LandContributions
with or without community-generatedcompensationfor communityactivitieswill be as follows:

    a)   The principlesrelatingto the voluntary nature of landor propertydonations as a form of
    community contribution to the rehabilitationworks, as well as the option for contributions
    against community compensation will be disclosed by District Irrigation Officers. This will
    be done during the process of soliciting/preliminary checks of proposals (see Operation
    Manualfor Community Irrigationand Roads Rehabilitation).The fact that the infrastructure
    contract funds are not to be used to provide cash or in-kind compensation will be
    emphasized.

    b)     Once the preliminary selection of schemes to be funded by the project has been
    conducted by the Central Irrigation Team, the District Irrigation Officers will facilitate a
    meeting with all potentially affected landholders to assist in the development of agreements


Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    111

   to maintainthe completed works (all beneficiaries) and, ifneeded, the preparation o f consent
   forms. The principles of these Policy Guidelines as they relate to Activity 2.1 will be
   reiterated by the District Irrigation Officer as a preface to discussing community
   contributions and location of the rehabilitation works. The District Irrigation Officer will
   assist infacilitatingdiscussions, butwill not make any decisions on behalfof the community.
   c) ProposedCommunity Schemes, with voluntary donations of land or provisionof landwith
   community-generated compensation, will need to include the following information in the
   proposal:


   1. For voluntary contributionsof individualland or property, a consent form which includes
        the name of the land donorh, and details of the contribution (type, size, location,
        specifiedperiodofuse, etc. as appropriate to the type of donation). This shouldbe signed
        by the land donorh (includingthe male and female household heads), the Community
        Contractor(or communityrepresentative), and witnessedby the Chief o f the Village and
        Chief of the Hamlet and the Leader of the Council of Elders (or nominee). A sample
        consent form is includedas Attachment C.

   2.    For land or property contributions with community-generated compensation, a consent
        form which includes the name of the land donor/s, details of the contribution(type, size,
        location, etc. as appropriate to the type of donation) and details of the compensation
        arrangements agreed. This should be signed by the landdonods (includingthe male and
        female householdheads), a nominated representative of the community group providing
        the compensation, (e.g. the appointed Community Contractor), and witnessed by the
        Chief of the Village, Chief of the Hamlet and the Leader of the Council of Elders (or
        nominee). A sample consent form which canbe modifiedfor each individualrequirement
        is includedas Attachment D.

   d) For Community Schemes where land is donated or provided with community-generated
   compensation, the CentralIrrigationTeam will, during its appraisal of proposedactivities,as
   the case may be: (i)verify with the land donods that the donation is indeed made on a
   voluntarilybasis, that the landdonods is/are the legitimate ownerhser of such lands, andthat
   the donods idare fully informedof the nature of the works and the implicationsof donating
   the land; (ii)assess that the land donor does not suffer a substantial loss affecting hidher
   economic viability as a result of the arrangement. Where there is substantial loss the works
   cannot be approved as proposed (the amount donated should usually not exceed 10% of
   hidher land or assets without an appropriate compensation); and (iii)assess that the
   compensationarrangements are appropriate. The compensation should be roughly equivalent
   to traditional compensation arrangements. Where demands are excessive, compensation
   inappropriate and the community cannot agree, the Community Contractors will encourage
   alternative sites or arrangements.

   e) In all cases of voluntary land contributions, the Recipient shall furnish copies of all the
   duly signedconsent forms to the Directorateof Landand Property o f the Ministry of Justice,
   for referenceandrecords purposes.




Timor-Leste Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    112

 3. Complaintsand Grievances

The District Irrigation Officers will be responsible for ensuring that discussions during the
formulation of agreements relating to voluntary donation of land and community-generated
compensation are transparent and conducted in a fair manner. Once proposals are submitted,
includingthe relevant forms agreeingto consent for voluntary donation and/or compensation, the
following processfor complaints and grievances is ineffect andreiteratedto communities:

    a) Any grievances should be invited and addressed during the verification and appraisal
    process. If a suitable solution is not found, the Central Irrigation Team cannot verify the
    consent forms and the proposalwill not be accepted for funding. The issue will then go back
    to the community for discussion. The village may ask the assistance of the Suco and Aldeia
    Leaders and any relevant traditional leaders to mediate in the compensation process. The
    mediationprocesswill be implementedaccordingto traditionalmethods o fmediatiodconflict
    resolution.The resolutionwill thenbe documentedonthe relevant consent forms andverified
    following step 2.d above.Ifno resolutionis forthcoming,the districtoffice o fthe Directorate
    of LandandProperty may be invitedby the Recipientto assist inthe mediationprocess.Until
    a resolutionis arrivedat, the work proposalwill notbe submitted for approval.


    b) After a proposal has been completed and verified, the land donorh as well as other
        members o f the community may raise any concerns they may have with the District
        Irrigation Officers, Suco and Aldeia Leaders, relevant traditional leaders or other
        appropriate authoritieswithin 30 days after the verification meeting. The resolutionwill
        then be documentedand the proposal and consent form changed, ifneeded, and verified
        by the Central IrrigationTeam. If no resolutionis forthcoming, the proposal will not be
        approved.

4. Monitoring

Duringactivity implementation,monitoringwill be conductedby the CentralIrrigationTeam and
the District IrrigationOfficers. This will be integrated into the overall monitoringof community
rehabilitationworks. District IrrigationOfficerswill be principallyresponsiblefor identifyingany
adverse outcomes as a result o f land donation. Where disputes occur, either because informed
consent has been withdrawn or compensation agreements have been reneged on, any further
disbursementwill be postponeduntilsuchtime as the dispute has beenresolved. Ifnecessary, the
village can choose to re-negotiate a consent form and verification will be required as outlined
above.

Indicatorswill include:
        -- the number o communitycontracts which have involvedlanddonation;
                          f
           the number o f community contracts which have involved provision of land against

        - the number
           compensation; and

PART II: Involuntary Land Acquisition

Land or other assets relating to the rehabilitation o f roads and existing head works, primary, secondary or
tertiary canals and land or other assets relating to the expansion o f existing primary, secondary or tertiary
canals, or the creation of new canals and other irrigation-related facilities if found to be required during
field investigations, and which would require involunta,wland acquisition by the Government o f Timor-
Leste, may be secured through the provisions o fthese Policy Guidelines.

These provisions relate to Component 2.2 Rehabilitation o f the Caraulun Irrigation Scheme, and will be
included in the tender documents for the supervision o f the Caraulun Rehabilitation Contract. They do
not relate to Component 1 Participatory Development and Natural Resource Management, nor to
Component 2.1 Community-Based Irrigation and Roads Rehabilitation.

For tertiary canals under Component 2.2 that are proposed and implemented by communities the
provisions in Part 1.B o f these Policy Guidelines apply as they will thus be provided for under a
Community Contract arrangement.

Key AdditionalDefinitions

  Compensation refers to payment incash or in kind o f the replacement cost o f the acquired land.

Displaced Person refers to persons who are affected by the involuntary taking o f land resulting in (i)
relocation or loss o f shelter; (ii)loss o f assets or access to assets; or (iii)loss o f income sources or means
o f livelihood, whether or not the affected persons must move to another location.

Replacement Cost refers to the principle o f valuation used to determine appropriate compensation for lost
land or other assets. For agricultural land, it is the pre-project or pre-displacement, whichever is higher,
market value o f land o f equal productive potential or use located in the vicinity o f the affected land, plus
the cost o f preparing the land to levels similar to those o f the affected land, plus the cost o f any
registration and transfer taxes. For houses and other structures, it is the market cost o f the materials to
build replacement structure, plus the cost o f any registration and transfer taxes. In determining the
replacement cost, depreciation o f the asset and the value o f salvage materials are not taken into account,
nor is the value o f benefits to be derived from the project.

Section 1. General Policy. The objective is to ensure that persons displaced either physically or
economically by the Project maintain their livelihood. It shall be the goal o f the Recipient to minimize the
physical and economic displacement o f persons as a result o f the implementation o f the project; provided,
however, when the involuntary acquisition o f land is required, the Recipient shall utilize available land
administered by the Recipient and which the community is not using. Only as a last resort shall the
Recipient acquire land through involuntary acquisition following the below provisions.

   1.1    There shall be no involuntary land acquisition o f land and other assets and resettlement o f people,
          unless absolutely necessary. In particular, acquisition o f sites o f spiritual or cultural significance
          shall be avoided.
   1.2    If such involuntary land acquisition is absolutely necessary then it shall be minimized to the
          greatest extent possible.
   1.3    Plans for involuntary acquisition o f land and other assets and provision o f rehabilitation measures
          will be carried out inconsultation with the Displaced Persons, to ensure minimal disturbance.
   1.4    The Displaced Persons will participate throughout the various stages o f the planning and
          implementation o f the Resettlement Plans. For these purposes and prior to the preparation o f the

                                      Technical Annex 11: Social Analysis

                      TIMOR-LESTE:Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Proiect

A. Introduction

A Social Appraisal was carried out inFebruary 2003 immediatelyfollowingthe mid-termreviewof ARP
11. During the mid-termreview, recommendationswere made basedon a self-evaluationof the quality of
impact o f activities on the farming community. These recommendations will be implemented between
February -December 2003, and continue in ARP 111. Projectimplementers andIDA will needto review
the outcomes at the conclusion of ARP I1 (December 2004) in order to further adjust AFV I11
implementation.

The main theme of the Social Appraisal was to examine how best MAFF could identify and meet the
needsof farmingcommunities, while at the same time contributingto a cultureof empowerment in which
farmers articulate realistic demands for external assistance. The methodology included a number o f
qualitative tools, such as: (a) focus group discussions with sample groups from a mixture of upland,
coastal and lowlandvillages from the north and south (269 men and 125 women); (b) development o f
detailedcase studies o f lightto mediumdamagedirrigationschemesrehabilitatedunder ARP Iand 11; and
(c) interviewswith key service providers.

This Annex summarizesthe resultsofthe Social Appraisal. A complete reportcan be found inthe project
files (see Annex 15).

B.     Key Findings


Component 1. Participatory Developmentand Natural Resource Management

Group Formationand Funds Disbursement

ARP I1required project activities to be implemented with the active involvement of the Conselho do
Sucos (village councils) established under the Community Empowerment Project (CEP), includingsub-
project agreements with the Project Management Unit. Supervision missions during ARP I1notednon-
compliance with this requirement in planning, management and disbursement of funds, and the Social
Appraisalexploredthe issue further to determine suitable solutions.

Non-pilot communities with no experience of managingexternalassistance (except for CEP) were wary
of the involvementof the Conselho do Suco as a possible organizationto planand implement agricultural
activities. This seemed to largely be attributed to the fact that they are perceived to be integrally
connected to CEP and do not yet have a broader role in the community. Instead, non-pilot groups
identifiedthe Chefe do Suco (village chief) and the Chefe de Aldeia (sub-village chief) as the key points
o f contact for planningnew activities, and the most trusted mechanism for receivingand administering
grant funds. They also mentioned the Conselho dos Katuas (Traditional leaders' council) as being
important to decision-making. Normally very active in making decisions surrounding land tenure,
traditional law and naturalresource management ceremonies, they tend not to concern themselves with
`development' or moderngovernance issues, and are more appropriate inan advisory role. With regardto
relyingon existinggroups to plan and implement the activities, a robust tradition of collective action in
formally established, non-clan based `farmers' groups appears to be largely absent from Timorese



Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture RehabilitationProject -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    122

farming communities.This is perhaps a reflectionof low input farming and the relativelyrecent entry of
many village communities into the money economy. Where groups did or do exist, they tend to be
dependent on external support to providethem with a reasonto identify as a group. This is supportedby
the fact that the majority of the non-pilot sucos thought that developing a new group to discuss and
implementa hypotheticalnew agricultural development and manage subsequent funding would be most
appropriate.

Where ImplementationTeams (i.e. "new" groups) had been established in pilot sucos, the communities
were largely content with their performance and nominatedthem as the most effective methodto channel
funds and new agriculturalactivities. The results of the Social Appraisal therefore supports the current
ARP I1 approach to flexibility in establishing new suco-based groups for activity planning and
implementation. This includes assessing requirements for groupings on a suco by suco basis,
incorporating strong, traditional leadership support where it is found to exist, while assisting new
community groups to increase self-reliance through increased democratic decision-making and funds
management.These principleshave been incorporated into the ARP I11design, which no longer mandates
the inclusionof the Conselhodo Suco ina formalrolebut reliesdirectly on the ImplementationTeams.

The identificationo f new groups andtheir members should be done in close collaborationwith the Chefe
do Suco, Chefe de Aldeia andTraditionalLeaders.What will be importantis that all interestedcommunity
membersare providedwith quality informationabout the scope of the potentialactivities, and are able to
nominate themselves if they are keen to participate. Suco government and traditional leaders should be
encouraged to motivate the poorest to become active members to minimize elite capture, rather than
nominate the most progressive/active farmers only (as may have been the case in ARF' 11). The
establishment of equal quotas of men's, women's and mixed groups is includedin the design of ARP I11
as a mechanismto help ensurewomen are givenmaximumchancesto participate.


The difficulty of sustaining purpose-specificgroups will be common to any institution in which the
component is located, i.e. they may only be sustained for as long as the activity is funded. ARP I11will
encourage groups to develop mechanisms for maximizing distribution of benefits arising from grant
activities to the entire suco population. The Operation Manual will include a process to extend the
opportunity to participateto beneficiaries who may not have been interested or been invited to join in
initially, especially in the larger villages. This will be especially important for ensuring equity o f access
for activitiesinvolvingthe use of communallandsuchas reforestation/plantation activities.


The Office of Administrationand Local Government and Development (OALGD) is currently leadinga
process to determine appropriate structures and institutions for local governance from suco to District
level. MAFF, in its important role on the Technicaland PoliticalCommittees (duringthe draftingof the
Autonomy Law) should consider the need for suco level representation to assist in implementationof
their broader programs. If a substantial change to village level administration occurs within the life of
ARP 111, the new suco structure will needto be studied by MAFF to determine whether the component 1
activities would be better planned and implementedthroughthese structures, rather than throughproject-
specific Implementation Teams. MAFF would then assists in overall capacity building of the newly
emerging suco structures by administeringsmall group grants throughthem. This would likely require a
changeto the OperationalManual andpossiblyan amendmentto the GrantAgreement.

With regard to financial disbursement and transparency, communities appear to embrace the idea of the
rightto information, while the holders of money are equally keento avoidsuspicion of misappropriation.
Whilst some form of public display (such as messageboards) is likely to remainappropriate, it will only
serve its intendedfunction if communities are assisted indevelopingmore user-friendlyformats. What is
preferable is that regular community meetings are held at which this information is presented orally for



Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    123

discussion and comment to all interestedparties. In the interests of promotingself reliance, communities
should be encouraged to develop their own plans for ensuring transparency, following an agreed set of
principles as part o f their proposal. These should be endorsed by group members as a prerequisite to
receivingfunding. Revised funding disbursement mechanisms which no longer rely on the Conselho do
Suco Treasurer have beenincorporatedintothe ARP I11design (see Annex 7).

Options for Providing Effective Service Delivery

The most keenly felt loss in agricultural support since independence is the services of the agriculture
extension officers. Their most important contributionsto farmers were the introductionof new varieties
and the establishment of demonstration plots to introduce new technologies. There is a feeling that
`modern' farming practices are the answer to productionproblems, as well as inputs such as improved
seed, fertiliser andpesticides. However, farmers feel decreasedaccess to these inputs, as well as less face-
to-face delivery. One o f the key challenges for ARP 111is to supplement MAFF's limited capacity to
providethese services ina sustainable manner.

In the absence of effective and broad-based extension services, trained facilitators employed by the
project are one of the most viable ways to assist in bridgingthe gap between communities and District
Agricultural staff. It is extremely critical, however, that facilitators receive appropriate training and
support. Attempts to train MAFF staff in participatory planning methodologies have largely been
unsuccessful as they see their role as technical specialists and do not have the time for extended
participatory planning. A desirable outcome from implementationof ARP I11would be to have either
MAFF or the local government hire the facilitatorsto create a permanent interfacebetweencommunities
and technical staff. Budgetary constraints, however, will likely prevent the hiring of additionalstaff for
some time.

The project considered the alternative of using the Sub-District Community Development Officers
(SCDOs) who will be recruitedby OALGD by August 2003 at a rate of 1per sub-district.Their intended
role is to stimulate development at the suco level. As the vast majority will be based in rural areas, their
role in facilitating agricultural planning could be maximized by MAFF. However it was considered
premature to divest greater responsibilityto them under ARP I11as their status and role requires further
clarification under the Autonomy Law, and the needs of the pilot villages at this point may mean they
neglectnon-pilotvillages intheir sub-districts.

Another alternativeis to train the newly recruitedForest GuardiansBxtensionOfficers to gradually take
over the role of facilitators. The major drawback with this approach is that their terms of reference largely
relate to community forestry activities, includingpolicing, and do not extend to other NRMissues. They
could not therefore be expectedto facilitate and integrated NRh4 planningapproach and provide follow
up support in all areas. However under ARP 111, both the SCDOs and the Forest GuardianExtension
Officers will be trained alongside the project facilitators, and will be included as far as possible in the
facilitator teams to ensure the principles of community-based planning are extended into their core
developmentactivitiesbeyondthe life ofthe project.

Many local NGOs are now being supported by internationalNGOs such as Oxfam and Catholic Relief
Services, and organizations such as CARITAS are actively tryingto establishstable, localNGOsthrough
an intensive process of capacity building. The extent to which effective NGOs are represented at the
District level should be assessed by MAFF and contracts for facilitation services considered on a per-
district basis (as an alternative to hiring facilitators), with district agriculture staff providing technical
inputs as required.ARP I11has made provisionsfor the involvementof up to 10NGO contracts. The form
of the NGO contracts will need to be carefully negotiated to ensure that MAFF is satisfied with the
intended outcome, and that the NGOs are able to provide services to an agreed level of quality. NGOs


Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    124

would be encouraged to seek funding from other sources to maintain their relationship with the pilot
communitiesandcontinueprovidingsupport inpartnershipwith MAFF beyondthe life ofthe project.
Underthe remainder of ARP I1and 111, facilitator trainingneedsto be improvedto develop an effective,
participatory planning methodology. This should take into account the broader farmers' priorities in
ensuring food security and self-reliance (such as livestockmanagement, improvedcroppingpractice, and
integratedpest management) rather than an exclusive focus on forestry and fisheries management. The
activities selected by communities should be based firmly on their priority problems, rather than on
activities recommended by the facilitators.ARP I11has acknowledged the need to include other MAFF
divisions in Component 1 through the establishment of an NRM Advisory Committee. Through their
involvement in the component, it is hoped that sectoral staff can further absorb NRM and participatory
planningprinciplesand integrate them into their sectoral programs,

Component 2. Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management

Communityand Light-to-MediumDamagedIrrigation Schemes

ARP I1supervisionmissions indicatedthat farmers in areas where some of the more complex irrigation
schemes had been rehabilitatedwere not yet usingthem optimally - e.g. not planting a dry season crop,
The Social Appraisal highlighted that each irrigation scheme rehabilitated has a set of conditions,
traditions and socio-politicalissues peculiar to the way it functions. The reasons given for sub-optimal
utilization were complex and were often contradictory and confusing - particularly as farmers were
largelybeingaskedto estimatetheir future plantingplans in an uncertainenvironment. An examination of
pre-I999rice growingpatterns was revealinginboththe extent to which rice growingwas subsidized and
supported, andthe unevenadoption of inputs such as fertiliser andpesticides.Baedubu, one of the largest
and most complex irrigation schemes, was kept operational by the Indonesian administration free of
charge (de-siltingthe primarycanal every year) while Bilimauhadassistance from an NGO andthe local
sub-districthead to excavate the intake each year. Neither of the two schemes in Viqueque or Maliana
used fertilizer, and actively rejected it, believing their soil was sufficiently fertile (perhaps because the
majority is croppedonly once ayear). By contrast, the three Oecussischemeswere largelyresponsiblefor
their own maintenance and were using fertilizer and pesticide on a regular basis. Marketing patterns
varied as well. In Viqueque, all surplus produced was sold to the Farmer's Cooperative; in Oecussi, it
was sold in the market at Kefamenanu (West Timor); in Bobonaro, it appeared to be mostly used for
householdconsumption,with some surplus soldto family members inMaliana. Plantinga secondcrop on
the same landwas not widespread, butwas most common inOecussi.

The respective levels of dependency appear to be reflectedinthe post-conflictproductionpatterns, where
the three Oecussi schemes seem to have recovered quickest to pre-1999 production levels (at least in
terms of number of hectares planted), with planting experiencingminimal disruption. Those with major
government and NGO support on the other hand came to an almost complete standstill and were much
slower to overcome productionproblems (whetherthis is coincidentallyan effect ofthe extent ofthe level
of damagethey suffered is not known).The advent o f the drought leadingup to the 2002/2003 wet season
further complicatedthe emerginguse pattern.This may meanthe 2003 dry seasonplantingwill haveto be
delayed until August, and the implications of the late wet season planting will need to be closely
monitoredbeforeconclusionsare drawnregardingoptimaluse.

Water availability aside, farmers raised many other factors that compound their difficulties. They
include: threat of flooding which causes damage to intakes, (and the course of the river shifting away
from the intake); lack of water; longstandingwater divisions accordingto tradition; unsuitabilityof some
areas for planting in both seasons; unsatisfactorysystems of water distribution; lack of or high cost of
tractors; lack of buffalo or buffalo unable to work in the dry season; lack of or poor quality rice seed;
unavailability of other inputs and credit; market uncertainty; difficulty in coordinating the community

when only a few plant in the dry season, and a tradition of plantingcorn and subsistencetendencies. The
interactiono f price, assuredmarkets, rice as a preferredstaple, the capacity to adequately store surplus for
long periods, the reversion to corn as a reliable staple post-1999, and the uncertainty surrounding the
operationand maintenance of their irrigationschemes is complex. It will take some time before a balance
i s struckbetweenperceivedbenefits of increasingproductivityandreturnson labor.

Despite the myriad problems facing rice growers, Water User Association (WUA) board members
interviewedduringthe Social Appraisalseemedcommittedto the idea of WUAs as an appropriate vehicle
for management of their water resources. All were well aware of the burdenof self reliance that hadbeen
placed uponthem and the enormity of the responsibility.They felt it was too early to comment on their
capacity as they had not hada chance to test their WUAs duringa plantingseason. Close monitoringwill
be requiredto ensure the WUAs are appropriate for the task ofmanagingtheir water resourcesequitably.
This may include strengthening the supporting role of the Chefe do Suco or Sub-district Head if the
authority of the WUAs is not sufficient to organize voluntary operation and maintenance works and
ensure compliance with distributionquotas. The ARP I11design includes establishment of more WUAs
and continued capacity buildingto assist them in undertakingtheir tasks. In recognition o f the need to
increase extension services to farmers to improve cultivation practices, provision for on-farm
demonstrations has also beenmade.

Women were under-representedas members of WUAs, and while their importance to the productiono f
rice is acknowledged by men, the tradition of men representing the household in irrigation matters is
strong. Women are consideredto be equally representediftheir husbandsare members, eventhough they
may never attendmeetings or participateindecision-makingdiscussions. WUAs should be encouragedto
progressivelyincludemore interestedwomen as membersto maximizeorganizationalcapacity and skills
within the Associations. As women were not specifically invited to attend initial WUA meetings, a
subsequent roundof meetingsto ascertain their desired levelof involvementshould be conducted as part
of ongoingsupportto WUAs.

 The Large CaraulunIrrigation Scheme

All o f the issues relating to the light-to-medium damaged schemes also relate to the larger Caraulun
scheme. However, the sociological study completed as part of the Feasibility Study (December 2002)
indicateda higher levelo f communitymanagementprior to 1999.Indeed, 14W A Sare reportedto have
been organized at the commencement o fthe scheme in 1995/6with a membership o f approximately 450
male and I50 female members. These were functioning until the scheme sustainedmajor damage during
the 2001 floods, and a relatively high level of cooperation was reported, with groups organized for each
tertiary block and the implementationof agricultural extension activities. Two local field coordinators
paid by the Indonesian Administration provided considerable support. This support will need to be
replicatedby MAFF until the groups are functioning again. The WUA consultants employedunder ARP
I11should be sufficient for this task initially, but MAFF will needto make arrangements for longer-term
support to the WUAs. The recent efforts of the Chefe do Suco to mobilize farmers in October 2002 to
clean the canals in preparation for a pump promised by MAFF indicate a willingness of the WUA
membersto re-starttheir rice production.

The feasibility study identified as a potential concern three unresolved land ownership issues. These
involve: 64 hectares used by transmigrants who have apparently left the area; 165 hectares used by the
church for a youth program, which is now no longer functioning; and 62 hectares of government land
which is currentlybeingusedby local farmers. While no disputes havethus far beenreported, andthere is
apparently a surplus of irrigatedlandcomparedto the amount of families with potentialownership rights,
this will need to be resolved in order for the scheme to be used optimally. With no formal land titling
process in place for the foreseeable future, the reallocation responsibility will rest with Traditional

Leaders, the Suco andAldeia Heads, and the Posto Administrator according to traditionallandallocation
practices. This process should be prompted by the detailed topographic and mappingsurvey which the
project will support prior to the start of the works, identifying individualplots and their "owners". The
projectwill also requirethat WUAs be establishedand land distributionresolvedbefore any rehabilitation
works proceed. By default, the land reallocation process must be completed before this begins, as all
WUA members must have a defined and recognized relationshipto their plot. A similar situation has
occurred on some of the light-to-mediumdamaged schemes (Bilimau in particular) and been resolved
without conflict, and as such is consideredto pose a low riskto the project.

Component 3. Services to Farmers

Sub-component3.1 Informationto Farmers

The Social Appraisal confirmed farmers expressed desire to learn about `new' and `modern' farming
methods. The challenge for MAFF is to develop quality information as a pre-requisite for effective
dissemination.

The overwhelmingly preferred method of delivery is through direct, practical demonstration, which
enhances the adoptionof new varieties andtechniques for largely illiterate farmingpopulations. While it
is acknowledge that MAFF faces problems with a shortage of human resources to support this face-to-
face delivery of technical training, direct extension as a means of effective communicationshould not be
left behindin the rushto develop alternative, less labor intensivesolutions which rely on radio and print
media. ARP I11includes demonstration activities under Components 1 and 2, and MAFF's Information
Section will actively assist in the development of materials and media to facilitate face-to-face delivery.
More traditional methods of informationdissemination will also be utilized. These will include farmer
field days which capitalizeon pre-arrangedactivities(such as vaccinationcampaigns).

To assist MAFF in delivering appropriate informationto farmers, the project will also establish a pilot
community-based information service network. This would rely on simple e-mail communication, and
would be open (on a regulated basis) to District Staff, local NGOs, community radio staff, service
providers and teachers keen to access information from MAFF and internationalcenters of expertise to
disseminate through their current programs. The extent to whichthis informationactuallyreaches farmers
will need to be closely monitored to ensure this approach represents the most effective means of
increasing farmer access to information. Undoubtedly, e-mail access will greatly assist the speedy
responseto implementationdifficultiesand should, at the very least, improveservice delivery.

Sub Component 3.2 Animal Health Services

Vaccinationcampaigns

Farmer expectations that their animals will not get sick if they are vaccinated are largely being met
through the current vaccination campaigns. Where animals were reported to have died following
vaccinations, farmers reportedthat it was becausethey were sick already, and they seemedto understand
that vaccinations will not cure sick animals. All sucos interviewed stated that they would continue to
vaccinate their animals, and that they expected to increase the coverage rate duringthe next campaign-
especially for free-ranging animals. Chickens were largely reported as not being vaccinated. This is
because training for women vaccinators had not yet taken place. ARP 111includes provision for this
trainingand vaccines for this importantsource o fhouseholdincomeandprotein.

The main reasons given as to why not all animals may be vaccinated were related to lack of clear
information or a meeting prior to the campaigns, and more importantly, the difficulty associated with


Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    127

gatheringthe (free-ranging)animals from the hills. Subsequent campaigns should focus on targetingfree-
ranging herds as farmers become more accustomed to the annual event. This may require notifying the
sucos at least one month in advance to enable the community to organize holdingpens and conduct a
coordinatedanimal drive. ARP I11includes an informationcampaign which will pay attentionto timely
delivery regardingvaccination events. The vaccinator's Terms of Reference also include exit reports on
the number of animals not vaccinated and the reasons given by the owners. This information should be
usedto improveMAFF's vaccinationcoverage.

A majority o f groups interviewed indicatedthat vaccination was a service they would be prepared to
consider paying a nominal amount for, in order to continue receiving the perceived benefits. This,
however, has not been widely tested. With the progressive shift in vaccination funding to the
Government, the concept of a fee for service should be gradually tested to ensurethat MAFF can sustain
this importantservice. However it may be premature to do this under ARP I11as the cash economy is still
developinginruralareas andcashshortages may prohibit payment evenwhen the demandis high.

Village LivestockWorkers

Ingeneral, farmers are somewhat fatalistic about animalillness, believingthat once sick, it is better to kill
andeat the animalrather thanattemptto save it with their limitedknowledge andresources. Priorto 1999,
veterinary assistance was not widespread. The difficulties people are experiencing in converting their
animals to cash is a possible disincentiveto treat them, although the needto have significant numbers o f
animals for ceremonial obligations is quite strong, and may provide some motivation to invest in
treatment. It is against this backgroundthat the Village LivestockWorkers (VLW) programwas designed
for ARP I1andwill continue inARP 111.

Although the first batch of VLWs has been selected, trained and equipped under ARP 11, this only
occurred inmid 2003. As such, it is difficult to judge how well they will be acceptedand utilizedby the
farming community. Duringthe Social Appraisal, the VLW program was not yet well known. Once the
program was explained to the groups, the majority indicatedthat they would likely call a VLW to treat a
sick animal. However, this woulddependonthe cost andtheir abilityto pay at the time. All o fthe groups
were supportive of the idea of a VLW - the closer to the suco the better, and all but one thought it an
appropriate role for a woman. Better information dissemination to publicize the program will be
addressed in ARP 111, including during the vaccination campaigns where paid vaccinators will provide
informationto suco with a VLW trained and operating in their sub-district.The tendency to select paid
vaccinators to be trained as VLWs will need to be closely monitoredto see if the combination o f free
service provision(vaccinations) with a paidservice (all other treatments) acts as a disincentiveto service
utilization. The perceptionthat the VLWs are government employees paid regular wages will need to
countered ifthey are expected to thrive as private service providers.In addition, the dependenceon paid
vaccinators may be limiting the opportunity for women to take up these positions. Recruitmentunder
ARP I11shouldtake bothofthese issues into account.

Sub-component 3.3 Agri-BusinessServices
The need for marketing services is a priority which continues to be expressed by farmers producing
surplus rice and cash crops in particular. Whilst the Agriculture Service Centers (ASCs) supportedunder
ARP Iand I1 are well targeted to meet this need, during the Social Appraisal the level o f farmer
awareness of the ASCs appearedto be low. Farmers who hadnot heard of the ASCs (or hadnot had any
dealings with them) had difficulty in conceptualizingwhat sort o f servicesthey might be able to provide.
In Viqueque, as discussions were with rice farmers, they were interested in their ASC expanding to
provide rice-relatedinputs.Pesticide was specifically mentioned, as this usedto be providedby a farmer
cooperativeat the sub-district levelandwas no longer availablefor purchase. Oecussifarmers by contrast

cannot be sold). Further discussions with farmers need to take place to determine other needs that the
Agri-BusinessUnit couldaccommodateby diversifyingservicesno longer available to farmers.


Conclusion

Recognizing that Timor-Leste is an emerging country with local government structures and service
delivery mechanisms still in their development, the Social Appraisal for ARP I1recommended that an
assessment o f social appropriateness become an integral, continuous part of the program. The idea is to
make certain that the assumptionsconcerningthe services providedand its impacts were actually correct,
and suggest changes if they were not. The Social Appraisal for ARP I11supports this recommendation.
Supervisionmissions should continue to providethe vehicle for strategic shifts in approaches to respond
to evolvingneeds.

                              Technical Annex 12: Environmental Analysis

                        TIMOR-LESTE: Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Project

A. Introduction

ARP I11was designed primarily as a continuationand consolidationphase of ARP 11. Therefore no new
activitiesthat couldhave potentialenvironmental impactsare anticipated.

The project will finance four major components: Participatory Development and Natural Resources
Management, IrrigationRehabilitationandManagement, Services to Farmers, andProgramManagement.
Project components with potential for environmental impacts are mainly found in the Participatory
Development and NRM and Irrigation components. As such, these components form the focus o f the
environmental analysis. Other activities - information to farmers, re-establishment o f an agro-
meteorological network, sustainable animal health services, agri-business support, policy development
andtraining-are not expectedto have significantenvironmental impacts.

Duringpre-appraisal, IDA reviewedlessons learned with environmentalprocedures adopted duringARP
I1 to determine the degree of impact and assist MAFF in revising the procedures according to past
experience. This environmentalreview took place on June 4-18, 2003, and involved field visits to the
districts of Lautem, Manufahi, Bobonaro, and Baucau. Discussions were also heldwith MAFF staff and
officials fromthe Division of Environment.

This Annex outlines the environmentalsafeguards of the overall project, based on lessons of experience
fromARP 11. The Annex will also serve as a guidelineto ensure that the relevant OperationalPolicies are
followed shouldany negativeenvironmentalimpacts occur.

The environmental review concluded that the project would not entail any major sign@cant, complex or
irreversible environmental impacts. N o works would be undertaken that could affect protected or
vulnerable ecosystems. The projecthastherefore beenclassifiedas EnvironmentalCategory B.

The project is expectedto result in environmental benefits from improvednaturalresourcesmanagement.
MAFFwill follow the environmentalmitigationmeasuresrecommendedinthis analysis andmonitortheir
compliance by includingthem into operational manuals for the respectivecomponents and inthe terms of
reference of engineeringsupervisionconsultants (for the major irrigationworks inCaraulun).

B. Institutional Context

Timor-Leste's environmentalreview procedures were formulated recently and are generally consistent
with the World Bank and European Commission criteria. These procedureswill form the framework for
the project's approach to environmentalmanagement. Even though ARP I11activities are expected to
have no major adverse effects, MAFF will institutescreeningandreviewingproceduresto ensure that any
emergingproblems are discussedandcorrectedina timely manner.

There have been recent improvements in the institutional framework of the Division of Environment
(Ministry of Development and Environment). A new environmentalregulationsimilar to the Indonesian
Environmental Management Act No. 23/1997 has been drafted and is expected to be approved by the
Secretary of State for Development and Environment at the end of 2003. Several Indonesian and
UNTAET laws and regulations are still applicable, includingRegulation on Analysis of Environmental
Impacts No 27 of 1999; Regulation Concerning the Control of Water Pollution No 20 of 1990; and



Timor-LesteThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    130

Regulation on Protected Places No. 2000/19. UNTAET drafted an interimRegulation on the Importation
and Use of Agriculture Chemicals in East Timor which is in line with the Food and Agriculture
Organization International Code of Conduct on Distribution and Use o f Pesticides, the Stockholm
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and the Rotterdam Conventionon Prior InformedConsent
Procedures for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade. However, this
regulation has not yet been officially adopted. With the exception of the UN Conventionto Combat
Desertification, which Timor-Leste accessed on August 20, 2003, the country is not yet a party to
internationaltreaties. Discussions are well underway for Timor-Lestetojoin the BiodiversityConvention
andthe RamsarConventionon Wetlands.

InARP 11, MAFF undertookthe initial environmental screeningofvillage projects (under Component 1)
and irrigation schemes. The screening criteria were derived from those followed by the Community
Empowerment Project and originally from Indonesian environmentalscreening criteria, adapted to the
environmentalcontext of Timor-Leste. Improvedcriteriahave been includedinthe Operational Manuals
for the two components.

MAFF will collaborateclosely with the Division of Environment in supervising the implementationof
environmental management and monitoringprocedures. Training will be provided in identificationand
minimization o f potential environmental impacts for project-relatedactivities. In addition, MAFF will
provide the Division of Environment with copies of its quarterly and biannual progress reports, which
will include a summary of any environmental issues encountered, the status of the environmental
indicatorindex adoptedfor the project,andany proposedmitigationmeasures(see Annexes 3 and 10).

C. Environmental Aspects

Component 1:Participatory Development and Natural Resources Management

This componentwas designedas a continuationof a similar componentunder ARP 11.The environmental
analysis focused on the revised positive list of village activities, as well as actual activities under
implementation in ARP I1 pilot villages. The review concluded that due to their small scale, the
environmentalimpactofvillage projects inthe short-termis not expectedto be significant.

Activities promoted under this component are expected in generalto have positiveenvironmentaleffects.
They include: (a) reforestation and rehabilitation of denuded communal areas within participating
villages; (b) rehabilitationof selected catchment areas, thus enhancing the quality and quantity of water
supply for domestic and agricultural use; (c) community management of natural forest areas; (d)
mangrove rehabilitation, potentially improving productivity of fisheries resources; (e) community
management of coastal fisheries and marine resources; (f) community nurseries to propagate fruit and
forest tree species; (g) agro-forestryactivities to promote alternative systems to shifting cultivation; and
(h) soil and water conservation structures in individual farms. By encouraging better natural resources
management, the component should also help decrease local vulnerability to climatic events such as
droughts and floods.

The mainenvironmentalissue envisagedduringproject implementation(based on the experience of ARP
11) is the disposal of large numbers of polybags (plastic bags used for seedlings). The recommended
environmental mitigation measure is proper disposal of the polybags by farmers. MAFF should also
encourage farmers to reuse the polybags or use local recyclable materials like bamboo tubes. In the
facilitator training sessions, MAFF will incorporate training on the reuse of polybags, and more
importantly,the use of locallyavailablebiodegradablesubstitutes.




Timor-LesteThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    131

Small freshwater fishponds in upland areas require minor excavation works by communities.
Observations in the field      indicate that this generally takes place in land with little alternative use.
However, MAFF should ensure that the ponds are constructed at minimumdistances from waterways and
that farmers use only local feeds (e.g. corn scraps).                Aquaculture proposals involving mangrove
conversion(e.g. shrimp) or relying on wild broodstock (e.g. grouper mariculture) would not be supported.
ARP I1adopted an environmentaland social check-list to screen potential proposals. This form has been
adjusted and simplified so that district staff and facilitators can use it as a practical environmental
management guideline (or more likely as a best practice), The table below summarizes the recommended
mitigation measures, which have been incorporated into the Operational Manual for Component 1.

Although Component 1 will not finance pesticides and fertilizers, it is possible that farmers may adopt
new farming practices that may require them. Ifthis occurs, the application of these agrochemicals would
follow the World Bank's Operational Policy 4.09, which excludes all Class Itoxic pesticides (see list in
Table 2). MAFF would also not support any Class I1moderately hazardous pesticides under the project.
As an additional mitigation measure, MAFF staffwould provide training for these farmers inthe selection
and safe use of appropriate agrochemicals.

Component 2: Irrigation Rehabilitationand Management

Community Irrigationand Roads Rehabilitation

Timor-Leste has 346 small irrigation schemes with a design area covering 41,092 ha and a functional area
covering 21,000. Virtually all needed rehabilitation following the 1999 violence. To date, ARP Iand I1
have rehabilitated 9,892 ha or 49 percent of the area in need of rehabilitation.                 Under ARP 111, an
additional 3,000 ha of irrigable land would be rehabilitated in all 13 districts. The schemes are scattered
throughout the country and are therefore not expected to have any significant cumulative or regional
impacts.

None of these works will have significant, complex or irreversibleadverse environmentaleffects, since
they will be carriedout only in pre-existingschemes. The activity will therefore not endanger protectedor
vulnerable areas or habitats. Potentialimpacts should be short-term, localized and readily prevented or
mitigatedby good engineering design and constructionpractices, reinforcedby adequate supervision by
MAFF staffoftarget communities.

An estimatedtotal of 150 km o f agricultureaccess roads (unpaved) will be rehabilitatedand maintained
through community participation. This activity is not expected to produce significant negative
environmentalimpacts as it involvesthe rehabilitationof existingunpavedroads, without any lengthening

or enlargement o f alignment. Local communities will undertake the work using hand tools and local
materials. Based on ARP Iand 11, the roads will be scattered through the 13 districts, and are not
expectedto haveany significantcumulative or regionalimpacts.

The main anticipatedimpacts of road rehabilitationwill be soil erosion and possible land slides in hilly
areas. During the design and constructionphases, MAFF will adopt the following mitigation measures:
(a) encourage communities to plant bush grass or buildretainingwalls in slopes and suitable places along
the road side to prevent soil erosion; (b) on sections with high filing and deep cutting, encourage
communities to cover slopes with stone pitchingand plant steep slopes with grass; (c) in sections along
the river, encourage communities to properly dispose of earth and stone to avoid blocking rivers,
adversely impacting water quality; and (d) encourage construction of drains and culverts to provide
adequatedrainage.

After rehabilitation, MAFF should encourage communities to maintain road surfaces, drains and
shoulders by periodically clearing drains to ensure water flow. Regular maintenance would help reduce
environmentalimpactscausedby continuingdeteriorationofroadconditions.

Environmental mitigation measures for community irrigation and roads rehabilitation have been
incorporated into Operational Guidelines, andwill be monitoredunder the project(see Annexes 3, 10).

Rehabilitationof Major Irrigation Schemes

The only major irrigationscheme proposedfor rehabilitationis Carulun, inthe district of Manufahi. This
scheme serves a potentialirrigablearea of 1,030 ha.

Rehabilitation o f Caraulun is unlikely to create any major adverse environmental impacts. No new
construction/structureof significantsize would be built.The major rehabilitationwork is the construction
of a new free intake at the existing intake site, but with an invert level 1.7 meters below the river bed. A
new channel would be constructed through the existing masonry sedimentation basin and canal. The
existingcanals will also be rehabilitated.

Operationo f the irrigationscheme is not expectedto result in significantnegative environmentalimpacts
as it would bring back water into previously irrigated areas. Since irrigationwater is generally diverted
from river flows duringand immediatelyafter the rainy season, the rehabilitationofthe scheme would not
affect ground water supply but may reduce slightly the amount of runoff water that goes to the sea. No
salinationnor water loggingare expected.

During ARP 11, MAFF commissioned a comprehensive feasibility study for major-damaged irrigation
schemes which includedan environmentalanalysis (see SMEC 2003. Feasibility Study Report of Seical
Up, Maliana I,Uatolari and Carulun Irrigation Schemes, Annex 6). The study indicatedonly relatively
minor potential impacts. There are no protected areas or cultural sites within the scheme area. Negative
impacts couldpotentiallycome from: (a) erosion andscouring o f river banks; (b) indiscriminatedumping
o f excavated sediment deposits and other materials from the canals, drains, and structures during
constructionand maintenance; and (c) environmentaldamage caused by contractors during construction
activities. The recommended mitigationmeasuresto address these potential impacts include: (a) gravel
managementto maintainthe river course during low and medium flows; (b) community-based catchment
managementto reducethe loss o fvegetation on the slopes; (c) managemento f constructionworks during
constructionincludingdisposalof sewage, disposal of spoil from canal desilting,and appropriate location
of constructioncamp; (d) protectionof flora and fauna; and (e) addressinghealth issues such as potential
for increasedmosquitobreeding grounds intemporary ponds.




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    135

The identified list of potential environmental impacts from rehabilitationof major damaged schemes is
includedinTable 3 below, along with the recommendedmitigationmeasures shouldthese occur. MAFF
will ensure that these measures are incorporatedinto the scope of works for the contractors as well as the
terms o f reference for the engineeringsupervisors. Relevantmitigationmeasureswill also be integrated in
WUA and stafftrainingmaterials.

Rehabilitationo f Carulunis expectedto also havepositiveenvironmentalimpactsthrough: (a) cleaning of
the main canals, drains and removal of deposited debris and other unwanted materials; (b) repair and
improvement o f canals and drainage channel banks; (c) removal of areas of stagnant and standing water
through cleaningo f drainage canals and drainage systems; and (d) improvement of water managementby
providing better access to control structures and to gates, improvement of outlets to farms and the re-
establishment of Water User Associations.

Component 3: Services to Farmers

This component is not expected to have any significant environmental impacts. The project would
support better informationto farmers which should help encourage sustainable agriculture and natural
resourcemanagementpractices. The projectwould also support the restablishmentof a networkof agro-
meteorologicalunits and rain gauges. The automatic units would be installedin pre-existingsites. The
rain gauges may requirethe constructionof minor fences (about 9 m2)to protectthem against vandalism,
but this should not entailany major environmental impact.The agro-meteorologicalnetworkwould be an
important source o f informationto help MAFF and other government agencies identify vulnerable areas
to droughts and floods andconsequently develop appropriatepolicyresponses.

The Support to Agri-Business component is expected tcI support the establishment of small village
coconut and candlenut oil mills and grain seed producers (mostly rice and maize). The proposed
feasibility study for coconut and candlenut oil processing will include recommendations on the proper
disposalof organic waste and any mitigationmeasuresrequired.

Extension support to seed producers is likely to entail distribution (by MAFF) of small quantities of
pesticides and fertilizers. If so, the procedures described for Component 1 (includingcompliance with
OperationalDirective4.09 on Pest Management) would apply. The Sustainable Animal HealthServices
sub-component would focus on vaccinationand animal healthand is not expectedto have any significant
environmentalimpacts. Vaccinationsyringes are re-usedextensivelyand their disposal is not expected
to be problematic.

Component 4: Program Management
This component would not have any significant adverse impacts on the environment. One of the policy
studies proposed by MAFF would cover community-based NRM which is expected to improve the
overallpolicy frameworkfor environmentalmanagement inforest and coastalareas of Timor-Leste.

Conclusion
The overall potential environmental impacts o f the project and remedies proposed are summarized in
Table 4 below. Activities under Component 1 are small in nature and would generally improve
environmentalconditions. Component 2 only includes rehabilitationof existing irrigationschemes and
roads-the quantity of water extracted would not change significantly from the original design capacity.
Any shortages in water for irrigationare more likely to be relatedto shifting river courses from braided
rivers rather than reductions in supply or project-relatedimpacts. No significant regional or cumulative
impacts of project activities are expected, since Component 1 operates in 50 villages spread over seven
districts, and Component2 inall 13 districts of Timor-Leste.

                       TIMOR-LESTE: Third Agriculture Rehabilitation Proiect


This Annex summarizesthe technicalassessmentof projectcomponents.

Component 1: Pilot Participatory Development and Natural Resource Management

This component buildson the introductionof a more integratedapproachto naturalresource management
(NRM) to increase sustainable productivity and decrease vulnerability in target upland and coastal
villages. This is a shift from MAFF's current subsector-based approach to providing assistance. A
national levelAdvisory Committee will lead the effort to achieve better integrationo f community-based
activities. The focus on devolving responsibility for natural resource management (NRM) to the
communities, and attempting to address user right security through a concurrent policy study, is
consistent with provenfarmer-first approaches in other developing countries. The strengthenedpositive
list o f activities offers technically simple, proven alternatives which continue to be adapted for
implementation in Timorese villages. These include improved forage production, planting of higher
yielding staples, andthe promotiono f traditionalmechanismsto planandrespondto climatic fluctuations
includingdroughts andfloods.

In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of an integrated village-based program, provision of direct
grants to farmers' groups is appropriate to enable sufficient experimentation with options. Community
capacity and experience in planning, financing, implementing and monitoring their own development
activities is still limited in Timor-Leste. However, the provision of direct grants to communities in
countries around the world has demonstratedthe potentialof this mechanism to promote demand-driven
development,It is also consistent withthe Government's objectiveof strengtheninglocal governance.

Component 2: Irrigation Rehabilitation and Management
The approach followed by the project to concentrate on rehabilitating existing irrigation schemes is
considered appropriate. Further rehabilitationof irrigation schemes will reduce the risks to food scarcity
causedby droughts, as indicatedby the recent FAO/WFPreport15whichreporteda 12percent increase in
rice harvest in 2003 at the same time as the yield of other food crops dropped (largely due to irrigation
rehabilitation).
Community-based rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation schemes and farm-to-market access roads
startedunder ARP Iand I1will be continued under the project.Ineconomic terms, rehabilitationof these
schemes is highly viable (see Annex 9). They have also shownto have generatedconsiderable benefits to
communities in terms of creatinglocal employment as well as contributingto an increase in production.
To strengthen farmers' capacity and improve operation and maintenance, one pilot Water User
Association(WUA) will be organizedineach district.

The 10 WUAs formed on the light-to-medium damaged irrigation schemes under ARP I1 will be
strengthenedfurther to ensure active participationof men and women farmers inthe managementof their
irrigationschemes. The technical advice and further training provided by MAFF staff will improve the
efficiency of the WUAs, particularly ifstaffcould learnto work in inter-sectoralteams (Irrigation, Crops,
Livestock and Research and ExtensionDivisions)to respondto farmers' needs for an integratedfarming
systems approach.

The topographic survey and mapping activities will provide detailed and accurate plans of completed
irrigationschemes and are expectedto facilitate their utilization and effective operations by WUAs. The
training providedwill also improve the capacity of MAFF staffto carry out future irrigation design and
construction-relatedactivities.


TechnicalJustificationfor Rehabilitationof Caraulun

ARP I1carried out a feasibility study for major-damaged irrigation schemes. One economicallyviable
scheme (Caraulun) will berehabilitatedto its originaldesign capacity to enable farmers to planttwo crops
per year. The contract for constructionwill be awarded competitively. A qualifiedengineering firm will
supervise the works. Based on the lessons of ARP I1where farmers were slow to take advantage of the
larger rehabilitatedschemes, a number of pre-conditionswill be requiredprior to the start of the works.
These are outlinedinthe Attachment to this Annex.

The feasibility study considered various alternatives for rehabilitating Caraulun's headworks, including
reconstruction o f the original fixed weir, free intakes either constructed annually or as a permanent
structure, andpumping. All these techniques couldbe usedto ensure deliveryof water to the projectareas
for irrigation.However,boththe weir reconstructionas well as pumpingwere rejected on the following
grounds:


0   The estimated cost of constructiono f the fixed weir was excessively high, based on an assessment of
    the poor foundationconditionswhich consisted of gravels and large cobbles, and the potentialscour
    depth(up to 5.5 metres). The economic analysis indicatedthe weir optionwas uneconomic.

0    Pumping the water required for the project would require high annual operation and maintenance
    costs, which could not be funded by the WUAs, making the project unsustainable since it would
    require annual Government interventions.

The selected option was a free intake to supply irrigation water only to the left bank area, with water
diverteddirectly from the river. This option is technically and economicallyfeasible and relatively easy
to operate andmaintain.Although the Caraulunriver is wide and braided, with itswidthvaryingfrom 150
to 500 meters upstream from the weir site, there are a number of low flow channels which run along the
left bank, and the assessment is that flow concentrations will continue along the left side of the river,
supplyingwater into the free inlet structure. Constructinga new intake structure with a lower invert level
located at the upstream edge of the existing weir apron would allow flow to enter the flume, while
minimizingdebris and sediment inflow.

The feasibility study modeled and evaluated the existingcanal system. Generally no major changes are
necessary for the irrigation system to deliver water supplies to 1,030 hectares. The rehabilitationworks
include mostly de-silting and repairs to the existing structures, with two new siphons on the Caraulun
secondary canal.

The engineering works proposed for the rehabilitation of the Caraulun Scheme appear appropriate,
technically feasible and sustainable, with operation and general maintenance by the WUAs possible.
Some long-termcommitment is requiredof the Government for major maintenance works which will be
required on the intake structure. More details of the technical assessment o f and preconditionsfor this
activity are providedinthe Attachment to this Annex.

Component 3 : Services to Farmers

Information to Farmers

This sub-component builds upon lessons from ARP Iand 11, experience from other developingcountries,
andthe expressedneedofTimorese farmers to foster effectivetwo-way communicationflows.

Access to appropriate andtimely informationhas consistently beenidentifiedby farmers as a major need,
particularly in the present context where extension support is scarce. A participatory approach to
informationdelivery through face-to-face contact with farmers will increase their knowledge and skills.
This will be coupled with the use of mass media-particularly               national and local radio broadcasts-to
maximize information dissemination through agriculture programs, generate demand for services, and
raise awareness. To ensure sustainability,capacity and resources will be strengthenedat the local level.
Training on basic communications and informationwill increase the ability to better identify needs and
issues, and choose appropriate communication methods and materials. Further, the functions o f the
CGIAR Liaison Secretariat at MAFF, established under ARP 11, will be streamlined to develop a rapid
response system to timely address farmer's immediate needs, and enhance the institutionalknowledge
base. A point-to-point e-mail communications network-successfully                    implemented in the Solomon
Islandsthroughthe PeopleFirstNetwork(PFnet)-using solar-poweredcomputers andradio connectivity
is expected to expand MAFF's dissemination efforts by making e-mail accessible to other development
partnersworkingwith farmers (e.g. NGOs).

The component also targets the re-establishment o f a network of agro-meteorologicalstations to enable
MAFF to collect and processbasic informationon rainfall, temperature, humidity, and evaporation. This
informationis becoming increasingly important to allow policy makers and potentialdonors to identify
highly vulnerableareas proneto droughts andfloods, andthereby permita better targetingof assistance.

The comprehensive approach proposed for information services will seek to optimize information on
demand. It is also consistent with MAFF's prioritization and sequencing exercise that identified
informationas one ofthe highest programpriorities.

Sustainable Animal Health Services

MAFF will continue to support the vaccinationcampaignsthat commenced inARP I,to ensure no major
outbreaks o f animal diseases. The 2002 Poverty Survey had indicatedthat nine in ten ruraldwellers live
inhouseholds that own animals. The inabilityof very poor householdsto pay for vaccines may put other
livestock at risk by reducingcoverage. The government has therefore decidedto continue vaccinationas
a public service in the short-term.To ensure financial sustainability, it was agreed that the vaccination
program will be carried out on a 3-year phasing out formula of external assistance, with EC/TFET
financing75%, 50% and 25% o fthe campaigncosts, andCFETfundingthe remainder.


The Village Livestock Workers (VLWs) Programbuilds on the successful Cambodian model of village
para-vets,aimed at traininga privatizedcadre of animalhealthworkers to serve ruralcommunities. About
265 VLWs will be trained on basic animal health and livestock production topics to enable them to
provide advice to farmers for a fee. MAFF could also contract out VLWs for its annual vaccination
campaigns. Eventually, there would be one VLW per two villages, covering all 498 villages in 13
districts. This is consideredan appropriate approachto provideminor veterinaryservices giventhe severe
shortages of trained veterinarians and MAFF livestock staff. To ensure quality control, MAFF will




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004       142

provide refresher training courses to VLWs every six months, and help establish a VLW Associationto
facilitatefurther training,certify its membersandfacilitatethe procurementofveterinarysupplies inbulk.

Supportto Agri-business

ARP Iand I1 established three farmer-owned Agriculture Service Centers (ASCs), to facilitate the
marketingof agriculture products and sales o f critical inputs (e.g. seeds and fertilizer). Althoughthere is
no further needfor ARP I11to invest in additionalASCs, MAFF will create, throughthe project,an Agro-
Business Support Unit to continue to provide advisory services and training to rural producer
organizations. Inaddition,MAFF will target the development o f two promisingniche markets: certified
rice production in the main rice producing areas (Viqueque, Bobonaro and Baucau); and promotion o f
coconut andcandlenut oil processingat the village level.

Availability of certified seed continues to be a major constraint to increasing rice production in the
country. The projectproposesto assist some 30-40 rice seedgrowers, help them establish a SeedGrowers
Association and assist them in initial marketing and quality control. This activity will be linkedto on-
going initiatives such as the ACIAR-funded Seeds for Life Project, and emerging partnerships with the
InternationalRiceResearchInstituteinthe Philippines.

The establishment o f about 12 small scale village-type oil mills in the production areas is expected to
generate value added products and employment in the villages. A feasibility study to be carriedout by
GTZ will providethe economic context andbasisfor implementationofthis activity.

Component 4: Program Management

The project will continue to support priority policy and organizational studies, through high-level
advisors to MAFF. The scope of the studies and advisory services will be left flexible to meet evolving
needs. This sub-componentwill be closely linkedto MAFF's new Policy and PlanningUnit, and enable
MAFFto helpconnect its new policieswith those o fother agencies involvedinregionaldevelopment.

                     Attachment: Technical Evaluation and Pre-Conditions for the
                                     Rehabilitation of Caraulun Irrigation Scheme



A. Technical Evaluation

1. Location and Background

The Caraulun Irrigation Scheme is located in the District of Manufahi, about 20 km south of the district
capital, Same. The scheme is designed to use the water from the Caraulun River, a wide, braided river
discharging into the Timor Sea at Betano. The construction of the Caraulun Project commenced in 1991,
and the civil works were substantially completed in 1996.The scheme consisted of a fixed weir across the
approximately 90 meter wide river, with intakes designed on both the left and right banks. However, only
the canal distribution system on the left bank was completed. This consists of a 2,200 meter long masonry
paved main canal, and two secondary canals which branch off to the left and right o f the system at a
regulating structure.

2. Economic Feasibility

The feasibility study carried out under ARP I1showed the following comparative costs of rehabilitating
the four major damagedirrigationschemes inTimor-Leste:

   Source: SMEC 2003. Feasibility Study Report of Seical Up, Maliana I,Uatolari and Carulun Irrigation Schemes
    Note: Area used in comparison is area proposed for first rice crop.

Although the total area planned to be planted for the first rice crop on Caraulun is more than 50% greater
than any of the alternative schemes, and is double the proposed area in Seical Up and Maliana, the total
rehabilitation costs for Caraulun is only approximately 50% of the cost of the next least costly project,
Uatolari.

The considerable difference in the costs of rehabilitation is reflected in the Economic Rates of Return
(ERRs) estimated for each of the schemes. Using a conservative approach based on the observed
development progress on the Light-to-Medium Damaged schemes rehabilitated under ARP Iand ARP 11,
the ERRsfor the four schemes includedinthe SMEC Study were as shown inTable 2 below.

    Source: SMEC 2003. Feasibility Study Report of Seical Up, Maliana I,Uatolari and Carulun Irrigation Schemes. The
estimatedERR for this study (22.9%) has beenreducedto conform with the project assumptions of 160% cropping intensity.

The economic analysis indicatesthat only Caraulunand Maliana 1 are economicallyviable. However due
to budget limitations, the rehabilitation of only one of these schemes was possibleunder ARP 111.Clearly,
the rehabilitation ofCaraulunrepresentedthe best option.

3. Economic Analysis
The base case scenario for the economic evaluationfor the Caraulun Project was based on the following
assumptions:

     0   First rice (wet season paddy) crop was assumed to yield 2.0 tonsha after rehabilitation,
         increasingto 2.5 tons/ha. after 5 years;
     0   Second rice (dry seasonpaddy) was assumedafter rehabilitation to yield 2.0 tonsha. after 5 years
     0   Incremental operating and maintenance costs are assumed at US$30/hectare per year, plus
         US$10,000/year for the headworks, with the cost building up at 10/50/100percent over a three
         year period.

These assumptions are conservative, but perhaps realistic based on the actual progress made on the
completed light-to-medium schemes to date.

However, even with these assumptions the ERR for the Caraulun scheme is 22.9%. The reasons for the
high ERRare relatedto the low costs per ha of rehabilitating the scheme:

     0   The Caraulun scheme will cover 1,030 ha, which is much higher than the other three systems
         included inthe feasibility study. The cost for rehabilitating the headworks per hectare is therefore
         reduced.
     0   The design for the new Caraulunheadworks is muchless expensive than for other schemes, since
         the modifications to the existing scheme do not requirea long ungatedfree intake flume which is
         necessary onthe Seical Up and Uatolari schemes.
The costs for rehabilitating the canal network are also considerably lower than for the other three schemes

4. Water Resources
The feasibility study carried out an assessment of the stream flow in the Caraulun River, as well as an
estimate of the crop water requirementsfor the full development of 1,030 ha. based on a three crop cycle
which may eventually be achieved. The land preparation and cropping pattern assumed for the analysis
was:

     0   First paddy crop land preparationinDecember
     0   Secondpaddy crop land preparation inApril
     0   Other crops cultivated inAugust

   The maximum water requirements are associated with land preparation and the first month o f the first
   paddy crop in NovembedDecember when effective rainfall becomes insignificant in November and the
   available water drops substantially. It is apparent that in most years there will be sufficient water for the
   full irrigation o fthe 1,030 ha.

   At present there are no significant upstream extraction on the Caraulun River which could affect the
   scheme. However, for the longer term sustainability of the system legal allocations and long term rightsto
   these limited available water resources will become essential and should be addressed.

   5. Major Works
   The major civil works included inthe proposed civil works contract for the rehabilitation o fthe Caraulun
   Irrigation Project are:


         0    Construction o f new intake works on the CaraulunRiver, including a flume intake;
         0    Rehabilitation o f the canal network

   The proposed rehabilitation works include the construction o f a free intake. The free intake is proposed
   with a lower invert level near the existing intake, and the design includes the lowering o f the primary
   canal to the second drop structure. The free gated intake will include a gate and a debris and rock barrier,
   located in the existing training walls, 15 meters upstream from the existing intake. The water will be
   conveyed to the existing canal system in a flume through the existing sedimentation basin.

   The civil works and equipment proposed as part o f the rehabilitation o f the headworks includes the
   following:


        0    Demolition o f part o fthe existing weir, intake and sluice;
        0    Constructiono f a 240 meter long open flume through the existing sedimentation basin;
        0    Construction o f a new flume and intake structure
        0    Installation o f new gates for the flume and canal intakes.

   For the canal distribution system, the rehabilitation works include the repairs and modifications to the
   2.25 km long Caraulun main canal, the 0.7 km long Leoai secondary canal, the 5.4 km long Raifusa
   secondary canal and the 1.83 km long Caraulun secondary canal. The rehabilitation works include the
   desilting o f the canals, and provision o f some inverted siphons for cross drainage flow.

   The need, ifany, for additional works at the tertiary level will be assessed after the detailed topographical
   surveys are completed.

6. Social Conditions

The total populationof ManufahiDistrictwas recordedas 38,617 inthe 2001 Suco Survey. The project is
locatedwithin the administrativeboundariesof Betanovillage, which has a total populationof more than
3,900 divided into 810 households. Before the Caraulun Scheme was damaged, 600 ha were under
cultivation by about 600 families. Approximately 20% of the households were female headed, and the
average land holding was 1.0 hectare. Duringthe Indonesian Administration, about 80% of the land in
Betano Village was owned by individuals, with a further 19.75% owned by the community, and the
remaining0.25% owned by the Government. The landtenure situationon the irrigatedland indicatedthat
75% were owner-cultivator,20% were tenant cultivator,and the remaining5% were share tenants. There
is an unresolved issue regarding the re-allocationof about 300 hectares of land, which was previously
allocated for a transmigrationprogram, a churchyouthprogram, and designated `government' land under
the Indonesian Administration. This will progressively be re-allocatedaccording to traditional law, and
the detailed surveyto identify landparcelsunder ARP I11will likely provideimpetus for this process.

 7. Water User Associations

The sociological study completed as part of the feasibility study indicated a higher level of community
management prior to 1999than in most light-to-mediumdamaged irrigationschemes. Indeed, 14 WUAs
were reportedat the commencement of the scheme in 1995/6 with a membership o f approximately 450
male and 150 female members. These were functioninguntil the scheme sustainedmajor damage during
the 2001 floods. The WUAs were reportedto have a relatively high level of cooperation, with groups
organized for each tertiary block and the implementationof agricultural extension activities. This was
partially due to the support of two field coordinators paidby the Indonesian Administration. MAFF will
needto replicatea similar levelof support untilthe groups are fully functioningagain. The recent efforts
of the Chefe do Suco to mobilise farmers in October 2002 to clean the canals in preparationfor a pump
promised by MAFF indicate a willingness of the WUA members to re-start their rice production.
However in light of lessons learnt from the light-to-medium damaged schemes under ARP 11, it was
considered prudentto establish a number of pre-conditionsto reconfirmboththe commitment of farmers
as well as the Government to ensure that the use of the scheme is maximizedfollowing its rehabilitation.
These pre-conditionsare summarizedbelow.

B. Preconditions Prior to Proceeding with Tender Process

1. Summary

Although the economic analysis carried out for the feasibility study indicates that under the most
conservative assumptions the investment for the rehabilitationof the Caraulun IrrigationProject is fully
justified, there are still a number of activities requiredwhich needto be completedbefore the contract for
the rehabilitationworks can be awarded.Broadly,these fall intotwo categories:

Actions Requiredat Government Level:

         0      Regulation on Water User Associations and Responsibilities o f the Government and
                Communities for IrrigationMaintenance

Actions requiredby MAFF:

        0       Formationof Water User Associations andAgreement on LandUse
        0       Staff Allocations from MAFF for ConstructionSupervision

Full completion of all these requirements will be necessary before the invitation to bid is issued by
MAAF. A detailed activity plan has been agreed which indicates measurable outputs to evaluate the
progress made towards achieving pre-funding requirements. Progress will be monitored during
supervision missions. The activity plan envisages that all required activities will be completed by mid-
October 2004. This will allow sufficient time for the bidding process for the rehabilitation works to
commence inthe dry seasonofApril 2005.

2. Actions Required at Government Level

The development of irrigationwithin East Timor requires a clear legal framework to ensure that projects
developed on presently available water resources are not detrimentally affected by future development
strategies based on the same resources. Although there may be adequate water available for most
purposes during the wet season when the rivers are flowing, the situation is significantly more critical
duringthe dry season, when irrigationdevelopment is basedon much lower riverbaseflows.

Ideally, a Water Law would be enacted following discussion and review (among all the various
Government Departments) of a Water Strategy and Policy Paper. The Water Law should cover at least
the following aspects:

    0   Water extraction rights, including riparian rights and release of base flows for environmental
        purposes;
    0   Priorities for allocation of water extraction from rivers, including allocations for agricultural,
        ruralandurbanuses;
    0   Definitiono fthe rightsandresponsibilitiesfor various Government Ministriesinvolvedinthe use
        and development of water resources;
    0   Allocation of available water resourcesfor future development within the catchment areas, so that
        these areas have some reservations for development; and
    0   Formationof WUAs with the rights and responsibilities for the management o f water resources
        within their projectareas.

It is recognized, however, that drafting and enactment o f a Water Law is beyond MAFF's control and
may not realisticallybe accomplished duringthe life ofthe project.

At a minimum, MAFF should draft and facilitate the enactment o f a MinisterialOrder approved by the
CouncilofMinistersspecifyingthe following:

     0   Clear delineation of responsibilities between the Government and communities and Water User
        Associations for       the rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of                 irrigation schemes.


     0  A firm Government commitment to give the Caraulun Irrigation Scheme first priority on
        available water resources in the Caraulun River, andto restrict any upstreamwater development
        projects which may prejudice the availability of water for the Caraulun Irrigation Scheme,
        particularlyinperiodswhenthere is limitedriver flow.

     0  A Water User Association regulation, which may be part o f a more general Law relatedto the
         legal status of small business, also issued as a Ministerial Order and approved by the Council of




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004          148

         Ministers, conferring official status and recognition to the formation o f the Caraulun WUA and
         its Turnout Service Area Groups. The regulation should specify:

         -   Minimumnumbers andtitles o fOffice Bearers;
         -   Procedures for the election o f Office Bearers;
         - ConstitutionoftheAssociations;
         -   Internal and External Audit o f Association Accounts;
         -   Authority o fthe Association to control and manage water distribution;
         -   Authority for the Association to assess and collect fees for water charges;
         -   Authority for the Association to use funds for expenses related to operation and maintenance;
         -   Authority for the Association to penalize or fine members for various activities including
             damage to the system, failure to carry out allocated maintenance or other duties, and illegal
             extraction o f extra water from the system;
         -   Limited authority to resolve land disputes, and allocate unused land within the project areas;
         -   Ifagreedby members ofthe Association, to extendthe activities ofthe associationto the bulk
             purchase o f crop inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc; and
         -   If agreed by members of the association, to extend the activities of the association to bulk
             selling o f produce, and other activities including finance and loans.

Untilmore general Laws are established within East Timor, the development o f irrigation projects which
require effective WUAs to operate and manage the systems will be problematic. Although some WUAs
have been established on the light-to-medium damaged projects which were rehabilitated under AI" I
and ARP 11, these associations have to rely on the good will o f the members in order to operate the
systems, and the WUAs have no procedures for obtain funds for their activities.

Before the Ministerial Orders can be issued, detailed discussions and agreements are necessary to
establish the responsibilities related to operation and maintenance which will be assigned to the WUAs,
and the source o f the funds necessary to carry out these tasks. Generally it would be expected that the
Government would provide the total maintenance costs in the first year (or two) o f the project, and this
would then decrease over a fixed period to some percentage (perhaps 30%). The Government would then
be required to provide this final amount each year for operation and maintenance, and this amount should
be includedinthe annual MAFFbudget. The actual procedure for usingthese funds should also be clearly
defined. The funds could be used by MAFF for direct maintenance costs under their supervision.
Alternatively, the funds allocated by the Government for operation and maintenance could be passed
directly into a bank account held by the WUA, and the WUA would make all arrangements for project
maintenance. Annual auditing o fthe accounts would be necessary to ensure transparency inthe allocation
o f these funds. MAFF may need to have a representative on the WUA to provide some technical support
inmaking decisions onthe use of available funds.


3. Actions Required by MAFF

SMEC has prepared the detailed Feasibility Study for the Caraulun Project, and as part o f the Study
SMEC has prepared detailed designs, specifications and tender documents for the project to proceed to
the next phase. However, before MAFF can proceed with the tendering and eventual construction process
there are a number o f activities which must be completed, as a pre-condition for disbursement under the
civil works category o f the EC grant. These requirements are detailed below:




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture RehabilitationProject -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004    149

a. Detailed Topographic Surveys. In order to prepare detailed designs at the field level, as well as for
the efficient and equitable operation of irrigation systems, there is an urgent need for MAFF to obtain
detailed topographic surveys of the area. These should include contour intervals at perhaps 0.25-meter
intervals drawn on the basis of spot height data collected by a total station (or similar system), at
sufficiently close intervals so that the contours developed are reasonably accurate and reflect the true
situation on the ground. The topographical surveys should result in the preparationof maps showing
details o f individualland holdings and field boundaries, as well as the positionso f roads, canals, rivers,
drains and any other natural features. Any infrastructureincludinghouses, farm buildings etc should also
be included.This detailedtopographicalmap will be requiredfor the preparation and finalizationof the
design for the irrigation canal network as well as in the reallocation of any unallocatedland and the
formation of the WUAs. MAFF will contract out this topographic survey in the first year of project
implementation.
b. Completion of the Detailed Designs and Bills of Quantities for Caraulun. After the detailed
topographicalsurvey is complete, MAFF (with assistance from the IrrigationAdvisor) should reviewthe
design documents completedby SMEC andprepare a more detaileddesignto ensure that equitable water
supplies can be suppliedto all participatinghouseholds. Since the present irrigationsystem adopted is a
cascadingprocess, with water flowing from field to field and each farmer relyingon the releasesof water
from the upper fields, this review should ensure that water will be able to reach the extremities of the
project area without problems. If necessary, some additional secondary or tertiary canals could be
proposed, but this would require agreement amongst WUA members that small amounts of land from
surrounding farmers would be providedvoluntarily for their construction,necessitatingsignedagreements
similar to those used in ARP I1 for the location o f WUA offices.                   The Policy Guidelines for the
Negotiationsover the Use andDevelopmentof Landfor ARP I11(see Annex 10) shouldbe appliedto any
landacquisitionrequiredfor the rehabilitationof Caraulun.


SMEC's design documents for Caraulun show a river flowing through part of the system. The design
review should consider the procedure for takingwater across or around this river, and the possibleuse of
the incisedriver to drainthe area. When the designreview is completed, MAFF should revise the Bill of
Quantities to includeany additionalworks identifiedinthe detailedfinal designfor the project.

c. Formation of Water User Associations and Agreement on Land Use. As soon as the detailed
topographical survey is complete, the process of re-establishingWater User Associations on Caraulun
should commence. It is anticipatedthat there will be a networkof WUAs with branchesestablishedat the
secondary and perhaps tertiary canal levels, each branch with the responsibility for managing water
allocationssupplied at one or more outlets fromthe proposedsecondary canals. These branches will each
providea representativeto the mainWUA.


MAFF's WUA Advisor will determine the optimal number o f WUA groups to be established on
Caraulun, anddefine the activitiesneededto create effectiveand sustainableWUAs for the project.

The process of establishing WUAs on Caraulun may be difficult and time consuming if adequate
resourcesare not allocated by MAFF.When the irrigationsystem failed, farmers generally abandonedthe
Caraulun Project area and returnedto rainfedareas inthe hills where there is generally adequate rainfall
for a single rice crop. For dry season rice crop, some farmers are developingcultivatedareas elsewhere
along the rivers where diversions are possible. This highlightsthe importance of establishing the WUAs
to determinethe number o ffarmers who will returnto andutilizethe scheme once it is rehabilitated.




Timor-Leste ThirdAgriculture Rehabilitation Project -Project Appraisal Document, October 7, 2004       150

The WUA establishment process needs to include signed agreements from all stakeholders involved
regardingthe 291 ha that remain unresolved (see Annex 11). These include land used by Indonesian
transmigrants who may have left the area (64 ha); land owned by the church and previously used for a
youth program (165 ha); and government land (62 ha). Traditional and formal leaders, the WUAs, the
church and the Government should agree in writing and voluntarily on the use of this land, using
traditionallandallocationprocedures.

Establishment o f the WUAs (including the election of office bearers, training, registration, and
preparationof an operationalandmaintenancemanual for day-to-day management) andwrittenresolution
of the unresolved land area will be required prior to MAFF proceeding with the tendering and
rehabilitationof Carulun. IDA will monitor closely the progress towards this requirement duringproject
supervisionmissions.

d. Staff Allocation from MAFF for Construction Supervision. The rehabilitationworks will be carried
out by a qualified company selected under InternationalCompetitive Bidding.MAFF will also contract
out a qualified engineering supervision consultant to oversee the constructionprocess, monitor progress,
ensure compliance with the environmental management plan, and ensure quality control of the works in
accordance with the original specifications. To limit the costs of the supervising services and to ensure
that MAFF Irrigation staff gain experience in supervision of major irrigation works, MAFF should
allocate some of its own staff for the supervision o f Caraulun.
During the constructionperiod, from the mobilizationof the contractor until the issue of the Completion
Certificate, MAFF shall providethree qualified staff to work directly under the Site Engineer nominated
by the supervising Consultant. The counterpart staff assigned for supervision should not be changed
during the construction period and should be involved in the preparation of the Operation and
Maintenance manual for the WUAs to ensure close ownership over the scheme. Allocation of three
qualifiedstaff on a full-time basisto the schemewould be a pre-conditionfor tendering.
