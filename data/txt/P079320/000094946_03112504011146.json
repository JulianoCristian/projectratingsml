It is accompanied by a social\n            appraisal report (v. 2) which identifies village-based\n            institutions, and outlines best options for creating demand\n            for services, and effective service delivery, within the\n            socioeconomic environment. Measures to mitigate\n            environmental degradation include: river diversification\n            protection through vegetative practices (i.e., suitable\n            grasses such as vetiver, lemon grass), and protective walls\n            to prevent erosion caused by floods. Vegetative practices\n            should also prevent sedimentation, while stone walls should\n            minimize bank erosion, and landslides; water intakes should\n            be adjusted at known groundwater intakes, to reduce\n            groundwater flows, and prevent intrusion of salinity\n            contents; measures should be taken to control, and ensure\n            adequate flows so as to prevent degradation of downstream\n            habitats; information dissemination should be ensured, to\n            liaise with communities in the introduction of environmental\n            regulations, and compliance, particularly water user\n            associations concerning remedial actions; identify\n            substrata, and water/groundwater levels to assess water\n            logging, and salinity contents, and conduct water and soil\n            quality testing, verifying as well potential nutrient\n            leaking, and toxic substances. To this end, at the design\n            stage, bedrock should be analyzed to estimate toxicity\n            concentrations, and/or algae, to protect aquatic\n            ecosystem's nutrients; integrated catchment management\n            practices, and re-vegetation programs should be instituted,\n            to provide community education programs which incorporate\n            policy and regulations."}, "docdt": "2003-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
