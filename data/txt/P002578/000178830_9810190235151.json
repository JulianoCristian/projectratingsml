         quickly increase and sustain agricultural production through\n            efficient use of available land, water and human resources.\n            Specifically, the project will include agricultural\n            machinery, workshop facilities and fuel storage; road making\n            and canal maintenance equipment; initial rehabilitation of\n            the canal and road systems; motor vehicles and\n            telecommunications equipment; stores; field staff housing\n            and a training center; electro-mechanical equipment and a\n            mechanical delinting plant; training, technical assistance\n            and consultancy services; field health centers, rural water\n            supplies, and malaria and bilharzia control programs; cash\n            requirements to operate NHAPC in the first three years of\n            the project. Start-up, debt and cost recovery and\n            realization of projected yields are foreseen as major risks,\n            but adequate provision has been made in the project design\n            to accommodate these concerns."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
