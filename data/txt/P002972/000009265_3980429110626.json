primary\n            education (UPE) policy. This operation is designed to\n            support the government's own priority in achieving UPE\n            while also complementing other donors' interventions.\n            In addition to providing budget support, the operation will\n            work to 1) improve resources allocation to primary education\n            particularly by paying and training additional teachers; 2)\n            increase efficiency in resource use by doubleshifting and\n            piloting multigrade teaching while expanding classroom\n            construction; and 3) protect the quality and availability of\n            education inputs, mainly by increasing the supply and\n            quality of textbooks and instructional materials and by\n            strengthening teacher training. Attention will also be given\n            to overall sector management, planning, budgeting, and\n            information systems. The adjustment operation will be\n            critical in assuring that resources exist to sustain growth\n            in school enrollment by assuring proper financial\n            disbursements and distribution of educational inputs."}, "docdt": "1998-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
