Bringing Education to the Poor of Uganda                                                                  September 17, 2002
                          When the Ugandan government introduced a new universal primary education policy in 1996, enrollment jumped
                          by 70 percent in one year—from 3.1 million in 1996 to 5.1 million in 1997.  This dramatic surge in the student
                          body required an immediate and matching increase in teachers and other resources..   

                          With the Education Sector Adjustment Credit, the World Bank and the Ugandan government have successfully
                          tackled this challenge, and in less than three years, the has project helped increase access to basic education
                          and substantially reduce the wealth and gender inequity in primary schools.

Household surveys taken in 1992 and 1999 showed that the number of disadvantaged students enrolled in schools rose to 84 percent
from 50 percent, while the enrollment of more affluent children showed an increase from 82 percent to 85 percent.  Also, among
economically disadvantaged 9 to 12-year-olds, female enrollment rose from 59 to 89 percent, while enrollment of boys increased to 91
percent from 67 percent.
