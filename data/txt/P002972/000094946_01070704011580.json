Continued good macroeconomic performance in\n            the second half of the 1990s and increased international\n            support for debt relief program created the financial space\n            that allowed Uganda to allocate significant additional\n            resources to primary education. The lessons learned from the\n            implementation of the project include: 1) Budget support can\n            be an effective instrument to support accelerated education\n            development. It helps overcome the recurrent costs -\n            especially teacher's salary - constraints that can\n            undermine the quality of instruction when enrollment grows\n            rapidly. Strong and broad government ownership is key. 2)\n            The sector wide approach (SWAP) holds considerable promise.\n            3) Focus on key issues is essential. Sequencing of reforms\n            is of particular importance as external assistance and\n            development programs are increasingly developed through\n            SWAPs. 4) Policy development must be a continuous process.\n            5) Decentralization, community involvement and communication\n            are key elements of large-scale education reforms. 6)\n            \"Big Bang\" policies for Universal Primary\n            Education will almost inevitably result in severe disruption\n            of the functioning of the system and are likely to\n            jeopardize the quality of instruction."}, "docdt": "2001-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
