The result\n            was almost doubling of enrollments which schools were\n            unprepared to accommodate and that put the school system on\n            the verge of collapse under tremendous pressure.\n            International Development Association (IDA) provided\n            emergency funds to finance the education sector budget and\n            to respond to the surge of enrollments. Education sector\n            adjustment credit (ESAC) provided the framework for a\n            harmonized and coordinated donor support to the sector.\n            Uganda's own universal primary education policy\n            resulted in an increase in primary school enrolment from 3.1\n            million in 1996 to 7.3 million in 2006 and removed wealth\n            and gender gaps among primary pupils.
