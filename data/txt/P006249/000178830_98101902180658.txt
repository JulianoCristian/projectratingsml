INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECCNSTRUCTICN AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATICN OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
COMPANHIA SIDERURGICA NACIONAL
FOR A STEEL EXPANSICN PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) with the guarantee of the
Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of $64.5 million to help
finance the expansion of CSN's steel mill from a capacity of 1.7 to 2.5
million tons of raw steel per year. The loan would have a final maturity
of 15½ years, including a V&½..year grace period; interest thereon would be
charged at the rate of 7¼ percent per annum. The loan would be made jointly
with a $43 million loan for the same project from the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB). The CSN project is the first of three comprising
Brazil's program for the expansion of its flat steel products capacity for
which total Bank and IDB financing of about $320 million 1/ is being sought
by the Government of Brazil.
PART I   THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Brazil" (WH-210a), dated November 30, 1971, was distributed to the
Executive Directors on December 2, 1971. A country data sheet is attached
as Annex II. The Report describes Brazil's remarkable economic growth
over the past few years and the policies which the Government has followed
in achieving this performance. The Report also calls attention to the
large external capital inflow which was associated with rapid growth. Dur-
ing 1968-70 the net inflow amounted to $2.5 billion of which $1.7 billion
consisted of financial credits with maturities of one to four years.  The
role of--medium and long-term finance was important -- development agencies
contributed $690 million net (IDB - $312 million; AID -- $278 million; and
IBRD -- $98 million), while suppliers' credits, including U.S. Export-Import
Bank, totalled about $200 million. Direct inveatments amounted to $270 million.
3.        The Report points out that continuation of rapid growth in the
1970s requires substantial increases in external capital inflows. There is
a good prospect that this capital will be forthcoming on better terms than
in the recent past. The Government has placed controls on short-term finan-
cial borrowing and has made considerable progress in formulating investment
projects suitable for external financing. These steps will result in an
expanded flow of supplier credits and project loans. However, the gross
external capital requirement cannot be met if external assistance is tied
entirely to the foreign exchange component of project costs. Aithough the
capital investment needed to support Brazil's economic growth targets is
substantial, the import needs of most investment projects are relatively
low, as Brazil's capital goods industry has already proven;its ability to
compete successfully under international competitive bidding.
1/ The cost estimates and financial plan for the expansion program were
prepared prior to the December currency realignments. The contingency
allowances provided are thought to be adequate to take care of eventual
increases of prices ir terms of US dollars.



- 2 -
4.        Brazil's total external disbursed debt amounted to $5.2 billion
at the end of 1970, two-fifths of which consisted of financial credits.
Because financial credits include a large component of disguised direct
investment and commercial bank working capital credit lines, they are -
probably not highly volatile despite the fact that an appreciable propor-
tion bore terms of one year or less. Moreover, much of the increase in
financial credits has been matched by an increase in foreign reserves,
which are now equivalent to some $2.0 billion, representing 6.0 monthts
goods and nonfactor services imports. Brazilts debt service ratio on
long-term debt, excluding non-guaranteed private debt, amounted to 16.9
percent in 1970. Although external debt management is one of the more
critical issues confronting the Government at high rates of growth,
Brazil should be able to service the increasing debt needed to support
its growth targets if the present high quality of economic management is
sustained.
PART II - THE BANK'S ROLE IN BRAZIL
5.        Brazil is at present the Bank's largest borrower. Since 1949,
Brazil has received 37 loans from the Bank amounting to $1,094.3 million
(net of cancellations). Of this amount, $179.9 million has been repaid
and $567.o million is still undisbursed. This latter figure reflects both
the significant increase in Bank lending in recent years and a number of
projects with respect to which disbursements are extended over a consider-
able period.
6.       Wie are proceeding with an active lending program in Brazil in the
current fiscal year. Two loans totalling $96 millimn were approved in
August 1971 for the MER iron ore project and related railway projecto The
steel financing may total about $190 million. In addition, a major new
highway investment program has recently been appraised, and so have the Sao
Simao Hydroelectric Project, a grain storage credit program and a small
land settlement project in the State of Maranhao. We have also been exam-
ining actively a proposed pilot project for the establishment of an Under-
writers Fund to aid the development of the Brazilian capital market. I
hope to be able to recommend loans for most if not all of these projects
in the next six months.
7.        In planning our lending in Brazil, we are responding to Brazil's
demonstrated ability to absorb increasing amounts of external capital that
enable it to sustain a high rate of economic growth. In selecting the
sectors and projects for lending, we are presently guided by several impor-
tant considerations. In the first place, we believe that the Bank can
help Brazil obtain maximum foreign capital inflow by associating its loans
either with sectors where bilateral lending is not available or where the
presence of Bank financing will help Brazil obtain additional bilateral
resources on a basis more favorable to Brazil's development. The latter
feature is important in the proposed steel financing. In the second place,
we hope to direct Bank lending towards areas where we can support the
Government in strengthening institutions and improving economic policies
in significant sectors. Such is the case with the Government's price
policy in the steel sector, which will be commented on below.  Third, we



- 3 -
hope to select projects which will help Brazil overcome the most critical
factor limiting economic growth, namely, the balance of payments. This
means help to promote exports as in the case of the iron ore project,
or supporting the creation of import substitution industries where, as
in the case of steel, Brazil has a significant comparative advantage.
Fourth, insofar as this is consistent with rational use of resources, we
hope to assist projects that will contribute particularly to the growth
of the less developed parts of Brazil.
8.        The proposed loan to CSN would be the Bank's first for a steel
project in Brazil. It would be our fourth loan for the development of
Brazilian industry following upon loans for an aluminum smelting project,
an industrial credit project in the Northeast and the above-mentioned iron
ore project.
9.        A summary statement of loans and credits, as of December 31,
1971, is attached as Annex I.  Of the loans declared effective, 18 have
not been fully disbursed, and of those, disbursement of 12 was behind
schedule. Nine of the latter are for electric power projects. This is
due to a number of factors which were discussed in detail at the time of
the presentation to the Executive Directors of the Salto Osorio Hydro-
electric Project (728 BR) in March 1971. As then stated, technical problems
relating to 404 BR, 442 BR, 565 BR and 566 BR have been solved and project
work is now progressing satisfactorily. Implementation of four power dis-
tribution projects (475-478 BR) was initially slowed by organizational
and administrative difficulties which have been substantially removedh
However, disbursement for the Marimbondo Project (677 ER) is now behind
schedule as a result of the discovery of poor foundation conditions which
have delayed civil works.
10,       After initial delays, progress in the execution of the First
Highways Project (567 ER) is now progressing satisfactorily. The same
applies to the Livestock Project (516 BR); our loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by the end of 1972. Disbursement of the loan to the Banco do
Nordeste do Brasil (ENB) (656 BR) has been slower than originally expected.
The major contributing factor was, until recently, easy availability to 
industrial companies in the Northeast area of Brazil of subsidized govern-
ment funds. As the availability of such funds is being progressively
restricted, demand through ENB for the Bank loan is likely to increase.
Nevertheless, we expect to postpone the deadline for submission of sub-
projects by ENB by one year to June 1973.
11.       Brazil is the country with the largest share of IFCVs commitments.
Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in Brazil totalling $61.8 million,
of which $5.1 million has been repaid, $13.L million sold and $1.3 million
cancelled. Of the balance of $42.0 million, $30.3 million represents loans
and $11.7 million equity. Included are outstanding investments of $1.0
million for a special steels project. A summary of IFC investments is
given in Annex I.
12.       The CSN project was appraised by a joint mission of the Bank and
the IDB in May-June 1971. Negotiations took place from December 15 to
December 22, 1971. CSN was represented by Colonel Arnaldo Sao Thiago Filhop



- 4 -
Assistant to the Vice-President of CSN, and by Mr. Gabriel Costa Carvalho,
Legal Adviser. The Government of Brazil was represented by Mr. Jayme
Alipio de Barros, Attorney-General for Finance, and by Mr. Luiz Fernando
Sarcinelli Garcia, Executive Secretary of the Conselho Nacional da Indus-
tria Siderurgica (CONSIDER).
PART III - THE STEEL INDUSTRY
13.       A report "Brazilian Steel Expansion Program - Part I" (PI-16),
dated January 10, 1972, is being distributed separately.  It contains a
description and evaluation of the Brazilian Government's expansion program
for flat steel products in the decade of the 1970s. This program comprises
the expansion of the basic iron and steel making, rolling and finishing
capacities of CSN, Usinas Siderurgicas de Ninas Gerais, S.A. (USIMINAS) and
Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA) which together account for the
bulk of Brazil's output of flat rolled products. The Bank has been asked
to help finance the expansion projects of the three companies in the
period 1972-76; I expect to submit the USIMINAS and COSIPA projects to
the Executive Directors within the next few months.
14.       Histor.   The establishment in Brazil of a modern steel industry
dates back to the 1920s with the creation by private foreign investors of
an integrated mill for the production of nonflat products. Since then, a
large number of nonflat product mills have been established, mostly under
private control. The Government's policy has been to preserve the predom-
inantly private ownership of the nonflats sector. The IFC is currently
studying three projects in the sector.
15.       Mainly because of the large minimum economic size and the resul~
tant heavy investment requirements, Brazil's first integrated mill for the
production of flat products and heavy structurals, CSNts Volta Redonda mill,
in the State of Rio de Janeiro, was only founded in 1941, at the initiative
and under the control of the Government. Two other exclusively flat product
plants, USIMINAS and COSIPA, were established in the early 1960s in the
States of Mines Gerais and Sao Paulo, respectively. The Government also
has a majority ownership in these companies, although Japanese interests
hold about 21 percent of USIMINAS' voting shares.
16.       Based upon an abundant supply of high quality domestic iron ore
and a rapidly expanding internal market, Brazil's steel production has
grown rapidly since 1950 at an average annual rate of 9 percent. Brazil
is today Latin America's largest steel producer.  Present capacity is rated
at 6 million raw steel tons divided about equally between flat and nonflat
rolled products.
17.       Planned Expansion.  The Government plans to expand capacity to
about 20 million raw steel tons per year by 1980 or shortly thereafter, of
which 11 million tons would be for flat products and 9 million tons for
nonflat products.



18.       Present flat product capacity of 3.1 million tons of raw steel
equivalent is currently being increased to 3.4 million tons in accordance
with Stage I of the Government s Steel Expansion Program. Stage II of the
Expansion Program for which the assistance of the Bank is sought will
raise flat product capacity to 6.7 million tons of raw steel equivalent by
1977. The total cost of the Stage II expansions of CSN, USIMINAS and
COSIPA is estimated at $1.28 billion, of which about $650 million relates
to equipment and machinery. Further expansion to the 1980 target would be
undertaken in Stage III.
19.       The Hank's Role. The Bank's association with the Brazilian steel
industry began in 1965 when it made a -$h2O,00O technical assistance grant
to the Government for a study to assess the gap between the supply and
demand of steel products in Brazil in the period 1966-72 and make recommell
dations on the most economical expansion program. The study, which was
carried out by the U.S. consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton International,
concluded that Brazil's comparative advantage in producing steel and the
prospective growth of domestic demand justified a substantial expansion of
steel-making capacity. It also concluded that priority should be given to
bringing CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA to balanced annual capacities of about
3.5-L.0 million raw steel tons each.
20.       Soon after completion of the study, the Government approached the
Bank to finance the expansions of COSIPA and USIMIAS to approximately their
presently envisaged capacities at the end of Stage I. The Bank at that time
suggested that the Government seek financing through bilateral channels.
21.       In fact, significant delays occurred in launching the Stage I
expansion programs. These delays and the rapid recovery of the economy
from the 1965-67 recession and with it of steel consumption, led the Govern-
ment to give highest priority to the coordination of the steel sector and
the implementation of an expansion program for the seventies to forestall
the need for massive importation of steel products. The Government's
resolve crystalized in the establishment in June 1970 of CONSIDER as a steel
coordinating agency with executive powers.
22.       CONSIDER has coordinated the preparation by the steel companies
of their expansion projects, made these projects compatible with one
another and with the findings of a comprehensive market study commissioned
by CONSIDER, coordinated arrangements with potential lenders such as the
Bank, IDB, bilateral credit agencies and the Federal Development Bank
(Hanco Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico) (HIDE). In an advisory
capacity, CONSIDER plays a leading role in setting the Government's price
control policy with respect to steel products.
23.       When the Brazilian Government again requested the Bank in Septem-
ber 1970 to consider financing the steel expansion program, it could point,
therefore, to substantial achievements, as well as to massive investment
requirements. The Government felt that the Bank's participation would
enable Brazil to secure external financing on the most favorable terms and
to reduce investment costs significantly through procurement of equipment
on the basis of international competition.



2i4.      Originally, the Government proposed that the Bank organize a
consortium for the joint financing of the steel expansion program. Such a
consortium would have included the Bank, the IDB and the export credit
agencies of major steel equipment producing countries. Since it proved
impossible to enlist the participation of the export credit agencies of
all major supplying countries, the Bak, the IDB and the Government sub-
sequently agreed on an alternative mixed joint-parallel financing scheme.
25.       Financing ELan, Under this scheme the equipment component of the
three projects will be divided into two separate lists. One, containing
equipment and engineering items whose value is estimated at $320 million,
would be entirely financed by the Bank and mDB in a 60:40 proportion. This
list includes the items which the Brazilian capital goods industry is
thought to be capable of manufacturing efficiently as well as a substantial
number of items which are likely to be imported. Procurement will be on
the basis of full international competitive bidding with a 15 percent
margin of preference for Brazilian bidders.
26.       The other list, containing the balance of the equipment, will be
financed by bilateral credit agencies with competitive bidding restricted
to suppliers in countries which offer the steel companies credits on terms
acceptable to the Brasilians. For this list, differing financial terms
offered will be taken into account for bid comparison purposes. The
Brazilian Government has received financing offers from Austria, Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the U.S.A., which
indicate that credits will be available on 15-year terms to cover 90 per-
cent of the cost of orders placed in those countries for equipment to be
contained in the bilateral list.
27.       Financing for the 10 percent down-payments on bilaterally financed
equipment, and for civil works, incremental working capital requirements
and interest during construction will be provided from internal cash gener-
ation of the steel companies, long-term loans from the BNDE and advances
or equity investments by the Government. The latter will provide a guaran-
tee of full performance of all the obligations of the three companies,
including a guarantee of provision of funds necessary to complete and
bring the projects into operation.
28.       The Market. In 1970, CONSIDER hired reputable consultants to
carry out a detailed market study for the period 1972-80. This study,
which involved a sector-by-sector analysis of the 10 major steel consuming
industries in Brazil was reviewed in the Bank and checked against macro-
economic projections made independently by the consultants and by Bank
staff, The following table compares the results of these projections.
The analysis relates only to flat products since this is the sector being
considered for Bank financing.

29.       It appears realistic to assme that domestic demand for flat
products will rise to somewhere between 3.3 and 3.5 million tons in 1975
and to a level of 5.1 to 5.4 million tons by 1980. The Government intends
to undertake additional studies in 1972-73 to update the 1975-80 estimates
before embarking on Stage III of the Expansion Program.
30.       The following table shows the estimated available flat product
capacity of Brazilian steel mills assuming that Stage II of the Expansion
Program is completed by 1976.
Forecast of Available Capacity of Flat Rolled Products: 1972-80

1975 3W5
1980                          4.7
31.       The data indicate that, despite the completion of Stage I in
1973, domestic supply will fall short of demand up to the end of 1974 and
that the flat product mills will, therefore, continue to be fully utilized,
Starting in 1975 with the completion of the first of the Stage II expansion
projects, available capacity may exceed domestic demand for three or four
years. Should the more conservative Bank sectoral projections, as distin-
guished from the consultants' forecasts prove closer to reality and  should
moreover, the Government's target of maintaining the level of exports at 10
percent of capacity not be met, utilization of capacity could fall to a low
of about 84 percent in 1976. Excess capacity would, however, be rapidly
absorbed thereafter and should be entirely eliminated before the end of the
decade.



- 8 -
32.       Underutilization of capacity, if it does occur, is expected to
be short-lived. Its possible implications for the financial situation of
the steel companies have been taken into account and would not impair the
soundness of the projects. Nevertheless, the question was considered
whether some elements of the expansion program should be postponed by
one or two years to obtain higher levels of capacity utilization in the
years immediately following completion of Stage II. It was concluded
that a deliberate delay would not be advisable in view of the possibilities
that market growth may be somewhat faster and the technical buildup to
full capacity somewhat slower than presently envisaged.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33-       A report, "Appraisal of the CSN Expansion Project - Stage III'
(PI-15a), dated January 7, 1972, is being distributed separately.  A
summary of it is in Annex III.
34.       CSN is a Brazilian corporation, 94 percent of whose shares are
held by the Government either directly (Treasury) or through governmental
agencies (Social Security Institute and public savings banks). CSN's
plant is located at Volta Redonda, a town about 145 kms northwest of the
city of Rio de Janeiro. It is centrally located with respect to both
major sources of raw materials and markets. The site permits expansion
to about 5.5 million annual tons of raw steel. Present capacity of
1.6 million annual tons is currently being increased to 1.7 million
tons as part of Stage I of the Expansion Program. Production includes
hot and cold rolled coil and sheet, plate, galvanized sheet and tinplate,
as well as some nonflat products, mainly structurals and rails.
35.       The project (Stage II of the Expansion Program) is designed to
increase the capacity of the plant to 2.5 million annual tons of raw
steel and to modernize and replace obsolete equipment. It consists
essentially of the installation of a large blast furnace with sufficient
capacity to provide the hot metal requirements of the subsequent Stage III
of CSNts Expansion Program, a coke oven battery, a sinter plant, a two-
vessel basic oxygen furmace (BCF) plant, a continuous slab casting unit,
modifications to the existing hot strip mill, a continuous annealing line
and two electrolytic tinning lines.
36.       The cost of the project is estimated at the equivalent of $448
million, including incremental working capital and interest during
construction. Assuming that 25 percent of equipment orders will be won
by Brazilian suppliers, local currency costs would be $195 million and
foreign exchange costs would amount to $253 million.



p.9 e
37.       Financing for the project will come from the following sources:
(In $ million)
Cash generation                    219.2
Long-term debt
IBRD                   64.5
IDB                    43.0
Blateral credits      121.5      229.0
Total                              448.2
38.       The proposed Bank loan to CSN of $64.5 million would be for 15½
years, including a grace period of 11 years. The Government of Brazil would
charge CSN a 1-3/4 percent per annum guarantee fee on the outstanding amount
of the Bank loan, thereby bringing the cost of the Bank loan to CSN to 9
percent.
39.       The Bank and IDB loans would be jointly disbursed in a 60:40 pro-
portion for equipment items to be procured under full international competi-
tive bidding. Brazilian manufacturers would be given a 15 percent margin
of preference. It is estimated that up to 42 percent of Bank loan proceeds
would be used for local currency costs. The case for some external financing
of local expenditures on Brazilian development projects is stated in para-
graph 3, above.
40.       About $3.6 million of the Bank?s loan would be used to cover the
foreign exchange cost of engineering consultants employed by CSN. This would
include financing of an estimated $720,000 corresponding to costs incurred
since July 1971, i.e., prior to approval of the loan but subsequent to ini-
tiation of project appraisal.
41.       The bilateral credits described in Part III of this Report will
finance 90 percent of the value of equipment items ordered from suppliers in
the respective countries (other than equipment included in the Bank/IDB list)
after competitive bidding. Credit terms are expected to be 15 years after
signing (12 years following commissioning of the equipment) with interest
charged at the most favorable commercial rate prevailing at the tine con-
tracts are awarded.
42.       The Government of Brazil has undertaken to make available to CSN,
on terms satisfactory to the Bank, whatever additional resources may be
needed to complete and bring the project into operation. It has agreed to
forego receiving cash dividends from CSN up to 1975 or to make additional
equity investments or loans as required.
43.       Projections of CSNts financial statements after completion of
Stage II, assuming full production and sales prices generally in line with
present international prices, indicate an incremental financial rate of
return, after taxes, of about 13 percent.  If sales were to decrease in the



- 10 
period 1975-79 to correspond to the conservative Bank sectoral forecasts
mentioned in Part III, and disregarding the possibility of export sales,
the return would drop to about 11 percent, which is still an acceptable
result.
44.       The financial projections also show ample long-term debt service
coverage ranging from 2.4 times in 1975 to 3.7 times by 1979. The CSN Loan
Agreement contains provisions to protect CSNIs liquidity through restrictions
on dividends, borrowings and nonproject investments. Furthermore, CSN under-
takes to maintain a current ratio of at least 1.3 times for the term of the
Bank's loan.
45.       The project will help Brazil to become self-sufficient with respect
to a basic industrial input, coated and uncoated flat steel products, in tha
production of which Brazil enjoys comparative cost advantages. Current
domestic Brazilian prices for the principal flat steel product groups such
as plate and hot rolled coil and sheet are in line with recent CIF import
prices (ex duties) and with domestic prices in major steel producing
countries. While average Brazilian cold rolled product prices are somewhat
higher than CIF import prices (ex duties), the cost reductions expected
from the expansion program should make possible some selectIve price re-
ductions in the future.  Based on the estimated import prices of steel oves'
the assumed 18-year life of the assets, the project yields an incremental
internal economic rate of return of 13 percent. Net foreign exchange
savings resulting from the project are estimated at about $70 million per
year, offsetting the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project in
about 3½ years.
46.       The Bank has obtained special commitments from the Guarantor and
the Borrower with respect to the following aspects which are crucial to the
sound execution and operation of the project.
47.       Price Policy.  The Government of Brazil periodically establishes
maximum selling prices for steel products, which are at present set at
satisfactory levels. Moreover, the Government has given the Bank satis-
factory assurances regarding the aims of its steel pricing policies and has
agreed to consult with the Bank if the return on the aggregate operating
assets of CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA should fall below 10 percent or rise
above 15 percent in any year. CSN, on its side, has undertaken not to
reduce the average price in real terms of its product mix before the end of
1975 without exchanging views with the Bank.
48.       Future Steel Expansion Projects.  The Government's Steel Expansion
Program for the 1970s, upon which our financing is based, entails building
iron making facilities in Stage II which will be fully utilized only after
the completion of the subsequent stage. The Government will confirm to the
Bank its policy of giving priority to the execution of Stage III of the
expansion programs of CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA and will not, without first
consulting with the Bank, establish or provide incentives for the establish-
ment of new integrated flat product plants outside of these three companies.



- 31 -
49.       Coal Policy.  The Government has followed a policy of obliging
the steel companies, including CSN, to procure domestically certain minimum
percentages of their total coking coal requirements. Since domestic coal
is relatively expensive and of poor quality, this policy tends to offset to
some extent the Brazilian steel industry's comparative cost advantage
stemming from relatively cheap iron ore and labor costs. The loan documents
provide that CSN will not, after completion of the project, be obliged to
consume more than 20 percent of its coking coal in the form of coal whose
cost and technical characteristics do not meet specified standards.
50.       Civil Works. The proposed loan would not finance any part of the
civil works of CSN. CSN intends to engage the services of reputable Brazil-
ian contractors, including subsidiaries of foreign firms, However, if during
the execution of the project contract prices and completion schedules are
seen to be rising significantly in relation to those prevailing during Stage
I, CSN will take corrective measures, including, if necessary, the employ-
ment of foreign contractors. This procedure should ensure the efficient
and economic execution of the civil works.
51.       Coordination with the IDB. A close relationship has been maintained
with the IDB including the joint appraisal mission. We propose to formalize
the continuing cooperation between the two Banks in a Memorandum of Agreement,
which if not signed on the date of the CSN Loan Agreement will be a condition
of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The Memorandum relates to future
joint action with respect to procurement, disbursement, supervision proce-
dures and exchange of information. A special feature of the supervision
procedures would be the joint engagement by the two Banks of a coordinating
consultant for the construction phase of the projects. Bath we and the IDB
consider that the successful administration of the loans to CSN, USIMAS
and COSIPA, given the concurrent execution and complexity of the projects,
requires continuous supervision by an independent consultant in the field.
The estimated cost of the consultant's fees is of the order of $1.5 million.
In accordance with its normal procedures, the IDB will deduct 1 percent
from its loans to cover supervision costs. The Bankts share of the consul-
tant's fees, an estimated $900,000, would be met from allocations within
the administrative budgets for fiscal years 1973 to 1976.
PART V - LEAL INSTRUMETS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Companhia Siderur-
gica Nacional; the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Federative
Republic of Brazil and the Bask; and the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and draft
Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The major features of these agreements
have already been described in this report. In addition, I wish to draw
the attention of the Executive Directors to Section 8.03(a) of the Loan
Agreement, which would give the Bank the option to premature the loan in
case any other debt of CSN is prematured by another lender.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENNATION
54a.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
