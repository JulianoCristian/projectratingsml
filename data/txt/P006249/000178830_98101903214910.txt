SUMNARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the proposed Stage II expansion project of
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), the largest steel producer in Brazil.
The plant is situated at Volta Redonda, about 145 km northwest of Rio de
Janeiro, in a central location with respect to both major sources of raw
materials and markets. The project will increase CSN's raw steel capacity
from 1.7 to 2.5 million tons per year by 1976 and add finishing capacity,
primarily for the production of flat rolled products. Its estimated total
cost, including incremental working capital and interest during construc-
tion, is US$448 million equivalent of which about US$225 million will be
for imported equipment and services. The requested Bank loan is US$64.5
million.
ii.       The project is part of an overall program to increase Brazil's
raw steel capacity from 6 to 20 million tons per year by about 1980. The
program was formulated by Conselho Nacional da Industria Siderurgica
(CONSIDER), the National Steel Council, and includes simultaneous expansions
of the other two government-owned flat products mills, Usinas Siderurgicas
de Minas Gerais, S.A. (USIMINAS) and Companhia Siderurgica Paulista (COSIPA).
The Bank has been requested to assist in financing these two expansions also.
iii.      The major objectives of the project (Stage II) are to expand raw
steel capacity, replace obsolete equipment, and increase finishing capacity,
primarily of tinning lines. To this end a third blast furnace will be instal-
led which can provide sufficient hot metal for both Stage II and the next
planned expansion (Stage III) to 4 million annual tons of raw steel. In
addition, a basic oxygen shop (BOF) will replace the open-hearth shop en-
abling CSN to produce better quality steel at lower cost and with less pol-
lution. A continuous casting machine will provide the Company with the most
modern technology for producing slabs. The other major facilities to be
financed under the project include a sinter plant, coke ovens, a continuous
annealing line and two electrolytic tinning lines.
iv.       The project will be financed by US$228 million in foreign exchange
loans and US$220 million of internal cash generation. The proposed Bank
loan of US$64.5 million and an Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loan
of US$43.0 million will be used jointly in a 60/40 proportion to finance
internationally bid equipment and foreign engineering costs. An additional
US$135 million worth of equipment is to be financed (90%) by export credit
institutions. This equipment, with the exception of that already ordered
and financed by the U.S. Export-Import Bank (US$10 million), will be bid
competitively among suppliers in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States, which countries have offered
credits for the Brazilian steel expansion program. Although the terms of
the export credits have not yet been finally settled, they are expected to
be similar from each country, with any differences to be taken into account



- ii -
in bid evaluation. An average interest rate of 7-1/2% and terms of about
15 years are expected. CSN's cash generation will be used for downpayments,
construction and erection, working capital and interest during construction.
The Brazilian Government has agreed to finance any overrun in project cost
or shortfall in cash generation.
v.        CSN was formed in 1941 by the Government of Brazil which owns
directly or indirectly about 94% of the Company's share capital.  Operations
commenced in 1946 at an annual raw steel capacity of 270,000 tons, which has
been steadily expanded to 1.4 million tons. CSN is currently implementing
its Stage I expansion which will further increase capacity to 1.7 million
tons by 1973. Following the economic depression in Brazil in 1964-67 in
which CSN's earnings dropped substantially, the Company recovered quickly
and is now producing good profits at capacity operation. Its financial
position is sound and it is well managed, although the Company's further
growth will require some improvements in the management structure.
vi.       In order to increase CSN's management capabilities, the Company
has selected a U.S. management consulting firm to recommend improvements in
organization, training and management reporting. As it is expected that com-
petition will become keener, the Company will also need to improve its sales
efforts. CSN has successfully executed several expansions and is capable of
carrying out the Stage II project efficiently. McKee, a U.S. engineering
firm, will provide technical assistance to CSN during project implementation
and Armco Steel and U.S. Steel will extend operational assistance particularly
for the BOF shop and continuous casting equipment. Engineering and some pro-
curement have commenced and the first equipment orders for which Bank finan-
cing is sought are expected to be placed in April 1972, with most installa-
tions completed in the third quarter of 1975.
vii.      Over the last two decades consumption of steel in Brazil has on
average increased by about 9% per year. In future, demand is expected to
grow at an annual rate of about 9.5% for all steel products and at 10% for
flat rolled products. In 1970, about 82% of CSN's domestic sales were flat
rolled products, with the balance non-flats (rails and structurals) and semi-
finished products (slabs and blooms). The Stage II expansion will place
greater emphasis on the production of coated products (tinplate and galva-
nized coil and sheet), for which CSN has a particularly strong market posi-
tion, with a view to making Brazil self-sufficient in these products. The
Company also envisages continuing exports of about 100,000 tons per year of
finished steel and, for a few years upon completion of the project, a maximum
of 250,000 tons per year of slabs until the domestic market will absorb the
added capacity.
viii.     CSN has its own iron ore mines from which it obtains all of its
ore requirements at a favorable cost. The other principal raw material,
coking coal, is primarily imported with the exception of about 20% of the
expanded requirements which will be procured from a CSN subsidiary. While
delivered coal prices are high, the combined cost to the Company of iron
ore and coal is comparable to costs in Japanese and European steel mills.



- iii -
Other raw materials are obtained locally and no significant problems are
foreseen in raw material supply. Labor productivity is lower than other
plants in Brazil and major steel - producing countries but total production
costs are competitive.
ix.       The Company's selling prices on which the financial projections
are based are, on the whole, competitive with European domestic prices for
similar products, with the exception of cold rolled steel. Most domestic
prices in March 1971 were less than 10% above CIF import prices (ex duties)
and it is expected that upon completion of the project the Company could
meet such import prices and still earn an acceptable financial return. The
relatively low tariffs on steel imports appear reasonable and in the long
run could be less. In view of the importance of steel prices (which are
controlled by the Brazilian Government) both to the steel industry and the
economy as a whole, the Government has agreed to consult with the Bank on
steel pricing policy as circumstances warrant.
x.        The Company has a strong equity base (about 84% of total capital)
which permits it to finance the project without increasing share capital.
CSN's debt service coverage is expected to remain strong as is its liquidity.
After completion of Stage II, the Company will have a low profit break-even
point of 60% of capacity. The.project provides a suitable financial return
of 13%, despite the fact that some facilities will not be fully utilized
until further expansion takes place. This imbalance is typical of steel
plants which require high-capacity production units to be economic.
xi.       Stage II also provides a satisfactory economic return of 13%.
Sensitivity tests have been conducted and indicate that a suitable economic
return is expected even under foreseeable adverse conditions, which in a
project of this size and complexity cannot altogether be excluded. The
project will have a beneficial effect on foreign exchange, saving about
US$70 million per year net for the Brazilian economy.
xii.      Based on the assurances obtained during negotiations, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$64.5 million equivalent for a term of
15-1/2 years including 4-1/2 years of grace. A guarantee fee of 1-3/4%
per annum is to be paid to the Government by the Company in addition to the
Bank's normal lending rate.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report (Part II) appraises the expansion from 1.7 to 2.5
million tons of raw steel 1/ per year (TPY) of the Companhia Siderurgica
Nacional (CSN) steel plant at Volta Redonda, in the State of Rio de Janeiro.
Total financing required for the expansion (Stage II), including interest
during construction and additional working capital, is estimated at US$448
million, of which about 60% is needed in foreign exchange. The Bank has been
requested to make a loan of US$64.5 million equivalent for the project for in-
ternationally bid equipment and foreign engineering. A pre-appraisal mission
visited Brazil in November 1970 and a full appraisal was undertaken in May/
June 1971.
1.02      CSN, the oldest of the three large Government maj6rity-owned-plants,
started operations in 1946. The other two main Government producers, Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais, S.A. (USIMINAS) and Companhia Siderurgica Paulista
(COSIPA), began operation in 1962 and 1965 respectively. As described-in
Part I which discusses the Brazilian Steel Expansion Program in general, the
Bank has been requested to help finance the expansion programs of USIMINAS
and COSIPA as well as CSN.
1.03      Today, CSN has approximately 25% of Brazil's steel-producing
capacity of 6 million raw steel TPY. While USIMINAS and COSIPA produce
exclusively flat rolled products (plates and hot and cold rolled coil and
sheet), only about 71% of CSN's output in 1970 represented flat products.
Structural shapes and rails (21%) and slabs and blooms (8%) accounted for
the remainder. Approximately three-fourths of CSN's expansion will be utiliz-
ed for the production of flat rolled products in 1977.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs. Jaffe, Nayar, Perram, Thadani
and Zaman of the Industrial Projects Department, based on the findings of
a joint mission 2/ of the Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
which visited Brazil in May/June 1971 and various subsequent discussions
with representatives of the Company and Conselho Nacional da Industria
Siderurgica (CONSIDER), the Government coordinating body for the steel
industry.
1/  Raw steel is defined as steel in the first solid state after melting
and includes ingots, continuously-cast semi-finished products and
castings.

II. THE COMPANY
A.   Ownership
2.01      CSN's share capital amounts to Cr$838 million (US$267 million 1/).
The Treasury holds 80%, the National Social Security Institute and public
savings banks 14%, and private shareholders 6%. CSN is the largest steel
mill in Latin America and produces a major portion (30%) of Brazil's market
of cold-rolled products, including galvanized sheet and tinplate for which
CSN has a monopoly.
2.02      The Company was founded in 1941 and operations commenced in 1946
with an initial ingot capacity of 270,000 TPY. The original plant was fi-
nanced by US$25 million equivalent in share capital and a US$25 million loan
from the U.S. Export-Import Bank (Eximbank). Subsequent expansions were fi-
nanced with cash generation, loans from Eximbank, U.S. Agency for Interna-
tional Development (AID) and banks in the U.S. and the U.K. and suppliers'
credits from Canada and Switzerland. Production in 1970 was equivalent to
1.5 million raw steel tons, i.e., slightly above rated capacity of 1.4 mil-
lion TPY and sales value reached Cr$953 million (US$208 million) 1/.
B.   Location and Plant Facilities
2.03      The plant is located at Volta Redonda (Map 1) a town of about
125,000 inhabitants some 145 km northwest of Rio de Janeiro, along the
main road and rail routes to Sao Paulo and on the Paraiba river. Railroads
connect Volta Redonda with the principal markets (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo
and Belo Horizonte), the Company's ore mines in Minas Gerais some 420 rail
km to the north, and the ports of Rio de Janeiro and Angra dos Reis on the
Atlantic Ocean. The plant therefore is centrally located with respect to
both major sources of raw materials (Map 2) and markets. Its site permits
expansion to about 5.5 million raw steel TPY.
2.04      The Company's operations are fully integrated with ownership of
the steel plant, iron and manganese ore mines and beneficiation plant,
limestone and dolomite quarries, and a coastal vessel for coal transport.
A subsidiary company supplies the Company's domestic coal, with high grade
metallurgical coal (about two-thirds of CSN's present coal requirements)
being imported.
1/   At the request of the Bank and IDB, the dollar equivalent of CSN's
share capital has been calculated by the Company's auditors (Boucinhas,
Campos, Coopers & Lybrand) based on historical exchange rates at the
time of subscription or capitalization of reserves and profits. His-
toric income statements and balance sheets have likewise been converted
to dollars at appropriate historical rates.



- 3 -
2.05      A full description of the Company's existing plant facilities is
contained in Annex 1. The plant is well run and maintained, but some of
the facilities are now obsolete. Steel is made by the open-hearth pro-
cess and galvanized sheet and tinplate by hot dipping. This results in
lower quality and higher operating costs than would be possible with modern
methods. The plant employs some 14,360 people. CSN is now in the midst
of a 300,000 TPY expansion program (Stage I) which is designed to increase
raw steel capacity to 1.7 million TPY and which is expected to be completed
in 1973. At that point the plant will be composed of 2 batteries of coke
ovens, 2 sinter machines, 2 blast furnaces, 8 open hearth furnaces, a
slabbing-blooming mill, a rail and structural mill, a plate and hot strip
mill, 2 tandem cold mills, 2 hot dip and 1 continuous galvanizing line,
2 hot dip and 2 electrolytic tinning lines, and a structural fabricating
shop.
C.   Subsidiaries
2.06      CSN holds controlling stock (80%) in Companhia Siderurgica de
Mogi das Cruzes (COSIM), which produced some 95,000 tons of steel bars and
seamless pipes in 1970, and eight other subsidiaries which are engaged in
coal mining and washing, power production, insurance brokerage, engineer-
ing consultancy, construction and real estate management, and palm oil pro-
duction. These are shown as investments on CSN's balance sheet. Except for
COSIM and palm oil production all subsidiaries were originally CSN depart-
ments. COSIM, which was in severe financial difficulties, was acquired in
1968 by CSN upon instruction from the Government. CSN, using funds received
from the Government for a CSN capital increase, committed Cr$ 25 million
for COSIM in 1971. The combined sales of the subsidiaries in 1970 were
Cr$164 million (US$32 million). In 1970 COSIM and the palm oil company
recorded an aggregate loss of Cr$0.8 million (US$0.16 million) and all
others an aggregate profit of Cr$7.1 million (US$1.4 million). A further
description of these subsidiaries is given in Annex 2. No major investments
in subsidiaries are anticipated over the next few years. During negotiations
it was agreed that CSN be limited to its existing subsidiaries and that fur-
ther investments in subsidiaries be limited to US$2 million per year and
new debt or guarantees to subsidiaries be limited to US$2 million outstanding
except with Bank approval, through 1980.
D.   Organization and Management
2.07      CSN has an eight-man Board of Directors (Directoria) all elected
by the shareholders to four-year terms except for the President, who is ap-
pointed by the President of Brazil. The other members are the Vice President,
who is in charge of expansion, and the Company's six department heads, re-
sponsible for production (industrial operations); raw materials; design and
construction; finance; commercial operations; and personnel and social wel-
fare. A detailed organization chart is given in Annex 3. The President and
some executive positions have historica;Lly been subject to changes with new
administrations.  However, CSN's succesq3ful and rapid growth over the years
gives evidence of the strength and contlLnuity of the senior management. Ex-
cept for the Government directive to Ct5 to purchase shares of COSIM, CSN's
Board has had relative autonomy in di7 iction of day-to-day operations of
dicto

the Company in recent years. The Government is considering the possibility
of creating a holding company for CSN, USIMINAS and COSIPA at a future date.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that CSN's present independent
corporate form will not be changed and that it will not be merged or con-
solidated with other companies without prior consultation with the Bank.
2.08      Apart from the Board of Directors, the Company maintains in
accordance with Brazilian law a Fiscal Council which reviews the Company's
accounts annually. The only other formal management body, the Consultative
Council was recently abolished in view of the active role now being per-
formed by CONSIDER in co-ordinating Brazil's steel industry and its expan-
sion programs. Although CSN's organization has been successful, the Board
and the management are one and the same and there is little outside super-
vision. CSN is studying the responsibilities of the Board and various
management levels to remedy this. Final determinations will depend on the
recommendations of management consultants whom the Company is about to appoint
(para. 2.10).
2.09      The President, and all but two members of the current Board elected
for 1971-75, served on the Board during 1967-71. The President, General
Alfredo Americo da Silva, is a graduate of the Army Engineering Institute
with experience in fabrication, research and planning during his previous
army career. He is 67 years old and performs the functions of the chairman
of the Board as well as the chief executive. The Vice-President, Colonel
Antonio Carlos Goncalves Penna, who is in his late fifties, has had exten-
sive production and engineering experience, was formerly CSN's Director for
production and provides vigorous, knowledgeable leadership to CSN. Most of
the Company's present Directors have had considerable experience with CSN
or industry in general.
2.10      In the past, CSN has served as the training ground for the managers
of Brazil's newer steel plants and has lost middle management strength to
USIMINAS and COSIPA as a consequence. CSN's directors realize the need for
management depth and have selected a U.S. firm of management consultants to
review CSN's corporate structure and recommend improvements in organization,
procedures, training and management information. New leadership personnel
will have to be developed to support the present CSN team in meeting the
technical and management challenge that will be encountered. The consultants
are to be paid out of the Company's own resources and the Company has agreed
to exchange views with the Bank regarding the terms of reference and the im-
plementation of the consultants' recommendations.
2.11      CSN has a general know-how and technical assistance agreement with
United States Steel Corporation (USS) for the plant in general and further
technical assistance agreements with USS and Armco Steel Corporation for opera-
tion of the tinning and galvanizing lines respectively. In addition, the
Company has concluded a technical training and general consultation agree-
ment with USS. The Bank has reviewed the fees for these services and found



-5-
them reasonable. These agreements are comprehensive and provide the Company
with the technical back-up and training facilities which it requires for
the successful operation of the plant.
E.   Past Growth and Recent Financial Position
2.12      From the start of full production to the severe economic depression
in Brazil during 1964-67, CSN's growth was generally satisfactory, as can be
seen from the Chart in Annex 4 which gives the Company's history of production,
sales and costs. During 1965, the Government instituted the control of steel
prices. This, and more importantly the economic downturn, led to a successive
reduction in profit margins during 1965 and 1966 and most acutely in 1967.
During 1967 - clearly the worst year in the Company's history - CSN showed a
net income of only Cr$427,000 with sales of Cr$395 million (US$148 million).
2.13      In subsequent years the recovery was rapid.  Detailed historical
statements are given in Annex 5 and the following table analyses develop-
ments in sales, costs and profits during 1967-71. Because of substantial
inflation in Brazil, the financial statements have been converted into
historical dollars to facilitate comparisons.

2.14      Following the end of the Brazilian recession in 1967, domestic
demand for steel rose rapidly in 1968 and 1969 with the Company register-
ing an 18% increase in domestic sales during the two-year period. Export
sales (mainly non-flat products) nearly tripled from 1967 to 1970. As a
result, overall sales tonnage rose by 28% from 1967 to 1970, while net sales
in U.S. dollars increased by 42%, reflecting a shift towards a better product
mix as well as the real price increases in 1970. As the Company's product-
ion went up to full capacity, its net profits increased dramatically from
the breakeven level of 1967.  The Company has a conservative debt/equity
ratio and its debt service coverage steadily improved with rising production.
2.15      Detailed historical balance sheets are given in Annex 5.  A suni-
mary analysis is given in the table below:

/2 The Company normally discounts about 1/3 of gross receivables,
/3 Defined as (cost of sales)/average inventories).
2.16      CSN's present long-term debt totals about US$68 million equivalent,
all in foreign exchange on which the Company carries the exchange risk. The
Eximbank has made seven loans to CSN totalling US$149 million with US$35
million outstanding (US$53 million including undisbursed amounts) at the
end of 1970; the final payment of the existing Eximbank loans is in 1982.
The current ratio after 1967 has been greater than 2:1, indicating CSN's
strong liquidity position. The high receivables to sales ratio and the low
inventory turnover point to the Company's high level of working capital.
Upon the Bank's recommendation CSN has reviewed and is changing its working
capital policies with a view to reducing raw material inventories (para. 4.05)
and accounts receivable (largely from Government agencies).
III. THE PROJECT
A.   Scope and Objectives
3.01      The project is designed both to increase the capacity of the plant
and to modernize and replace obsolete equipment, some of which has been used
for 25 years. The ongoing expansion (Stage I) to 1.7 million raw steel TPY
is expected to be completed on time and within cost estimates (US$67 million
equivalent).



-7-
3.02      The subsequent Stage II of development to bring capacity to 2.5
million raw steel TPY is the expansion project the Bank has been asked to
help finance. 1/ It is part of the Company's longer-term objective to raise
raw steel production capacity at Volta Redonda to 4.0 million TPY by 1980
(Stage III) or shortly thereafter. The plans and cost estimates for Stage II
have been prepared by the Company, with assistance from Arthur G. McKee and
Co. (McKee) and, in the case of the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) and continuous
casting facilities, by USS.
3.03      To reach the 2.5 million TPY capacity for Stage II, the following
additions are to be made: (i) expansion of the iron ore mines (Casa de Pedra)
near Belo Horizonte; (ii) a 5,200-ton/day sintering plant; (iii) a battery
of coke ovens with gas and tar recovery plant; (iv) a 6,000-ton/day blast
furnace; (v) a BOF steel plant with two 200-ton vessels and a new oxygen
plant (600 tons/day); (vi) a continuous slab-casting unit; (vii) modifications
to the existing hot strip mill, including new edgers, roughing stand and mill
tables and additions to the existing hot coil preparation line; (viii) one
continuous annealing line; (ix) two electrolytic tinning lines, including
coil preparation, shearing, assorting and shipping facilities; and shops.
A detailed description of the project is contained in Annex 6.
B.   Observations
3.04      The new sinter plant will enable the blast furnaces to run on a fully
sintered burden. The new 6,000-ton/day blast furnace is sized to increase
total iron making capacity of the plant to meet the requirements of the
4 million TPY stage. As one of the 12 largest blast furnaces in the world
and one of the two largest in the Western Hemisphere, it will be a highly
efficient operating unit. The combined effect of 100% burden preparation,
high hot blast temperature and top pressure operation and fuel injection will
minimize coke consumption and result in improved operating costs.
3.05      The phasing out of the existing open-hearth shop and its replace-
ment by a BOF shop will reduce steel making costs and, equally important,
improve finished product quality. The technical and economic feasibility
of slab versus ingot casting was studied by USS, which recommended continu-
ous slab casting. This process, which is comparatively new and requires
highly-skilled operators, is already being successfully used by some leading
steel producers including USS which will provide the necessary operational
back-up. The installation of the BOF and continuous casting facilities will
result in excess steel-making over rolling capacity which will necessitate
sales of slabs until a new hot strip mill is installed as part of Stage III.
1/   A small part of Stage II (one electrolytic tinning line, continuous
annealing and cold coil preparation lines) is being financed by the
Eximbank (US$10 million) due to its urgent nature. The cost of this
complementary investment (US$24.5 million) has been used in calculating
the rate of return for Stage II and is included in the US$448 million
total cost of Stage II referred to in para. 1.01.



- 8 -
3.06      Reductions in operating costs as a result of Stage II will be sig-
nificant on account of the installation of the basic iron and steel making
facilities which both replace obsolete equipment (open hearth furnaces) and
contribute to the expansion of capacity. A few facilities will be fully
utilized only upon completion of Stage III (blast furnace). This is a
typical feature of steel works undergoing expansion which, due to the large
size of economic plant units, cannot at every stage maintain a truly balanced
state. The objectives of Stage III are to bring the major production facili-
ties into balance at a capacity of 4 million raw steel TPY equivalent, while
increasing the share of coated products (such as tinplate and galvanized
coil and sheet) in the product mix.
C.   Ecology
3.07      The existing installations meet Brazilian pollution control regu-
lations which are still in the early stages of development. For the Stage
II expansion, the replacement of the open-hearth shop will make a major con-
tribution towards improving the environmental impact of the plant. Also
dust collection devices, especially at the blast furnace and BOF shop, water
treatment devices and scrubbers to minimize the sulfur content of the gas
emissions at the coke ovens and by-product plant will be included in the
project to provide water and air pollution control consistent with present-
day standards in industrialized countries. These facilities are provided
for in the cost of the project. More details on the ecological facilities
presently installed and being included in the project are given in Annex 7.
D.   Labor Force
3.08      At the start of 1971, CSN had 17,840 employees (including 14,360
in the steel works) for an annual rate of production of about 1.5 million
tons of raw steel. The incremental output of 1.0 million TPY calls for an
addition of 3,440 people. The labor force maintained in 1971 and after the
expansion is high by modern standards. To put the Company's labor force in
proper perspective indices for the U.S. and Japanese steel industry for 1970
show 13 and 13.2 man hours per ton of finished product respectively compared
with 21 man hours per ton which CSN envisages upon completion of the project.
It should be noted, however, that the Company has a relatively large invest-
ment in labor-intensive finishing facilities. CSN is taking steps to improve
the situation by facilitating early retirement and by attrition. During nego-
tiations the Company agreed to establish targets to bring the labor force to
more reasonable levels. Neither CSN nor the other steel plants has had
strikes in the last six years. The Company's labor turnover has been low
and its safety record good.
E.   Execution and Project Implementation Schedule
3.09      CSN has a well-functioning technical organization with several
expansion programs to its credit and is capable of carrying through all
stages of the project. As in the past, the Company has retained McKee to
assist in the project preparation and in procurement. In addition, USS has



- 9 -
been hired to carry out the engineering and provide technical know-how for
the BOF shop and continuous casting machine and assist with the operation
of the network control system. As the project progresses, the scope of
McKee's and USS's contracts may be extended and additional consultants may
be hired to cover further work including evaluation of bids, approval of
manufacturers' drawings and specifications, inspection and progressing of
the equipment, construction management and some specialized training of
operators.
3.10      CSN is currently having civil, structural, mechanical and elec-
trical design and detail work performed by the subsidiary established from
CSN's steel works engineering department (Annex 2). The drawing office
staff which numbers about 250 at present will be increased to about 400 to
handle the work load resulting from the project. The standard of work is
fully up to the requirements of the project.
3.11      Construction and erection will be carried out mostly by outside
contractors (about 85%), while CSN's crews will be responsible for additions
and alterations to existing facilities (about 15%). Equipment suppliers
will provide assistance in erection and start-up.
3.12      The construction schedule for Stage II is shown in Annex 8.  En-
gineering and procurement action has commenced. Expansion of the Company's
iron ore mines began late in 1971 along with the construction of the
complementary investments (footnote 1, para. 3.02). Orders for the facilities
to be financed by the Bank and the bilateral agencies are expected to be
placed starting in April 1972 and most installations are scheduled for
completion in the third quarter of 1975. The balance of the equipment will
become operational in 1976 in time to permit the projected increase in
production and sales shown in the financial projections. The delivery and
construction times are based on information provided by potential equipment
suppliers and are considered achievable.
IV. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCIAL PLAN
A.   Project Cost
4.01      Detailed capital costs of the part of the Stage II expansion for
which Bank financing is sought are contained in Annex 9. The following

*    Excluding complementary investments of US$24.5 million already financed.
**   Includes US$25.2 million which is the estimated foreign exchange component
of locally procured equipment and construction costs.
4.02      Capital costs are based on estimated equipment prices, construction
and erection costs updated to February 1971. Pre-operating expenses are
being charged to current operations. The equipment estimates are based
partly on studies by McKee and USS and partly on the cost of similar items
currently being installed.  Civil engineering and construction costs were
obtained by applying unit construction costs from the current expansion to
estimated quantities of excavation and materials. The properties of the
sub-soil are known and no problems are expected. To provide for physical
contingencies, a 10% allowance has been added. This is considered adequate.
4.03      A further 12.3% has been added to the estimated cost to cover
price contingencies. This is equal to 5% per annum from February 1971 to
the projected dates of disbursement. While recent changes in international
currency exchange rates have created difficulties in estimating accurately
the price contingency required, a study of competition and recent trends
among steel mill equipment suppliers and the basis of the equipment estimates
indicate that this provision should be adequate.
4.04      Brazilian manufacturers are expected to be awarded about 25% of
the equipment contracts for the project (Part I, para. 8.03) taking account
of the 15% margin of preference. This would result in foreign exchange re-
quirements of US$201 million for imported equipment, freight, insurance,
spares and engineering plus US$40 million for interest during construction,
bringing the total foreign exchange requirements, including about US$12



- 11 -
million for the complementary investments to an estimated US$253 million.
If only 10% of the equipment bids were won by Brazilian suppliers this would
increase to about US$283 million.
B.   Working Capital
4.05      The incremental working capital estimate of US$29 million for the
project (Stage II) is realistic. Inventories are forecast to decrease by
the completion of Stage I. CSN's Board adopted measures in September 1971
to provide better control of raw material inventory with a view to reducing
the overall level. These measures coupled with the planned modernization
of raw material handling should enable the company to realize the planned
decrease. However, if additional working capital is needed, CSN is expected
to be able to finance part of it from surplus cash and borrow any remaining
shortfall on a short-term basis.
C.   Financial Plan
4.06      The financial plan for the Stage II project expected to cost
USS423.7 million (excluding the complementary investments of US$24.5 mil-
lion) is based on contributions from the Bank and IDB (US$107.5 million)
being approximately equal to the credits provided by the bilateral agencies
(US$110.8 million). Foreign exchange requirements of US$241.3 million are
nearly covered by these foreign loans. The balance needed, together with
the local currency requirementa,will be supplied by internal cash genera-
tion (US$205.4 million).
4.07      The Bank/IDB financing is to be shared 60/40 between the two banks.
The two loans are to be for 15-1/2 years including a grace period of 4-1/2
years at the prevailing interest rates of 7-1/4 and 8% respectively (plus
1-3/4% p.a. additional on the Bank's loan as a fee for the Government guar-
antee). The terms of the bilateral credits have not been definitely set-
tled, but are expected to be for 15 years, including 3-1/2 years grace (i.e.
payments commencing 6 months after commissioning) at an average interest
cost of 7-1/2% per annum with a 10% downpayment. It is assumed in this
report that the downpayments will be provided by CSN from cash generation.
The cash generation appears adequate to meet the needs of the Company for
the project, working capital and complementary investments as well as debt
repayment. All funds needed to cover overruns or shortfall in cash genera-
tion, whether in foreign or local currency, are to be provided by the Gov-
ernment on terms acceptable to the Bank, under the Guarantee Agreement.

/1 Including consumption by CSN's fabrication shop.
5.02      CSN's total sales increased from 920,000 to 1,057,000 tons during
1968-70, or about 7% annually. Domestic sales during the same period rose
from 862,000 to 913,000 tons, with the share of flat products rising slight-
ly to about 82% of total sales. Exports - mostly non-flat products - in-
creased nearly two-fold in response to the Government's policy of incentives
to exports, including steel. Increasingly, Brazil's demand for flat-products
exceeded domestic supply, and in 1970 over 300,000 tons of flat products were
imported to supplement domestic output.



- 14 -
5.03      CSN, the only producer of tinplate and galvanized sheet in Brazil,
has not been able to meet domestic demand in recent years for these two prod-
ucts and substantial imports had to be authorized. In future, the Company
intends to give first priority to these two products and to increase its own
output and sales to an extent that would eliminate the need for imports.
Combined sales of tinplate, black and terne plate are expected to grow from
244,000 tons in 1970 to about 550,000 tons by 1977, implying an average
annual growth rate of over 12%. This is consistent with the expected 10%
growth rate for flat rolled products in Brazil. The Company will need
to plan for additional capacity to meet expected demand by about 1980.
5.04      For galvanized sheet and coil CSN plans to increase sales from
the 1970 level of 60,000 tons to 167,000 tons in 1977, equivalent to an
annual growth rate of nearly 16%. While this might appear to be optimistic,
it reflects realistic expectations created by demands for the housing, air-
conditioning and domestic and commercial utilities industries. There may be
some surplus capacity available for exports when the new facilities are first
commissioned in 1977 but such surplus is expected to be absorbed by domestic
demand within two years (Part I, para. 3.11).
5.05      As far as the market for plate is concerned, CSN will continue
to compete with USIMINAS and COSIPA, although only to a limited extent.
CSN will be catering primarily to a restricted segment of the market for
plate of narrow width (upto 72 inches), while both USIMINAS and COSIPA would
produce upto 160-inch wide plate. Moreover, CSN envisages an increase in
domestic plate sales from 119,000 tons (1970) to 140,000 tons in 1977. As
about 64,000 tons would be used in CSN's own structural fabrication shop,
only about 76,000 tons would be left for outside sales.
5.06      Domestic sales of hot-rolled products are projected to increase
from an average 166,000 tons per year in 1968-70 to 196,000 tons in 1977;
and sales of cold-rolled coil and sheet will actually decline from 169,000
tons in 1970 to 117,000 tons in 1977 in order to allow increased production
and sales of tinplate, galvanized sheet and coil (para. 4.03). The Company
thus plans to use its total capacity for flat-rolled products in a manner
which would yield maximum profit, by giving priority in the production plan
to tinplate, galvanized coil and sheet, other cold-rolled products, hot-
rolled products and plate in that order.
5.07      In non-flat products CSN competes with a number of privately
owned companies; but in these the Company has some advantage, as it is
the only Brazilian producer of shapes larger than 4 inches, and part of
its output will be used in its own structural fabrication shop. Expected
sales increases of rails and accessories are linked to the Government's
Railway Development Program, which is now being given particular emphasis.
Overall, the Company's domestic sales projections appear realistic.
5.08      Export markets are expected to absorb about 100,000 tons per year
of CSN's output up to 1976, less than the Company exported in 1969 and 1970.
For 1977 CSN plans to maintain its exports of rolled products at the 1976
level; and in addition to sell abroad about 240,000 tons of semi-finished
steel (slabs) which it could produce in that year, but for which it would
lack rolling capacity. It may be difficult for CSN to export such a large
quantity in one year at the assumed price, and the financial projections
have been tested to see the effect if the Company recovered only marginal
costs on these sales (para 8.04).



- 15 -
5.09      The exportable surplus is likely to be absorbed by domestic demand
within two years or thereabouts. At the completion of Stage II the Company's
rolling and finishing capacity for flat products will not be sufficient to
process all its raw steel production. Over the next few years, CSN intends
to review market developments in order to firm up its market prospects, by
types of products, for the second half of the seventies, and then decide
what finishing capacity it should most suitably add at that time. As dis-
cussed in Part I (para. 6.09), assurances were received during negotiations
that the Government will consult with the Bank prior to sanctioning any new
plant to produce flat steel products.
B.   Geogranhic Distribution of Sales
5.10      At present about 58% of CSN's domestic sales are made in the Sao
Paulo-Rio de Janeiro areas, which are the fastest growing centers of consump-
tion in the country. The Company expects to maintain its position in these
markets and by 1980 may improve its share as its production of tinplate and
galvanized sheet replaces current imports.
C.   Marketing Organization
5.11      CSN has a well established marketing organization under the Com-
mercial Department which has a staff of about 200 persons divided into two
major sections (i) market research and sales promotion, and (ii) commercial
sales. There are five domestic sales offices in the country's major cities
and one export office. About three-quarters of CSN's sales are made directly
to the customers and the remainder through dealers. Dealers provide facilities
for warehousing, some processing and credit and sell in small lots. The Com-
pany is at present reviewing its policies regarding sales through dealers in
order to systematize their role, rationalize their purchases and inventory
policy and determine whether it should increase its own direct sales to con-
sumers.
5.12      CSN shares a marketing information pool (serviced by electronic
data processing facilities) with USIMINAS and COSIPA. It also undertakes
periodic surveys to check the adequacy of its sales program and improve
production planning. In view of the considerable growth in sales envisaged
and the foreseeable competition among the three principal producers in the
mid-1970's, CSN will need to develop progressively more dynamic sales pol-
icies and practices and improve the efficiency of the distribution channels -
both dealers and its own depots - as well as its production planning and in-
ventory practices. CSN has agreed to outline a program for improving its
sales organization before the increased production is realized.

VI.  PROCUREMENT
A.   General Procurement
6.01      Equipment to be financed under the Bank and IDB loans (approximate-
ly US$100 million) will be procured by international competitive tender, with
Brazilian manufacturers receiving a 15% preference, which is less than the
normal import tariff (waived for the expansion project). The two banks will
finance 100% of internationally bid equipment and spare parts won by Brazilian
or foreign manufacturers with financing shared between the two banks on a
60/40 basis. The balance of the imported equipment (approximately US$123
million, with the exception of the US$12 million in complementary items
which have already been ordered) will be bid competitively among suippliers
of the countries providing bilateral credits. Civil and local construction
works, which are not being financed by IBRD/IDB, are to be provided by local
contractors unless the quoted costs and schedule indicate that the Brazilian
construction industry is becoming over-extended. In such circumstances the
Company has agreed to secure foreign quotations for subsequent contracts.
CSN has requested IBRD/IDB to finance engineering fees retroactively to July
1971 when payments began. The amount due through February 1972, when the
loan is expected to be signed, is about US$1.2 million, of which the Bank's
share would be US$720,000. The equipment to be financed by the Bank is shown
in Annex 11, and further details on procurement are found in Part I. During
negotiations the Government agreed to expedite the registration of purchase
contracts and approval of import licenses.
B.   Allocation of Bank's Loan
6.02      On the assumption that the Government will permit normal tax
incentives to Brazilian suppliers of equipment for the project, identical
to those granted for exports, Brazilian manufacturers may win up to 55% of
equipment bid competitively under the Bank and IDB loans. Based on this
estimate, the maximum amount of local currency financing by the Bank would
be about US$27 million.

6.03      The estimated disbursement schedule for the Bank's loan is shown
in Annex 11. It is based on detailed estimates of order placements and
expected delivery times for equipment in line with the construction schedule
in para. 3.12.
VII. PRODUCTION COSTS AND SELLING PRICES
A.   Raw Materials
7.01      The availability of domestic iron ore of good quality has been an
important factor in the development of Brazil's integrated steel plants. As
the delivered cost of iron ore to industrialized countries may contain a
freight element as high as 60%, CSN's iron ore costs are in comparison very
favorable. Based on US$4.80 per ton delivered to the plant for 65% Fe ore,
the ore cost per ton of finished steel produced by CSN is US$9.30. In con-
trast, plants in Japan and Western Europe have a typical ore cost per ton
of finished steel of US$17 to 24. Offsetting this inherent advantage is
Brazil's need to import a large proportion of its coking coal requirements
and the Government's insistence that a proportion be obtained domestically,
at a cost substantially above that of the better grade imported coal. Agree-
ment was reached during negotiations that the Government will not increase the
20% domestic requirement assumed in the projections. CSN's coal cost per ton
of finished steel amounts to US$27.50, somewhat higher than the indicated
best costs of US$18 to 22 in Western Europe and Japan. Thus, the combined
cost per ton of steel for the principal raw materials, iron ore and coal,
to CSN is US$36.80, or almost the same as the lowest costs in Japan and
Western Europe.
7.02      Brazil has virtually unlimited iron ore and hence an assured supply.
A full discussion of Brazil's iron ore resources is contained in the appraisal
of the Mineracoes Brasilieras Reunidas Iron Ore Project (PI-10) dated June 16,
1971.  The Bank has reviewed the outlook for coking coal 1/ over the next
decade and concluded that while short- and medium-term imbalances in the
market cannot be ruled out, there are no serious long-term problems in the
availability of coking coal for the world iron and steel industry. The other
principal raw7 materials are limestone, dolomite, and to a lesser extent, scrap.
These are available in Brazil and no difficulties are foreseen in their supply.
Further details regarding raw materials including quality and sources are
given in Annex 12 and Map 2. Transportation and shipping used by the Company
are adequate and are being improved and extended. Water and electric power
supplies are available in sufficient quantities.

B.   Production Costs
7.03      CSN's direct production costs for representative products are
shown below at completion of Stage I (1973) and Stage II (1977). For raw
materials, labor and material inputs, January/February 1971 costs have been
used.  Direct costs per ton for individual products are contained in Annex 13.

*    Including raw materials, labor and supplies, but excluding general
overhead expenses, depreciation and ICM tax.
7.04      The economies of scale to be achieved by the expansion and the impact
of new technology are seen in the estimated drop in production cost for slabs
from US$70 per ton in 1971 to US$59 in 1977, a 16% decline. These improve-
ments are consistent with the results of similar technology applied in
other steel plants known to the Bank. The additions in the finishing lines
result in further cost savings over and above those expected to be achieved
in the production of slabs; thus costs of tinplate and hot rolled coil which
are expected to account for more than half of CSN's sales of flat products
decline 19% from 1971 to 1977 and rolled structurals 18%. Total fixed costs
per average ton of rolled steel sold at full capacity of Stage II are
estimated to be about US$70 of which depreciation is about US$20. Variable
costs would be about US$94 excluding the manufacturing (ICM) tax of US$27
per ton. The unit input and operating costs are considered realistic and
are in line with those obtained in major steel-producing countries.
C.   Selling Prices
7.05      CSN's selling price assumptions, shown in Annex 14, are based on
February 1971 prices. The average selling price of CSN's rolled steel products
(excluding ICM tax) is about US$180/ton and, on a product by product basis, are
in line with Western European prices. Minor decreases for cold-rolled product
prices have been assumed from 1976 onward when the Stage II production com-
mences. Maximum prices are established twice a year after approval by the
Interministerial Price Council (CIP), based on increases in costs outside of
CSN's control, i.e. raw materials, labor contracts and depreciatlon. CTP's
policies are discussed in Part I, para. 2.19.



- 19 -
7.06      As discussed in Part I, paras. 5.10 and 5.11, the Government agreed
during negotiations that steel prices should remain at levels which would
remain resonably competitive with imports and permit the companies to (a)
earn an adequate return on capital under efficient operating conditions, (b)
meet their financial obligations and (c) contribute to the financing of
further expansion. It was also agreed that savings in production costs as
a result of the steel expansion program might be shared by Brazilian consumers
by a reduction of individual steel prices in real terms. To this end the
Government and the Bank will consult as necessary to determine whether steel
prices are appropriate. More specifically, the Bank obtained agreement that
(a) CSN would take all reasonable steps to ensure that its projected revenue
will not be reduced in real terms during the implementation of the project,
without exchanging views with the Bank and (b) a detailed study on the
future price structure will be carried out by the Government.
VIII. FUTURE: PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION
A.   Profitability
8.01      Forecast income and cash flow statements through 1979 together
with major assumptions are contained in Annexes 15 and 16. The income state-
ments are summarized below:

/1   Estimate.
8.02      As a result of the completion of Stage I and complementary invest-
ments net sales increase US$99 million, or about 41% between 1971 and 1975,
while net profit after taxes goes up US13 million, or about 52%. Although
additional sales from Stage II are only US$91 million, the better efficiency
of the facilities permits CSN's net profit after taxes to more than double
from 1975 to 1979. In the years of 1978/1979 net profit after taxes provides
an 18% return on sales and 14% on average equity. These demonstrate the bene-
ficial effects of the project (including cost reduction) and its financial
viability. The technical and commercial assumptions underlying the forecast
are considered sound and the projected profit levels attainable.



- 20 -
B.   Break-Even Point
8.03      After completion of Stage II, the profit break-even point is about
60% of production capacity or 1.1 million tons of finished steel. Alterna-
tively, prices at full capacity could fall by 20% before the Company would
show a loss. At peak debt service requirements, the cash break-even point
would be 47% of production capacity since maximum debt repayment of US$26 mil-
lion is less than the US$39 million annual depreciation.  In the same year,
assuming full production, prices could fall about 27% before the Company's
cash generation would be zero. Further details on break-even levels are
found in Annex 17.
C.   Financial Rate of Return
8.04      The project provides a suitable incremental financial rate of
return (after taxes) of 13.4%. If sales decrease in the years 1975 to 1979
to equal the Bank's most conservative domestic market forecasts and no
benefits accrue from export sales during those years, the return would drop
to 10.6% which would be marginally acceptable.   The assumptions used for
the rate of return calculations, as well as details of the sensitivity tests,
thereon are contained in Annex 18.
8.05      To determine the effect of various events on the financial rate
of return, sensitivity tests have been run which show the following:

ect costs would result in a return of 9.7%.  A drop of 10% in sales without
a corresponding reduction in operating costs decreases the return to 10.8%.
An increase in the operating costs by 10% decreases the return to 12.1%.



- 21 -
If 10% increases in project costs and operating costs occur while revenue
is being reduced by 10%, the return drops to 8.3%. Based on the low prob-
ability of such a combination of circumstances the project is expected to
provide a satisfactory financial return.
8.07      In addition to (a) possible delays caused by the simultaneous ex-
pansion of three large steel projects in a rapidly expanding economy and (b)
a market growth somewhat slower than predicted, the risks inherent in the
project are basically in the use of the new technology. The slab caster
alongside the BOF facility requires sophisticated scheduling and highly-
skilled operation if delays and loss of production are to be avoided.
Although CSN will benefit from the experience of USS, one of the acknowl-
edged leaders in the field of continuous slab- casting, the Bank neverthe-
less recognizes that production may be adversely affected in the first years
of operation. In the Bank's judgement there is a possibility that the rate
of return could fall to 10%. The risk of it being lower is not great con-
sidering the fact that the technical difficulties that may confront CSN have
been successfully overcome elsewhere. This is also true for any adverse ef-
fects on account of market limitations which should only be temporary.
D.   Financial Position
8.08      Forecast balance sheets for 1971-1979 are contained in Annex 19.
Significant data from these are shown below:
Selected Balance Sheet Items
(In Millions of US Dollars)

/1   Estimate.
8.09      The long-term debt/equity ratio remains favorable during the imple-
mentation of the project with a maximum debt position of 42% being reached
in 1974.  Thereafter, the debt/equity ratio declines and by 1979 CSN would
have only 25% in debt. This conservative capitalization will place the Com-
pany in a good position to finance further expansion (para. 8.12).  The cur-
rent ratio is satisfactory, particularly in the years 1971-1975, and there-
after levels off to about 1.5 to 1. The current ratio after completion of
Stage II would be higher if surplus funds generated had been included in
current assets during that period.  It has been assumed that these funds
will be used for further expansion and will not therefore be available as
working capital.



- 22 -
8.1l)     The Company's financial position should allow payment of reasonable
dividends. During negotiations it was agreed that dividendls (except on exist-
ing preferred shares) would not be permitted to the extent that the current
ratio falls below 1.5:1. The Treasury will re-invest its dividends *luring
the project's construction period. CSN has agreed not to undertake addi-
tional capital investments in excess of US$12 million equivalent annually,
including those in subsidiaries as well as normal renewals and replacements,
during the life of the Bank's loan without the Bank's approval. It has also
been agreed that the Company be permitted to borrow additional long-term
funds if its debt does not exceed its equity or if projected debt service
coverage is at least two times.
E.   Debt Service Coverage
8.11      Based on the proposed financial plan, CSN should have little
difficulty servicing its debt. Long-term debt service coverage forecasts
indicate the following:
Long-Term Debt Service Coverage
Year                       1971/11972  1973  1974  1975  1976  1977  1978  1979
Times Covered               3.4   3.4   3.3   2.6   2.4   3.1   3.5   3.6   3.7
/1   Estimate.
While debt service coverage drops in 1974 and 1975, it exceeds 3 times in
all years after Stage II becomes operational. This is ample and would per-
mit some additional borrowing in the mid- to late 1970's to lhelp finance
the company's growth.
F.   Further Expansion (Stage III)
8.12      As mentioned in para. 5.09 above, CSN will need additional rolling
and finishiing capacity in the mid- 1970's. Also to meet the continuing in-
crease in steel demand in Brazil, the Company plans to undertake a further
expansion of its raw steel capacity to about 4 million TPY before the end of
the decade. These plans are in a preliminary stage but tentative estimates
of the cost are calculated (in 1971 prices) at US$440 million, of which
about half will be in foreign exchange. Annex 20 shows income, cash flow and
balance sheet projections super-imposing these additional investments on the
financial forecasts of Stage II.

IX. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
A.   Economic Rate of Return
9.01      Based on the estimated import prices of steel over the assumed 18-
year life of the assets, the project yields an incremental internal economic
rate of return of 13%. The underlying assumptions and details of the econo-
mic analysis (including sensitivity tests) are given in Annex 18. The econo-
mic return is generally sensitive to the same factors as the financial return.
It is affected greatly by clhanges in the sales price or by delays in comple-
tion. A 10% decrease in the sales price reduces the return to 10.5%. A one-
year delay in project completion and a resultant 15% increase in project costs
reduces the return to 9.3%. A combination of selling prices 10% lower than
assumed and operating costs 10% higher will still produce an economic return
of 9.5%. Thus, the project provides a satisfactory return under the most
probable circumstances and a marginally acceptable return under adverse cir-
cumstances.
B.   Competitiveness and Protection Required
9.02      As indicated in Chapter VII and discussed in greater detail in
Part I, selling prices for finished flat rolled steel products in Brazil
are in line with prices prevailing in Western Europe. A comparison was made
in midi-1971 of the CIF import price (ex duties) of the various steel products
to be manufactured by CSN which revealed that, on average, import prices
for CSN's products were less than 10% below CSN's prices. Since, as indicated
in para. 8.05, the project yields a satisfactory 10.8% return if gross sales
revenue were to decrease by 10% from domestic prices, the project does not
need tariff protection, assuming maintenance of the international prices
prevailing before the currency readjustments were initiated. This is not
to say that Brazilian steel should not have the reasonable tariff protection
which is described in Part I.
C.   Estimated Foreign Exchange Savings
9.03      Net foreign exchange savings by the Stage II expansion have been
calculated to be about US$70 million per year, offsetting the estimated foreign
exchange costs of the project in about three and a half years at full operation.
Thus the project will have a very beneficial impact on Brazil in terms of for-
eign exchange. Further details of the calculation of foreign exchange savings
are shlown in Annex 21.
X. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
10.01     Agreement was reached on the following principal points during
loan negotiations:



- 24 -
A.   Commitments by the Government
(a) The Company will remain an independent corporation and will
not be merged or consolidated without consultations with
the Bank (para. 2.07).
(b)  The Government will consult with the Bank prior to sanc-
tioning any new fiat product capacity before the completion
of Stage III (para. 5.09).
(c) Agreement to reinvest the Government's dividlends during
implementation of the project and satisfactory arrangements
for the provision of funds for project completion in case
of cost overruns or shortfall in cash generation (paras. 4.07
and 8.10).
(d) Assurance of prompt registration of purchase contracts and
issuance of import licenses (para. 6.01).
(e) The Government and the Bank will consult on future steel
pricing policy (para. 7.06).
(f) Agreement that the steel companies will not be required
to use low-quality, high-cost domestic coal for more than
20% of the requirements after Stage II is in operation
(para. 7.01).
B.   Commitments by the Company
(g) No new subsidiaries without Bank approval (para. 2.06).
(h) Consult with Bank regarding terms of reference for management
consultants and implementation of recommendations as appropriate
(para. 2.10).
(j) Agreement to submit plans to improve marketing organization
(para. 5.12).
(k)  Limitation on dividends (para. 8.10).
(1) Limitation on new investments and additional investments in
subsidiaries without approval of Bank (paras. 2.06 and 8.10).
(m) Restrictions on new borrowings (para. 8.10).
(n) Agreement to bring labor force to acceptable levels
(para. 3.08).
(o) Agreement that, in the event that there is evidence that
the local construction industry is becoming overextended,
foreign quotations will be sought for subsequent contracts
(para. 6.01).



- 25 -
10.02     Concurrent effectiveness of the IDB loan will be a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank's loan.
10.03     on the basis of these assurances, the proposed project constitutes
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$64.5 million equivalent.

An ore yard, approximately 265 feet wide by 800 feet long, is located
near the stockhouses of the two furnaces for storage of ore, flux stone and sin-
ter requirements. An ore bridge is used for ore stacking and reclaiming, and
for loading transfer cars that fill the furnace bins.
Gas cleaning equipment at the No. 1 furnace includes a dust collector,
a Venturi washer and two cooling towers; No. 2 furnace has a dust collector and
a tower washer. Five precipitators are connected to a common main which receives
the primary washed gas from both furnaces. A system of gas mains to stoves,
boilers, coke ovens, and blast furnace gas holder is connected to the precipi-
tator discharges.
Equipment for the recovery of flue dust from washer water is also pro-
vided.
Steelmaking Facilities
Steelmaking facilities include an 8-furnace open hearth shop, mold
yard, skull cracker, slag dump, scrap preparation and charging box loading area,
a storage building for raw and burned dolomite, and a brick shed.
The open hearth shop is arranged with conventional charging and teem-
ing aisles. Two hot metal mixers, 800 and 600 tons in capacity are located in
an elevated position at one end of the charging bay and are arranged to fill
transfer ladles mounted on cars at the charging floor level. Transfer of the
hot metal to the mixers is done by means of a high level crane. Each 200 ton
furnace is equipped with a waste heat boiler. The eight furnaces are equipped
with vertical roof lances for oxygen injection.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
The stockyard area is also used for scrap preparation and charging box
loading.
Tracks in the steelmaking area are arranged to receive hot metal from
the blast furnaces at the mixer end of the shop, after it is weighed on a track
scale. Other tracks are arranged for convenient movement of mold car drags bet-
ween the mold yard and teeming aisle and to the stripper area, located in the
soaking pit furnace building.
Oxygen Plant
The Stage I expansion supplemented the single oxygen plant available to
produce 30 MT/day of 99.5% purity oxygen by a new 70 ton/day plant that was in-
stalled in 1970. Another plant to produce 250 tons/day is being provided. This
plant is rated to supply simultaneously 240 tons/day of 99.5% purity gaseous
oxygen and 10 tons/day of 99.5% purity liquid oxygen, plus 35 tons/day (95 tons/
day in the future) of gaseous nitrogen containing no more than 5 ppm of oxygen,
and 2.5 tons/day maximum of liquid nitrogen containing no more than 5 ppm of
oxygen.
Blooming Mill
Ingot mold stripping facilities, including two stripping cranes, are
located at the east end of the soaking pit building.
The soaking pit facilities are two-hole units of the regenerative type.
The pits are fired with a mixture of blast furnace gas and coke oven gas.
The reversing slabbing-blooming mill is part of the original Volta
Redonda plant equipment. In previous expansion plans, changes were made to this
mill to include the following: increased roll opening, new front and rear mill
tables, new manipulator parts, roll balance system alteration to suit the in-
creased mill roll opening, main mill electrical drive system revanping with
existing 6,ooo hp, 50/130 rpm, mill drive motor modified for 7,000 hp rating,
screwdown mechanical and electrical systems changed to provide the addition of
automatic screwdown positioning by means of a PRODAC 50 computer.
In the Stage I expansion program, improvement of the mill has been
continued. With the old mill stands and tables used as a breakdown unit for
the rail and structural mill, new stands are being provided to increase the
rolling capacity of the slabbing-blooming mill to over 1.7 million tons per
year. The revamped mill will have the following main characteristics:
441x X 96' two high reversing slabbing-blooming mill, high lift type,
with hydraulic top roll balance, and pinion stand driven from an existing
7,000 hp, 50/130 rpm.
Breakdown Mill
As mentioned in the preceding item, the existing 40ho slabbing-blooming
mill will be relocated to operate as a primary unit for the rail and structural
mill.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
Rail and Structural Mill
The rail and structural mill is capable of rolling rails up to 115
pounds per yard, and structurals up to 20"1 I-beams, 15" channels and 8" by 8"
angles, as well as rounds, squares, rail splice bars and tie plates.
The facilities include two 18' wide furnaces (one added in the Stage
I expansion), fired with coke oven gas and oil. The first furnace can heat 45
tons of blooms per hour, and the second 65 tons per hour.
The 3-stand, 23" and 29" rail and structural mill is provided with
tilting and traveling tables. Roughing and intermediate stands are driven by
a 4,000 hp motor and the finishing stand by a 1,500 hp unit.  Finishing equip-
ment includes roller type straighteners, shears, cold saws, rail drilling and
milling machines, slow cooling pits, gag presses, skids, and facilities for
rail accessories including a splice bar and a tie plate heating furnace.
Plate and Hot Strip MNll
Heating facilities for slabs rolled on the plate and hot strip mill
now comprise three 18' wide furnaces burning coke oven gas or oil. These fur-
naces have been rebuilt in previous expansion plans; and, by the end of the
Stage I expansion, two furnaces will have their effective heating capacities
increased by 50% each.
The plate mill consists of one 28"1 by 56" 2-high scale-breaker, driven
by a 1,250 hp motor; one 36½" and 49" by 72" 4-high reversing rougher, with a
direct-connected 5,000 hp synchronous motor through a 5.6 to 1 ratio gear reducer.
Each of the roughing mills is equipped with vertical edgers. As a plate mill,
these stands can produce plates up to 66 inches wide. A cooling table, 50 feet
wide and about 65 feet long, follows the auxiliary roughing stand and leads to
a transfer runout table equipped with a hot leveler. The runout table, which
allows further cooling, inspection and marking of the plate, is followed by an
upcut shear, a caster table, and a single side-squaring shear.
The plate mill stands also serve as roughers for the strip mill.
Before the Stage I expansion the hot mill included six 4-high, 22½'" and 46" by
52" finishing stands, each driven by a 2,500 hp, 250 to 500 rpm adjustable
speed D.C. motor. Delivery speed of the last stand ranges from 1,050 to
2,100 feet per minute. Following Stage I modifications, the hot strip mill
will have:
- one descaling unit, initially before the two-high roughing scale-
breaker and, ultimately, ahead of a vertical edger which is to
be installed in the future;
- one descaling system with a nominal pressure of 2,380 psi at the
descaling pumps;
- automatic gauge control on each of the six finishing stands;



ANNEX 1
Page 5
- one 22½" and 26" x 52"1 four-high finishing stand as a 7th
stand in the finishing train;
- mountings for two X-ray thickness gauges following the 7th
finishing stand.
The hot strip rolling is followed by two continuous picklers,
one for material up to 4411 and the other for 48" material. Each pickler
has a flash type butt welder, a flash trimmer and side trimmers, plus
normal entry and delivery end equipment.
A shearing line for strip up to 3/16" thick and up to 48"
wide, includes an uncoiler, shear, inspection table, a 2-high skin.-pass
mill, two roller levelers, and pilers for reject and prime material.  A
separate line is provided for side-trimming and rewinding of hot rolled
coils prior to shearing or shipping. The additions to be introduced in
the Stage I include a hot rolled coil preparation line with crop shear
and scrap box, 16" diameter scrap cutter, a 32" x 54" two-high temper
mill capable of at least 2% strip reduction, and two 16" diameter strip
printers.
Cold Strip Mills
The cold mill facilities comprise an 18I" and 46" by 52" 4-high
cold reduction mill (No. 1) to roll light gauge strip and steel for tinplate.
The last (fifth) stand is driven by a 2,000 hp, 200 to 455 rpm motor, at
a delivery speed ranging from 970 to 2,300 fpm. No. 2 cold reduction
mill is a 5-stand, 4-high, 21"t and 53" by 56" mill used for rolling sheet
strip in widths up to 48 inches. A total connected horsepower of 21,000
hp drives the five stands and a recoiler. Both cold reduction mills are
provided with automatic gauge control equipment, including X-ray thick-
ness gauge.
Electrolytic Cleaning Lines
Two of the three existing electrolytic cleaning lines have been
improved and provided with edge control equipment. The third line, to
be provided in the Stage I expansion, is rated to operate at 2,000 feet
per minute.

Annealing
The anmealing facilities for cold reduced strip in coils consists
of two groups of equipment arranged as follows: area No. 1-31 furnaces and
119 bases, all for 54" diameter coils, area No, 2-24 furnaces and 86 bases,
half for 54" diameter coils and half for 66" diameter coils.  Atmosphere
gas for the furnaces is generated in four DX units and three HNX units.
Coke ovens gas is provided as fuel for the furnaces and for generating
reducing atmospheric gases.
Temper Mills
The temper mill installations include No. 1 unit with one 18½"
and 46's by 521", 4-high stand with mandrel type uncoiler and recoiler for
cold rolled sheet strips. The mill is driven by two 500 hp motors. Total
connected power includes 1,000 hp to drive the mill rolls and 600 hp on
the recoilers A 200-kw drag generator is driven by back tension on the
strip passing through the uncoiler.  Delivery speed range of the mill is
1 ,450 to 2,420 fpm. The equipment includes a coil downender with entry
and delirery conveyors.
No. 2 temper mill for tinplate and other light gage strip is a
19" and 49"1 by 43" a 2-stand tandem mill with entry and delivery tension
rolls, payoff reel, and mandrel type uncoiler. Connected motor power
totals 21,000 hp. Delivery speed ranges from 1,990 to 3,480 fpm.
A temper pass and cold reduction mill are being installed as
part of Stage I expansion. It includes two four high stands, 21" and
49" x 43" for processing tinplate gauge strip.
Sheet Shearing Lines
Two flying shear lines are installed. They operate at speed up
to 350 feet per minute, and shear sheet strip up to 48" wide. Both lines
are designed to shear 14 to 30 gage strip into 2-feet 6" to 16 foot lengths.
Coated Products
Hot_2ip Galyanizing facilities include a rocker-type sheet pick-
ler, wooden tanks, an overhead crate-handling system, two hot dip lines,
and a molten metal holding pot. A corrugating machine and resquaring

Roll Shops
Three roll shops are provided, the third installed in the Stage I
expansion. All shops are equipped with lathes, roll-grinders, wabbler shaping
machine, drills, blast abrasive equipment, industrial tractors and travelling
cranes.
Maintenance Shops
Existing maintenance facilities and related storage areas include
boiler shop, electrical repair shop, railroad car repair shop, locomotive
repair shop, machine shop, paint shop, pattern shop, and foundry.
In the Stage I expansion, the foundry is to be enlarged by the
addition of facilities to produce quality castings, rolls, ingot molds and
stools to accommodate a productionr,Level of 1,700,000 tons of steel per year
using conventional ingot techniques. The maximum roll casting weight is 45
tons. The foundry building area will be increased by 5,677 square meters.
A 30-ton electric furnace and a car-type heat treating furnace will be
installed.
Services
Various service facilities are to be provided for the increased
administration, operation and maintenance needs of the plant. These include
a large general office building near the main gate, but outside of the plant
boundaries; a general laboratory building near the main plant gate; a control
laboratory; a third laboratory close to the blast furnace and coke plant;
laboratory rooms and areas in the foundry and other individual departments;
and a spectrographic laboratory.

A main building for the stores department is included in the
vicinity of the electrical maintenance shop; provision for raw material
storage, construction material storage, general storage, a customis building,
expediting building and a scale have been added as part of the Stage I
expansion.
Rolling Stock and Vehicles
These include a total of 267 locomotives and cars, 216 trucks and
automotive behicles; and 36 mobile cranes, bulldozers, scrapers and front-end
loaders.
Utilities
Boiler Houses: The Volta Redonda plant has three sources of steam.
The blast frinace boiler house has capacity to generate 730,000 pounds of
steam per hour at 475 psig and 725 degree F, in 7 boilers. In addition,
each of the eight open hearth furnaces-is provided with a firetube waste-heat
boiler and a motor-driven induced draft fan. These boilers produce steam at
a pressure of 165 psig and h50 degree F; and two automatic out-door boilers
near the rolling mills produce 50 ton/hour each at 165 psig and 450 degree F.
Powerhouse
Three blast furnaces turbo blowers (two of which are modified in the
Stage I expansion) are installed in the powerhouse. Blowers No. 1 and No. 2,
rated 35 psig discharge pressure and 65,000 inlet cfm are to be driven by
turbines and operated in parallel. Blower No. 3 is rated at 100,000 inlet cfm
and a discharge pressure of 35 psig.
Electric Power Distribution
All power used at Volta Redonda was purchased or generated at 50
cycles, 3 phase, prior to the Stage I expansion. Thereafter the capacity of the
6.9 KV-50 cycles power distribution system will be exceeded by the increased
demand. An increase in 50 cycle power is needed to meet the larger demand.
This was complicated by two immediate problemss
1. Because of the current national plans in Brazil to convert
gradually from 50 cycles to 60 cycles, no additional 50
cycles power is available for purchase. Furthermore, no
additional power generation can be expected at this from
CSN's own plant;
2. Reinforcement of the 50 cycle distribution system as it
now e;fists is seriously hampered by the fully loaded con-
dition of the transformers at the main substation, by the
lack of available space for rearrangements of existing
switchgear, and by congestion in cable routes and duct
facilities.



ANNEX 1
Page 9
To solve both these problems, two 30,000 kw frequency converters were
provided to convert 60-cycle power from the new incoming 132 kv lines as a
supply for the additional 6.9 kv 50-cycle power required by the Stage I expan-
sion. Power generating facilities consist of four steam-driven turbogenerators,
two 5,000 kw units and two 10,000 kw units at 0.8 power factor.
Water System
The water system pumping plant, located on the south bank of the
Paraiba River, supplies directly or indirectly all water for the plant. The
inlet is provided with screen and four silt-settling basins.
The second source of general service water is the recirculating pump
house, where a portion of the discharge water from the powerhouse surface con-
densers is repumped into the blast furnace cooling water system. The five
service water pumps located in the river pump house have a rating of 12,500
gallons per minute at 170 feet head. The recirculating water puwps are rated
12,500 gpm at 170 feet head and were formerly located at the river punp house.
Seven circulating water punps, which serve the surface condensers at
the turboblowers and turbogenerators in the powerhouse are located at the main
pump house and each has a pumping capacity of 15,000 gpm at O0 feet head.
The water treatment plant, located near the main pump house, provides
treated water to the CSN plant and to the city of Volta Redonda. It is supplied
by three raw water pumps, previously mentioned, in the main pump house; each of
these pumps has a capacity of 4.,000 gpm at 60 feet head. The treated water is
delivered to the city and to points of usage in the plant, by three pumps each
rated 2,600 gpm at 170 feet head.
A water clarifying facility is located adjacent to and north of the
water treatment plant, for supplying process water to the electrolytic tinning
lines and to other production operations using processed water.
Fuels
Coke oven gas from the by-product plant goes first to a 1,000,000 cubic
foot gas holder, and precipitator-cleaned blast furnace gas is piped to a 5,000,000
cubic foot gas holder. There are also four oil storage tanks with a combined
capacity of over 2,200,000 gallons.
Fuel oil is received in tank trucks. A new pipe-line, projected and
approved by PETROBRAS (Caxias - Sta. Cruz - Volta Redonda pipeline), will be
completed by the third quarter of 1972. This will provide sufficient capacity
to meet not only the fuel oil needs of the 2.5 million ton program, but the
future expansion as well.
By-product tar is used as a fuel only in the open hearth furnaces.
For special applications, such as cutting-torch fuel, liquefied petro-
leum gas is available from storage tanks and acetylene from generators located
within the CSN plant.

ANNEX 2
CSN's Subsidiaries
The following companies are the subsidiaries of CSN:
1. CECISA - Imobiliaria Santa Cecilia S.A.
CECISA, also located in Volta Redonda was organized on February 24,
1964, and it handles construction and real-estate activities for CSN. It
builds and sells houses and apartments to employees under the official hous-
ing program in collaboration with BNH - Banco Nacional de Habitacao (National
Housing Bank). It also handles the administration of CSNts properties,
supervises repairs and draws up leases and contracts, etc.
2. COBRAPI - Companhia Brasileira de Projectos Industriais
COBRAPI, the largest engineering corporation in Brazil, emerged in
January 28, 1963 out of the engineering department CSN had at that time. It
is now an efficient and well established company dealing with engineering
projects not only for CSN but also for many others, especially but not ex-
clusively in the steel industry. Besides the work performed for CSN's
expansion, COBRAPI rendered the following services to these companies:
COSIPA    - Expansion plan in cooperation with Arthur G. McKee,
USIBA     - Construction of the plant,
ACESITA   - Plant expansion,
ICOMI     - Design of building for the manganese pelletizing plant,
FERRO E AGO DE VITORIA - A new electric open hearth plant,
COMINAG   - Calcination of magnesite, and
COSIM     - Expansion feasibility plan.
It also promoted courses for specialization of technicians and draftsmen.
It is located in Volta Redonda. It works on a cost-plus basis, charging
CSN with its lowest rate.



ANNEX 2

3. EPLAN - Emissao e Planejamnento de Seguros S.A.
Under Brazilian insurance laws and regulations, firms that may
operate as agents for insurance companies are allowed to exist. EPLAN, one
such firm, was organized on April 29, 1968. It earns a commission on the
insurance handled, plus a participation on the profits made during the year
on the policies issued.
4.  LAVADOR - Lavador de Capivari S.A.
LAVADOR was organized on August 18, 1968, when CSN decided to
concentrate only on the steel producing activities, leasing some of the
secondary supporting operations to subsidiary companies. This company grew
out of the coal washing facilities at Tubarao, Santa Catarina State. The
plant also washes coal for USIMINAS and COSIPA.
5. OPALMA - Oleos de Palma S.A.
This corporation was established in Salvador, Bahia, on May 27,
1961, under SUDENE (Superintendency of Northeast Development) legislation,
for the production of palm oil from its cwn extensive plantations - still
underway, for which selected seeds were imported from Africa. CSN took over
the control of this company in April, 1964. The industrial unit is now
operating with raw material from the Company's own trees and from individual
farmers. Palm oil,used in the manufacture of tin plates, previously imported
from the Belgian Congo, is now entirely supplied to the Volta Redonda plant
by OPALMA. Substantial quantities are still sold to soap and margarine pro-
cessing industries and also used for cooking.



ANNEX 2

6.  IROSPERA - Sociedade Carbonifera Prospera S.A.
This is a coal producing company organized in 1924 and is located
in the State of Santa Catarina. CSN bought its control on May 31, 1946.
After many years of operation, the mines CSN explored in Santa Catarina
State, at nearly Sideropolis were added to PROSPERA in 1969. PROSPERA
pays CSN a royalty for the exploration of the mines still held as CSN
property. Besides coking coal, steam coal is also produced and sold to
local power plants.
7.  SOTBCNA - Sociedade Tecnica de Administracao e Corretagem-de Seguros Ltda.
SOTECNA was organized on December 4, 1964 as an insurance broker
and administrator mainly for CSN's insurance problems. The firm grew out of
the Insurance Department CSN had within the accounting and financial area.
In 1970 only 27% of its revenues came from CSN and its subsidiaries, while
in 1965, its first full year of operation, it was 76%.
8. UTE - Servicos de Eletricidade S.A.
This company was organized on August 18, 1968 by converting a
former power producing department CSN maintained in Tubarao, State of Santa
Catarina. The idea is, eventually, to sell the control of the new company
since CSN is no longer interested in producing power, which can now be
easily bought in that area. The power produced by this company is partly
consumed by CSN and the surplus is sold to nearby retail utility companies.
COSIM - Co2panhia Siderurgica de Mogi das Cruzso
COSIM was created by a specific law in 1966 but was incorporated only
on July 28, 1968. Although not considered a subsidiary by CSN, all its voting
capital is owned by CSN, which by law was directed to assume its control. The
government increased CSN's capital in order to provide the necessary funds to
invest in COSIM's capital. COSIM produces steel bars and seamless pipes.

ANNEX 6
DESCRIPTION OF "STAGE II" EXPANSION
The "present" facilities of the CSN plant, described in Annex 1
reflect an assumed "tflat" condition with the Stage I expansion program already
completed and in operation. In actual fact, this is not likely to be the case
until late in 1972. At that time the capacity of the Volta Redonda Works is
foreseen as 1.7 million tons of raw steel per annum. As noted, this represents
the initial step - Stage I - of a long-range expansion program. The next step
- Stage II - that is to bring the CSN capacity to 2.45 million tons (nominal)
of steel per year, is of immediate concern in this analysis.
Overall Concept
The main factors that characterize the overall expansion program of
CSN are the follawing:
(a) increased production of coke from mixtures of imported and
domestic coals in which the latter component is minimized;
(b) expansion of hot-metal production in a large, modern blast
furnace operated at an optimal iron-make and at a minimal
coke rate;
(c) introduction of BOF steel-making with rapid replacement of
current open-hearth production practice;
(d) slab production by continuous casting supplemented by ingot
mold teeming;
(e) expanded use of own iron-ore sources for prepared blast
furnace burdens containing about 75% of sinter and pellets;
and
(f) reduction in the use of national coals in coke oven charges
from approximately 35% to 10%.
The total expansion program is also characterized by a stepwise
development. Stage II is to advance CSN's nominal raw steel capacity to 2.45
million tons annually, and Stage III to 4.0 million.tons. The limit on the
Stage II expansion is the capacity of the "present" rolling mill installations.
Therefore, the attainment of Stage III requires the installation of a complete-
ly new 56", continuous hot strip mill. Supporting departments for both Stages
of the works development are keyed to this restraining feature.
Finally, the ultimate level of development of the Volta Redonda
steel plant on its present site is determined by the maximum accessibility to
roads and rail lines on the one hand and by the boundaries of the Paraiba River
and the adjacent city. The potential capacity has been calculated at 4.525
million tons of rolled products, or about 6.3 million tons of raw steel within
the mentioned constraints.



ANNEX 6

New Installations
The principal new facilities that comprise the Stage II expansion are
described below.
Raw Material Handling and Storage
Coal preparation equipment, with capacity to transfer, blend, grind,
screen and move by belt-conveyor 5,000 tons per day, is to be installed in an
arrangement that will adequately serve a new (No.3) coke oven battery, the
existing batteries (No. 1 and 2) and a future installation (No. 4).
Iron ore and fluxes for blast furnace and sinter plant operations will
obviously be needed in greater quantities - approximately 50% more for Stage II
and an addition of 150% for Stage III. Accordingly, a rotary car dumper will be
installed and the raw material area will be extended to provide storage capacity
for about 30 days of requirements, or more.
Ore fines for sintering, sized ore, dolomite and, later, pellets for the
blast furnace will be unloaded by the rotary car dumper having sufficient capa-
city for the quantity of raw materials needed for the 4,000,000 tons of steel
output in Stage III.
The "present" three rail track and truck hopper will receive all lime-
stone flux, and miscellaneous materials for No. 2 and No. 3 sintering plants.
Ore fines for No. 1 sintering plant will move from the car dumper through the
ore fines bin of a new highline screening station. The ore, ore fines, dolomite
and pellets unloaded by the car dumper will be conveyed to this screening station
located over No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnace highline.
Coarse ore and pellets will be screened before being taken to the stock-
house bins of No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces, or to yard storage by transfer cars.
Dolomite will not be screened. Ore fines and unscreened material will be taken
directly to a new No. 3 blast furnace automatic stockhouse, or to the raw mate-
rials storage yard. Materials, including coke for blast furnace, No. 3 will be
supplied entirely from the automatic stockhouse. The No. 3 blast furnace stock-
house will have screens and bins for coarse ore, sinter, coke, pellets, limestone
or dolomite.
The main belt conveyors will be able to handle all the raw materials
required for the ultimate step of 4,000,000 tons of steel. Two new stackers and
reclaimers will be installed in making a total of three for No. 3 blast furnace,
No. 1, No.2, and No. 3 sintering plants, and the automatic stockhouse.
Coke Ovens and By-Product Plant
A battery of 71 coke ovens (No. 3), assuming units of the same capacity
as the existing ovensl. complete with necessary coal bins, oven machinery, coke
1/  This number may be smaller if 6 meter ovens are installed instead of units
4.5 m high. Inquiries for estimates for the higher ovens have been requested,
and the coke oven specification may still be considered "open."

quenching equipment and wharf, is included in the project. The coal bins for
a future No. 4 battery will be immediately adjoining.
The coal preparation equipment will be of sufficient capacity to
handle 5,000 t/day, sufficient for batteries No. 3 and No. 4.
A primary coke screening station is provided with enough capacity to
handle coke from the future battery No. 4 also. Coke will be delivered to the
blast furnace automatic stockhouse by conveyor belt. Coke crushing and final
screening will be located at that stockhouse.
Coal will be received by rail, stacked by a conveyor stacker and re-
claimed by a bucket feeder. Storage capacity will be sufficient for 45 days
requirements. The car dumper will have enough capacity to handle the total
coal necessary for the 4,000,000 ton Stage III plan. The dumper is equipped
with a weighing type platen so that full and empty car weights may be obtained
at the time a car is emptied.
Equipment will be added for the recovery of coke oven gas and raw tar,
including facilities to increase tar refining capacity.
Blast Furnaces
The Stage II Expansion will require an annual production of 2 ,335.,000
tons of hot metal or approximately 6,670 tons/day. For the ultimate production
of 4,000,000 tons of raw steel, 3,535,000 tons of hot metal or about 10,200
tons/day will be needed. This production will be attained by installing the
third blast furnace with about 6,000 tons/day capacity, and rebuilding the two
existing blast furnaces to produce 2,200 tons/day in No. 1 and 2,520 tons/day in
No. 2 blast furnace.
The revamping of No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces will increase working
volume by reducing the lining thickness, elevating blast temperature to 2,000
degree F, increasing the total heating surfaces of the stoves, and raising wind
and blast pressure by parallel-split blowing of the present No. 1, No. 2, and
No. 3 blowers after suitable modifications on the No. 1 and No. 2 cold blast
mains.
The proposed changes for No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces are as follows:

No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces will operate with a wind rate of
1.8 scfm per cu. ft. of working volume.  Blowers, cold blast mains, stoves,
hot blast mains, bustle pipe, blow pipes and tuyeres will be made adequate for
the wind volumes, pressures and temperatures indicated; plus an operating
margin for operating at abnormal pressures; and for 50 degree F blast tempera-
ture control variation of operating temperature (1950 degree F).
No. 3 Blast Furnace
The new blast furnace No. 3 and one of the smaller furnaces will
produce during the former's first campaign, the tonnage' of hot metal needed for
the increased output of raw steel. No. 1 and No. 2 blast furnaces will thus be
rebuilt, one at a time.
The proposed characteristics for No. 3 blast furnace are:
Iron Production tons/day                          6,000

No. 3 blast furnace requires 34 tuyeres, spaced 441" apart, to keep
within a limit of 1.75 gallons per tuyere per minute, when injecting 50 kg of
oil per ton of iron.
No. 3 furnace will have a double cast-house, 3 tap-holes, 1 slag notch,
with iron runners from each tap-hole to direct the metal into new torpedo ladles
and/or present kling type ladles as required during casting. There will be
eight 250 ton torpedo ladles provided.
A common slag runner which will lead to slag granulation spout and pit
or to two separate slag pits. Provision for granulating slag will be retained
at furnace No. 1 and No. 2.
No. 3 blast furnace will be arranged for loading by conveyor belt from
an automatic stockhouse close to the raw material yard. The stockhouse will have
bin capacity for 20 hours supply of iron bearing materials and fluxes and 8 hours
supply of coke, and will be arranged to provide for screening of all materials
prior to charging, including coke-crushing and screening. High energy type gas
cleaning is to be provided.
Trackage will be arranged with an underpass at the open hearth high
line trackfor direct movement of both types of hot metal ladles to a transfer
and weighing station in the basic oxygen steelmaking shop.



ANNEX 6
Page 5
Sintering Facilities
The existing sinter plants, No. 1 and No. 2, have a total capacity
of 2,310,000 tons/year or 7,000 tons/day of screened sinter. For the "present"
level of production of 1,700,000 tons of ingots, this sinter allows 100% of
sinter in the blast furnace burden. To maintain 100% sinter burden, and reduce
the coke-rate to 460 kg/ton of iron, a total sinter production of 3,960,000
tons/year, or 12,000 tons/day is necessary. The Stage II expansion therefore
includes a third sintering plant, with a rated production of 5,220 tons/day of
screened sinter, or 1,723,000 tons of screened sinter per year. Sintering
machine No. 3 is largely a duplicate of No. 2 sinter plant and was foreseen and
provided for when the present No. 2 sinter plant was designed and built.
The number of coke and limestone or dolomite bins at the existing
No. 2 sintering plant grinding station will be duplicated and additional ones
provided for No. 3. In the coke and limestone grinding station, another con-
veyor will be added, making coke and limestone grinding entirely independent of
each other. The raw material stock bins, unit proportioning system, mixing
drums, hot fine bin and the building will be duplicated.
The new sintering-umit will be installed complete with conveyors,
feeder system, ignition furnace, sinter breaker, exhaust system including motor,
hot sinter screen and cooler. At the sinter crushing and screening station
another crusher, a storage bin and three cold sinter classifying screens will
be added. From this station a new conveyor belt will be installed to transport
sinter to the No. 3 blast furnace automatic stockhouse.
A limestone truck hopper, to supply No. 1 sintering plant with
crushed limestone received by truck from the yard or from the existing three-
rail track and truck hopper will be installed.
Steelmaking Facilities
The "present" open-hearth facilities limit production to a maximum of
1,700,000 tons of ingots/year. In planning the Stage II expansion's additional
steelmaking capacity, three main factors were considered: (a) the plant's
ultimate capacity of 4,000,000 tons of raw steel per year; (b) the intention to
phase-out the open-hearth unit for economic advantages offered by BOF steel-
making; and (c) the possibilities offered by the continuous casting process to
operate at a higher yield. In addition to these factors, the BOF heat size of
the 2-vessel installation of Stage II, must be adequate so that the addition of
one more vessel of the same capacity will give the ultimate production goal of
4,Oo0,000 tons of raw steel from the BOF steel plant alone. Open-hearth pro-
duction will be decreased progressively with increasing production of BOF steel.
The phasing-out of the open-hearth shop will be scheduled for two years after
the start-up of the BOF shop in Stage II. The vessel capacity that will fit
these conditions has been calculated to be 200 tons.
The new basic oxygen steelmaking shop will therefore have two
200 ton furnaces, operating one at a time in normal sequence, with provision
for a future third vessel of the same capacity.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
Molten iron will be delivered to the BOF shop by submarine ladles,
into an iron transfer ladle that will be on a self-propelled transfer car in a
pit. The iron ladle capacity will be sized so that only one ladle of molten
iron will be required per charge, over the BOF furnaces and in the furnace aisle,
an adequate number of storage bins and a material conveying system will be pro-
vided. The capacity of the storage bins will be designed for a 24-hour supply
of spar, burnt lime, fine ore, and other addition.  A weighing, batching and
dispensing system of the late design will be provided.
The hoods for the collection of the wast gases from the BOF furnaces
will be water cooled. A waste gas fan will provide sufficient air into the hood
to maintain full combustion of all CO to C02. The waste gases will pass through
a cooling chamber and then through a high energy Venturi Scrubber for gas
cleaning. The waste gas cleaning capability will be designed to meet expected
air pollution standards. The waste solids will be collected in a thickener.
An adequate complement of ladle cranes, steel ladles and slag pots
will be provided. Slag pots will be dumped at the end of the charging aisle,
and the slag transported to a disposal area by trucks.
A ladle service aisle will be of conventional design containing ladle
servicing and relining facilities, stopper-making equipment and pouring plat-
forms. The shop will be arranged for either 100% ingot - teeming or for a
combination of ingot - teeming and continuous slab casting, with modifications
as needed.
The BOF shop's effective annual capacity of 2,530,000 tons of liquid
steel production includes 950,000 tons that will be cast continuously into
slabs, and the remaining tonnage of liquid steel will be cast as ingots. A
complete 2-strand continuous casting machine and auxiliaries will be installed
in a separate building adjacent to the BOF pit side. Provision of space for a
future second two-strand machine will be designed into the initial installation.
The ingots cast from the BOF shop output (1,500,000 tons) will be
stripped and rolled at the "present" stripper and blooming mill facilities.
The present mold yard will handle all mold servicing. Provision is
also to be made for a new mold yard and for a mold cooling area and stripper
for the future 4,000,000 ton capacity (if a second 2 strand continuous casting
machine should not be added). In that case approximately 2,500,000 tons will
have to be cast into ingots, that will be rolled on a new slabbing mill, for
which space will also be provided.
Oxygen Producing Facilities
'Present" oxygen installed capacity equals 320 tons/day.  This is
enough to supply the 9 open hearth furnaces with oxygen lancing through the
roof, and all other plant requirements for scrap cutting, scarfing, open
hearth and blast furnace tapping, and for the foundry, boiler shop, fabricating



ANiEX 6
Page 7
shop and other needs, at the "present" level of 1,700,000 tons of ingots/year.
For Stage II another oxygen unit of 600 tons/day will be installed, raising the
total capacity to 920 tons/day. Of this the BOF shop will need approximately
650 tons/day for a 2/1 vessel operation.
Continuous Caster
The design of the continuous casting facility includes a vertical,
straight-sided mold; an electrically driven cam-operated oscillator; a
short, vertical roller apron with edge supports; reaction-type slab bending
rolls; a curved roller apron with drives; a straightener and a horizontal
roller apron with drives. Also included is a secondary spray cooling
system which extends from the underside of the mold to the discharge end
of a horizontal guide rack, and a mold liquid level control system.
The slab casting machine will be a 2-strand unit. The cast slab
will have a maximum width of 1,260 mm, thickness of 150 mm and a length of
18.3 meters. The curved guide rack radius will equal 6.3 meters. Casting
speed will range from 2.0 to 2.5 meters per minute.
The unit will be provided with two welded steel ladle positioning
cars, to provide for continuous casting. The cars will be provided with
D.C. motor drives, and operated either from the ladle car operating plat-
form or from a position on the operating pulpit.
The machine will accommodate ladles of 200 tons capacity, pouring
into a 30 ton tundish. Tundishes will be rectangular with sloped bottom
and an overflow lip. Self-propelled tundish positioning cars will be pro-
vided also.
Plate and Hot Strip Mill
The modifications made at the plate mill and hot strip mill
in the Stage I expansion, will be extended to add the following new
units: (a) vertical edger approach table with adjustable sideguard;
(b) vertical edger scalebreaker mill; (c) new mill table, with adjustable
sideguards, between the new edger mill and the first horizontal roughing
mill stand; (d) a 36 inch x 68 inch 2-high roughing mill, replacing the
present 28 inch x 56 inch 2-high scalebreaker; (e) a front mill table
ahead of the present reversing roughing mill (R-3); and (f) a rear mill
table and new X-ray gauge after mill R-3.
Hot Coil Preparation Line
The "present" hot coil preparation line will receive additional
equiment such as a flash-type butt welder and a draw-cut type flash trimmer
to convert this preparation line into a coil build-up line.



ANNEX 6
Page 
Tinning Facilities
The present tinplate producing facilities, consisting of the existing
hot dip tinning equipment, two existing electrolytic tinning lines and the two
additional electrolytic lines, will have an effective total capacity of 550,000
tons of tinplate per year plus 30,000 tons of terne plate.
The additional facilities will include one continuous cleaning and
annealing line, two electrolytic tinning lines with coil preparation units and
the necessary shearing, assorting and shipping facilities. In addition to these
new lines, there will be an alteration to existing tinning line No. 2.
The continuous electrolytic cleaning and annealing line for tinplate
processes strip in thicknesses of 0.006" to 0.015" and in widths of 22" to 38".
The lines are capable of operating at speeds up to 1,875 feet per minute, depend-
ing on gauge. Gas generators produce reducing atmospheres in the annealing and
cooling sections.
The two additional electrolytic tinning installations will have coil
preparation lines to side-trim the strip and remove heavy ends. Each coil pre-
paration line includes a mandrel type uncoiler with pinch rolls, shears, a welder,
a side-trimmer and recoiler, and means for separately coiling the heavy strip ends
removed from the prime product. Lines operate under strip tension at speeds up
to 4,000 feet per minute. Each line has an electrolytic cleaning section, an
electroplating section, a flow brightener, a chemical treatment tank, an electro-
static oiler and space for future addition of an emulsion oiler. Delivery end
equipment includes a strip shearing section, with flying shear, a pinhole detec-
tor, a magnetic gauging device and a product classifier.
Roll Shops
A total of three new roll grinders, added to present equipment will
enable the No. 1 and No. 2 roll shops to handle all the needs for flat roll con-
ditioning of the Stage II expansion.
Maintenance Shops and Foundry
The boiler shop will be moved to allow space for enlargement of the
machine shop. The electrical repair shop will be enlarged and will replace the
present axle and wheel repair shop that will be relocated. New modern machinery
will be installed in various shops, replacing old units.
Two drying ovens, additional and system facilities, and a 30-ton elec-
tric arc top charge melting furnace will be installed in the foundry.
Rolling Stock and Vehicles
Additional rolling stock for internal plant traffic will include ten
600 HP diesel-electric locomotives, a rail-mounted diesel crane, and 96 cars for
special purpose.



ANNEX 6
Page 9
Automotive vehicles to be purchased include a total of 52 trucks, trac-
tors, trailers and jeeps.
Off-the-road vehicles include a total of 16 cranes, bulldozers and pay-
loaders of various sizes.
Flat products material handling ecuipment comprise one 1200-lb fork-
lift tractor and two 50,000-lb ram tractors.
Steam Generation
High Pressure Steam Generation: Three 1,000 psi boilers of 250,000 lb
each and 7500F will be provided to operate in parallel with the existing steam
network. The new boilers will be designed with all required auxiliaries, includ-
ing steam puwps, air pre-heater, combustion control, instruments, deaerating
equipment and improvement of the existing installation of water treatment for
boilers.
Low Pressure Steam Generation: The low pressure installation at the
rolling mill will be conpleted with the addition of a third automatic boiler,
out-door, oil type, rated 30 ton/h, at 165 psig and 450°F and improvement of the
corresponding water treatment station being installed.
Improvement of the steam distribution system will be provided to meet
the consumption requirements.
Turbo-Blowers: One turbo-blower, rated at 250,000 inlet cfm and 45
psig discharge pressure, will be provided in a separate building, for use with
the new No. 3 blast furnace.
Additions to the Electrical System
These facilities include new 60-cycle equipment at several substations
around the steel works; new 13.8 KV switchgear groups for the underground distri-
bution system to the plant buildings; substation interconnections through towered
aerial 132 KV lines, crossing over the present rolling mill building and the new
No. 2 hot strip mill; and some 21 unit substations for the low tension service
and lighting circuits.
Water, Air and Sewer Systems
Water Distribution System: Recirculated discharge water from the conden-
sers will be used preferentially and repumped into the plant service water system.
If the performance of the "present" 70-ton oxygen plant cooling tower proves to
be satisfactory, adequate towers will be used for water cooling purposes. The
existing water clarifying facility is stated to be sufficient to meet the expanded
plant demand.
Compressed Air System: Two new 4,000 cfm rotary coupressors will be
installed at the rolling mill area, freeing smaller existing smaller 800 cfm com-
pressors for service in low consuwption areas, such as the foundry and shops
that require additional supply.



ANNEX 6
Page 10
Sewers: A new sewer line will be laid south of the plant as storm
sewer and as clean service water sewer. It will discharge into the Brandao
river that runs east of the plant towards the Paraiba river. All polluted
industrial water to be discarded into the sewer will first be treated. The
capacity of the presently projected acid sewer treating station will be in-
creased to meet the requirements of the full expansion program.
Railroads and Highways
A railroad track will be built, south of the plant, linking the west
yard to the east yard and reducing the existing heavy traffic on the central
line. The present west section of the Central railroad will be relocated to
make available an additional area to the hot strip mill.
The main north-south road will be elevated, easing yard level traffic
to the stripper building and the BOF building.
Construction Schedule
The origin of the Stage II expansion obviously lies in a much larger
program. Studies of engineering alternatives go back many years. The overall
conception placed the start of Stage II in the second half of 1971 with conple-
tion anticipated mostly by the end of 1975. A sophisticated PERT program has
been draun up to control and maintain these objectives.
Production Goals
The anticipated tonnage and product outputs, keyed to the above con-
struction schedule, have been defined by CSN, as follows:
Forecast Annual Production: 1973 and 1977

million tons of liquid steel production, with continuous casting.



ANNEX 6

Utilization of Plant Units and Yields
The proposed facility installations are foreseen as operating by 1977
at high levels of utilization - over 85% - in most cases. The exceptions are
the blast furnaces (around 80%), the oxrgen facilities (about 90%), the slab
caster (77%) and the hot-dip galvanizing units (52%).
The generally high utilization expectations indicate a well-balanced
concept,    but provide limited leeway for unforeseen operating emergencies.
The assumed yields may also be optimistic.

ANNEX 7
ECOloGy
In specifying the new facilities to be installed in Stage II,
the Company proceeded on the premise that air and water pollution control
should be in line with U.S. standards. It is estimated that the cost of
the pollution control equipment is of the order of US$10 million.
Water Management
All water used in the plant is drawn from the Paraiba River.
After performing its intended function, the water is given a primary clean-
ing in the vicinity of the facility and reused where possible. All polluted
industrial water will be treated prior to discharge.
The coke oven and by-product plant will use about 63,000 cubic
meters of cooling water. Tar separation, naphthalene scrubber and ammonia
removal facilities (Phosan process) will be installed and the waste water
will be passed through a biological treatment plant.
The no. 3 blast furnace will be equipped with a dist catcher, high
energy scrubbers and water separator. The gas cleaning system at the BOF
shop will remove about 3 to 6 tons of suspended solids per furnace heat, and
the continuous casting facility will be a heavy user of cooling water. After
clarifying in thickeners, the process water will be cooled in cooling towers
before being recirculated.
The capacity of the acid treatment plant will be expanded to
handle the increased volume of pickle line waste liquor.
Air Management
The high-energy wet scrabbers at the blast furnace will be designed
to remove about 3,000 tons per month of particulate matter from a maximwfm of



ANNEX 7
Page 2
400,O00 cfm of blast furnace gas. The most costly piece of equipment is
the high-energy scrubber at the BOF shop. This unit w-ill collect about
1,800 tons of dust each month.

ANNEX 12
RAW MATERIAI S
The requirements at the completion of Stage II of nearly 1.75 million
tons of coal will be more difficult to meet than the 3.1 million tons of iron
ore, and the approximately 900,000 tons of limestone (including lime) needed.
Some 660,000 tons of scrap will be recirculated material.
Coal Sources and Supply - CSN expects to reduce its use of national
coal from the present level of about 30% to 20% by 1977. Its own resources in
Santa Catarina coal are expected to provide 350,000 tons by 1977 for mixing
with 1.4 million tons of imported high and low volatile coals, mostly from the
U.S. The companyts own reserves of coking coals are estimated in excess of
300 million tons, and a major development program has been undertaken to meet
the expansion program requirements.
The Brazilian coking coals of Santa Catarina are generally poor and
transport distances considerable between mine and Volta Redonda. Foreign
sources are therefore extromely important. CSN has apparently fortified its
position in this respect by negotiating a 10-year contract recently with a major
U.*. supplier.
Iron Ore Sources and bupply - The company's mine at Casa de Pedra,
420 km from the plant in Minas Gerais on an established rail line, has econom-
ically. minable reserves of some 200 million tons. Typically, the ores are high
(over 60%) in iron content and low in sulfur, phosphorus and other impurities.
The mining operations at Casa de Pedra generate large amounts of fines.
Part of these are shipped to the plant for intering, but a considerable portion,
under 150 mesh, is stockpiled, or settled out in slime beds. Thus, less than
50% of the ores mined and beneficiated are shipped to Volta Redonda. This tends
to raise the cost of the ores used, but has provided a large store of ore that
may ultimately be used for pellets,
1/ Raw material prioes assumed for financial and economic rate of return
calculations are shown in Annex 180



ANNEX 12
Page 2
CSN anticipates no deficiency of ore from its own mine until 1975.
An extensive improvement and expansion program is contemplated, some as part
of stage II, to increase annual mine capacity to 4.5 million tons of processed
ore, and to ship at least 8,000 tons a day. Based on 350 days a year, the
latter figure falls somemhat short of the total of 3.1 million tons of ore
requirements indicated in the raw material flow diagram (Annex 23). This
deficiency can readily be corrected.
WImestone and dolomi-te will in large part be purchased from independent
suppliers in Minas Gerais. There are a number of suitable sources available
to CuN when their present supply quarries become exhausted in the next year or
two,
Trsport - The rail SyStem serving Volta Redonda is generally adequate
to carry the increased tonnages of raw materials that will be needed for
stage II, Additional rolling stock will be needed and some of this is included
in the itage II expansion project. Increased handling and storage facilities
for the larger anounts of materials to be aocommodated at the plant have
already been mentioned,
scra  - As noted., scrap requirements at CSN are likely to be met from
internal prooess generation. For a combined flat-product and non-flat product
operation., such circulating scrap may run from 22.5% to 27e5%. The indicated
need of about 670,000 tons a year equals approximately 27% of the plant's steel
output, Thus, there may be occasional periods when outside scrap may have to
be purchased - up to 100,000 tons a year, although half this amount is more
likely.

NOTES:
The prices used for the economic return calculations are based on European
export prices that prevailed in February-August 1971 for the various products. These
prices have been analyzed in the context of historical trends, and on average are
expected to reflect representative prices over the long-term period relevant for evalua-
tion of this project. In fact, if Brazil had to import 3.5 million TPY of steel product
in the context of the existing volume in world trade (under 50 million TFY) there would
probably be some upward pressure on prices of several products.
The cost of transport from main European ports to Sao Paulo, the principal
market for steel, has been calculated on the basis of actual costs incurred in recent
years on imports of upto 300,000 TPY, with benefit of special contract rates for bulk
shipments. While it is possible that much larger shipments could be moved at somewhat
less cost, there is also the likelihood of higher costs on account of port congestion
and the need for additional handling facilities, etc.
Altogether, the import prices (CIF) assumed for the calculations appear to
be a fair average of costs that would have to be incurred for imports during the period
of time under consideration.
For exports, the economic return calculation assumes February 1971 Brazilian
prices (FOB Brazilian ports). These are gnerally lower than the prices actually
obtained for Brazilian steel exports in the recent past.
1/ Excluding price escalation.
