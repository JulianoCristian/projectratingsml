                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project remains on track towards achieving its PDO, which is to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted areas by improving farmers access to critical
                         agricultural inputs.

                         In 2011/12, subsidy vouchers were distributed to approximately 1,600,000 farming households. Voucher redemption is still underway, however, the mission estimates that 85% of
                         these vouchers will be successfully redeemed, benefiting approximately 5.4 million farm residents. The lower than anticipated rate of voucher redemption resulted because vouchers
                         were delivered late in many areas. The government sought to resolve this constraint by distributing Certificates of Confirmation of Receiving Subsidized Inputs, but these were not

                         universally accepted. The 2011/12 season production statistics are not yet available. However, rains have been more favorable in most of the country, suggesting a likely gain in
                         maize production of approximately 640,000 t of additional grain.

                         During the three years of the project, the more than 3 million households will have received over 15 million subsidy vouchers redeemable for improved seed and fertilizer. Based on
Public Disclosure Copy




                         the initial project impact assessment, the average gain in maize yields per recipient is 480 kg of grain. This suggests the three year investment has raised national maize harvests by
                         more than 1.5 million t. Correspondingly the country has achieved self-sufficiency in maize production, and even exported more than 120,000 mt of grain following the 2010/11
                         season drought.

                         Gains in rice production have been much more limited - about one-half the level of yield gains compared with maize. However, rice producers only received about 4% of the total
                         value of vouchers distributed.

                         Preliminary data suggest that the targets for most intermediate outcome indicators for the third year of the project have been met. This can be confirmed when the final production
                         estimates are available in September.

                         Overall, farmer access to agricultural inputs, national maize production and food security have undoubtedly improved. Correspondingly, the progress towards achieving the PDO is
                         rated as satisfactory.
