                         agricultural inputs.

                         Since the project started, over 2.5 million farmers have received and redeemed seed and fertilizer subsidy vouchers contributing an additional 2.5 million tons of maize and 73,000
                         tons of paddy to the economy. In 2012/13, the NAIVS distributed about 126,000 tons of fertilizer and 9,500 tons of improved seed to over 894,000 households. IDA funding supported
                         a subset of these household - about 300,000 beneficiaries - in 7 regions.

                         In 2012/13, roughly 88 percent of the vouchers were targeted to maize farmers. Yield gain estimates derived from independent impact surveys suggest beneficiaries are achieving an
                         additional 433 kg per acre (1.07 t per hectare). Correspondingly, the subsidy package supported an additional production of about 340,000 tons of maize grain. The impact surveys
                         also provide evidence of continuing commercial purchases of improved seed and fertilizer among households graduating from the program. The survey indicated that 57 percent of
                         program graduates continued to purchase improved seed, and 37 percent continue to purchase chemical fertilizer.

                         The gains derived from the paddy subsidy are less attractive than those obtained under maize. Average paddy yields increased by about 264 kg per acre in the fields where the
                         subsidized inputs were applied. These gains contributed an additional 28,000 tons of paddy to the national economy in 2012/13.

                         All input subsidy vouchers are redeemed through private input suppliers. In past years, these agro-dealers have been selected by district and village officials. At the beginning of the
                         2012/13 cropping season, agro-dealers were instead being selected by larger seed and fertilizer suppliers. This has helped strengthen national supply chains for these critical inputs.
                         However, this change has reduced the number of agro-dealers participating in the program.

                         Overall, farmer access to agricultural inputs, national maize production and food security have improved. Correspondingly, the progress towards achieving the PDO is rated as
                         satisfactory.

                         Continuing investments will be required to further strengthen retail trade in agricultural inputs, and to assure a continuing flow of a wider range of new technologies to smallholder
                         farmers. In addition, many farmers need stronger guidance on how to improve their fertilizer use efficiency - - particularly in paddy systems. Improvements in product markets can
                         also raise grain prices at the farmgate, increasing incentives to continue investing in these modern inputs. The Government of Tanzania has expressed interest in continuing IDA
                         support in order to address these challenges.
