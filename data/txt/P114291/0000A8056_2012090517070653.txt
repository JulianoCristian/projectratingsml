                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project remains on track towards achieving its PDO, which is to contribute to higher food production and productivity intargeted areas by improving farmers access to critical
                         agricultural inputs.

                         In 2011/12, subsidy vouchers were distributed toapproximately 1,600,000 farming households. Voucher redemption is still underway, however, the mission estimates that 85% of
                         thesevouchers will be successfully redeemed, benefiting approximately 5.4 million farm residents. The lower than anticipated rate ofvoucher redemption resulted because vouchers
                         were delivered late in many areas. The government sought to resolve this constraint bydistributing Certificates of Confirmation of Receiving Subsidized Inputs, but these were not

                         universally accepted. The 2011/12season production statistics are not yet available. However, rains have been more favorable in most of the country, suggesting alikely gain in maize
                         production of approximately 640,000 t of additional grain.

                         During the three years of the project, the morethan 2.5 million households will have received over 15 million subsidy vouchers redeemable for improved seed and fertilizer. Basedon

                         the initial project impact assessment, the average gain in maize yields per recipient is 480 kg of grain. This suggests thethree year investment has raised national maize harvests by
                         more than 1.5 million t. Correspondingly the country has achievedself-sufficiency in maize production, and even exported more than 120,000 mt of grain following the 2010/11
                         season drought.

                         Gainsin rice production have been much more limited - about one-half the level of yield gains compared with maize. However, riceproducers only received about 4% of the total value
                         of vouchers distributed.

                         Preliminary data suggest that the targets for mostintermediate outcome indicators for the third year of the project have been met. This can be confirmed when the final
                         productionestimates are available in September.

                         Overall, farmer access to agricultural inputs, national maize production and foodsecurity have undoubtedly improved. Correspondingly, the progress towards achieving the PDO is
                         rated as satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government of Tanzania has requested an extension of the project for one year to allow the completion of procurement activities relating to strengthening seed systems and
                         agricultural input markets. This extension request was accepted. The project is now scheduled to close on June 30 2013. The Government has also requested $30 million in
                         additional financing to scale-up its subsidy commitments in the 2012/13 cropping season from about 640,000 households to about 940,000 households. This request is currently
                         under consideration.
