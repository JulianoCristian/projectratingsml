Project\n            for Tanzania contributed to higher food production and\n            productivity in targeted areas by improving farmers'\n            access to critical agricultural inputs. The outcome of the\n            project was rated moderately satisfactory with the Bank\n            performing moderately satisfactory and the Borrower\n            performing moderately unsatisfactory. The overall risk to\n            development was rated substantial. The project had several\n            monitering and evaluation shortcomings. Therefore, data\n            quality is poor. Although only one indicator (maize yield\n            achieved by farmers with subsidized seed and fertilizer) out\n            of the six project developmetn objective level indicators\n            was fully achieved, the project made significant progress on\n            most of its targets. Four key lessons were learned from the\n            implementation of this project. Firstly, successful\n            implementation of emergency operations significantly\n            benefits from careful advance planning, especially\n            procurement. Secondly, mainstreaming projects in line\n            ministries works best when complemented by pragmatic\n            solutions to implementation issues as they arise. Thirdly,\n            agricultural input voucher programs can significantly\n            increase productivity, but remain difficult to administer.\n            Lastly, a final lesson learned is that inclusion of major\n            civil works (e.g., the irrigation infrastructure) without\n            expedited procurement arrangements, while well meaning, may\n            not be best suited for these type of emergency operations.\n            Such longer gestation investments could divert focus and\n            contribute to implementation delays."}, "docdt": "2014-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
