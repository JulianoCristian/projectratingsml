                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project remains on track towards achieving its PDO, which is to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted areas by improving farmers access to critical
                         agricultural inputs.

                         The input subsidy program contributed an estimated 800,000 tons of additional grain to national food supplies in 2012, and helped Tanzania maintain a position of self-sufficiency in
                         maize production. Average maize yields of voucher recipients are estimated to have increased by approximately 1.2 tons per hectare. Average paddy yields of voucher recipients are
                         estimated to have increased by about 600 kilograms per hectare. Preliminary data suggest that the targets for most intermediate outcome indicators for the third year of the project

                         have been met.

                         In 2012/13, subsidy vouchers were distributed to approximately 940,000 farming households. Approximately 640,000 farm households received seed and fertilizer vouchers in
                         unimodal rainfall areas, and most of these have now been redeemed by farmers. IDA provided this project with US$25 million of additional financing to allow an additional 300,000

                         vouchers to be distributed in bimodal regions with planting rains expected in March 2013. At the time of the latest Implementation Support Mission (ISM) in January, none of the
                         vouchers had yet been encashed by input suppliers. The redemption and encashment process is expected to be completed by June 2013.

                         This program is organized to allow farmers to receive seed and fertilizer vouchers for three consecutive years. This allows farmers to learn to use improved seed and fertilizer, and
                         generate enough cash to continue this investment. In 2012/13, the number of households receiving vouchers has declined by 50 percent compared to the 2001/12 season.
                         Approximately 1.5 million farmers have now graduated from the program. The ISM found evidence that 15 to 60% of graduates are purchasing seed and fertilizer on commercial
                         markets depending on their location. This assessment requires further verification in independent surveys. However, the mission notes good evidence that farmers now better
                         understand the value of these inputs, and are more likely to invest their own resources in improved seed and fertilizer.

                         All input subsidy vouchers are redeemed through private input suppliers. In past years, these agro-dealers have been selected by district and village officials. This 2012/13 cropping
                         season, the agro-dealers are instead being selected by larger seed and fertilizer suppliers. This has helped strengthen national supply chains for these critical inputs. However, this
                         change has reduced the number of agro-dealers participating in the program.

                         Overall, farmer access to agricultural inputs, national maize production and food security have undoubtedly improved. Correspondingly, the progress towards achieving the PDO is
                         rated as satisfactory.

                         Continuing investments will be required to further strengthen retail trade in agricultural inputs, and to assure a continuing flow of a wider range of new technologies to smallholder
                         farmers. This includes the need to further strengthen research-extension-farmer linkages. The Government of Tanzania has expressed interest in continuing IDA support in order to
                         address these challenges.
