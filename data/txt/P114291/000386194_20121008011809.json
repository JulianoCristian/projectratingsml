objective of the\n            Accelerated Food Security Project for Tanzania is to\n            contribute to higher food production and productivity in\n            targeted areas by improving farmers' access to critical\n            agricultural inputs. This project paper seeks the approval\n            of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit\n            in an amount of SDR16.5 million (US$25 million equivalent)\n            to the project. This will be the project's first\n            Additional Financing (AF). The AF will support the scale up\n            of an agricultural input subsidy which has successfully\n            contributed to the expansion of maize and rice production in\n            the country, the improvement of national food security, and\n            the withdrawal of an export ban on grains trade.\n            Specifically, the AF will finance a 30 percent increase in\n            the number of farmers receiving input subsidies during the\n            2012/13 cropping season. This expansion in program coverage\n            is critically important in the context of high international\n            fertilizer prices, and rising international grain prices.\n            The funding will help Tanzania maintain self-sufficiency on\n            grain production. The Government of the United Republic of\n            Tanzania (GoT) has requested continuing International\n            Development Association (IDA) support for its input subsidy\n            program. This was anticipated in the Tanzania Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS), with the expectation that the\n            commitment would be defined within the next phase of the\n            Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP). However, the\n            development of this commitment has been postponed to allow\n            for a more strategic review of sectoral coordination and\n            performance. The new ASDP funding is now only expected to be\n            available in late 2013. The AF will support the maintenance\n            of the subsidy program during the 2012/13 gap year."}, "docdt": "2012-10-02T00:00:00Z"}
