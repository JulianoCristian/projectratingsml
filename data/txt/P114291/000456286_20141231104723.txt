F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project was to contribute to higher food production and productivity in
targeted areas by improving farmers’ access to critical agricultural inputs.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

 The PDO was not revised. The PDO level indicators were revised as follows:


                                                    vi
               Additional maize production derived from improved seed and fertilizer;
               Additional paddy production derived from improved seed and fertilizer;
               Maize yields achieved by farmers with subsidized seed and fertilizer; and
               Paddy yields achieved by farmers with subsidized seed and fertilizer.


(a) PDO Indicator(s)

General Comment: Targets in the original PAD and the Additional Financing of October 2, 2012 were set
on an annual basis. For the purposes of this ICR, cumulative data has been derived as appropriate in
order to suite the reporting format.

                                                 Original Target                           Actual Value

Comments
                 Cumulative data for both targets and actual values have been used for this ICR to fit in
                 the ICR format. Further note that this relates to data for Year 2 –Year 5 as there was no
                 data collected in Year 1 due to a poor M&E system.
Indicator 2 :    Additional rice production derived from improved seed and fertilizer (mt)
Value                          0                       86,800                                  82,800

                 season as the yield data for the 2013/2014 crop season was not available for the ICR.

                   The target was 2.5 million beneficiaries. The Results Matrix of the original credit,
                   which is restated in the Project Paper for the Additional Financing (Report NO. 71677-
                   TZ dated October 2, 2012) only provides the annual number of voucher recipients.
                   Since some beneficiaries were graduating as others were joining, it’s difficult to deduce
Comments           from voucher recipients how many new individual beneficiaries and how many are old
                   beneficiaries. About 6,845,000 vouchers were distributed over five years. Assuming
                   each beneficiary received a voucher for three years as stipulated in the program, then
                   2.3 million households benefited from the scheme. However, this is just an assumption
                   as household graduation after three years was not systematically enforced. And some
                   households might not have received their third voucher by project’s end.

1. Project Context, Development Objective, and Design

1.1 Context at appraisal

1.       At appraisal, Tanzania, like many other countries, was still managing the effects of the
2007/2008 Global Food Crisis during which the world experienced an unexpected spike in key
food prices. For instance, by mid-2008, the international prices of maize, rice and wheat were up
by 70 percent, 180 percent, and 120 percent respectively, compared to mid-2007 prices. During
the same period, World fertilizer prices had also spiked substantially (as a result of high oil
prices) and there were concerns that the high fertilizer prices would further constrain food
supply. Many countries resorted to subsidies as a mechanism to offset these shocks. On its part,
the Government of Tanzania (GoT) had responded to the rising input costs and food prices by
piloting a National Agricultural Inputs Voucher Scheme (NAIVS) to enable farmers to access
agricultural inputs for the 2007/2008 cropping season to boost agricultural production. The
failure of the 2008/09 short rains in northern Tanzania – which normally account for about 20
percent of national food production – added to the concerns about a potentially serious food
crisis, and galvanized the country’s resolve to scale up the pilot program in 2009/2010.
2.      However, time was of the essence as input vouchers and inputs themselves had to reach
farmers in time for the August/September 2009 planting season, which accounts for about 80
percent of the nation’s agricultural output. GoT, whose own budgetary resources had been
strained by the economic contraction in the wake of the global financial crisis, needed urgent
external support to successfully implement this scheme. It is in this context that it had
approached the World Bank for emergency assistance.
3.      On its part, the World Bank had responded to the 2007/2008 global food price crisis by
setting up a Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), which consisted of fast-track
funding from its IDA resources and from trust funds, to help clients address the immediate food
crisis, while promoting agricultural policies and investments for increasing resilience in the long
term. It is against this backdrop that the World Bank accepted GoT’s funding request and
approved a support package in June 2009 under “OP/BP 8.00 – Rapid Response to Crises and
Emergencies”. The funding package consisted of US$30 million additional financing for the
Tanzania Social Action Fund Project to strengthen social protection to the vulnerable, US$30
million additional financing to the Agricultural Sector Development Project to strengthen the
long term fundamentals of agricultural growth, and US$160 million for a new Accelerated Food
Security Project, which is the subject of this ICR, to stimulate a rapid food supply response by
scaling up the NAIVS in view of the continuing food crisis threat.

     1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.     The PDO was to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted areas
by improving farmers’ access to critical agricultural inputs.
5.      The following key performance indicators were selected at appraisal:
              Maize production in targeted regions (tons).
              Rice production in targeted regions (tons).
              Average maize yields in targeted regions (tons/ha).

                                                1
                   Average rice yields in targeted regions (tons/ha).

      1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
          reasons/justification

6.      The PDO was not revised, but associated Key Indicators were. The original PDO
indicators measured production and yield gains for maize and rice among targeted regions.
However, since not everyone in targeted regions was participating in the voucher program, these
indicators were an inappropriate reflection of the input subsidy outcomes. The PDO indicators
were, instead, modified during the Additional Financing in October 2012 to circumscribe them to
outcomes more directly related to subsidized input usage (with 2008/2009 as a baseline year, and
2013 as end date). Furthermore, a beneficiary target, including the number of females, was also
added. The new PDO indicators were:
                   Additional maize produced with subsidized seed and fertilizer;
                   Additional paddy produced with subsidized seed and fertilizer;
                   Maize yields achieved by farmers with subsidized seed and fertilizer;
                   Paddy yields achieved by farmers with subsidized seed and fertilizer;
                   Project beneficiaries (number) of whom female beneficiaries

      1.4 Main beneficiaries

7.     The project target beneficiaries were 2.5 million rural smallholder farmer households
who cultivated less than one hectare of land for maize and rice in 65 districts. These districts
were identified as those most suited for producing the two crops. They were concentrated
mainly in the southern highlands, northern highlands, and western region, which account for
about 70 percent of total maize production and 50 percent of total paddy production in the
country2. In addition, key government institutions such as the Agriculture Seed Agency (ASA),
the Tanzania Official Seed Certification Institute (TOSCI), and some private sector institutions
and agro-dealers were among the target beneficiaries of the project.

      1.5 Original components

8.       Component 1 – Improving access to agricultural inputs. This included: (a) providing
paper vouchers to eligible smallholder farmers in targeted areas, to enable them to purchase
improved seed and fertilizers at a subsidized price from certified agro-input dealers who would
in turn redeem the vouchers at the local branch of the partner bank (National Microfinance
Bank); and (b) carrying out an awareness campaign related to the voucher program, including
training the Village Voucher Committees that would facilitate in the scheme’s implementation.
Under the scheme, the value of the voucher was pre-set at printing to cover 50 percent of the
estimated cost of the agricultural input, with the beneficiary responsible for toping up the
difference between the voucher and the actual price at the time of purchase (which may be more
or less than 50 percent depending upon the actual price at the time of purchase).



2
    The Government eventually expanded the program to more than 120 districts across 23 regions of the country.

                                                          2
9.       Component 2 – Strengthening the input supply chain. This included: (a) expanding
and training a network of agro-input dealers; and (b) strengthening the national seed systems by
– (i) updating the policy and regulatory framework to stimulate a vibrant private seed industry;
(ii) stimulating business-oriented, farmer-based seed production and marketing units across the
country; (iii) providing irrigation and other equipment to three agricultural research institutes for
producing pre-basic seed, and to ASA for producing quality basic seed; (iv) providing equipment
to TOSCI to improve its certification capability.
10.    Component 3 – Project management and monitoring and impact evaluation. This
included: (a) capacity building for the National Voucher Steering Committee and the
Agricultural Inputs Section of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security, and Cooperatives in
charge of project management; and (b) funding for project monitoring and evaluation, including
impact assessments.

      1.6 Revised components

11.      The components were not revised.

      1.7 Other significant changes

12.     Extension of project closing date (June 30, 2012 – June 30, 2014): The closing date of
the original credit was extended on three occasions. The first extension, from June 30, 2012 to
June 30, 2013, was to allow for the completion of: (i) the redemption of outstanding subsidy
vouchers; (ii) outstanding procurement contracts; (iii) the performance audit; and (iv) the
preparation of a pilot for an electronic voucher system. The second extension, from June 30,
2013 to December 31, 2013, was intended to bring the timing of the original credit in line with
the additional financing (discussed below). The third extension, from December 31, 2013 to June
30, 2014, was to complete the purchase and installation of irrigation infrastructure at two ASA
seed farms in Morogoro and Arusha regions.
Changes to subsidy modalities and overall project financing. During the first two years of the
project, IDA financed 50 percent of the subsidy costs, and GoT financed the remaining 50
percent. However, national budget constraints caused long delays in the release of government
funds and IDA increased its share to 83 percent, against 17 percent for GoT for the 2010/11
cropping season. This was covered through reallocations from internal project savings. In
addition, an additional financing of US$25 million equivalent was approved by the Bank in
October 2012 to finance one additional round of input subsidies for maize and rice farmers who
had yet received support for 3 consecutive years. According to MAFC records, an estimated 1.5
million households had received the mandated three consecutive years of subsidy support, and
over one million had received assistance for only one or two years but not the mandated three.
Government resources were expected to support 640,000 of these households and the Additional
Financing would support 300,000 farmers during the 2012/13 cropping season in seven regions.
The Bank would cover 100 percent of the subsidy value for these farmers, whereas Government
would finance 100 percent of the subsidy costs in the rest of the regions. By then, Government




                                                 3
had decided to expand the program nationally3, with the Bank and GoT covering separate
regions4.
    2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

    2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation

13.     Soundness of Background Analysis. The project was prepared under “OP/BP 8.00 –
Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies”. As a result, some of the analyses, such as baseline
studies were to be carried out during project implementation. However, the project preparation
team carried out reviews of the Government’s pilot voucher program and the experience from
Malawi’s subsidy program, both of which informed the project’s design. The assessment of the
ability of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security, and Cooperatives to manage the project,
especially with respect to procurement, financial management, and overall oversight, appears to
have been inadequate, though, in view of the challenges faced later by the ministry in these
domains during project implementation (discussed in Section 2.2 below).
14.     Incorporation of Lessons Learned. Useful lessons were drawn from GoT’s previous
experience with agricultural subsidies, especially the pilot NAIVS, and from Malawi’s
agricultural input subsidy scheme, which were incorporated into the design. These include: (i)
beneficiary targeting to maximize poverty reduction; (ii) field demonstrations to increase input
demand; (iii) beneficiary involvement in program administration to increase program
participation; (iv) working with the private sector to strengthen input markets; and (v) ensuring
fiscal sustainability through a clear exit strategy. However, some of the weaknesses in the pilot
NAIVS that had been noted at appraisal were not adequately mitigated in the project design (or
were just hard to mitigate), and came to undermine project implementation, including: (i) belated
voucher deliveries that were not in consonance with the cropping calendar; (ii) lengthy voucher
redemption processes that hurt agro-dealer cash flows; (iii) insufficient agricultural extension
support at local level that led to sub-optimal input efficiency; and (iv) the partner bank being
overwhelmed by huge volumes of vouchers, resulting in slow redemptions, etc.
15.     Soundness of the Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention. The 2008/2009 economic shocks
had been projected to reduce Tanzania’s GDP growth to 4-5 percent in 2009, from 7.4 percent in
2008. The budget deficit was projected to grow higher than previously estimated (US$250-
US$450 million). Under these tough economic times, GoT’s funding for the NAIVS in 2008/09
was only able to reach 30 percent of eligible households. In order to have a greater impact, the
program needed more funding. The Bank’s intervention was, therefore, critical in contributing to
closing the funding gap that threatened the government’s efforts to adequately address the food
crisis and improve food security.



3
  The project was initially designed to operate across 11 regions in the country. Government later expanded
coverage to 23 regions effectively becoming a national program.
4
  Farmers in the seven regions covered by the Bank were allowed a choice of basal fertilizer options, whereas those
in the rest of country covered by Government funding were restricted to the domestically produced rock phosphate.
as a basal fertilizer. Earlier experience in the project indicated most farmers preferred to purchase imported di-
ammonium phosphate (DAP) rather than domestic rock phosphate.

                                                        4
Project Design

16.     Project design. The project’s components were consistent with the PDO, and were
mutually reinforcing: the vouchers to stimulate agricultural input demand, and the agro-dealer
network to respond to it. The support to the seed sector addressed needs for good quality, locally
adapted seed, which again was consistent with the PDO. The project had an exit strategy based
on clear farmer graduation timelines. Mainstreaming project implementation into existing public
administration structures accelerated project start up. However, to the extent that this was a short
duration project (3 years), the inclusion of major civil works in the project (such as irrigation
infrastructure) without expedited procurement arrangements (or advance preparation of technical
specifications and other documentation) appears to have been a design shortcoming.

Government Commitment

17.     GoT was highly committed to the project as it facilitated the preparatory activities,
including working collaboratively with the Bank team. The government team made up of
representatives from MAFC, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MOWI) and the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Affairs (MOFEA) worked hard to expedite the project’s preparation. GoT
worked hard to accelerate the delivery of the first year’s vouchers, which arrived just two months
after project effectiveness.

Risks and Mitigation Measures

18.     At appraisal, likely sources of implementation challenges were identified as: (i)
counterpart funding release difficulties or GoT’s share becoming a potential undue fiscal burden;
(ii) possible negative impact of the export ban of grain on farm prices; (iii) poor information
flow among program participants; (iv) agro-dealers’ limited technical and financial capacity; (iv)
unfavorable output price movements; (v) sub-optimal technical efficiency of applied inputs; (vi)
inadequacies in beneficiary targeting; (vii) poor monitoring and evaluation; and (viii) adverse
weather events. Of all the above risks, counterpart funding posed the most daunting challenge.
Counterpart funding shortfalls were mitigated by increasing IDA contribution, first from 50
percent to 83 percent, and in the Additional Financing of October 2012, to 100 per cent in
selected regions. By ICR time, Government still had open liabilities on long overdue voucher
redemptions. Clearly this risk was hard to mitigate. In addition, poor monitoring and evaluation,
and inadequacies in beneficiary targeting did materialize and could not be effectively mitigated.
One risk that hadn’t been identified at appraisal but which became a major constraint was
Government institutional capacity, especially procurement which, as discussed below, was a
major constraint to project implementation, and was not mitigated.

      2.2 Implementation

19.      Factors that facilitated project implementation include:
            Strong government interest in the program. The government ensured that key
             implementation arrangements and mechanisms were in place at all levels (national,
             regional, district and village) as per the project design. The government also initially
             ensured timely transfer of funds to the National Microfinance Bank (NMB) that was

                                                  5
             in charge of redeeming vouchers. In addition, Government fast-tracked initial voucher
             printing, which were ready within two months after project effectiveness.
            Participation of the private sector. About 1,000 agro-input dealers had been trained
             under a previous activity funded by the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, in
             conjunction with the Citizens’ Network for Foreign Affairs (CNFA). This activity
             was in support of the pilot NAIVS. The project leveraged this experience in
             expanding this nascent agro-input dealer network, including engaging the services of
             CNFA which had already developed training materials and methods. The project also
             benefited from the participation of NMB which had developed voucher redemption
             experience under the pilot NAIVS and had a country-wide branch network to serve
             the participating agro-input dealers.
            Additional Financing. As discussed earlier in Paragraph 13, additional financing in
             the amount of US$25 million was approved by the Bank in order to bring the project
             to an orderly conclusion. This not only facilitated providing the remaining rounds of
             support to eligible project beneficiaries, but allowed more time for completion of
             other remaining activities, especially those relating to strengthening the input supply
             chain.
20.    However, and as already discussed above, there were also a number of factors that
negatively affected project implementation. These factors, especially those related to slow
procurement processes, contributed to multiple project extensions, which turned a short-
duration, emergency project into a five year operation, These factors include:
            Significant problems associated with the vouchers. First, apart from the first and
             fifth years, there were significant delays in printing and distributing vouchers during
             other years (especially in 2011/12), which was disruptive to the program. Second,
             some agro-dealers experienced difficulties raising adequate capital to purchase the
             inputs from wholesalers. Third, from 2011 to 2014, slow release of counterpart
             funding and other bureaucratic delays severely undermined redemptions of vouchers
             held by agro-dealers (for over six months in some cases), prompting some to drop
             out. Fourth, the principle of graduating program participants after three years was
             generally not enforced, not only undermining a basic sustainability tenet of the
             program, but also limiting its expansion to other needy families. Fifth, the envisaged
             access to extension services materialized in only 25 percent of cases, which
             potentially limited amplification of program outcomes.
            Delay in procurement for key activities. The project was plagued with procurement
             delays that resulted in the cancelation of some key activities5 in the procurement plan.
             In addition, several of the activities retained in the procurement plan could not be
             initiated or completed: (i) the planned second training of agro-dealers never
             materialized; (ii) the final impact assessment surveys were never completed; (iii) the
             services for strengthening rural retail systems were never procured; (iv) a center pivot

5
  (i) Design and Pilot Test of Electronic Voucher System; (ii) Tracking of Input Purchase behaviour after the end of
subsidy; (iii) Conducting of Impact Assessment of Quality Declared Seed System in 18 Districts; (iv) Assessment
of Strength of Agro-dealers Development; and (v) Facilitating Agro-dealer Associations to Establish 400
Demonstration Trials in Villages under the Subsidy Program.


                                                         6
             irrigation scheme on the ASA seed farms in Morogoro and Arusha could not be
             completed; and (v) an end of term survey which could have provided a
             comprehensive report on poverty, gender, and social development impacts was never
             completed.

    2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

21.     M&E design. The PDO indicators, especially as further refined during the Additional
Financing (see paragraph 6 above) were pertinent to measuring project development outcomes.6
The project had provided for a number of important evaluations to provide the needed data for
assessing project outcomes, including: a baseline survey, a mid-term assessment, and an impact
assessment at project completion. In addition, it had provided for establishing a Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) system to systematically document project inputs and outputs for use in
improving management performance. Overall, the project had reasonably good M&E design
elements. However, since the initial project duration was short (3 years), orchestrating these
assessments would have required intricate planning, or possibly awarding the contract for the
three assessments to a single firm to minimize procurement overload, given the inherent risks
from procurement delays.
22.     M&E implementation. M&E implementation was weak. The baseline survey, which was
originally planned for February 2010, was completed in the last quarter of 2011. A mid- term
survey conducted in mid-2012 provided a fair indication of some of the impacts of the project.7
However, the procurement of an end of project survey in late 2013 was never completed. In
addition, an MIS system to systematically track delivery of inputs, as well as targeted outputs
and outcomes was never established as planned. Hence, data collection remained ad hoc, and at
the time of the ICR, there were significant gaps in the data available at the project management
team level.
23.    M&E Utilization and Sustainability. The above shortcomings notwithstanding, the M&E
outputs available were utilized in different fora. These data were reported in two limited impact
assessment reports, and one larger public expenditure review (PER) report for the NAIVS. These
were disseminated and discussed in detail in the Ministry, and the PER was discussed in a
national workshop sponsored by the Ministry of Finance. But its recommendations were not
followed through. Sustainability of the M&E system could not be ascertained as, at the time of
the ICR, significant weaknesses, including staffing in the system, remained.

    2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

    2.4.1         Safeguard Compliance


6
  However, some intermediate indicators remained poorly defined. For instance, Indicator No. 5 was formulated as a
percentage, although its annual targets were stated in absolute numbers. In addition, many of the indicators were
defined as annual targets with no clear end of project targets. These were expected to rise and fall with the increase
and decrease in the number of vouchers distributed.
7
  DEC oversaw the survey, although this led to uncertainty and confusion about the responsibility for analyzing and
writing up the survey results. Ultimately, much of the survey data was not analyzed, including the impact of
production and productivity on social and gender aspects.

                                                          7
24.      The project was classified as Category B and three safeguard policies were triggered:
OP4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP4.09 (Pest Management), and OP7.50 (Projects on
International Waterways). As agreed at appraisal, this project used the Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) of the Agricultural Sector Development Project as the two
projects were implemented by the same Ministry. As required by the ESMF, an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was prepared for investment activities pertaining to strengthening
national seed systems. Also, an Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) to manage the use of
pesticides as well as Integrated Nutrient Management Plan (INMP) to manage the use of
fertilizer were prepared. An environmental impact assessment showed no significant fertilizer
and pesticide residues in surface and underground water as chemical input use is still generally
low. Simplified INMP guidelines in Kiswahili were prepared for use by farmers. However,
because of the continued existence of knowledge and skills gaps in safe handling of chemical
inputs by farmers, the overall safeguard compliance was rated as Moderately Satisfactory in the
last ISR.

   2.4.2       Fiduciary Compliance
25.      Financial management. Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were generally submitted on
time, and at the time of the ICR, all withdrawal applications had been completed. However,
overall FM performance was frequently rated moderately satisfactory during project
implementation, including in the last ISR. Issues included: (i) failure to track budgets well
enough to ensure that all resources are defined in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF); (ii) ensuring timely transfer of allocated funds to NMB to expedite voucher
redemptions; (iii) poor tracking of advances to regions and districts (large outstanding advances
to the regions and districts are still in the process of being resolved); and (iv) inadequate follow-
up on external audit findings. The 2010/2011 project audit had qualifications relating to:
ineligible expenses, failure by the Ministry to strictly reconcile the record of vouchers sent for
redemption and the payments made by NMB, and failure to record unused vouchers in store
ledgers. The ineligible expenditures (US$ 20,954) were refunded to the project, as were funds
(US$ 19,000) associated with incomplete delivery of goods by a supplier. Otherwise, there were
no other reported incidents of malfeasance. Regarding disbursements, the project had, at the time
of the ICR, disbursed US$158.97 million (99.1 percent) of the original credit (because of
procurement delays, US$3.7million equivalent from the original credit earmarked for certain
activities was cancelled). All the US$25.0 million (100 percent) of the Additional Financing was
disbursed.
26.     Procurement. Overall, the project complied with the Bank’s procurement policy (OP/BP
11.00) as well as the national procurement act. From a fiduciary perspective, there were no
incidents of malfeasance reported or discovered in the course of the project’s implementation.
However, procurement was rated moderately unsatisfactory by the Bank procurement team as
the project suffered from long delays leading to cancelation of certain key activities, as indicated
above. This was mainly due to: (i) lack of capacity at the implementing agency to prepare the
requisite procurement documentation, and meticulously follow up on the procurement processes
until their logical conclusion; and (ii) inordinate administrative bureaucracies, such as infrequent
meetings by the Ministerial Tender Board regarding contracts above the Directors’ and
Permanent Secretary’s approval authority.

   2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
                                                 8
27.     The NAIVS was originally planned as a six year program ending in 2014. However, GoT
remains concerned about the high costs of agricultural inputs. GoT is, therefore, trying to
organize a program to provide subsidized credit to smallholder farmers by paying banks the
difference between the commercial interest rate of 18 percent and the program’s designated rate
of 4 percent. In addition, government has agreed to pay commercial banks 50 percent of the
value of the credit upfront, as a guarantee against possible defaults. Farmers are expected to
contribute 20 percent of the input cost, leaving banks to bear the risk on the remaining 30 percent
of the cost. Farmers are also expected to agree to market their produce through a designated
trader or warehouse, allowing the banks to first be repaid, before the residual sales proceeds are
remitted to the farmer. These discussions have included proposals for bulk purchases of inputs
and bulk sales through a new warehouse receipts system. The government was initially expected
to fund this program in 2013/14, but failed to provide funding to the banks in advance. In the
new fiscal year, Tsh58 billion (US$35 million) has been budgeted for this activity. The Ministry
has approached two commercial banks (Tanzania Cooperatives and Rural Development Bank,
and National Microfinance Bank), which have expressed their willingness to participate in the
program subject to government paying the guarantees upfront. Regarding the agro-dealer
networks supported by the project, their sustainability could not be ascertained as there was no
strategy in place regarding the continuation of their operations.

      3. Assessment of Outcomes

      3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

28.     Relevance of objective. The relevance of the project’s objective remains high. Increasing
productivity and production of principal food items remains a top Government priority as clearly
articulated in the National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction – MKUKUTA II (July
2010). The fourth goal of MKUKUTA II, Cluster 1, seeks to particularly ensure food security.
The project’s objective is also consistent with the current Bank CAS (2012-2015) objectives,
especially outcome 1.2, which focuses on increased agricultural productivity and
commercialization. Farmers’ access to improved seed and fertilizer remains a key to attaining
such a goal.
29.      Relevance of design and implementation. The relevance of design and implementation
arrangements is rated substantial. On the one hand, several design and implementation features
are still relevant, such as: (i) the use of an existing public administration network to facilitate
rapid project start up; (ii) the use of representative village committees to confer some measure of
control and community empowerment upon beneficiaries (despite being overshadowed by the
local administration officials in some cases); and (iii) involvement of local private distributors to
reinforce a sustainable mode of input distribution, among others. On the other hand, paper
voucher procurement, distribution, and redemption mechanisms can be very onerous and future
designs of such programs should leverage technology using paperless vouchers including
enhanced accountability features. In addition, some activities, such as major irrigation
infrastructure, probably should not belong to these kinds of emergency projects given their short-
term duration.

    3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial
30.    As indicated under Section 2.3, the project had several M&E shortcomings. Therefore,
data quality is poor. The analysis in this Section relies on some data collected by MAFC, and
impact assessments carried out in 2010 and 2013.
31.      Although only one indicator (maize yield achieved by farmers with subsidized seed and
fertilizer) out of the six PDO level indicators was fully achieved, the project made significant
progress on most of its targets.
32.     At the end of the project, 2,300,000 tons of additional maize production were produced
with subsidized seed and fertilizer compared to the target value of 2,400,000 tons. Also, 82,800
tons of additional rice was produced with subsidized seeds and fertilizers compared to the 86,800
tons target. The increased production of maize and paddy enabled Tanzania to be self-sufficient
in cereal grain production, and thereby resulted in the lifting of the grain export ban instituted in
2011.

33.     The increased use of subsidized input also led to an increase in productivity of maize and
rice. At the end of project, the average maize yield increased from a baseline of 0.33 tons/acre to
0.93 tons/acre, slightly above the target value of 0.90 tons/acre. Productivity of paddy increased
as well, from a baseline average yield of 0.74 tons/acre to an average yield of 1.11tons/acre,
slightly short of the targeted 1.31 tons/acre.
34.     About 6.97 million vouchers were distributed, against a target of about 7.17 million
vouchers (the target number is derived from the cumulative summation of the annual targets in
the project documents). These vouchers were supposed to benefit about 2.5 million households.
The M&E system does not allow determining whether the target of 2.5 million households was
achieved. Assuming that each household received the stipulated 3 vouchers (one per year for
three years), then some 2.3 million households benefited from the program. However, this is
difficult to determine since some households might have received vouchers for more than the

  This indicator supplants the number of beneficiaries for which the computation is no possible given limited
information about the targeting process i.e. how many of the beneficiaries received 1, 2 or 3 vouchers.

three stipulated years, and others for less. Regarding women, only 15 percent of the voucher
recipients were women against the targeted 29 percent.
35.     About 20 private companies and ASA are now involved in maize seed production,
representing about 87 percent of the total seed volume supplied in the country. At the end of the
project, 288 tons of basic seed were produced by private firms and ASA, against a target of 230
tons and from a baseline of only 44 tons. In addition, 99.4 tons of basic rice seed was produced,
slightly below the target value of 110 tons, and against a baseline of only 46 tons. Furthermore,
the capacity of three research stations in Arusha, Morogoro, and Mbeya regions to produce pre-
basic seeds was significantly strengthened. At the end of the project, they produced 18,000 tons
of pre-basic breeder maize seed (against 700 tons at baseline) and 40,000 tons of rice of pre-
basic breeder rice seed (against 1,200 tons at baseline).

   3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial
36.     The project’s efficiency was assessed using a cost-benefit analysis. Project benefit
estimates are based on incremental maize and paddy production using the subsidized inputs of
improved seed and fertilizer. But as is normally the case in traditional farming systems, other
crops rotated in previously fertilized fields also benefit from residual fertilizer and experience
increased productivity, sometimes quite significant. Moreover, the beneficiaries’ heightened
sense of plant nutrition and overall crop husbandry often spreads over to non-program crops.
However, for the purposes of this analysis, all these ancillary benefits were not assessed, hence
the re-estimated cost-benefit analysis is very conservative. The number of program beneficiaries
is estimated at 6.97 million farm households. At ICR, the project’s IRR was estimated 53.5
percent compared to 37 percent at appraisal, and the NPV at US$118.9 million, compared US$67
million at appraisal.

   3.4 Justification of Overall outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
37.      The intervention contributed significantly to maize and rice production and productivity
in targeted areas. These improvements are partly responsible for the government’s decision to lift
the grain trade ban it had instituted in 2001. It also expanded private sector input supply chain in
the country allowing the private input market to develop. However, it fell short on some of its
PDO level indicators, and implementation delays resulted in the cancellation of some key
activities and uncompleted major infrastructure.

   3.5 Overarching Themes, Other outcomes and impacts

   (a) Poverty impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

38.      Poverty impacts. The project focused on households farming less than one hectare.
Shortcomings in strict criteria enforcement notwithstanding, field missions did not detect cases
of elite capture. It is, therefore, generally understood that project benefits largely accrued to this
population segment, which is generally among Tanzania’s rural poor. However, it also

                                                 11
acknowledged that poorer households that could not afford the 50 percent subsidy top-up were
excluded from the program. More generally, the program contributed to increased grain supplies,
which moderated consumer prices of these items, especially maize, which is a staple for the poor,
both rural and urban.
39.    Impact on gender. Village Voucher Committees were composed of six members, three of
whom were women, which elevated women’s involvement in the local communities’ decision-
making processes. However, the proportion of women headed households among the program
beneficiaries was smaller than expected. This is probably because women headed households
were poorer than average, and might not have had the means to pay the top-up costs to the input
subsidy.
40.     Social impact. The beneficiary selection process was participatory: after vetting
applicants against selection criteria by the Village Voucher Committees, final beneficiary
selection was validated by the Village Assembly. This is believed to have created a greater sense
of community empowerment. In addition, the training of agro-input dealers as reliable sources of
technical information on agricultural inputs, and the expansion of their network, has created a
socio-economic dynamic between the farmers and their input suppliers.
   (b) Institutional change/Strengthening
41.     The project equipped the Agricultural Seed Agency to improve production of basic seed
for private companies to multiply and commercialize to farmers. The installation of the planned
pivot irrigation systems was never completed and GoT plans to complete it with its own budget.
The project also equipped the laboratory of the Tanzania Official Seed Certification Institute as
well as strengthened its capacity to process regional seed marketing certificates. In addition, the
three strategically located agricultural research institutes in Arusha, Morogoro, and Mbeya
regions were equipped with irrigation and other equipment to significantly increase pre-basic
seed production. Available data on pre-basic seed production and purchase show that pre-basic
seeds for maize and rice produced by these institutes were sufficient to cover the county’s
required foundation seed production.
   (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive of negative)

42.    Delayed payments to agro-dealers especially in the regions that were covered by
government prompted agro-dealers to factor in those delays in the final price of the input. This
led to an escalation of input prices that still persist under input supply programs backed by
government.

   3.6 Summary of findings of the beneficiary assessment survey

43.     Increased awareness of improved agricultural inputs. Farmers are more aware of
productivity gains from improved seeds and from judicious use of fertilizer. They have a better
understanding of the fertilizer options: basal fertilizer (manure versus DAP, versus Mining
Mazak) and top dressing (urea versus urea + CAN/ammonium sulfate). Indeed, over 57 percent
of program graduates continued to buy improved maize or rice seed after graduating from the
NAIVS. The data also indicate that 37 percent continued to purchase chemical fertilizer in the
year following their graduation.


                                                12
44.     Strengthened relationships with agro-dealers. The program’s expansion of a network of
trained agro-dealers and the program’s modus operandi have forged a close relationship between
farmers and dealers from whom they not only buy inputs, but also receive advice on their proper
application. The reduced distances to agro-dealers is also likely to facilitate continued use of
improved seed and fertilizer.

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcomes

Rating: Substantial
45.      The project sought to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted
areas by improving access to critical agricultural inputs. It sought to make these gains sustainable
through various provisions in the project’s design, including: (i) placing a time limit (of 3 years)
to the subsidy, a time during which the graduating farmers were expected to have built financial
capability to acquire these inputs on their own; (ii) expanding a network of trained agro-input
retailers to facilitate farmers’ easy access to inputs and related basic information; (iii)
strengthening national seed systems; (iv) strengthening collaboration with research and extension
on integrated soil management, etc. As discussed above, some gains were made to varying
degrees on some of these elements, such as expanding and training the input dealer network, and
rehabilitating some of the seed network. And as also noted above, some farmers are continuing
to purchase inputs on their own. However, the project’s approach to wean farmers from subsidy
dependence through the 3-year graduation strategy was not consistently enforced. Government
is, instead keen on continuing a subsidy program, this time in the form of subsidized credit. The
sustainability of the program will then hinge upon Government’s ability to fund it, a substantial
risk to the program. In addition, the construction and rehabilitation of a center pivot irrigation
system for ASA, was left incomplete. According to MAFC officials, the ministry intends to
complete this infrastructure with its own resources in 2014/15 and has made budgetary provision
for its completion.

    5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

   (a) Bank Performance in ensuring quality at entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

46.     As an emergency operation, it was prepared under an expedited process, with little time
for extensive analytical rigor. Nonetheless, the project exhibited many good quality features,
including: (i) a simple and clear PDO, well aligned to country priorities; (ii) PDO indicators,
although short on pertinence in formulation, that were broadly reflective of expected project
outcomes; (iii) a recognition of the prevailing fluid macroeconomic environment that inspired a
flexible design with respect to Government counterpart funding (which was allowed to evolve in
tandem with Government’s fiscal disposition); (iv) a provision for retroactive financing to
expedite voucher procurement in time for the upcoming planting season; (v) mainstreaming
implementation in Government administrative structures to facilitate early implementation; (vi)
accommodation of a number of useful lessons from the NAIVS pilot and the Malawi experience;
(vii) an exit strategy to deter subsidy-dependence, and lighten Government fiscal burden, etc.
There was strong collaboration with Government which had a deep interest in the project.

                                                13
However, some of the major shortcomings include: (i) inadequate assessment of Government
capacity which led to significant implementation delays; (ii) inclusion of some activities (such as
major irrigation) that would ordinarily take a long time, or for which expedited procurement
would have to be facilitated (like a head start on procurement documentation during project
preparation); and (iii) some intermediary indicators with unclear end targets.

   (b) Quality of supervision
       Rating: Satisfactory

47.     The Bank organized two missions per annum to provide implementation support to the
government. The mission team members consisted of technical specialists who provided hands
on solutions to key implementation issues, including transferring knowledge to their government
counterparts. With its key FM and Procurement staff based in-country, the Bank worked closely
with the government team to discuss key fiduciary issues. The team kept management informed
of implementation progress through systematic reporting in aide-memoires, back-to-office
reports and ISRs. The Bank also responded positively to government request for additional
financing and extension of the closing date to scale up project implementation. During the AF
preparation, the Bank team worked with the government team to revise and reformulate certain
indicators that were perceived ambiguous and unachievable. However, the team erroneously did
not change the baseline and the targets for the first three years and that remained the same until
end of project. The Bank could have done more in building the capacity of MAFC staff in
fiduciary management and monitoring and evaluation, including strategic outsourcing of discrete
items to expedite implementation. These are recognized weaknesses across the country portfolio
and merit a broader response.

   (c) Justification for Rating Overall Bank Performance
       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

48.    Taking into account the quality of preparation and supervision, the overall Bank
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

   5.2 Borrower performance

   (a) Government Performance
       Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

49.     The GoT exhibited high level of commitment to the success of the project. It facilitated
the preparation process by working in close collaboration with the Bank team. During
implementation government facilitated project supervisions and worked closely with the Bank
team in addressing key implementation challenges. However, the government did not promptly
resolve major fiduciary issues that caused delays in payment of government funding to input
suppliers. Counterpart funding was simply not made available on a timely basis and this had a
negative effect on key project aspects such as voucher printing and redemption. While the
overall project contributed major improvements in production and food security, the
sustainability of these gains has been seriously undermined.

                                                14
   (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

50.      During project preparation and appraisal, MAFC worked closely with the Bank team and
facilitated the process by coordinating the interventions of the key stakeholders. It met all
effectiveness conditions, which ensured a timely project start-up. During implementation, MAFC
maintained good relationship with the Bank team, facilitated all supervision missions, and
addressed issues together with the Bank team. However, MAFC commonly failed to implement
key procurement activities which led to delays in the execution of key activities, the failure to
complete planned training of agro-dealers, the failure to complete key infrastructure investments,
and the failure to complete several key impact assessments. Procurement delays were repeatedly
discussed in implementation support missions’ meetings with the implementation team, and
meetings with the MAFC management. Yet little improvement was achieved. The MAFC also
fell short of systematically monitoring project results as data collection, implementation
monitoring and documentation were deficient.

   (d) Justification for Rating Overall Borrower Performance
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

51.     The overall borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The government
was committed to the project, but it was slow in fulfilling its financial commitments that caused
significant implementation delays. It did not also address weaknesses in day-to-day monitoring
of project results.

   6. Lessons Learned

52.     Five key lessons were learned from the implementation of this project. Firstly,
successful implementation of emergency operations significantly benefits from careful
advance planning, especially procurement. In order to expedite voucher procurement for the
first year, the project rightfully provided for retroactive financing in order for the vouchers to be
ready for the August/September 2009 rains, even though the project only became effective in late
August, 2009. However, the project could have benefited from advance planning regarding the
procurement of other items, such as the service providers for the baseline and other assessments,
the irrigation systems, etc. From the project’s concept review in December 2008, to its
effectiveness in August 2009, critical procurement documentation could have been prepared for
these items (e.g. TORs and technical specifications). Several of these items were ultimately not
procured or completed within the project implementation period, even after three project
extensions.
53.    Secondly, mainstreaming projects in line ministries works best when complemented
by pragmatic solutions to implementation issues as they arise. Mainstreaming this project’s
implementation in the Ministry allowed leveraging some of the public administration strengths,
ranging from drawing heavily from Government’s experience in implementing the pilot voucher
program, to taking advantage of the extensive public administration network that went all the
way to the village level which, among other things, accelerated project start up. However, this

                                                 15
arrangement also exhibited several weaknesses, especially in monitoring and procurement.
Pragmatic solutions, such as outsourcing certain discrete tasks (like writing TORs and drawing
technical specifications for irrigation systems that might require specialized expertise), should
have been considered, especially for small tasks with lower procurement thresholds, hence
falling under Government’s expedited approval provisions (Director or Permanent Secretary
level). Such complementary actions do not go against the mainstreaming principle but are a
recognition of some of its limitations in situations of especially emergency, when speedy
effective action is critical. Yet, such actions would have gone a long way in expediting project
implementation, instead of expecting that each and every task be done Ministry staff, which led
to protracted delays.
54.      Thirdly, agricultural input voucher programs can significantly increase
productivity, but remain difficult to administer. As already noted, the voucher program had
significant positive impact on production and productivity among program participants. But the
program was hamstrung by challenges that had plagued such past programs (including the pilot
around which it was modeled). To the extent that a voucher program might be considered the
most viable option for supporting smallholders at a given point in time, some of the
enhancements that might merit consideration, drawing on this program’s experience, include: (i)
integrating independent external monitoring in the design and arranging that such services be
available early on through advance procurement planning; (ii) elevating the dialogue on
enforcing the program’s exit strategy beyond the project, given its bearing on the broader sector
strategy and the country fiscal’s situation; (iii) leveraging cell phone technology in program
design and implementation; (iv) partnering with the microfinance institutions in order to
facilitate financing poor farmers that might have potentially viable farming propositions but
cannot raise the requisite top-up funds; and (v) incorporating in the design a more structured
collaboration with/availability of extension services to amplify impact. In addition, since voucher
programs require a lot of advance preparation like poverty and asset profiling, third party
monitoring arrangements etc., they are inherently unsuitable under emergency operations of this
nature.
55.      Lastly, a final lesson learned is that inclusion of major civil works (e.g., the irrigation
infrastructure) without expedited procurement arrangements, while well meaning, may not be
best suited for these type of emergency operations. Such longer gestation investments could
divert focus and contribute to implementation delays.

dissemination was delivered through meetings at the regional, district and village levels. More
than 10,000 leaflets containing information on (i) importance of using improved inputs; (ii)
maize and paddy production; (iii) recommendations for the appropriate fertilizer for maize and
rice were produced; and (iv) Integrated Nutrient Management Plan (INMP) guidelines were
prepared and distributed to farmers in the targeted districts. Over 10 radio and 13 television
programs on the success of the NAIVS were organized and broadcasted on Tanzania
Broadcasting Cooperation (TBC 1), including local FM radios in Mbeya region. These

                                                     18
interventions covered the Southern Highlands’ regions of Mbeya, Ruvuma, Iringa and Rukwa.
To enhance members of VVCs’ understanding of the NAIVS, the project trained the VVCs
across the country. The VVCs were responsible for selecting beneficiaries, distributing vouchers
to the participating farmers, and ensuring that the inputs were available and utilized at village
level. Table 3 shows key outputs of this subcomponent.

Table 3: Key Intermediate Outputs
     Intervention                                   Output
    Awareness       - 10,000 leaflets printed
    creation        - 10 radio and 13 television programs on NAIVS organized and
    campaigns          broadcasted
                    - All VVCs trained in the implementation modalities of NAIVS

7.     Component 2: Strengthening the inputs supply chain. This component supported the
input voucher scheme by (i) strengthening the agro dealer network; and (ii) strengthening
national seed systems to improve the immediate and longer-term availability of quality seed for
maize, rice, and other crops.
8.       Strengthening the agro-dealer network. Through this component an expanded network
of well-informed, trained agro-dealers that are located closer to the villages they serve has been
established. The project increased farmers’ access to agricultural inputs by providing training in
business and technical skills to agro-dealers involved in distribution of fertilizers and improved
seeds to the participating farmers. In the course of project implementation, about 3,855 agro-
dealers across the country were trained on business planning and handling of agricultural inputs.
The trained agro-dealers were directly involved in the distribution of improved seed and
fertilizers to the farmers in 24 regions under NAIVS. The involvement of the agro-dealers has
led to a reduction of distance travelled by farmers to purchase inputs. Before the project, farmers
had to travel long distances to purchase fertilizers and improved seeds, which translated into
increased prices of fertilizers and improved seeds. Table 4 shows key outputs of the component.

                                   dealers’ Associations (DAAs) in the country

9.     Strengthening National Seed Systems. This subcomponent supported the development of
a national seed policy, strategy, and regulatory framework to: (i) develop the enabling
environment for a vibrant, competitive seed system in which private companies can participate
successfully; (ii) stimulate the development of business-oriented, farmer-based seed production
and marketing units in all regions; and (iii) support agricultural research institutes in producing
                                                19

                             Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.     This analysis includes a qualitative analysis of administrative and operational efficiency
and cost-benefit analysis.

2.       Administrative and operational efficiency. The project faced delays in implementation
of activities due to administrative inefficiencies largely attributed to financial management,
particularly delays in the GoT’s financing and procurement issues. As noted earlier, the project
utilized public financial management systems, which was saddled with cash flow problems
leading to late transfer of funds from the Exchequer to NMB account. This meant that NMB was
not able to pay agro-dealers on time. At the time of ICR, the government’s payment of seed and
fertilizer suppliers in the regions it supported had barely begun; though almost all input suppliers
in the IDA funded zones had been paid. The delays in procurement largely contributed to the
cancellation of about US$3.7million of project funds. Besides, inefficiencies in the procurement
processes and procedures resulted in delays in the execution of key activities, including
uncompleted installation of center pivot irrigation system in ASA irrigation fields in Morogoro
and Arusha. The delays in procurement activities led to extension of the closing date of the
project on three occasions as noted in section 1.7 above, yet this important infrastructural activity
was not completed. The inefficiencies in the procurement process were mainly attributed to the
failure of the project management team to consistently track procurement tasks, procurement
capacity constraints at MAFC and user departments/agency level, and slow public procurement
procedures.

3.      Cost-Benefit Analysis. Although it is not a requirement under OP/BP 8.00 guidelines for
emergency operations, an ex-ante cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted at appraisal. For
that reason, the ICR team conducted a CBA for the activities under the three components of the
project. Component 1 (input voucher distribution) constituted over 91.5 percent of total project
cost, including additional financing. The component financed the distribution of over 20 million
input vouchers to over 6 million beneficiary households. Data for component 2 was mainly
obtained from capacity activities aimed at strengthening the agro dealer network. The following
key assumptions form the basis of the analysis:

4.      Methodology and underlying assumptions. (i) Benefits: The gross revenue from the sale
of the maize and rice was assumed to be the project benefits accruing to farmers. The gross
revenue is calculated as increased maize and rice production times average consumer price of
the two crops [(maize= Tsh371.43 (US$0.23 per kg ) and rice=Tsh1,850 (US$1.12 per kg)]9; (ii)
Costs: Costs include direct costs of the program per household in different regions and
complementary investments (incremental farm production costs) per household and
administrative and transport costs associated with the delivery of input vouchers; (iii) a 12
percent discount rate was used as a proxy for average opportunity cost of capital, based on the
average bank lending rate in Tanzania; (iv) a five-year horizon was assumed for both maize and
rice production; and (v) an exchange rate of Tsh1, 650=US$1.


9
 Estimates for average consumer prices per kg were obtained from PER NAIVS, February 2014, for eight regions:
Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Morogoro, Ruvuma, Iringa, Mbeya, Rukwa, and Kigoma. The analysis uses consumer prices
as opposed to farm gate prices as these were not readily available for representative regions.

                                                      22
5.      Results. On the basis of the above assumptions, the project interventions for input
voucher distribution generated a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$118.9 million and Internal Rate
of Return (IRR) of 53.5 percent compared to appraisal estimate of US$67.0 million NPV and
37.0 percent IRR respectively. Table 1 below compares appraisal and end of project estimates
for the project NPV and IRR respectively.

  agricultural input

6.     The project also resulted in non-quantifiable benefits associated with the distribution of
the input vouchers, which strengthened the national maize and rice input distribution system.
This was achieved through strengthening of the linkages between input (seed and fertilizer)
companies, intermediary agro-dealers (agents) and village level small agro-dealers. The national
agro-dealer network has been strengthened, and brought farmers close to services in the project
implementation areas. The project, thus impacted on reviving the maize and rice input markets.

                               Annex 6. Beneficiary/Impact Assessment Survey

Methodology
1.      Selection of beneficiaries. Before the implementation of the NAIVS program, it was
estimated that 2.5 million households were eligible, but the government distributed vouchers to
only 1.5 million households in 2000/10 and 2 million households in 2010/11. This resulted in
fewer vouchers distributed than the number of eligible farmers each year. The assessment used
this shortage to create a comparison group of farmers made up of non-beneficiary households
within the same village. The treatment group was therefore comprised of farming households
that received subsidy for the first time in the 2009/11 planting season and the comparison group
consisted of eligible farming households in the same village that had never received the subsidy.
2.      Comparison of outcomes. The analysis also compares outcomes between fourth-year
beneficiaries – or graduates – that received the subsidy for the first time in 2008/09 with those
that have received vouchers since 2009/10.
3.      Sampling. The overall sample for the impact evaluation was selected from eight Regions
that are representative of the NAIVS program area in the Southern and Northern Highland zones,
because they have the highest potential for maize production. The study focused on 8 of these
Regions, in particular those across Tanzania’s grain belt known as the “big six” that covers the
Southern Highlands (Ruvuma, Iringa, Rukwa, Mbeya) as well as some of the Western Zone
(Kigoma) and Central Zone (Morogoro). The sample also included two Regions in the North:
Arusha and Kilimanjaro. Morogoro, Arusha, and Kilimanjaro are distinct in that they experience
bimodal rainfall patterns, which result in a later start date for the main planting season as
compared to southern areas with uni-modal rainfall. The sample was expanded in the 2012
follow up survey to include two additional regions – Dodoma and Tabora - that experience less
rainfall to represent the country’s “dry zones”. In order to measure and compare the cost-
effectiveness of the program across a wider variety of climatic zones and soil types.
4.      The following are major findings of the beneficiary/impact assessment survey conducted
as part of project closure:
5.      Increased production and productivity. The project contributed to an increase in maize
and rice production and productivity. Over 2.5 million farmer households received and
redeemed seed and fertilizer vouchers directly contributing to additional production of about
2.85 million tons of maize and 97,000 tons of paddy to the economy10. According to the impact
assessment report, yield gains has averaged 433 kg per acre for maize and 263 kg per ha for rice
respectively, and participating farmers achieved maize yields averaging 925 kg per acre (2.3
t/ha), compared to only 454 kg per acre (1.1 t/ha) yields achieved by non-participating farmers.
Participating farmers achieved paddy averaging 1.1 tons per acre (2.7 t/ha). In comparison, non-
beneficiaries achieved paddy yields of only 0.7 tons per acre (1.8 t/ha).
6.     Increased utilization of improved seeds. A significant number of farmers are now using
improved seeds and fertilizer. Over 57 percent of program graduates continued to buy improved
maize or rice seed after graduating from the NAIVS. The data also indicate that 37 percent
continued to purchase chemical fertilizer in the year following their graduation. This implies a


10
     Estimated cumulative total over the full five project years.

                                                             26
significant improvement in the adoption rates for these inputs compared with the period before
the project started.
7.     Increased awareness of improved agricultural inputs. Farmers are more aware of
improved agricultural inputs and have recognized the use of recommended fertilizer and
improved seeds offer productivity gains. For example, in southern highlands, demand and
purchases of fertilizers and improved seed (hybrid seed) are high and in lowlands the use of
Open Pollinated Varieties (OPVs) has increased.
8.     Increased number of agro-dealers. There has been significant increase in the number of
agro-dealers serving districts and villages. Over 2,300 agro-dealers across the country are
capable of distributing agricultural inputs up to the village levels. The strengthened agro-dealer
network has improved farmers access to improved agricultural inputs. Before the project farmers
were travelling to the district headquarters to purchase agricultural inputs. The relationships
between seed and fertilizer suppliers and agro-dealers have also strengthened considerably. More
than 600 agro-dealers have been formally designated as sales agents for one or more input
suppliers.
9.       Availability of technologies. Farmers can now seek more information about a variety of
technology options. Farmers, local extension staff, and agro-dealers, can now conduct more on-
farm demonstrations and trials to test multiple technical options, including application of basal
fertilizer (manure versus DAP, versus Minjingu Mazao) and top-dressing (urea versus urea +
CAN/ammonium sulfate). They can also seek more information about the wider range of
available maize and rice varieties adapted to their cropping systems and changing environment.

Background

1.      At project inception, the agriculture sector of Tanzania was characterized by a number of
challenges including among others (i) low productivity, (ii) over dependence of rain fed
agriculture, (iii) inadequate agricultural support services, (iv) poor rural infrastructure, and (v)
weak agro-industries and poor linkages within the value chain of agricultural produce. The
government took different initiatives in order to address these challenges and accelerate
agricultural development and rural transformation in the country. For example, the government
re-introduced the National Agriculture Inputs Subsidy Program (NAISP) in 2003/2004. The
objective of NAISP was to ensure national food security by increasing production and
productivity of food crops through improving farmers’ access to quality agricultural inp uts. This
was in line with the country’s National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (Kiswahili
acronym MKUKUTA II), Tanzania Five Year Development Plan 2011/12-2015/16 and Tanzania
Agriculture and Food Security Investment Program (TAFSIP), which calls for agricultural
productivity growth and food security through the expansion of input subsidies to all regions of
the country as a means of supporting productivity growth by the country’s smallholders. Through
NAISP, the government subsidized 50 percent of agricultural inputs market price particularly on
basal fertilizer, top dressing fertilizer, and improved maize and paddy seeds. The remaining 50
percent of inputs market price under subsidy were paid by farmers. The farmers were subsidized
with one bag of basal fertilizer, one bag of top dressing fertilizer, 10 kg of improved maize and
15 kilogram of paddy seeds. Each selected farmer received inputs under subsidy for three
consecutive years. The subsidized inputs given to farmers were used in an area of one acre.

2.      In 2009/2010 season, the government received a three-year credit (CR 4619-TA) worth
US$160 million from the World Bank (WB) in order to scale up NAISP through AFSP. The
PDO was to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted areas by
improving farmers’ access to critical agricultural inputs. The credit was scheduled to end in
June 2012, but due to uncompleted procurement the credit was extended to December 2013. In
addition to that, the WB approved additional financing (CR-5173-TZ) worth US$25 million to
support the payment of input subsidies for 2013/2014 cropping season. The additional financing
is scheduled to close on June 30, 2014.

       Description of Original Project Components

4.     Component 1: Improving Access to Agricultural Inputs. This component encompassed
the provision of agricultural input vouchers to eligible farmers in targeted areas to enable them to
purchase seeds and fertilizer, as well as the improvement of farmers’ awareness of the
importance of improved inputs use through input voucher program and training for VVC.

5.      Component 2: Strengthening the Input Supply Chain. The objective of this component
was to build capacity of agro-dealers to improve their customer service provision, creating
linkages to input supply companies, and building smallholder demand for improved inputs. In
addition, this component strengthens national seed systems through (i) reviewing and updating of
the national seed policy and regulatory framework, including developing a seed sub-sector
strategy; (ii) stimulating business-oriented farmer-based seed production and marketing units;
(iii) providing irrigation and field equipment, cold seed storage facilities and seed cleaning
equipment to three Agricultural Research Institutes to support the production of pre-basic seed;
and (iv) providing irrigation equipment, storage facilities, farm implements, seed cleaning
equipment and transport equipment to the Agricultural Seed Agency (ASA) to support
production of high quality basic seed.

6.      Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring and Impact Evaluation. The
objective of this component was to support project management, coordination and
implementation, as well as to conduct monitoring and evaluation activities. Despite the
additional financing, the components were not revised and remained the same throughout the
project implementation period.

       Project preparation and design

7.       AFSP was prepared following the WB response to the GoT’s request for urgent support
for its efforts to enhance national food security and avert the food crisis that could arise because
of persistently high, volatile prices for food and agricultural inputs. The project was designed to
scale up government efforts to boost domestic food production, make food more widely
available, and increase the stability of food production through improving small scale farmers’
access to agricultural inputs specifically, fertilizer and improved seed for maize or paddy. The
project was designed mainly to support the government effort to improve national food security
through improving production and productivity by providing input subsidies to small scale

                                                      30
farmers following and incorporating important lessons from government implementation of
subsidy program in 2008/2009 and similar programs in other countries, such as Malawi. Also the
project design considered the country’s initiatives for development including the National
Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (Kiswahili acronym MKUKUTA II), the
Tanzania Long Term Perspective Plan 2011/12-2025/26, and the Tanzania Five Year
Development Plan 2011/12-2015/16 with development objectives relating to agricultural
productivity growth and food security.

8.      The following risk were identified (i) political visibility as the project provided subsidies
to large numbers of farmers which created political support, but also debated about the extent of
coverage and efficiency of the use of public resources. This risk was mitigated by MAFC
presenting inputs subsidy plans and openly discussed with Members of Parliament, regional and
district stakeholders and inputs supplies; (ii) voucher misallocation and misuse which raised
concerns about weak monitoring and control systems. This risk was managed by conducting a
performance audit by the National Audit Office (NAO) and a third part independent monitoring
and evaluation; and (iii) fertilizer runoff leading to groundwater contamination. The risk was
handled through water contamination testing and the result indicates no significant
contaminations were observed.

Assessment of Project Outcomes

9.       The following section provides an assessment of the achievement of the PDO. As stated
earlier, the PDO is to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted areas by
improving farmers’ access to critical agricultural inputs. The main components that contributed
to the achievement of PDO include: (i) Component 1: Improving Access to Agricultural Inputs;
(ii) Component 2: Strengthening the Input Supply Chain; and (iii) Component 3: Project
Management and Monitoring and Impact Evaluation. The detailed objectives of these project
components are as described in section 4 above.

       1.2     Component 1: Improving access to agricultural inputs.

10.    The objective of this component was to scale up the input voucher scheme and facilitate
the implementation through improving awareness, information and participation at local level.
The component was divided into two sub-components which are (i) Scale up National Voucher
Scheme and (ii) Improving farmers’ awareness, information, and participation.

Sub-component 1.1 Scale up National Voucher Scheme.

   a. Voucher Printing and distribution

11.     The project increased the use of fertilizer and improved seeds of maize and paddy by
distributing more than 15 million input vouchers to 2.5 million farm households in 121 districts
in 24 regions (Annex 4). The distributed vouchers supported the purchase and application of over
500,000 tons of fertilizer, and over 50,000 tons of improved seeds of maize and paddy. In the
fifth year of project (2013/2014 season), 2,796, 273 vouchers were printed and distributed to
932,100 farm households to assist in purchase of 93,210 tons of fertilizers and 9,620 tons of

                                                 31
improved seeds of maize and paddy. Table 2 shows a summary of project beneficiaries from
2009/2010 to 2013/2014.

    b. Production and Productivity

12.    Production: The project through NAIVS has improved production of maize and paddy in
the country. The WB Review Mission report in 2013 showed that production of maize and paddy
has increased from 3.1 million tons in 2003/2004 to 5.2 million tons in 2012/2013 and from
688,000 tons in 2003/2004 to 1.3 million tons in 2012/2013 respectively. This production
increase has made the country to record additional maize and paddy production (Table 3)
allowing the country to retain self-sufficiency in cereal grain production. The increase in maize
and paddy production assisted the lift of grain export ban in 2011 and subsequently reduced
importation of grains in the country.

13.    Productivity: The improvement of farmers’ access to fertilizers and improved seed
increased maize and paddy yield per acre. The WB reports show that average maize yield has
increased from 0.5 tons per acre to 2.0 tons per acre and average yield for paddy has increased
from 0.5 tons per acre to an average of 2.5 tons per acre in 2013/2014 respectively. Table 4
shows the trend of average maize and paddy yield per acre achieved with subsidized inputs from
2009/2010 to 2013/2014.

  Sub-component 1.2: Improving farmers’ awareness, information, and participation

  14.    This sub-component aimed at providing information to farmers, implementing agencies,
  agro-dealers, other private sector participants, agricultural research agencies, extension services,
  and the general public about the input voucher scheme. The information described how the
  scheme works, how to participate, stakeholders’ rights and responsibilities, the scale and timing
  of operations, and the exit strategy.

  15.      Awareness campaign: During the execution of the project, the information dissemination
  was delivered through meetings at the region, district and village levels. More than 10,000
  leaflets on (i) importance of using improved inputs; (ii) maize and paddy production; (iii)
  fertilizer recommendations for maize and rice; and (iv) Integrated Nutrient Management Plan
  (INMP) guidelines were prepared and distributed to farmers in the targeted districts. Ten Radio
  and thirteen Television Programs on performance of NAIVS were prepared and aired through
  Tanzania Broadcasting Cooperation (TBC 1) countrywide and Bomba FM radio in Mbeya which
  covered for the Southern Highlands’ regions of Mbeya, Ruvuma, Iringa and Rukwa.

  16.    Training of Village Voucher Committees (VVCs): The Project trained all VVCs who are
  key players in the implementation of NAIVS through the District officials. The VVCs had the
  role of selection of beneficiaries, distribution of vouchers to the participating farmers and
  ensuring that the inputs are availed and utilized in the respective villages.

          1.3    Component 2: Strengthening the inputs supply chain
  17.     The objective of this component was to facilitate input voucher scheme by (i)
  strengthening the agro dealer network; and (ii) strengthening national seed systems to improve
  the immediate and longer-term availability of quality seed for maize, rice, and other crops.

  Sub-component 2.1: Strengthening the agro-dealer network

  18.     This sub-component aimed at improving business and technical skills of agro-dealers so
  that they can improve their provision of customer services, link to other input supply companies,
  gain better access to finance, and build smallholders’ demand for improved inputs. A key


                                                    33
outcome of this sub-component was an expanded network of well-informed, trained agro-dealers
that are located significantly closer to the villages.

19.     The project increased farmers’ access to agricultural inputs by training agro dealers who
were involved in training, distributing fertilizers and improved seeds to the participating farmers.
In the course of project implementation, about 3,855 agro dealers across the country were trained
on business planning and handling of agricultural inputs. The trained agro dealers were directly
involved in the distribution of improved seed and fertilizers to the farmers in 24 regions under
NAIVS (Table 5). The involvement of the agro dealers during the implementation of the project
has reduced the distance travelled by farmers to purchase the inputs. The interviewed farmers
informed that, before the project, they were travelling long distances to purchase fertilizers and
improved seeds. Travelling long distances increased the price of fertilizers and improved seeds.

20.    Apart from the success which the farmers got from having agro dealers in their vicinity,
the number of agro-dealers participating in NAIVS has been declining. This is due to the fact
that most reliable agro-dealers remained in NAIVS and developed their business as were linked
with input producers and importers. The interviewed agro dealers noted that their commercial
supply chains have been strengthened under the project and their commercial sales (outside the
voucher scheme) has increased. Some of these agro dealers are operating as agents of one or
more seed and or fertilizers suppliers.

21.    The objective of extending agro-dealer networks to the villages has been only partly
successful as in most villages input shops do not exist as was anticipated during the project
planning and implementation, and inputs were often left with the Village Executive Officers
(VEOs), while agro-dealers collected the vouchers (and top-ups) once the voucher redemption
was completed.

22.    Formation of the national agro dealers association known as Tanzania Agro-dealers
Association (TANADA) was facilitated by the project. TANADA is composed of representatives
from 44 District Agro dealers’ Associations (DAAs) in the country. The Chairperson and
Secretary of the DAAs are members of TANADA.

Sub-component 2.2: Strengthening National Seed Systems


                                                34
23.     The objective of this sub-component was to promote better and more sustainable access
to a greater array of high quality seed of locally adapted varieties for a broad range of food crops,
sold at competitive prices through the agro-dealer network supported through by the project.
Activities within this sub-component were to ensure that high-quality seed were available in time
to implement NAIVS and help to develop a sustainable and efficient seed system in the country.
More specifically, was to: (i) support the development of a national seed policy, strategy, and
regulatory framework to develop the enabling environment for a vibrant, competitive seed
system in which private companies can participate successfully; (ii) stimulate the development of
business-oriented, farmer-based seed production and marketing units in all regions; and (iii)
support agricultural research institutes in producing pre-basic and ASA in producing basic seed
to enable private companies and QDS system to supply high-quality seed to farmers. The key
issues that contributed to the achievements of this sub-component are:

        Support to Agricultural Research Institutes (ARIs)

24.     The project supported three strategically located ARIs of Selian in Arusha for 5 ha,
Ilonga in Morogoro for 15 ha and Uyole in Mbeya for 5 ha by providing research and laboratory
equipment, irrigation and field equipment, cold storage facilities and seed cleaning equipment in
order to increase production of pre-basic seed. During the implementation of the project
production of pre-basic seed for maize and paddy were adequate to cover required foundation
seed production. Table 6 shows production of pre-basic seed from 2008/2009 to 2011/2012.

        Support to Agriculture Seed Agency (ASA)

25.     The project supported two ASA seed farms of Arusha for 50 ha and Msimba for 150 ha
to improve production of basic seed so as to enhance Private Seed Companies and QDS to
produce and supply high-quality certified seeds to the farmers. The seed farms were supported
with (i) a complete processing line for basic seed, including seed cleaner, gravity table, treatment
equipment and bagger-scale; (ii) new and rehabilitated seed storage facilities; (iii) farm
implements and transport equipment; (iv) irrigation equipment sufficient for 50 ha at Arusha and
150 ha at Msimba; and (v) seed testing equipment for internal quality control. The support that
was provided improved the production of basic seed (Annex 7). Table 7 shows the production of

        Support to Quality Declared Seed (QDS) Production

26.     During the implementation of the project, 18 QDS farmers groups were each provided
with seed treatment equipment (cleaner, sorter, etc.) to improve their seed production. The seed
equipment has been delivered to the farmer groups in Mvomero, Kilimbero, Kilosa, Ulanga and
Morogoro Rural (Morogoro region); Kongwa, Kondoa, Mpwapwa, Bahi and Dodoma rural
(Dodoma region); Iringa Rural and Mufindi (Iringa region); Njombe Rural, Makete and Ludewa
(Njombe region); Nachingwea and Ruangwa (Lindi region); Masasi and Mtwara Rural (Mtwara
region). Procurement of 36 pieces of high quality tarpaulin (18 by 18 m side) for various seed
drying, sorting and grading were provided to QDS producers.

27.     The outcome of the support by the project is reflected by a trend of QDS production as is
shown in Table 8. QDS production has increased marginally over the project period but
remained small as a proportional of total seed production in the country of about 2.8 percent.
Low contribution of QDS to the total seed produced is attributed by; (i) financial capability of
QDS producers; (ii) buyers preference to hybrid varieties than QDS; and (iii) drought which
occurred in 2009/2010 and partly in 2010/2011 in Masasi, Mtwara Rural, Nachingwea,
Ruangwa, Bahi, Morogoro Rural and Kondoa districts. Despite its low contribution to total seed
production, QDS has successfully assisted farmers who cannot meet the expense of purchasing
the varieties supplied by the Private Companies as the price of QDS ranges between Shillings
500 per kg to Shillings 1,000 per kg.

28.      The project supported refresher course on Seed production by TOSCI, ARI-Dakawa,
ASA and Seed Unit staff of MAFC. The participants were 45 Authorized Seed Inspectors and 44
Subject Matter Specialists (SMS) from Dodoma, Singida, Mara, Mwanza, Kagera, Kigoma,
Tabora, Manyara, Shinyanga, Simiyu, Morogoro, Iringa, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, Tanga, Mbeya,
Rukwa, Katavi, Ruvuma, Njombe, Pwani, Mtwara and Lindi regions.The project supported the
training of the QDS farmers groups and Subject Matter Specialist (SMS) from the districts. In
totality, 60 QDS farmers from 12 irrigation schemes of Mwega (Kilosa), Kitere (Mtwara),
Kinyope (Lindi rural), Ruaha Mbuyuni (Kilolo), Mahiga (Kwimba), Irienyi (Rorya), Soko
(Moshi), Lusu/Ifumba (Nzega), Ruhwiti (Kibondo), Mahenge (Korogwe), Kyakakera (Missenyi)
and Msagali (Mpwapwa) and 78 SMS from 37 districts were trained on how to produce
improved rice seeds. The Fields days/study tours were conducted at Agricultural Research
Institution Trials, Agricultural Seed Agency (ASA) farms and their fellow QDS farms. Farmers
had the chance to see the differences in QDS production against Pre-basic, Basic and Certified
seed production on isolation distance, times of inspection, cares undertaken during harvesting,
storage (pre-processing), processing and post processing storage, packaging and transport/sale;
and sample taking.

29.     In 2010/2011 at ASA Seed farms at Dabaga in Iringa and Msimba and Ilonga ARIs both
in Morogoro 143 farmers (52 female and 91 male) and 23 extension staff participated in the
study tours.In 2011/2012, 162 farmers (70 female and male 92) attended at QDS farmers group
farms in Kondoa, Dodoma, Iringa, Kilosa, Morogoro and Ruangwa in Lindi region.

30.     Business Plan and Market Strategy: The project facilitated the development of two
training guide manuals for QDS producers, Subject Matter Specialists from Morogoro, Dodoma,
Iringa, Njombe, Mtwara and Lindi regions and Ministry of Agriculture Training Institute
(MATI) tutors. The developed manuals are standard teaching materials across the country and
were used to train 63 QDS farmers, 5 District SMSs and 7 MATI tutors. The trained tutors will
in turn use the manual to teach certificate and diploma course in agriculture and horticulture.

31.     Seed Strategy: The Project supported the formulation of seed sub sector development
strategy. The Mission and Vision of the Seed Industry Development Strategy is to ensure timely
availability of high seeds to farmers timely at reasonable prices. TOSCI strengthening. In close
collaboration with East Africa Agriculture Productivity Project (EAAPP), the Project supported
the TOSCI with laboratory and field equipment needed for International Seed Trade Association
(ISTA) certification. Office equipment, scientific instruments and precision tools were
successfully procured by the project.

        1.4    Component 3: Project Management and Monitoring and Impact Evaluation
32.     This component supported project management, coordination and implementation, as
well as monitoring and evaluation activities.

33.    Sub-component 3.1: Project Management. The project was mainly managed by MAFC in
collaboration with MoF and PMO-RALG. The day to day management of the project was carried

                                              37
out by Agriculture Input Section (AIS) of MAFC. Given the scope of the project activities,
National Voucher Steering Committee (NVSC) was formed to guide and coordinate the
implementation of the project. The NVSC was chaired by Permanent Secretary, MAFC, and
consisted of representatives from MoF, PMO-RALG, Directors of relevant MAFC departments,
representatives of national farmer organizations, representatives of agribusinesses that produce
and import inputs, and other representatives of the Private Sector, Civil Society Organizations
(CSOs), Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and NMB. NVSC set the criteria and
guidelines for allocating vouchers at the targeted regions, reviewed and approved annual work
plans, addressed management and project implementation issues. The following was achieved
under the project management:

34.     Voucher Printing and Distribution. Since 2009/2010 more than 6.0 million vouchers were
printed and distributed to 2.5 million farm household in 109 districts of 24 targeted regions.
There were some cases of delay in voucher procurement and arrival in the country that
pretentious timely distribution of vouchers to the farmers especially in those areas that gets early
rains in the seasons. This affected the PDO of timely delivery of inputs to farmers at reduced
costs prior to planting season. Mitigation for this was through the project management doing the
following: (i) in 2010/2011 season project management produced and distributed Certificates of
Confirmation of Receiving input voucher for the Year 2011/12. The certificates were then
replaced by the vouchers when sent to the farmers in targeted villages; and (ii) in 2011/2012 and
2012/2013 season, project management stamped the previous years’ unused voucher and
distributed them to the farmers to meet the planting season. Stamping of unused voucher helped
to distribute timely the inputs to those areas which the planting season starts in between August
and September. The regions which starts the cropping season of Katavi, Kagera, Geita, Mwanza
and Mara and districts of Ileje, Chunya, Mbeya Rural and Rungwe (Mbeya region), Njombe
Rural, Njombe Urban, Makete and Ludewa (Njombe).

35.     Budget and Action plan. Auditing of AFSP Implementation, meetings. The project
management team prepared budget and action plan to ensure that the project is implemented
effectively. The budget and action plan was presented to the NVSC for approval before including
in the MAFC budget. Quarterly and annual project progress reports on financial and physical
achievements of the project were prepared and submitted to WB and MoF. Auditing of the
project implementation was carried out and audit reports including internal, external and special
performance audit were prepared as was planned in the project document. Meetings were
organized and conducted by the project management to discuss the implementation of the project
as planned. Project management team successfully held two meetings in each year with the
project review mission.
36.     Environmental Safeguards. The project complied with environment safeguards by (i)
preparing a simplified Integrated Nutrient Management Plan (INMP) guideline in Kiswahili
language and distributing it to farmers to enhance safe handling and proper application of inputs,
particularly fertilizer that was provided through subsidy; and (ii) conducting a quantitative
assessment on the impacts of chemical fertilizer use on groundwater quality in and around
villages receiving larger numbers of vouchers in 2013. The assessment report showed that there
was no evidence of groundwater contamination associated with fertilizer application. In that
case, the project’s overall safeguard compliance was rated satisfactory.

37.      Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM). Two technical meetings were held in
Tanga and Iringa to bring together Soil Scientists (researchers) from the Department of Research
and Development (DRD) of MAFC to review work that was done and to conclude AFSP
activities. The meetings deliberated and provided adapted ISFM recommendations to farmers in
the high potential zones for maize and rice production, as well as defined strategies for
improving dissemination of research findings to the farmers. Results on 14 research projects that
were carried out to verify fertilizer technologies such as optimum rates of fertilizers to apply,
agronomic effectiveness of various P sources and residual P from different sources were
presented. Thirteen (13) titles for promotion of technologies were also presented. These covered
use of Minjingu Rock Phosphate, use of combined organic and inorganic fertilizers as well as
conservation of soil and water for enhanced crop yields.

38.     Procurement of Goods and Services. Procurement activities under the project were
mainstreamed in the government system and managed by the Procurement Management Unit
(PMU) of MAFC. There have been inefficiencies in processing the procurement activities due
long procedures of procurement and vetting of contracts by the Attorney General Chamber
(AGC). During the full course of implementation, the project was troubled by procurement
delays. As a result of this, in 2012, MAFC requested a one year extension of original credit (CR
4619) so as to complete pending procurement activities. The original project was scheduled to
close in June 2012. Also in September 2013 mission, the MAFC requested a further extension of
the original grant (CR 4619) to June 30, 2014 in order to complete the procurement of irrigation
equipment for two seed production facilities. Despite the procurement delays, the project
managed to complete procurement activities under works, goods and consultant services.

39.      Goods, Works, Consultancy Services. The following goods were procured and delivered
to (i) research and laboratory equipment; (ii) irrigation equipment for research; (iii) equipment
for three research stations (Selian – Arusha, Ilonga – Morogoro and Uyole – Mbeya); (iv) seed
treatment equipment for QDS; (v) supply of scientific instruments and tools, supply of precision
tools, weights and measures for TOSCI; (vi) supply of four wheel drive vehicle; and (vii) supply
of two (2) seed processing plants. The project completed borehole drilling and testing at Msimba
and Arusha seed farm; rehabilitation of offices and warehouse at Msimba seed farm and
Installation of irrigation system at Msimba Seed Farm in Morogoro and Arusha seed farm.
Contracts for the following consultancies were executed: (i) Seed Strategy/Incentive/Policy and
Regulatory Framework; (ii) Impact Evaluation on NAIVS (1st and 2nd Round); and (iii) Seed
Enterprises Development and Business Plan; and Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
for the project. Annex 11 summarizes the completed procurement activities under AFSP.

40.    Sub-component 3.2 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Monitoring of AFSP
implementation was carried out at all levels to ensure effective execution of planned activities.
Monitoring was carried out by MAFC staff in collaboration with members of NAIVS steering
committee that included representatives from MAFC, TASTA, TANADA, CSOs, CBOs, PMO-
RALG and NMB. The main accomplishment of this component was baseline impact assessments
which assured the management team of the success of the input subsidy targeting and provided
an independent measure of the yield gains being achieved. The first round project impact
assessments was carried out in 2010 and the second round was carried out on 2013. Both reports
were submitted to WB and MAFC. The Important thing revealed from impact assessment among

                                               39
others include maize and rice production gains and participating farmers graduating from NAIVS
continue commercial purchase and use improved seed and fertilizers. Seed and fertilizer
suppliers also report rising commercial (non-subsidized) sales of improved seed and fertilizer.

Way forward

41.     The following suggestions aim to inform on the opportunities for better agricultural
inputs access and use by the farmers.

Enhanced agricultural credit for inputs

42.     Interest has been expressed in the option of providing subsidized credit to farmers
graduating from the NIAVS program. Little commercial credit currently flows to the agricultural
sector, and interest rates are high, because agricultural lending is risky. Repayment rates depend
on weather, variable product prices, and the willingness of farmers to return borrowed money.
There is growing interest in various insurance products to offset weather related risks. Price risks
may be arbitraged in futures markets. Lenders have long been experimenting with group lending
and liability to offset the risks of side selling, or farmers who simply seek to avoid repaying their
loans.

43.     The results of these initiatives continue to show that agricultural credit works most
reliably in well defined, single channel supply chains. The ideal case is to sell through a single
channel such as NFRA prior to the payment of the farmer. Lending is more risky when the
contracted commodity may be sold through multiple channels as for tobacco and or cotton.
Group liability may significantly reduce lending risk in narrower supply chains.

Provision of Starter Seed Packs

44.     The distribution of starter packs of improved OPV of food crops provides an excellent
way to quickly raise productivity and food security of poorer farm households. The major
advantage of the OPV is the seed only needs to be provided once. If farmers like the variety, they
can readily select seed from their harvest for replanting the next season. If these varieties offer
only a ten percent yield gain, the investment costs in seed production and distribution can be
fully paid in the first year. Productivity gains in the following years are essentially free. This can
be achieved through provision of approximately two kilograms of OPV grain seed, and one
kilogram of OPV legume seed to enhance household nutrition. This program could be extended
to encompass vegetative multiplied crops such as cassava, sweet potato and banana.

45.     Ideally, this program should contract commercial seed companies to produce and deliver
free seed to farmers. This would encourage a continuing expansion in wholesale to retail supply
chains, even if the seed is initially delivered for free. Over time, farmers should become
accustomed to looking for new varieties in their local retail shops.

Provision of Small Pack Seed Sales




                                                 40
46.     Farmers should be encouraged to consistently look for, and invest in, better seed
varieties. Many crop varieties on the national registration list remain unknown to most farmers as
are inadequately commercially multiplied for sale. Some are multiplied, but only sold in a few,
limited parts of the country. MAFC in collaboration with LGAs and Private Sector should
promote broader awareness of newly released varieties by establishing demonstrations linked
with commercial sale of small packs of the new seed.

47.     The value of this exercise is enhanced if linked with a careful survey of farmer
preferences for alternative grain and plant traits. The results of this survey - an explanation of
farmer preferences, as well as the priority farmers attach to different traits when selecting a
variety, can be integrated back into national breeding programs.

Promoting adoption of chemical fertilizer

48.      While some of the graduates from the NAIVS have continued to purchase chemical
fertilizer after the subsidy programme others are not. This is attributed by the small yield
possibly because the fertilizer was wrongly applied, or the nutrient mix was inappropriate for
their soils and some farmers simply do not have the cash available at the right time to purchase
fertilizer. Several fertilizer companies have responded to this problem by starting to sell smaller
bags of fertilizer for example, in 5, 10 or 25 kilogram bags rather than the standard 50 kilogram
bag. In addition, several companies are working to better target fertilizer to local soil conditions.

49.     Farmers should also be given more advice on how best to apply smaller doses. More
grain can be produced if for example, 10 kilograms of urea is spread in small doses (e.g. a bottle
cap dose) over one-third an acre than over two-tenths of an acre. This implies the need to shift
the orientation of many extension programs including those commonly found in farmer field
schools. MAFC in collaboration with LGAs and Public Sector should help farmers with
alternative fertilizers and with, at least initially, smaller fertilizer doses.

Increasing input use through improved market efficiency

50.     There are several ways input sales can be made more reliable. One is to encourage bulk
purchases of seed and fertilizer allowing volume discounts on both commodity and transport
costs. Another is to promote input sales at the same time farmers are selling their agricultural
products when they have cash in hand. A third option is to encourage electronic payments
through mobile money transfer systems. These could be linked with efforts to encourage the
commitment of remittances to input purchase, or savings tied with future delivery.

51.     Public support has a larger role to play in promoting the improvement of farm-gate prices
for basic staples. National grain markets tend to be highly seasonal, with prices just after harvest
often 30 to 50 percent lower than the prices for the same commodities six months later. These
markets are also characterized by large differentials between farm-gate and wholesale prices
resulting from limited trade competition at the farm-gate, and the high costs of assembling many
small lots of grain. When farmers receive a low price for their crop, they have less incentive to
invest in improved inputs, and less capacity to do so.



                                                 41
52.     Public investment in village warehousing offers the opportunity to bulk commodity for
sale by the truckload, rather than by the bag. Warehouse storage allows farmers to take
advantage of seasonality of prices by selling later in the harvest season. Finally, in order to
increase trade competitiveness at the village level, truck or warehouse lots may be transparently
auctioned on the regional or national market. This may take the form of a simple mobile phone
based auction whereby a pre-defined group of traders receives an SMS offering the opportunity
to bid on a truckload of grain by a designated deadline. The public investment may support
building or refurbishment of a warehouse, the provision of training in warehouse management,
the licensing of traders willing to participate in the commodity auction, or the monitoring of the
system to assure the trade is transparent.

53.   If these farmers find maize and rice production to be more profitable, they will invest
more in improved seed, fertilizer and other farming inputs. The growth of productivity will
improve the competitiveness of Tanzania’s grain on regional markets.
