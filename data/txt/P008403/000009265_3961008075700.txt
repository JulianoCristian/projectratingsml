MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA
FOR AN AGRICULTURE PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed single currency loan to the Republic of Estonia for the equivalent of US $15.3 million (DEM
22 million) to help finance a project for the development of the agriculture sector of the Estonian
economy. The loan would be payable in seventeen years, including five years grace, at a LIBOR-based
variable interest rate.
2.           Country/Sector Background. Since regaining independence in August 1991, Estonia has
followed an open and liberal reforrn path. It has successfully stabilized its currency, and has liberalized
all agricultural commodity prices, while creating competitive markets based on minimal barriers of entry,
and free internal and external trade. After declining in 1992 and 1993, real output in Estonia began to
recover in 1994 and an annual growth of about 5% is projected for 1995 and 1996. The unemployment
rate (adjusted for job seekers) has decreased from between 8% to 9% in 1993 to around 6% in the fourth
quarter of 1995. After a sharp decline in 1992, real wages have increased broadly in line with
productivity. Annual inflation has continued to decline reaching 48% in 1994 and falling further to 29%
in 1995.
3.           The recovery of output is underpinned by sound economic policies. The stability of the
currency is being supported by monetary and fiscal policies consistent with the operations of the country's
currency board arrangement. Estonia's current account reports a deficit of about 6% of GDP in the first
three quarters of 1995, according to official Estonian statistics. The current account deficit results from
a large deficit of the trade balance which is partly compensated by a substantial surplus on services.
However, capital inflows in the first three quarters of 1995 exceed the current account deficit and the
reserves of the Bank of Estonia have risen every year since the currency reform. External trade and
payments policies are liberal, with no tariff or non-tariff barriers. Sectoral policies are aimed at creating
and supporting a viable private sector and especially the service sector has developed rapidly.
Privatization of former state-owned enterprises and non-land properties has nearly been completed.
Urban and rural land properties are being restituted to their former owners, however, this process has
been slower than expected.
4.           Agriculture in Estonia is dominated by dairy and livestock production. Even though
livestock production has decreased considerably during the transition period, this sector presents the
highest competitive potential for Estonian agriculture. Crop production focuses on feed grains and fodder
crops for the livestock sector. It is estimated that agricultural production decreased by about 40% from
1991 to 1993, resulting in a similar contraction of the agricultural labor force. In 1994 the sector
accounted for about 9% of GDP, contributed 15% of exports, and employed about 6% of the Estonian
labor force.
5.           Following its general liberal economic and trade policies, Estonia's agricultural strategy
has been to create an open competitive agricultural sector based on private ownership of land, a private
agro-processing sector, liberal agricultural trade policies, fully market determined agricultural prices, and
targeted budget support for the agricultural and rural sector. Although proceeding slowly and with
difficulty, Estonia has continued to restitute and privatize land. The privatization of agro-processing
enterprises is nearly complete, and the companies are in the process of adapting to the market economy.
Since 1992, agricultural price policy has been completely market determined. There are no import or
export tariffs regulating agricultural trade, and Estonia has entered a number of trade agreements with
the EU and the EFTA countries. The Governmnent of Estonia (GOE) supports the rural economy through



- 2 -
a credit fund and the implicit annual rural credit subsidy has been estimated to be about US $1.0 million
to date.
6.            Estonia is embarking on the next stage of improving it's rural institutions after having
nearly completed the transition to a market economy with minimal market distortions. Unlike other
countries of the former Soviet Union, the GOE has a well developed agricultural sector policy, and is
now in a position to effectively use public investments to rehabilitate rural infrastructure (including the
deteriorating farm drainage systems), promote the transfer to private ownership, improve agricultural
technology dissemination to the evolving private farms, promote rural entrepreneurship, and strengthen
the sector's public institutions.
7.            The slow transfer of rural and agricultural land to private owners and the slow title
registration impairs the development of a land market and the use of land as collateral for mortgage loans.
This is mainly due to the time consuming physical restitution of land and to difficulties in the
development of the legal framework, institutional arrangements, and technical capacities. Up to
December 1995, of the around 4.5 million ha of agricultural and forest land, only about 220,000 ha and
180,000 ha have been registered in the cadastre and title book respectively. A large part of the arable
land remains under state ownership after the end of the first phase of the restitution process because
owners not interested in farming have chosen non-land compensation. Considerable changes in farm
structures, including the downsizing of large cooperative farms and the emergence of family farms, are
currently underway. All collective farms have been restructured into joint stock companies and about
10,000-15,000 family farms are operating in Estonia. Of those farmers who have chosen to enter private
family farming, the ownership of only a small fraction have been formally registered in the title books.
8.            Project Objectives. The Project objectives are to increase rural incomes and to stimulate
the rural economy through rural entrepreneurship. To achieve these objectives, the Project focuses on
improving factor productivity and competitiveness of agricultural products by providing assistance for the:
(a) privatization of rural lands; (b) privatization and rehabilitation of select rural infrastructure; (c)
improvement of human resources skills for entrepreneurship in rural areas; (d) introduction of new
farming technologies consistent with transformed private agriculture; and (e) improvement in food quality.
The Project's objectives and strategies support the implementation of the GOE's rural sector policies.
9.            Project Description. The proposed Project is comprised of the components noted below.
Additional technical assistance, supportive to the Project is being separately funded by donors.
(a)    Land Reform. Accelerating the land reform by preparing a state rural land disposal study
to expedite the transfer of state-owned rural land to the private sector through sale or
lease; carrying out surveys to complete the National Geodetic Network; and carrying out
land surveys through private surveying companies to register rural lands in the land
cadastre, especially in areas where the drainage system will be rehabilitated.
(b)    Farm Drainage Rehabilitation. Rehabilitating the drainage infrastructure by improving the
capacity of existing' farmland drainage with extensive farmers' participation through: (i)
rehabilitation of existing drainage systems of about 60,000 ha; (ii) technical assistance
to organize farmers in about 60 Land and Water Associations (LWAs) with the
responsibility for future operations and maintenance of the drainage system; and (iii)
development of an adaptive research program for reduction of maintenance costs and
environmental protection.
No new drainage systems will be funded under the project.



- 3 -
(c)    Land Use Management. Improving environmental protection by formulating a Strategy
for Wetlands Management; carrying out environmental screening of sites for, and
monitoring of, the drainage rehabilitation works; and carrying out an environmental study
on future drainage investments.
(d)    Agricultural Advisory Services. Introducing new farming technologies by establishing
the Private Advisory Services Development Fund2 (PASDF) to provide eligible farmers
with temporary and partial funding to contract private sector advisory services in farming
and rural business; strengthening of the private and publicly funded extension services
through training and technical assistance to develop educational programs on improved
agricultural practices; and support for selected rural information centers with equipment
and technical assistance to assist the rural population with advice on alternative non-farm
employment.
(e)    Food Quality Control and Veterinary Laboratory.   Improving food quality by
strengthening the state-owned veterinary and food control laboratories with laboratory
equipment for the quality control of Estonian food and livestock products; and training
of the staff of the food and veterinary control facilities.
(f)    Project Management3. Support to Project management activities and Bank-related
administration requirements, primarily accounting, procurement, disbursement,
monitoring, and evaluation.
10.           Program  Objective Categories.  This Project falls under the private sector and
environmentally sustainable development categories.
11.           Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. Previous Bank involvement
in project implementation has included a 1992 Rehabilitation Loan (US $30.0 million, completely
disbursed and now closed), a Highway Maintenance Loan for US $12 million in 1994, a District Heating
Rehabilitation Loan for US $38.4 million in 1994, a Health Project in 1995 for US $18 million, and a
Financial Institutions Development Project in 1995 for US $10 million (all effective and under
implementation), and the recently approved Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project (April 25,
1995). Experience in implementing these projects has shown that it is important at the initial stages of
project implementation to fully train the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staff in project management
and supervision, financial management, and competitive procurement procedures.  In general,
implementation of projects in Estonia has been satisfactory. It is planned to create a joint PIU for the
implementation of the Bank's, EU (Phare)'s and other donor programs in agriculture and to extensively
train the staff in management, procurement, and monitoring & evaluation.
12.           Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project is consistent with the Bank's overall
Country Assistance Strategy,4 which proposes to support the development of a dynamic private sector,
improve the existing public infrastructure, and alleviate the pockets of poverty that have developed during
the transition process, in order to raise overall living standards. The Bank's strategy focuses on
2      Donor-funded projects providing training to upgrade the present agricultural extension service and private sector
advisors.

improving the environment for private sector investments and growth, and improving public infrastructure
services. The Bank has assisted the GOE to develop an agriculture sector strategy through the
preparation of the Agricultural and Forestry Sector Review for Estonia5 and the preparation of this
Project. This sector review highlights key strategy elements for the development of the sector: efficiency
improvements in primary agricultural production; development of agricultural advisory services;
agricultural marketing improvements; and rapid completion of land reform. The Sector Review notes
that low wages, low land costs, and the existing stock of skills, equipment, and productive infrastructure
provide Estonia with a competitive potential in dairy and beef production. This competitiveness has
already been demonstrated on a limited scale by some transformed farms and food processing industries.
In general, the GOE's agricultural policy reflects these objectives, although progress with the land reform
has been slower than expected.
13.          The Bank supports the MOA's strategy to ease key bottlenecks in the agricultural sector,
e.g.: land reform, deferred maintenance of rural infrastructure (drainage), development of agricultural
advisory services, and improvement of food quality control. The Project would therefore strengthen the
private sector, improve the MOA's policy and regulatory functions, and support a gradual transfer of non-
essential Government functions to the private sector. The Project investments support key Government
regulatory functions (food quality control, environmental regulation in agriculture) and the gradual
transfer of some government functions to the private sector (land reform, drainage maintenance, advisory
services). The Project assists the MOA in rehabilitating and privatizing farm drainage infrastructure by
handing over the responsibility for future operation and maintenance to the beneficiaries. Furthermore,
the Project supports the development of a private farmer-financed advisory service to complement a core
Government funded, modestly-sized, agricultural extension service. These are investments of either a
public good dimension, or necessary to support the emerging private sector and reduce recurrent
Government expenditures.
14.          Poverty Category. A poverty category, as defined in the Bank's guidelines, is not
applicable because the Project does not directly target the poor. However, the Project addresses rural
poverty indirectly, through "preventative" interventions. It actively pursues the establishment of efficient
small farms (through extension advice and drainage rehabilitation), the creation of rural employment
opportunities outside agriculture, and the establishment of a viable agricultural services sector.
15.          Environmental Aspects. The Project's environmental review was consistent with the
requirements of Estonian Governmental Regulation No. 314 of November 1992, concerning the
"Environmental Impact Assessment" and with the Bank's own requirements. A number of governmental
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including the Matsalu State Nature Reserve, the Estonia
Fund for Nature, and the Stockholm Environment Institute -Tallinn have been consulted during Project
preparation to ensure a sound environmental design of the Project. A field-based review of environmental
aspects of the proposed Project was prepared with the participation of the MOE. The MOE has
confirmed to the Bank that all Project components correspond to the environment regulations of Estonia.
The farm drainage rehabilitation component is in the Bank's category "B" and activities to be supported
under these components would be subject to environmental screening and review during the investment
period consistent with procedures jointly developed by the MOE and the World Bank with input from
NGOs. An Environmental Impact Assessment has been completed for a pilot drainage site and the
conclusions have been discussed with the MOE and MOA and environmental NGOs. All other Project
components have been placed in category "C." The MOE plans to have the Wetlands Management
Strategy Study include preparation of an environmental impact assessment consistent with Estonian
5      Report # 13316-EE, May 16, 1995.

procedures to allow for consideration of environmental issues in the design of wetland strategies and to
provide an effective forum for public participation.
16.          Participatory Approach. The preparation of the Project has involved representatives of
the GOE, local authorities, environmental NGOs, and outside experts in preparing detailed
implementation plans for each component. In addition, through technical assistance and the Bank's own
staff efforts,6 the participatory approach has been introduced for the design of the drainage rehabilitation
works, and for the formation of the LWAs. The Project will ensure that the farmers, organized in
LWAs, will be involved throughout the process, assisting in the design, and contributing to the
implementation of the rehabilitation works. The Project would utilize this participatory approach in the
development of the National Agricultural Extension Plan. This involvement of stakeholders (farmers,
advisors, and environmental groups) in the design of both the drainage and the agricultural advisory
systems could result in new grass roots farmers' organizations (LWAs) developing a range of additional
services to members such as input supply, machinery pools,' marketing, and possibly credit.
17.          Project Implementation. The overall coordination would be handled by a Project
Steering Committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the Ministry of
Environment (MOE), and their implementing line agencies, and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The
individual components would be implemented by line departments of the MOA and the MOE who have
prepared the respective components. The implementing line departments would be supported by a joint
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the MOA assisting both the Agriculture Project and EU (Phare)'s
agricultural assistance program in procurement, disbursement, monitoring & evaluation, project
administration and supervision of Project implementation. This joint PIU, which effectively continues
and widens the tasks of the currently operating EU (Phare) PIU, would be established in early 1996 and
financed by EU (Phare). In the meantime the implementing agencies are directly supported by the Bank.
A central public procurement advisory service, bilaterally funded by the Government of Finland, has been
established by the GOE to provide general assistance in procurement.
18.          Single Currency Loan.  The GOE is eligible for single currency loans under the
expanded SCL program for 100% of its anticipated FY96 lending program of US $15.3 million
equivalent. The Borrower informed the Bank during negotiations that it wishes to borrow in a single
currency (DEM) at a variable LIBOR-based interest rate for the proposed Project. The Estonian
delegation justified the choice of a single currency loan by stating that most of Estonian's loans are
LIBOR-based to ensure that the country does not pay higher than market rates at any point in time. In
addition, Estonian's currency is pegged to the Deutsche Mark.
19.          Agreed Actions. Prior to negotiations, the Borrower has provided proof of appointments
of the two Joint Project Directors, and the MOE Project Coordinator. At negotiations it was agreed, that:
(a) by June 30, 1996, the cadastre registration of Est-survey shall be transferred to the Land Board; (b)
by March 30, 1996, the Borrower shall initiate studies to the formulate a national policy for the transfer
of ownership of state-owned rural and farming lands to private individuals and companies; (c) by June
30, 1996, the cadastre registration activities of Est-Survey shall be transferred to the National Land
Board; (d) the Borrower before commencement of the drainage rehabilitation works on any drainage site,
shall: (i) register in the cadastre all lands at that specific drainage site to benefit from drainage
rehabilitation under the Project and (ii) make available all such state-owned agricultural lands for purchase
or lease; (e) the members of the LWA benefiting from the drainage rehabilitation shall contribute 20%
6     Including use of the Fund for Innovative Approaches in Human and Social Development (FIASH).

of the costs of the drainage rehabilitation works either in cash or by providing labor; (f) investments for
drainage rehabilitation would be made on those sites that meet the agreed selection criteria; (g) by May
31, 1996, the PASDF would be established and the manager appointed; (h) the Bank should be consulted
on all Terms of Reference for all consulting services; and (i) by June 30, 1996, the Borrower would
establish a Contract Administration Unit in the Land Board. As a Condition of Board Presentation the
Borrower submitted the bidding documents and the pre-qualification criteria for the technical services
(land surveys) to the Bank for review. Conditions of effectiveness would include the condition that the
Borrower has: (a) promulgated as official regulations the environmental screening criteria and procedures
applicable to all drainage rehabilitation works in the borrower's territory; (b) appointed: the Chairman
and members of the Project Steering Committee; the Project Manager; and the staff of the PIU; (c) made
adequate allocations for the Project in the budget for the year 1996; and (d) MOA would have expanded
the participation in the NAETF to fully reflect the wide diversity of stakeholder interests, and provided
the NAETF with a secretariat consisting of a manager, staff, an operating budget, and terms of reference.
As a Condition of disbursement the Borrower would have: (a) presented to the Bank a standardized
contract format for agricultural advisors' services, and the selection criteria for agricultural advisors to
be eligible under PASDF (for agricultural advisory services); and (b) published the tender for
privatization of at least five of Est-Survey's regional land survey offices or terminated Est-Survey's
commercial land survey activities, and contracted all publicly funded property surveys to private
surveyors under competitive bidding procedures (for technical services).
20.           Project Benefits. The major benefits are: (a) accelerated development of a rural land
market; (b) increased agricultural production and farm income in the drainage rehabilitation areas; (c)
improved farmer information on new farning technologies and farm management practices; (d)
development of grassroots rural institutions; (e) improved food and livestock quality standards to protect
consumers and increase export potential of food and livestock products to the EU; (f) protection of the
environment through environmental controls in agriculture, drainage, and wetlands management; and (g)
the revitalization and development of farms, rural services and enterprises that would create additional
employment opportunities in rural areas.
21.           A farm model analysis shows that the Project investments in drainage rehabilitation and
private extension would, if complemented by privately financed on-farm investments in farm assets,
increase farm incomes by about 40% after two years, compared to a "without Project" situation. The
ERR of the farm model analysis is estimated at 16%. A separate ERR has been calculated for the farm
drainage rehabilitation component and is estimated at 23 %. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrate the
potential benefits of the land reform and food quality control component separately.
22.           Project Sustainability. The Project components where sustainability is a potential issue
are: land reform, farm drainage rehabilitation, and agricultural extension.
(a)    Land Reform.  The GOE is in the process of changing laws and procedures to
significantly lower the land survey and registration costs to the GOE and to land reform
beneficiaries and to speed up the land reform and ownership transfers. The GOE is
currently clarifying responsibilities and simplifying procedures and regulations.
(b)    Farm Drainage Rehabilitation. The Project would ensure extensive farmer participation
and assist in the establishment of LWAs. The members of the LWA would contribute
about 20% to the drainage rehabilitation cost as cash or an in-kind contribution to the
rehabilitation works. LWAs would be fully responsible for all future operations and
maintenance of rehabilitated drainage systems. Only drainage systems on lands with a
high productivity would be rehabilitated by the MOA to ensure that farmers can afford



to maintain the drainage system. In addition environmental procedures and criteria for
site selection are being developed to ensure the sustainability of rehabilitated sites.
(c)    Agricultural Advisory Services. It is the GOE's intention that within a three to five year
period the majority of extension services directly addressing farmers would be provided
on a fee basis by private sector agricultural and business advisors. A small public sector
funded agricultural advisory group is expected to continue to deal with special problems
of public education in agriculture that are in the national interest.
23.           Risks. The main risks and the actions taken to mitigate them are:
Risk:         The commitment and ability of the farmers to pay their share for rehabilitation and to
undertake the fullfunding offuture operations and the maintenance of their rehabilitated
drainage systems.
Mitigation:    LWA formation is the key mitigating factor; both the MOA staff and group facilitators
have been trained in the participatory approach to group formation; LWA formation will
have at its core the development of the group's mutual interest in the continuing operation
of the drainage system; experience from other countries shows that mutual-interest
LWAs do work, and that group social pressure does contribute to coherence and the
fulfillment of obligations; no investment in rehabilitation at any site would be undertaken
if the LWA has not been formed and is not committed to contributing its share of the
rehabilitation costs and to undertaking all future maintenance.
Risk:         Iffarmers are unwilling to pay their share of rehabilitation costs, field investments would
be delayed, and possibly a portion of the loan commitment would not be utilized.
Mitigation:    Formation of LWAs to receive the loan-funded rehabilitation has been ongoing for about
a year prior to Project effectiveness; target farmers (i.e. only those with good soils) are
aware that without rehabilitation they would not achieve the required productivity to be
profitable; the costs of contribution by the farmers is affordable from the post-investment
incremental benefits, as investment cost is limited to EEK 1,500/ha, of which the farmer
would pay 20%, much of which would be in kind, with the balance from cash or a
credit.
Risk:         Farmers are not willing to pay for private advisory services.
Mitigation:    Farmers would be initiated into the "for-pay" system through the GOE grant partial
payment for agricultural advisory services, resulting in both familiarization with this
system and permitting changes in design depending on the farmer responses; farmers and
advisors would be represented on the National Agricultural Extension Task Force and the
design of the private service would be responsive to client needs; private agricultural
advisory services would be targeted only at those farmers with higher income potentials;
those farmers not willing or unable to pay, for private extension advice would continue
to be served by the public extension service, at a lower frequency of contacts, but only
with public domain technical information (i.e. no commnercial and business advice).
Risk:         Implementation of land reform will continue to be slow.
Mitigation:    The GOE has committed substantial budget resources in addition to the loan amount to
undertake land surveys in the areas benefitting from drainage rehabilitation and in the
rural areas in general; the policy study on disposal of State-owned rural lands should set
the GOE's future action plans; strong political willingness of the present government to
move land reforms as fast as possible; strong desire by all sectors of the population to
gain land titles; donor assistance with strengthening institutional capacities and developing
associated legal reforms.
Risk:         A longer implementation period than planned would be required, due to limited local
implementation capacity and extensive farmers 'participation.



- 8 -
Mitigation:    Pre-launch training in participation techniques; donor assisted technical assistance for the
advisory service already in the field; the longer term benefits of assuring stakeholder
participation and ownership justifies the risk of a slower implementation schedule: the
project implementation schedule has taken into account a realistic time period for the
effective development of stakeholder participation and ownership.
Risk:         The private sector would not complement the Project investments with privately financed
investments.
Mitigation:    Training and advisory services promoting investment opportunities and explaining
financing possibilities supported through technical assistance would assist the private
sector with investments. Registration of secure, transferable and mortgageable land titles
would facilitate the use of land as a collateral for long-term loans. The economic
analysis shows satisfactory benefits of the proposed investments even in the (unlikely)
absence of complementary investments.
24.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
