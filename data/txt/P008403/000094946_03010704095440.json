outcome is highly\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, with substantial\n            institutional development impacts. Although project\n            preparation, and appraisal took longer than anticipated, it\n            proved essential in ensuring full agreement between the\n            Borrower and the Bank on issues related to project\n            objectives, content, and design. In line with the above,\n            lessons demonstrate that the Borrower's sustained\n            commitments, and the Bank's readiness to adjust\n            implementation arrangements, were instrumental for the\n            success of the project, particularly so for the land survey\n            program, drainage rehabilitation, and advisory services\n            components. Nonetheless, assumptions regarding the impact of\n            transition to a market economy, as it regards the evolving\n            structure of the rural economy proved inaccurate, suggesting\n            forecasts be regarded as transient. Evolution of the framing\n            sector was faster than foreseen, with implications for the\n            advisory services component, e.g., responsiveness to the\n            evolving land, and tax policy required modifications in the\n            implementation of the land reform component. However,\n            project experience also shows that effective private-public\n            partnerships can meet satisfactory information needs, with a\n            quick adaptation to changing client characteristics, and needs."}, "docdt": "2002-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
