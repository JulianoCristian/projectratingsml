Punjab is\n            Pakistan\u2019s largest province with a population of 100\n            million, which embodies 60 percent of the country's\n            total population. In the country\u2019s efforts to alleviate\n            poverty, low educational attainment had long been a\n            stumbling block. The International Development Association\n            financed Punjab Education Sector Reform Program was launched\n            in 2003 with the objective of improving access, quality, and\n            governance in the education sector. A number of reforms in\n            teachers\u2019 recruitment and professional development, textbook\n            production, and the examination system were implemented. As\n            a result, net enrollment in primary schools in Punjab has\n            increased from 45 to 62 percent between 2001 and 2007.\n            Female primary net enrollment during the same period\n            increased from 43 to 59 percent and for rural females from\n            38 to 55 percent. The Punjab government has launched a\n            second generation of reforms that focuses on increasing\n            access and completion rates, enhancing the quality of\n            reforms and student learning outcomes, and strengthening\n            school management and sector governance."}, "docdt": "2009-09-29T05:13:05Z"}
