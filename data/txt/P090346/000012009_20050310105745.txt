                              CREDITAND PROGRAMSUMMARY

Borrower:      Islamic Republic o f Palustan

Implementing   Government of Punjab
Agency:

Beneficiary:  Province of Punjab

Amount:        SDR 65.8 million(US$lOO millionequivalent)

Terms:         Standard IDAterms; 35-year maturity with 10-year grace period

Description:  The purpose of this seconddevelopment policy Credit i s to provide financing for the
              Province of Punjab, which has embarked on a wide-ranging reform agenda to
               improve fiscal management, promote devolution and improve service delivery
               starting with education.

              Key pillars of the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) are:              (a)
               public finance reforms to increase public spending for education (and other pro-
               poor services) and to ensure fiscal sustainability; @) reforms that strengthen
               devolution and improve the fiduciary environment and governance; and (c)
               education sector reforms to improve quality, access and sector govemance. The
               Program Document o f the first Punjab Education Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC)
               presented the three year PESRP. There has been steady progress duringthe first year
               of the program which was supported under the first credit, and a number of sector
               initiatives are already beginning to show impact, including promising increases in
               school enrollments.

Benefits:      Before the first credit, PESRP was considered a high-benefit, high-risk program.
               However, the first year of implementation showed a reduction in risk and higher
               benefits than anticipated.    The main benefits come from reversing the slide in
               education indicators, bringing more children into school up to grade 8 (particularly
               poor children and girls) sooner than previously expected, and providing them with
              better quality education. The program would contribute to closing the social gap and
               helpingthe Country progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
              related to poverty reduction and Education For All (EFA). Improvements in
               education outcomes in Punjab, the largest province o f Pakistan, would have a
               countrywide impact, and success could motivate other provinces to follow a similar
              path and undertake sector-wide reforms. Another indirect, but important, benefit i s
              that the program i s strengthening decentralization by increasing the role of districts
               and promoting accountability between service users (parents and students) and
               service providers (schools and teachers).

Risksand       Before the first credit, the major risk expected came from Pakistan's history o f lack
Mitigation     o f sustained political support to the education agenda. The factors mitigating this
Strategy:     riskwere: (a) the PunjabGovernment continues to drive the reformprogramand has
              the full backing o f the provincial Chief Executive; (b) the district govemments
              regular engagement and support for education sector; (c) the increasingrealization in



                                                                                             V

Pakistan o f the strong links between education - particularly girls' education - and
economic growth; and (d) a strong determination to reverse the slide in the
Province's social indicators. Early indications o f program implementation suggest
that these riskmitigating factors were appropriate. However, there i s still an inherent
political risk for the subsequent years that a change in leadership could affect
program momentum or shift priorities. The intensive awareness campaign and early
indications o f enrollment increases have already generated rising expectations among
the public. The risk mitigating measure for the political risk i s the likelihood that
even if there i s a change o f government, there will be continued public pressure to
deliver.
Preliminary outcome data i s showing a rapid increase in enrollments. This can be a
major risk if these expanded numbers overwhelm the system by causing pressure on
the already extended physical infrastructure, and if quality improvements do not
keep up with the increasing numbers o f children entering the public education
system. Factors mitigating this risk are: (a) identifying, through intense monitoring
efforts, areas where schools are experiencing rapid increases in enrollment, and
malung provision o f additional physical facilities and staffing to these schools; (b)
launching a comprehensive professional development program for teachers to
improve quality o f education; (c) launching o f a system for assessing student
learning achievement;        and (d) Government's agreement to increase sector
expenditures inaccordance with the growing demand for education. These mitigating
measures, ifwell implemented, can help inreducingthis risk.

Another major risk was linked to the evolving roles and responsibilities o f the local
governments relative to the Provincial Government, as devolved system o f
government was still gradually taking shape. Factors mitigating this risk were: (a)
the Terms o f Partnership agreements clearly define the roles and responsibilities o f
the provincial and district governments for program implementation; (b) fiscal
decentralization in Punjab i s more advanced than in other provinces; and (c)
compared to other provinces, Punjab has greater alignment between district
governments and the province. The first year's experience proves that this risk still
remains, although the early successes have added to the credibility o f the program.
There is however an inherent political risk as the next local government elections are
scheduled during 2005 and the provincial government would need to develop its
relationshipwith the newly elected governments.

Weak institutional capacity, especially at the district level, to implement and monitor
the program poses another risk.        This risk i s being addressed through the: (a)
appointment o f specially selected Executive District Officer for Education in all
districts; (b) creation o f new positions o f District Monitoring Officers (DMOs) in all
districts; (c) implementation capacity development programs for district staff; and
(d) strengthening district level EMIS capacity. There are potential risks from weak
financial management capacity at the provincial and district level that could hamper
implementation of the reform program. These risks are being mitigated by actions
taken during the first program year and through the progressive implementation o f
parallel financial management reforms.

There is continuing risk that School Councils (SCs) will not be allowed to function
as needed, or they may have weak capacity. This risk has been mitigated by issuing
appropriate financial and administrative guidelines to empower SCs, as well as by
contracting with NGOs for capacity development o f School Councils. During the



                                                                                 V i

               second year, SCs are authorized to receive school-based budgets, for both civil
               works and recurring expenditures. To enable SCs to fulfill these responsibilities,
               parallel capacity support has beenbuilt into the program.

               Overall, given the success o f the first year, the risk rating is moderate for the second
               program year, proposed to be supported under this Second Development Policy
               Credit. Nevertheless, there i s a need to maintain continued vigilance in case o f
               change of priorities and focus at the political level, both at the province and in the
               districts.

                                          I.OVERVIEW

1.        The Punjab EducationDevelopment Policy Credit (PEDPC-II) would be the second' o f a
series of three development policy Credits to support the Government of Punjab's three year
education sector reform program (PESRP) to enhance access, improve quality o f education, and
improve gender parity inPunjab, Palustan's largest province. The programwas supported during
the first year through the US$ 100 million Punjab Education Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC),
which was approved by the Board on February 10,2004. The proposed Credit would support the
program's second year that builds upon impressive progress achieved during the first year o f the
reformprogram.

2.        Key pillars o f the Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) are: (a) public
finance reforms to increase public spending for education (and other pro-poor services) and to
ensure fiscal sustainability; (b) reforms that strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary
environment and governance; and (c) education sector reforms to improve quality, access and
sector governance. The Program Document o f the first Punjab Education Sector Adjustment
Credit (PESAC) presented the three year PESRP. The Bank's support for the first program year
was approved based on the strong prior actions taken by the Government. The Government of
Punjab's performance during the first program year has been impressive and a number o f
initiatives are already beginning to show impact. The reforms are beingimplemented on a faster
track than anticipated duringthe preparation o f the first credit. Key achievements inthe first year
o f the program are presentedbelow.

3.        Government commitment to reform is evident in its early and successful
implementation of first phase reforms. Most o f the monitoring targets agreed under the first
Credit have been exceeded. Even more importantly in critical areas, reforms are ahead o f the
original plan. The provincial education department i s beingrestructured to make it better aligned
to the reformprogram. Liberalization o f textbook production has moved ahead o f plan with the
largest production book, the Kindergarten primer, contracted out to the private sector for
development and production through an open competitive process. On time distribution of
approximately 10 million free textbooks was made to more than 85% o f primary school students.
Approximately 175,000 girls have receivedregular installment o f monthly stipends to encourage
retention and to increase enrollments in elementary grades. To promote these reforms, the first
phase of an education awareness campaign targeting the people through print and electronic
media was implemented to disseminate information about the program and its major
interventions. Political commitment and ownership has been maintained as evidenced by: a) the
establishment of a high level Provincial Program Steering Committee, directly reporting to the
Chief Minister, with the mandate for policy development and implementation reviews; and b)
increases to the FY05 education budget in accordance with the agreed Medium Term Budget
Framework (MTBF).

4.        Preliminary school census data suggests promising increases in enrollments during
the first year of the program. School census data collected by the program in October 2004


' The  1'' Credit (PESAC), was approvedprior to the issuance o f the new guidelines which changed the
AdjustmentCredits to DevelopmentPolicyLendingCredits.


                                                                                                    1

shows an overall 13% increase inenrollments inprimary schools and 20% increase in enrollment
o f girls in grades 6-8 in fifteen l o w literacy districts o f Punjab. This is especially noteworthy as
this enrollment surge has come about after the onset o f many o f PESRP inputs since February
2004, such as free textbooks for primary school students, stipends for girls enrolled in grades 6-8,
appointment o f teachers in schools that were closed due to lack o f teachers, and improvements in
physical infrastructure. An independent thirdparty validation exercise has been commissionedto
confirm and validate the findings o f the school census. Although it i s still early, the emerging
outcomes are encouraging and appear to reverse a ten year trend o f only 1.5% annual increase in
enrollments inpublic schools.2 The Punjab Government i s taking steps to ensure retention and i s
taking actions to appraise additional infkastructure and staffing requirements, and i s committed to
monitoring progress very closely to keep accurate assessment o f the trends.

5.        An education monitoring system, led by the Program Monitoring and
Implementation Unit (PMIU) of the Department of Education, has been established under
PESRP. The Government has established a credible system for program monitoring and
evaluation. Rigorous routine monitoring efforts at the provincial and district levels are being
supplemented by third party validation exercises to verify program inputs and progress.
Evaluation o f program activities to gauge progress towards achievement o f outcomes i s being
undertaken through third party surveys and impact studies that are currently underway. Further
analytical work, supported by the World Bank is ongoing, such as a teacher management study
and a study o f public private partnerships in education (see paragraph 64). The results o f these
studies will inform further policy development for the program.

6.        Participation of stakeholders, including civil society organizations, district
governments, district and local level department staff, among others was key to the
developmentof the reformprogram. An extensive consultation process was undertaken during
the design o f the reform program, and continuing dialogue with stakeholders forms an integral
part o f PESRP.     Several focus groups have been held with Executive District Officers (EDOs),
teachers, local elected officials, and NGOs. Dialogues have also been held between the Punjab
Government and the media for wider dissemination o f the objectives o f the PESRP and the
critical interventions. The provincial Government recognizes that these types o f consultations are
key in helping to improve the program, taking course corrections, and to build greater ownership
o f the reforms.

7.        An integral part of the reformhas beenthe clarification of government roles under
the decentralizationprogram and the introduction of incentivesto improve service delivery.
These reforms are embodied inthe Terms of Partnership (TOP) agreements between the district
and provincial governments, which were initiated for the first time in Palustan.                 The TOP
improves the transparency and efficiency in the financing and management o f the education
sector by clearly defining the responsibilities and obligations o f districts and the province in
planning, implementing and monitoring the education system and use o f funds, and also provides
financial and performance based incentives for districts to improve their education service
delivery. Finally, the TOP agreements include very specific annually updated targets for each
district including input, output and outcome targets.




  These figures do not take into account enrollments in the private sector and reflect only public sector
enrollments. However, it should be noted that during the past decade there has been a rapid increase in
private schools, and it is estimated that approximately 26% of all enrolled children in Punjab are attending
private schools (basedonpopulation census and household survey data)


                                                                                                          2

                                    11.THENATIONAL          CONTEXT

8.       With continued sound economic management, Pakistanhasbeen able to consolidate
i t s macroeconomic situation, with rate of economic growth accelerating to 6.4%.                    The
country's exports showed a double-digit growth. For the second year in succession direct foreign
investment in 2003104 was up by 19% and the foreign exchange reserves increased to US$12.4
billion (i.e., 6.6 months o f imports). Due to good economic and trade performance, revenue
collection improved significantly and for the first time inmany years, tax collection surpassed its
annual target. Constraints on public expenditure were partly relievedby better debt management,
made possible by greater access to concessionary external financing and lower domestic interest
rates. The fiscal space thus created was channeled to increase social and other pro-poor
expenditure. Nevertheless, savings from lower subsidies, coupled with reducedinterest payments
helped to contain the government expenditure to only 0.4% higher than the target, despite a
12.5% over runin defense spending, a 15% increase in development outlays and a 15% increase
in salaries of government employees. As a result, fiscal deficit, at 2.4% o f GDP, was 0.8% of
GDP lower than the target (See Table 1).


9.       It is not yet possible to ascertain the impact of the strong growth performance on
poverty reduction as the only reliable poverty estimates are from 2001. Nevertheless, a large
proportion o f Pakistanis live below the poverty line, and Pakistan's human development
indicators, e.g. education, continue to lag behind other countries in South Asia.             The primary
participation rate is 20% below the average for countries with similar levels o f income, with 40%
fewer girls inthe relevant age bracket attending primary classes.


10.      The Federal Government developed a national Education Sector Reform (ESR)
Strategy, and a comprehensive reform of public finance and governance reforms, including
devolution of power to the districts. The ESR Strategy was designed to develop a framework
for improving the poor performance o f the education sector and the factors that led to exclusion
based on gender, regional and income differentials. The Federal Government i s now initiating a
comprehensive review o f education sector policy to assess all modes o f education delivery,
including private and madrassah3schools, with the objective o f developing specific policies to
improve sector performance and sector outcomes.

 11.     Public service delivery has been strengthened through decentralization and
accompanying public finance and management reforms. Some reform measures are already
being implemented, in line with the comprehensive reform agenda under the Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA).              These reforms include: (i)a Medium Term Budget
Framework (MTBF) and establishment o f a Debt Policy Coordination Office for better
management o f public debt; (ii)     introduction o f institutional mechanisms for better monitoring
and evaluation o f pro-poor expenditures and corresponding outcome indicators; and (iii)              the
development o f an integrated financial management system under the Bank-funded Project to
Improve Financial Reporting and Auditing(PIFRA).




    The Federal Government approved in 2004 a Madrassah Reform Program to bring the Madaris into
mainstream education through provision o f textbooks, teacher training, equipment and grants.



                                                                                                        3

12.      The reform program in Punjab is closely linked to major national level initiatives:
(1) The national PRSP4which specifies that: (a) measures taken inthe education sector are an
integral part o f the Govemment's reform program; and (b) the responsibility for implementation
rests with districts ledby elected local governments; and (2) the national devolution plan which,
through the Local Govemment Ordinance (LGO) 2001, has devolved decision making and
finances to districts. Under Pakistan's Constitution, education i s a provincial subject. The
devolution plan further devolved education financing and service delivery responsibilities to the
district govemments. Punjab is leading the other provinces in its effort to fully implement the
national decentralization initiative, using education as the leading sector. The education sector
reforms complement the broader govemance and economic management reforms undertaken by
the provincial government, with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).




  The PRSPtitled "Accelerating EconomicGrowth and ReducingPoverty:The RoadAhead" has been placedon
the web for public dissemination at www.finance.gov.pklpovertvlprsp 03.pdf.    The Bank-Fund Joint Staff
Assessment (JSA), discussedby the Boardofthe IMF on March 8,2004 andthe Boardofthe Bank on March 11,
2004, endorsed the PRSP and indicatedit provides a good policy framework for the implementationof a strong
reformprogram.

   The GDP growth figure for FY05 is taken from IMF projections (made in August 2004). Due to continued good performance of large scale
 manufacturing sector and expectations of bumper harvest of winter crops due to improved water availability, the government estimates a
 significantly higher growth (7%) in2004/5.                                                                                          5

              111.EDUCATION         SECTORPERFORMANCEINTHE PUNJAB: KEY ISSUES

13.      With a population of 83.7 million (56% of the country's population) and a nominal GDP
of about $60 billion (purchasing power parity GDP o f about $250 billion), Punjab occupies a
pivotal role in Pakistan's economic and political life. Its economy i s well balanced, with strong
agriculture, and urban-based activity drivenby the 26.5 million people living inurban areas (53%
of the country's total urban population). Punjab has historically played a leadership role, among
the country's four provinces, in definingpolicy issues, which gives the province a central role in
the national reform agenda. This critical role of Punjab in shaping national policies has to be
considered when supporting the reforms.

14.      Punjabhas slightly better humandevelopment indicators than Pakistanas a whole,
however it fares poorly relative to other South Asian countries. A very large proportion of
the adult population (40%) i s illiterate and less than half o f the province's school-age population
i s enrolled in primary schools. The Net Enrollment Rate (NER) stagnated in the 1990s even
declining slightly until 1998, before improving slightly to 45% (compared to 42% nationally) in
2001-026. Of those enrolled in the first year of primary school, only half complete four or more
years of education. There are also substantial regional disparities in access to education. The
population's low education level i s a major contributor to poverty inPunjab and poses significant
constraints to the realization o f sustainedeconomic growth.

15.      Like the nation as a whole, the main issues affecting education sector service
delivery in Punjab were: (i)insufficient resources allocated to education; (ii)systemic
weakness in public sector delivery, including over-centralization and inadequate management;
and (iii)the poor performance of the education system (in terms o f quality, access and
governance). These issues are presentedinfurther detailbelow.

         (i)InsufficientResourcesAllocatedtoEducation
 16.     During the past, education spending had been insufficient which had adversely
affected quality and access. Like other provinces, public spending on education has remained
low at about 1.l%      of estimated provincial GDP between 1999/00 and 2002/03. The PESRP was
instrumental in increasing this ratio to 1.45% in 2003/04.                  However, in view o f the large
financing needs o f the sector, education expenditure still remain low.' This i s partly due to poor
resource mobilization by the provincial and federal governments, and partly because a large
proportion o f these limitedfiscal resources are preempted by defense and debt servicing, leaving
only a small proportion o f public resources to finance delivery o f public services. It indicates the
need for continued higher education sector allocations for the province (and for Palustan) to
achieve MDGs.

Govemmentof Pakistan, 2002
  The total Punjab govemment budget amounts to about 3% of provincial GDP. Hence, despite the meagemess of
provincial resources getting allocated to education, education spending constitutes a sizeable portion (over 30%) of
provincial budget (up from 28% in 2002103). The increase in education sector allocations (as a percent of budget) is
more evident for development expenditure, where the share of (development) budget was increasedfrom a little under
3% in 1999/00 to about 11%in2003/04.



                                                                                                                  6

         (ii) WeaknessinPublicSectorDelivery
              Systemic

17.      The over-centralized management o f the system by the Provincial Education
Department and weak fiduciary management capacity at lower levels o f government, which
hampered public service delivery, is now being reversed. Until the recent devolution, the
recruitment of teachers, procurement o f school furniture, signing small contracts for school
improvementsand even minor disciplinary measures usedto be centralized at the provincial level.
The problemwas compounded by inadequate mechanisms to track andmonitor expenditures, and
insufficient procurement and financial management capacities at the local level.

         (iii) PerformanceoftheEducationSector
               Poor
                 (1)    Education Sector Governance
18.      The province had ineffective mechanisms for ensuring staff accountability, which
started being addressed duringthe first year o f the reforms inpart by using facility specific
fixed t e r m appointments for teachers. The Punjab Education Department i s one o f the largest
employers inthe country (over 500,000 staff). Due to political interference in appointments and
transfers and weak systems o f monitoring and supervision it had difficulty in ensuring staff
accountability. Teacher absenteeism emerged as a central service delivery issue, with rates as
highas 30percent insome areas.

19.      There has been a history o f limited stakeholder participation at the local level.
Although, School Councils (SC) have intermittently had control over school maintenance funds,
they were not empowered to take administrativedecisions, makingthemlargely ineffective.

20.      The system for monitoring education outputs and outcomes was ineffective and has
been greatly strengthened duringthe first year o f the reforms. The system usedto rely on two
main instruments: the Education Management Information System (EMIS); and the Palustan
Integrated Household Survey (PIHS). The EMIS was a school-based system, which generally
provided dated information and was not connected to the needs of policy makers.

                 (2)     Education Quality
21.      The quality of education delivered through the government managed school system has
been poor due to: (i)low levels o f teacher competence; (ii)high teacher absenteeism; (iii)
curricula and textbooks that include outdated material; (iv) outdated pedagogical methods; and
(v) inadequate teachng materials and aids. The teacher training systems were inadequate.
Pedagogic methods rely on rote learning and high stakes examination. Most textbooks do not
have accompanying teacher guides, nor do they possess adequate teaching materials. Finally,
there was no systematic method for carrying out periodic assessments o f teachers or student
leaming outcomes.

                 (3)     EquityandAccess
22.      Poverty, low levels o f parents' education and lack o f access to facilities have been
important factors explaining low school attendance inPakistan. The cost o f education is one
o f the main reasons cited by poor families for not sending children to school. Access difficulties
and distances to schools-particularly  for girls-in isolated and rural areas also deter attendance.
Inaddition, poor quality school infrastructure without facilities such as boundary walls, toilets,
drinkingwater, andelectricity lowers participation.




                                                                                                  7

                 (4)      Private Sector Role
23.      Access to education services would have been worse without the rapid expansion of
the private sector. The Census of Private Schools (2000) showed that Punjab has almost 24,000
private schools'. Among these private schools, nearly two thirds (65 percent) are inurban areas,
and the vast majority (80 percent) are primary and middle schools. Analysis of household survey
data of 1998-99 and 2OOl-O2',     shows that the share of private schooling insecondary enrollment
has increased from 17 to 23 percent, while that in primary enrollment has remained stable at
about 24 percent. The data shows that while private schools are providing schooling to children
from low income households, the majority of private schools benefit those in the middle and
upper income quintiles. The majority ofpoorer andrural households still remainoverwhelmingly
dependent on low quality public education. This brings into sharp focus the need for quality
public schooling to improve education among poor children, as well as the need for government
to develop a vision and a strategy for developingpartnerships with the private sector.

                IV. PUNJABEDUCATION          SECTORREFORMPROGRAM(PESRP)

24.      Punjab has significantly reallocated public expenditures toward education and
other pro-poor programs, and is the first province in Pakistan to implement national
initiatives for decentralization and accompanying publicfinance and management reforms,
using the education sector as the leading sector. The PESRP has three pillars: (A) public
finance reforms to realign expenditures at the provincial and district level toward education and
other pro-poor expenditures; (B) devolution and public sector management reforms; and (C)
reforms to improve quality, access and governance of the education system. The first two pillars
of the reforms are also being supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) underthe Punjab
Resource Management Program (PRMP). ADB support extends from FY2004 to FY 2006. The
education sector i s benefiting from the parallel PRMP reforms under implementation on financial
management and procurement. The Punjab Government has developed a Provincial development
strategy, which i s parallel to the Federal PRSP. This strategy supports the devolution o f decision-
making and finances to districts and provides the impetus for public finance and management
reforms. Experience duringthe first year implementation o f PESRP, shows that education sector
reforms are better implementedwhen aligned withparallelreforms inpublic finance management
and governance.

25.      The Bank's support to PESRP has been developed on the basis of underpinninganalytic
work that has been undertaken by the Bank and the Government at both federal and provincial
levels.   The program and the development policy operation draw upon the national Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Pakistan Poverty Assessment (2002). The Punjab
Economic Report (June 2004) has also helpedto informthe continuing support for PESRP. Other
analytic work currently underway includes a Teacher Management Study that aims to make
recommendations on improving teacher performance. A study on public private partnership in
education in Punjab i s also underway that will provide more information and policy options on
the role of the private sector in providing education.         A provincial financial accountability
assessment for Punjab has commenced, and the findings o f this will also feed into programdesign
and ongoing implementation. Many o f PESRP's interventions are inline with the findings o f the
recent World Bank draft Country Gender Assessment (CGA) relating to girls' education, and the
Programi s already addressing several recommendations made inthe draft CGA.

26.       PESRP is a new program, andwhile its early success is promising,the gains are still
fragile and require continuedclose managementand monitoringto ensure that the progress
i s sustained. Of special significance i s the need for strengthening local government's capacity
and consolidating the relationship between the provincial and district governments. Building
upon the first year's experience, the Government remains committed to the framework o f the
Program and its three pillars. It has, however, identified areas that need greater emphasis during
the second year in order to sustain the momentum o f reform. The areas being focused on in the
second year include: a) strengthening district capacity, especially district monitoring capacity; b)
institutional restructuringo f the provincial Department o f Education to enable it to better perform
its functions; c) placing a greater focus on community empowerment; d) focusing on quality o f
education through a comprehensive teacher professional development program and improvements
in the quality of textbooks; and e) developing a vision and strategy for the private sector and
partnerships with the private sector through the Punjab EducationFoundation.

27.       The three pillars o f the reform program are described below, including progress already
achieved, actions underway in the second year o f the program, and future actions in the third
programyear and beyond.

A.        Pillar I:PublicFinanceReformsto Increasethe Leveland Share of Education
          Expenditures
28.       Since the start o f the reform program in2004, Punjab has been increasing provincial and
district expenditures on education based on the Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF) in a
fiscally sustainable manner (see Table 2). Although credible data on education expenditure from
the districts are still awaited, based on the Accountant General (AG) data on education
expenditure from the field, one can infer that the FY04 actual expenditure on education would be
quite close to the budget level (of Rs.42 billion)".

          (1)IncreasePublic ExpenditureonEducation

29.       The MTBF supports large increases inprovincial expenditures on education (and other
pro-poor services). These increases are to be brought about by channeling large sums o f
provincial funds to the district governments as conditional grants. The revised MTBF shows
more than doubling o f allocation for education over the next four years (2004-2008), with
recurrent expenditure increasing by 78% and almost quadrupling o f development spending.
Development expenditures had significantly gone down before the reform program, hence the
increase i s from a very low base. The MTBF i s a step in the right direction for ensuring fiscal
sustainability by creating additional fiscal space over a medium-run through generating
additional provincial revenue and by reducing the debt-servicing burden and other low-priority
expenditure. This framework also provides additional funding for district educationprograms
on the basis o f need and if the districts allocate more budget for the education sector from their
own overall district budgets and if they meet performance targets set out in the TOP agreements
(see paragraph 7).



10 The FY04 end-year fiscal accounts (the Punjab Civil Accounts) reported total "actual" expenditure on education to
be about Rs. 45 billion. These accounts, however, also show that entire allocation o f Rs. 5 billion which was provided
to the districts for missing facilities as fully spent.        This is due to the accounting protocol, which treats all
disbursements from the Provincial Consolidated Fundas "expenditure", irrespective of whether these funds are actually
spent or not. Information from the field shows that by end o f FY04, while over 90% o f funds were contracted out, only
30% of the funds for missing facilities were actually spent, making overall expenditure to be about Rs. 42 billion. The
low utilization of these funds i s due to late start o f the program, i.e. in the 31d quarter of FY04. These funds are fully
committed and are non-lapsable.



                                                                                                                          9

30.      Punjab government's strategy of creating additional fiscal space for high-priority
expenditures through better revenue collection, sound debt management and improved
expenditure management has started to yield results but the fiscal position still remains
constrained and necessitates continued external budget support. Improving provincial
economy together with streamlining o f provincial taxes helpedthe Punjab Government to collect
18% higher revenue than the FY04 budget target. According to the revised budgetary estimates,
the provincial government's revenue collection in 2003104 was 55% higher than in 2002103.
With provincial current expenditure exceeding the budget target by only 1%, enough fiscal space
was available to the provincial government to significantly increase the allocation for
development budget and grants for the local governments. As a result, the government was able
to increase development expenditure during the course o f FY04, and exceeded targets by 43%.
Notwithstanding, the good revenue collection and prudent expenditure management by the
provincial government, Punjab still remains heavily dependent on revenue transfers from the
federal govemment to meet its expenditure needs.

31.       T o date, however, increased allocations for education are financed mainly through
increased revenue, lower non-priority expenditure and donor funds. None o f the other priority
expenditures has been reduced to accommodate these increases."             Inview o f heavy reliance of
the province on federal revenue transfers and competing demands from other priority sectors,
large scale investments in education will require continued donor assistance even beyond the
programperiod.

32.       Actions taken: During FY05, Punjab has made good progress and has maintained
the commitments under the MTBF (see Table 2). It has increased pro-poor expenditures; the
financial position o f the province i s sound, and the budget for the second year o f the program
(Fiscal Year 2005) projects a 21% increase in overall provincial revenue and 28% increase in
provincial expenditure. While the overall (provincial and district) education sector expenditure i s
projected to increase by 30% -- recurrent expenditure by 26% and development by 57%, the
recurrent expenditure on provincially executed education activities has increased by 28%, and the
allocation on the development side in education has increased by 38%.              There is an overall
increase o f 15% in the FY05 education budget in accordance with the MTBF. Information
available from district budgets shows an increase o f about 14% for the education sector budget.
More than 50% o f districts have realigned their budgets to increase the level o f district non-salary
budget for education.




''There,  however, is a possibility that the strong government focus on educationmay have deprived other
priority sectors of larger increases inallocations.

  33.        Future Actions. The Government i s committed to: (i)                        increase provincial expenditures
  for education according to the Medium Term Budget Framework; (ii)                             allocate conditional grants
  from the provincial budget to districts based on TOP agreements and achievement o f agreed
  targets that gives weight to both need and performance; (iii)                         increase the level of real middle
   school expenditures fkom base year 2004; and (iv) pay-off more expensive federal debt.

  B.         Pillar 11:Devolution and Public Sector Management Reforms
             (1)Support Devolution

   34.       The reform supports devolution through measures that: (i)decentralize financing and
   decision making to the district level; (ii)           increase accountability o f districts for resource use; (iii)
   clarify the roles o f all levels of government; and (iv) strengthen the capacity o f districts to assume
  their new responsibilities under decentralization. Devolution carries attendant capacity risks and



                                                                                                                              11

the risk that local governments may not focus on pro-poor expenditures. These are being
specifically addressedthrough the program interventions.

35.      Duringthe first year, Terms of Partnership (TOPs) were signed with all 34 districts, and
conditional grants were fully transferred to the districts for implementation o f the PESRP.
Duringthis second reform year, new TOPs for all 34 districts have been signed and grants have
been assigned according to a formula which reflects both need and performance. This formula
has been endorsed by the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC). The formula i s beingused for
allocation o f funds for provision of missing facilities in schools, and provides 70% o f financing
on need basis. Need has been calculated on the basis of: (a) each district's requirements for
physical infrastructure improvements of schools (based on the district profiles developed inApril
2003); (b) inverse literacy rate; and (c) enrollment levels in public schools. Performance i s
calculated on the basis of: (a) district govemments' FY04 education expenditures; (b) district
govemments' FY05 allocations for education; and (c) enrollment increases.

36.      Actions Taken. Devolution i s being supported by: (i)transferring general budget
resources as a single line budget transfer to the district governments' accounts (Account 4") in
accordance with the resource allocation formula developed by the Provincial Finance
Commission (PFC); (ii)        fully transferringto Districts' Account 4 additional allocations (over and
above the single line transfer) as outcome-based conditional grants, using aformula that reflects
both need andperformance (see para 35 above), inaccordancewith the TOPs, with agreedannual
targets (see paragraph 7); (iii)     including the need and performance basedwindow inthe windows
created under the PFC (see Box 1); (iv) re-aligning district budgets with more than 50% of
districts increasing the level of non salary budget for schools; (iv) financing and implementing
district education departments' capacity development programs through the PESRP funds; and
(v) creating new posts and appointing District Monitoring Officers (DMOs) in the 34 districts
(see Box 2).




'*ProvincialGovemment      funds move through different accounts. Account 1is for resources managed by the province,
  and Account 4 is for resources managed b y the district. The funds transferred to Account 4 (district Account) are
  transferred as a single line (non-earmarked) transfer. The districts prepare their annual budgets (development and
  recumng) on the basis o f this single line budget transfer. In addition to this transfer, the conditional grants provided
  under the PESRP are earmarked for the education sector and are also transferred to Account 4.

I                                  Box 1: FiscalDecentralizationin Punjab
  Devolution o f state functions and authority i s the fundamental reform undertaken by Pakistan to improve
  the delivery ofpublic services. This reform presents a unique opportunity to significantly improve service
  delivery, and especially the performance o f public education, by bringinggovernment closer to the people,
  thereby enhancing its accountability to the stakeholders.
  The Punjab Government is ahead o f other provinces in implementing fiscal and administrative
  decentralization, and is already providing the full share o f district governments' budgets directly into
  district accounts. Moreover, the provincial government is in the process o f refining the PFC formula by
  making it more flexible. The new mechanism for transfer o f revenue to local governments will define not
  one but a number o f modes for transferringfunds to district governments. These include:

      i)GeneralPurposeGrants.Aspecifiedshareofprovincialallocableamountwouldbetransferredto
          the districts primarily on a need-based formula (although some elements on performance could be
          included) to cater for the districts' needs o f making salary, non-salary and development
          expenditures.

     ii)IncentiveGrants:      These grants may distribute another specified share o f allocable amount on the
          basis o fperformance of each district on meeting some pre-specified goals defined by the provincial
          government (e.g. timely completion o f projects, increasing own revenue, etc.)
     iii)SpecialPurposeGrants:Thesegrantswouldbeprovidedtospecifieddistrictsonthebasisofsome
          normative aspects (e.g. bringingbackward districts at par with the rest o f the province, say interms
          o f localinfrastructure).
     iv) Policy Transmittal Grants: These would serve to achieve high-priority sectoral objectives and
          would be conditioned on some process and/or input and/or output and/or outcome indicators.

  Besides approving the concept ofthis new mechanism, the PFC will determine:

       a)   The shares o fprovincialretained and allocable amounts;
       b) The share o feachtype o fgrant inprovincialallocable amount; and
       c)   The indicatorslfactors and their weight in determining the share of each district in each type of
            grant.




 37.      Future Actiolzs. The Government will: (i)           implement the n e w mechanism for fiscal
 transfer; (ii) transfer PESRP funds to districts on the basis of the n e w formula which will remain
 a component o f the new PFC fiscal transfer mechanism and will be based on both need and
 performance; (iii) strengthen the capacity of districts by implementing a capacity building
                       further
program that: (a) provides financial management and accounting training to district officials; (b)
 supports district efforts to build School Council capacity, including the use of NGOs inother than
 the six pilot districts; (c) provides additional support for streamlining monitoring arrangements
 through the newly appointed district monitoring officers; and (d) further strengthens the district
 offices o fthe Education Management Information Systems (EMIS).




                                                                                                             13

                                        Box 2: DistrictCapacityBuilding
 PESRP recognizes the importance o f supporting the devolution process by strengthening district
 governments. The Program supports the functioning and effectiveness o f district governments to deliver
 services.
 One key element o f the reform program is the capacity development initiative that focuses on strengthening
 the capacity o f district governments. The Punjab Government recognizes that greater district capacity is
 central to enabling full ownership and sustainability o f the reform program. The province is financing a
 district capacity development initiative to provide logistical support, physical and technical support, and
 managerial capacity development.        Logistical support is being provided to enhance the mobility and
 supervision capacities o f the district education staff. Physical and technical support aims to strengthen
 district education capacity to implement and monitor the overall district education sector program, including
 specific PESRP interventions. Computers and other related technical support has also been included. A full
 training needs assessmenthas been carried out that forms the basis for the capacity development o f relevant
 district staff under this initiative.
 PESRP is also supporting restructuring o f the district education system in order to better align it with its
 functions, such as human resource management, monitoring, and student assessment. Bringing about this
 structural change will enable the districts to function more effectively in delivery o f education services.
 Overall district education management capacity has been strengthened through the selection and appointment
 o f specially selected EDOs for education, and through the creation o f new posts o f District Monitoring
 Officers (DMOs). District Monitoring Officers have beenappointed inall thirty four districts.
 Finally, strengthening o f districts i s reflected in the TOPS between the province and the districts with
 performance-based incentives providedto districts. This is intended to not only provide monetary rewards to
 well-performing districts, but by encouraging districts to perform better, it aims to bring about a process o f
 better management and functioning of districts. The Punjab Government is cogniz             e fact that there is
 unevencapacity among districts, and therefore the program will aim to direct mor
 that have a greater needto improve their capacity.

          (2) StrengthenGovernanceandthe FiduciaryEnvironment

38.       The reform supports an improved governance and fiduciary environment through
measures that strengthen financial management and procurement capacity at both the provincial
and district levels.     These reforms are also supported through the ADB-supported Provincial
Resource Management Program (PRMP). Significant progress has been made in the area of
financial management, with timely and more reliable financial data being made available. The
Education Department has a huge backlog of pending audit paragraphs as Departmental Accounts
Committee (DAC) meetings were not regularly convened to review and clear the paragraphs. The
DAC meetings are now being regularly convened. Procurement reforms have been introduced
with contracts for civil works above a reasonable threshold now based on open competition, and
with School Councils now authorized to carry out small civil works at the school level.              Special
monitoring teams have been established to conduct field verification of the quality of
infiastructure providedto schools.

39.       Actions Taken. Financial management reforms include: (i)establishment of the
Program Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU) in the Department of Education, which i s
regularly reporting and analyzing education expenditures; (ii)development of accounting
procedures to track program expenditures; and (iii)          recruitment of an audit firm to provide
financial management capacity on an interim basis through direct recruitment of new financial
management staff on a phased basis.                  Significant procurement reforms have been
implemented that include:(i)          removal o f requirements for pre-registration of contractors; (ii)
removing the requirement of composite schedule of rates (CSR), and replacing it with realistic
cost estimates based on prevailing market rates; (iii)development of standard procurement
guidelines for the purchase of goods; (iv) increasing the threshold for community contracting up


                                                                                                           14

to Rs. 400,000'3; and (v) provision of greater authority for School Councils to manage and
implement these community contracts.

40.      Future Actions. The Government will continue to strengthen its financial management
capacity, both in reporting and accountability, through: (i)implementation o f the New
Accounting Model (NAM)and the introduction o f a new and comprehensive Chart of Accounts
(COA) under the PIFRA regime (see paragraph 11); (ii)          computerization of financial management
processes to support the timely production o f financial information for decision making; (iii)
training of accounting staff and auditors; (iv) hiring of at least 150 qualified finance and
accounting personnel to augment the human resource capacity in the area of financial
management and control; (v) maintaining the regular quarterly reporting of financial flows by the
Department o f Education, including expenditures, outputs and outcomes at the provincial and
district levels; and (vi) ensuring timely audits, and convening o f fortnightly DAC meetings to
review and settle all arising audit observations (paras) as well as progressively clearing the
backlogs. Inthe area of procurement, future actions include regularly updating the Schedule of
Rates for civil works procurement with a market price based schedule of rates; ensuring effective
mechanisms for quality assurance and end use verification of contracts; and ensuring
transparency at the local level by malung available information on civil works, winning bids and
the price o f contracts through local posting.             During FY05, annual third party ex-post
procurement reviews have been contracted, and regular training programs for procurement staff
are under implementation.

41.      Another important comprehensive reform package aimed at solidifying the gains already
made inthe area of financial management and accountability i s the province's concurrence for the
Bank and other Donors to undertake a formal Financial Management and Accountability
Assessment of the Province duringFY 2005. The Assessment, launched inNovember 2004 will
further inform the provincial government, the Bank, and the other development partners of the
accomplishments and the progress being made in improving public financial management inthe
province. The Assessment would also identifyand recommend further actions for the province's
financial management reform agenda.

C.       Pillar 111:EducationSector Reforms
42.      There are two core areas addressedinPunjab's Education Sector ReformProgram:
(i)improvements insector governance; and(ii)improvement inaccess and quality. The
Provincial Government recognizes that implementing far-reaching, sector-wide reforms i s a
formidable exercise. The Government has therefore adopted a phased approach for the program.
Underthis approach, the Provincial Government i s implementingan ambitious reformagenda up
to the elementary level during the first two years (see Table 3 for Baselines and Program
Targets), and will move up to the secondary and high school levels by the third and subsequent
years. While the first year focused on the public sector delivery, reformsequencing inthe second
year enables the development of a framework for partnering with low cost private sector. The
Punjab Education Foundation will assist Government in developing the framework in
consultation with key stakeholders. The Government recognizes that in the coming years, the
strength of PESRP will also be measured by its ability to influence improvements in overall
outcomes (including both public and private sectors). While the recent public school census has
demonstrated a marked increase in participation and enrollment in public schools, the results o f
the forthcoming CWIQ survey will help inform Government on changes inoverall enrollments in




 l3
  This amount is sufficient for school boundaries, toilets, repairs and maintenance.


                                                                                                    15

the province. The actions for the third Credit therefore include a greater focus on actions related
to the private sector.

43.     A summary of implementationprogress during the first year is presentedbelow (see
also Box 3):

        (1) Significant progress is evident in outcomes as measured by enrollment increases. A
             school census conducted in October 2004 shows a 13% enrollment increase in
             government primary schools as compared to the annual 1.5% increase documented
             during the past decade. Girls' enrollment in the fifteen low literacy districts has
             increased by 20% due to the timely provision of stipends. These data findings are
             now being validated through independent thirdparty surveys.

        (2) Education sector governance and quality has been strengthenedby the recruitment of
             a total of 30,000 contract facility-based teachers in one year (from the start o f the
             program to-date), and expanding the role of School Councils. Contract teachers'
             educational qualifications have been increased to improve teaching quality. A
             credible monitoring system for the program has been developed (see paragraph 5),
             and education data i s being effectively and analytically used for policy decisions,
             planning and monitoringpurposes.

        (3) The process of improving textbook quality has been initiated by privatizing textbook
             development (starting with one book this year, expanding to others in subsequent
             years), and developing standards for improved quality of textbooks through better
             printingand graphics for the textbooks for the newacademic sessioninApril 2005.

        (4) Impressive progress has been made to improve equity and access with on time
             delivery of free textbooks for the school year beginning in April 2004. A girls
             stipend program targeting all girls enrolled in Classes 6 - 8 in fifteen low literacy
             districts was successfully launched, and quarterly installments o f stipends to over
             175,000 eligible girl students (now increased to 200,000 girls) are being regularly
             provided in these districts. A comprehensive program to provide missing
             infrastructure to schools has commenced and i s making steady progress towards
             completion of works. Fifty percent of the closed and non functional schools were
             openedby filling vacant teaching posts.

44.      The details o f each sector reform area, with actions taken and future actions are presented
below:

         (1) Strengthen EducationSector Governance

45.      The reform supports improvements in education sector governance through the
implementation o f measures to: (a) restructure the Department of Education (DOE) to reflect
program priorities both at the provincial and at the district level; (b) improve teacher
management; (c) strengthen School Councils; and (d) strengthen monitoring and evaluation.

                 (a) Restructuringthe education department

46.      These reforms, initiated in the second year, are designed to realign the education
department's operational structure to meet the province's development objectives. This i s the first
time that a serious effort i s being made to re-focus and re-orient the provincial education
department inline with its responsibilities and functions under a devolved framework.

47.     Actions Taken. This is being achieved by: (i)        restructuring the various parts o f the
provincial education department, which has already commenced with the Planning and Finance
Wings, to reflect its new role where service delivery i s a district responsibility while policy
development, strategic planning, and overall monitoring & evaluation remains a provincial
responsibility;  (ii)appointment of specially selected Executive District Officers (EDOs) for
Education in all thirty four districts who are goal oriented and have demonstrated management
slulls; and (iii) the EMIS under the Planning Wing, rather then keeping it isolated from
                placing
decision malung.

48.      Future Actions. These will be complemented with reforms in the education department
structures at the district level with the cooperation o f the district Government so that the district
structures are also aligned with the development objectives o f the program. Specific actions will
include restructuring district education departments' planning and monitoring sections with
attendant capacity and skill development programs. This would enable districts to develop annual
sector development programs and to monitor implementation inan effective manner.

                 (b) Improve Teacher Management
49.      The reforms aim to improve teacher management by increasing transparency in
recruitment, reducing teacher absenteeism, and achieving greater local involvement in
teacher selection through changes inrecruitment policy.

50.      Actions Taken. The problems o f teacher accountability and highrates o f absenteeism
are being addressed by: (i)   recruitment o f all new teachers, called Elementary School Educators
(ESEs), through site-specific, fixed-term contracts, with more than 30,000'* teaching staff already
recruited during the past 3 years through such contracts and primarily posted to schools which
were previously closed due to lack o f teaching staff, and to fill vacancies in schools where
enrollments have increased; (ii)      implementation o f district monitoring mechanisms to curb
absenteeism and monitor local schools through School Councils; and (iii)     evaluating performance
o f the contract appointees through an approved criteria, which i s part o f the contract signed by
each contract appointee. This includes, among others, enrollment increase, reduction in dropout
and assessing student leaming achievement. Transparency inteacher recruitment, postings and

                                                                                                   19

transfers has been enhanced through: (i) merit-based recruitment criteria, based on a point
                                                new
system, which favors recruiting women and local candidates with District Governments being in-
charge o f making recruitments and the provincial government overseeing the process of
recruitment;    (ii)appointment of Executive District Officers (Education) specially selected
through a transparent process; and (iii)     reduction inthe probability of transfer of teachers by way
of school-specific contract appointments.             To improve quality, preference i s given to the
recruitment o f graduate teachers. To further improve issues relating to teacher management, a
study is being conducted, recommendations of which will be available during 2005 to inform
furtherpolicy development.

51.      Future Actions       The Government will: (i) recruitment criteria based on the
                                                                 review
feedback provided by the district governments and ensure that at least 40% of all elementary
teaching staff positions have school-specific, fixed-term contracts by end FY05; (ii)                  assess the
impact o f contract appointments; (iii)         appoint additional 19,000 teaching staff, and where
required, create new posts to meet the requirements of increased enrollments; (iv) bringstructural
changes that could improve the quality o f teachers, including incentives structures and possible
separation o f administrative and teaching cadre"; (v) redeploy teachers basedon a rationalization
exercise, and create new posts where needed; (vi) establish criteria to measureperformance o f the
regular teachers on lines similar to those of the contract appointees and develop measures that
reward good performance; and (vii) take additional measures to improve accountability and
reduce absenteeism, such as usingthird party surveys to evaluate changes inteacher absenteeism,
after abaseline has been established.

                 (c) Revitalize School Councils

52.      The reform program revitalizes School Councils (SCs) in order to strengthen the link
between stakeholders (clients) and providers (schools), and improve service delivery. School
councils were re-established in FY04 based on majority membership of parents, with mothers
represented inSCs o f girls' schools.

53.      Actions Taken. The provincial government and district governments have taken several
actions to strengthen School Councils, including: (i)         an agreement on the role o f SCs, included in
the TOPS;(ii) issuance of guidelines by the provincial government clarifying the role o f SCs,
               the
including enhancing their authority to undertake small civil works (see Box 4); (iii)               start of school
based budgeting by nineteen districts for non-salary recurrent costs and implemented through
school councils; (iv) authorizing SCs to hire contract teachers inaccordance with the recruitment
policy; and (v) as a pilot, contracting two NGOs for capacity support to SCs in 2400 schools in
six districts.

54.      Future Actions. Future measures to strengthen School Councils include developing and
implementinga phased plan to spread the capacity buildingprogram for School Councils across
the remaining districts infuture years by engaging other NGOs. All districts will move to school
basedbudgetingand will authorize schools councils to manage school recurring and development
expenditures. The Government will allocate the additional required resources to ensure that
parental and community participation i s being strengthened across all districts o f Punjab. The
results o f an ongoing Bank assisted study to assess the impact o f the SC intervention will also
inform future government policy.




  The govemment is also reviewing the existing functions and skill-mix of the district education management cadre.



                                                                                                                  20

                          Box 4: Revitalizing and Empowering School Councils
The Government o f Punjab is committed to enhancing community and parental participation in schooling
by strengthening School Councils.        While many efforts have been made in the past to mobilize
communities, experience has shown that when such community/parental organizations are provided with
financial support and are given the authority to spend on critical school level activities, they are able to
deliver quality and timely outputs. Under PESRP, the program o f revitalizing School Councils is being
implementedwith credible actions that also include engagement of School Councils inschool improvement
activities. School Councils have been given the authority to spend funds for small works currently up to a
ceiling o f Rs.400,000 for works such as electrification, construction o f boundary walls, provision o f water
supply, and construction o f toilets and sanitation facilities. In Punjab's Narowal District, 163 small works
schemes have been awarded for implementation by School Councils. The SCs accomplished over 80%
completion in a short time span, with considerable savings, which are being utilizedby the School Councils
for other school specific needs. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness o f School Council engagement
in school improvement activities such as provision of necessary and missing facilities. Inorder to h h e r
strengthen SCs so that they can play a major role for inclusion o f parents in the administration o f the
school, a capacity building program for SCs is being implemented through tripartite partnership
arrangements among NGOs, district governments and the provincial government. Under this program, two
NGOs have been contracted to strengthen SC capacity to manage school affairs in six pilot districts
covering 400 schools per district for a total of 2,400 schools. The Punjab Government aims to leam from
the experience in these pilot districts and expand such capacity building efforts to cover all of Punjab's
schools.

          (d) Strengthen Monitoring & Evaluation

55.       The education reform program strengthens monitoring and evaluation to monitor
progress, informeducation policy and allow performance-based financing o f education services.

56.      Actions Taken. The Government has: (a) developed and updated district education
profiles and establishedbaseline indicators of education performance for the reformprogram, and
i s monitoring and reporting progress on the basis o f this baseline; (b) agreed on monitoring
targets with the districts and included them in the TOPS; (c) established a Program Monitoring
and Implementation Unit (PMIU) in the Provincial Education Department, and fully integrated
the PMIU's outputs into the regular worlung o f the Department; (d) created a new position o f
District Monitoring Officers (DMOs) and appointed DMOs in all 34 districts; (e) moved EMIS
from an isolated position outside decision making structures to become a part o f the Planning
Wing in the department; (f) launched third party surveys; (g) completed a school census in
February 2004, and follow up census in October 2004 to assess changes in enrollments; (h)
developed credibility of its data collection and analysis which, for the first time ever, i s being
used for policy development; and (i)       successfully initiated an education awareness campaign for
disseminating information about the reformprogram through the print and electronic media.

57.       Future Actions. The Government will take several actions to strengthen monitoring and
evaluation. These measures include: (i)using the results of the Core Welfare Indicators
Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey to monitor PRSP indicators2'; (ii)              strengtheningEMIS to make it
more responsive to education sector monitoring and evaluation needs; (iii)            strengthening district
EMIS offices; (iv) engaging SCs for monitoring school performance, starting with 6 districts; (v)
institutionalizingthe provincial education learning assessment program to annually gauge student
learning achievements; (vi) implementing third party surveys to assess availability of reform



20 Many of the PRSP indicators are also Punjab Education Sector Reformindicators.


                                                                                                            21

inputs; (vii) conducting an impact evaluation of the reform interventions, including the girls'
stipend program; and (viii) making information on the reform program available to the public
through the media and the Department of Education's website, and launching the next phase of
the education awarenessprograms.

         (2) ImproveEducationQuality andAccess

58.      The reform enhances the performance of the education sector (e.g. achieving universal
primary enrollment, improving student leaming outcomes, and achieving gender parity) through
removal o f constraints to access and improvements inthe quality o f education services.

             (a) ImproveAccess to PublicEducation

59.      Actions Taken. The Government is addressing the problem of access and equity by: (i)
providing free schooling up to the matriculation level (tenth grade); (ii)       extending the policy o f
free textbooks to elementary school (grades 1-8) students from the new academic year in April
2005; (iii) continuing to implement the stipend21program for all girls ingrades 6-8 (the age group
where dropouts start to increase), initially targeting 15 disadvantaged districts with low literacy
levels (see Box 5). This scholarship i s conditional on 80% monthly attendance and school
certification and, to ensure transparency, monthly posting of the list of eligible girls at the
schoolz2;(iv) continuing to provide missingfacilities for schools; and (v) opening non-functional
schools through appointment ofnew teachers.




60.      Future Actions. The Government will take further actions to improve access including:
(i) expansionofthegirls'scholarshipprogramwillbeconsideredbasedonitsevaluation; (ii)
    an
provision of infrastructure and staff to remainingnon functional schools23;and (iii)        continuing to
improve existingschool infrastructure (see Table 3 for baseline andtargets) through the provision
o f basic facilities such as boundary walls for girls' schools, toilets, additional class rooms and



21 Tuition has been made free up to grade 10 and the term scholarship refers to stipends. Scholarship is the
common term inPakistan.
22 The stipends are transferred to each girl directly by postal money order and funds are transferred four
times per year.
23 Non-functional schools are those in which either infrastructure or teachers are missing, but there are
existing or potential students.


                                                                                                          22

other infrastructure improvements, thereby reducing the backlog of missing facilities to ensure
that at least 80 % of schools are providedmissingfacilities inthe three year period.

                 (b) Improve Quality ofEducation

61.      The Punjab Government recognizes the need to improve the quality o f education to
complement the improvements made inenhancing access to education. Implementation progress
inthis area, specifically inteachers' professional development, was slower than in other reform
initiatives of the Program.     During the first program year, Government efforts focused on
developing a comprehensive framework for professional development of teachers rather than only
implementing new training programs. Progress in assessing student learning achievement has
also been slow, mahng it difficult to assess quality improvements in student learning in the
absence o f a province-specific baseline. There has been better than anticipated progress in
improving the quality of teaching materials through the reforms underway in textbook
development.

62.      Actions Taken: The Government has taken the following actions to improve the quality
of teaching and textbooks: (i)  placed emphasis on in-service training o f teachers by focusing full
professional development of the teaching and education management staff through the
restructured Directorate of Staff Development (DSD); (ii)  developed a framework and action plan
for professional development o f teachers; and (iii)  under the National Education Assessment
System (NEAS), established a system o f ongoing student assessments and completed the first
pilot assessment o f grade IV students in language and mathematics. This is the first time that a
nationwide assessment program has been undertaken. Hence, at the moment there i s no baseline
o f student leamingoutcomes, either at the provincial or national level. The results o f the first pilot
test will be available by April 2005. The Government i s striving to improve the quality o f
teaching materials by opening up textbook development to competition. The quality of textbooks
i s being improved by: (i)   awarding textbook development contracts through a transparent and
competitive process, with authors external to the Textbook Board selected by an independent
selection committee established for this purpose; (ii)opening textbook printingandpublishingto
competition, beginning with the Kindergarten primer; and (iii)  establishing standards for textbook
paper quality, and improving the graphics and printing quality o f textbooks starting with
textbooks for Classes 6-8, which will be ready for distribution at the start of the next academic
year inApril 2005.

63.      Future Actions: The Government will take the following actions to improve the quality
of teaching and textbooks. Teaching quality is being improved by: (i)        broadening the teacher
training activities to a professional development program which also includes direct classroom
support to teachers, incentives, monitoring and accountability, and career path growth and
compensation; (ii)   establishing a new training and post-training follow-up plan for 2005 which
particularly emphasizes direct support to teachers in their classrooms, including teacher guides,
classroom materials and the sharing of teaching ideas between school staff; (iii)          developing
partnerships with the private sector for delivery o f teacher training programs; (iv) using the
results o f a teacher management study to improve teacher monitoring and accountability
mechanisms; (v) implementingtesting o f student leaming achievements in grade 4 and 8 as part
of the National Education Assessment System (NEAS) program and institutionalizing regular
provincial learning assessments; and (vi) developing a more extensive province-specific student
learning assessment basedon the World Bank study of learning achievement inpublic and private
schools.




                                                                                                      23

                  (c) Improve Access by Strengthening Public Private Partnerships

64.     The reform program facilitates greater private sector participation in education service
delivery through a restructured Punjab EducationFoundation(PEF), which will provide financial
and technical support mechanism for the low cost private and NGO sector, and by considering
incentives such as stipends to private schools also. Progress in this area has been slower than
anticipated due to the delays in enactment of the law to restructure the PEF, and subsequent
delays in appointment of the PEF Board. The government is developing a framework for public
private partnership to increase access to education in the province. The elements of this
framework include development of a vision for public private partnership and strategy for
working with the private sector. Inorder to help develop a better understanding o f the scope and
participationo f the private sector, a private school census will be conducted to map out the extent
o f access to education which i s not currently captured by the public school census, and to provide
updated information on the characteristics and trends of private education provision. The Punjab
Government will also explore extending the free textbook and stipend programs to low cost
private and NGO schools. It i s anticipated that through these and other measures, the capacity of
the private sector will be tapped to increase access to schooling inthe province.

65.     Actions Taken.        The Government has taken the following actions to strengthen
private/public partnerships: (i) approved the new Act of the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF)
whichnow provides for an independent Board and ChiefExecutive with financial autonomy; (ii)
appointed the Board of the PEF; (iii)     initiated recruitment o f the Managing Director; and (iv)
provided budget support to the Foundation to enable it to begin its work. The PEF Board has
developed a strategic vision to guide the work o f the Foundation.

66.     Future Actions. The government will develop its vision for private sector service
provision, and will take the following actions to strengthen public/ private partnerships: (i)
expand the scope o f PEF functions from urban to rural areas and make it the main mechanism for
financing low cost private and NGO service delivery in the education sector; (ii)      develop and
implement policies to facilitate the expansion of low cost private education; (iii) launch a private
school census to establish an updated baseline of private schools; (iv) support innovative
public/private partnership programs, usingthe results of the World Bank assisted study on student
learning achievements in public and private schools; (v) based on an evaluation, consider
expanding initiatives such as the stipends program to the low cost private and NGO schools; and
(vi) expand existing successful public-private partnerships to increase coverage inthe education
system.

                                     V. THEPROPOSED       CREDIT

Country Assistance Strategy

67.      The Bank Group's program priorities in the Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) are to: (i)strengthen macroeconomic stability and government effectiveness; (ii)
improve the business environment for growth; and (iii)improve equity through support for
pro-poor and pro-gender equity policies. The CAS was presented to the Bank's Board inJune
200224,and a CAS Progress Report discussed at the Board inFY04 confirmed that the strategy
laid out in the CAS remains appropriate, and that overall progress in implementing the CAS has
been satisfactory. While this operation was not in the CAS Progress Report high case lending
scenario, it i s consistent with CAS priorities, and helps to promote CAS objectives by supporting



24PakistanCountryAssistance Strategy FY03-05 (ReportNo. 24399-PAK).


                                                                                                  24

pro-poor and pro-gender equity initiatives, and policy reforms to improve the cost-effectiveness
of government programs. I t also promotes investments required to increase the educational
attainment o f the population of Punjab, particularly the poor and women, which i s crucial for the
country's ability to grow economically and alleviate poverty. The proposed operation i s expected
to helpPalustan come closer to the MillenniumDevelopmentGoals for education.

Coordinationwith the IMF and Other Donors

68.      The Bank has been working closely with the IMF and has been instrumental in
encouraging donors to build stronger partnerships in support of the Government's reform
program and its PRSP. There has been good progress under the IMF supported three year
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The final IMFreview o f the PRGF arrangement
inDecember2004 was successfully completed.*' TheDepartment for InternationalDevelopment
(DFID) is working in parallel with the Bank to provide technical assistance to Punjab for
supporting capacity development programs. DFID assistance will include support for both
provincial and district education departments and their programs. This includes: capacity
development especially for planning and monitoring, support to School Councils, and teachers'
professional development. Inaddition, Gesellschaft fuer Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) are also providing parallel support for the
education sector, including the teachers' professional development program. The program is well
coordinated with the ADB-supported Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP), and i s
usingthe MTBFdevelopedunder the PRMP.

69.      The objective of the proposed Credit is to provide financing to the province of
Punjab to enable it to progresstoward the MDGtargets relatedto primary education and
gender parity. This operation would be the second in a series o f single tranche development
policy credits to support a medium-term program of sector-wide reforms linked to achieving
specific qualitative and quantitative targets inthe education sector. Although PESRP started as a
medium term program, it is evident that sustaining education sector improvements requires a
longer termprogram and continued assistance. This Credit would help buildon the success of the
first credit, and would continue to create incentives for sustaining the gains as subsequent funding
i s based on both outcome improvements and overall performance.                 Furthermore, it would
continue to promote Bank's engagement on policy reforms at a time when improvement in the
macroeconomic situation allows increased fiscal space for support to education. Finally, the
Credit would support a provincial reform program that is focused on improving education sector
performance, and i s already beginning to show significant improvements in outcomes. It i s
evident that Bank's assistance would need to cover a period beyond the earlier envisaged three
year program. Government is also extending the program period and this would necessitate
continued support from the Bank group.

70.      The Government's reform program is proposed to be supported through the
DevelopmentPolicy Lending @PL) instrument. Punjab has been implementingsystem-wide
reforms, which are backed by a significant increase in the education budget. The DPL i s the
appropriate instrument to support cross-sectoral areas linked to the education reform program
such as fiscal decentralization process and governance reforms. Further, lessons from Bank



25 The Pakistan authorities have decided not to seek a successor arrangement after the expiry of the PRGF
arrangement in December 2004. The Fundwill maintain a dialogue with the authorities on economic and
financial developments and policies in the context o f the Fund's normal consultations with member
countries.




                                                                                                       25

experience with investment projects in Pakistan show that policy reforms require commitment
and ownership beyond sector line ministries. The second DPL also builds upon the credible
progress accomplished under the first credit. The Punjab Government has a good program and
strategy in place to improve education quality and outcomes, malung it suitable for support
through the DPL instrument.

Prior Actions CompletedandActions Priorto FutureCredits

71.      The choice of prior actions and triggers is linked to the three reform pillars of
PESRP. These prior action and triggers are critical to achieving the development objectives in
each reform area, mitigating risks, and ensuringsustainability. The triggers support those actions
that would show an impact in the long term, would be less amenable to reversals, and could be
sustained inthe long term. Thus, these triggers focus on sector policy and financing, governance
aspects, strengthening the relationship between the provincial and district governments, and
bringing about structural changes inthe education sector, with a view to improving both access
and quality. Adjustments to the prior actions for the second Credit have been made to reflect the
progress in reform implementation and the move towards second generation reforms. Some o f
the triggers for the secondCredit identifiedinthe first year have been merged inthe TOPs while
a few have been rephrased or updated in order to reflect the realistic progress. The Government
has submitted an updated Letter of Sector Development Policy for the second program year to
reflect the progress and the programdirection duringthe coming years (see Annex 1).

Sustainability of Sector Financing after the Reform Program Period

74.     The continued strong commitment o f the Provincial Government to education as
demonstrated by public pronouncements, good implementation progress, and budgetary
allocations assures its sustainability.     In order to build upon the early indications of sector
improvements and to come closer to achieving MDGs, the government would need to extend the
programbeyond the three year period with assured financing. The PESRP, as designed, i s likely
to generate a stream of recurrent expenditure needsinthe post-program period. These expenditure
requirements, which are over and above the normal growth in sector spending, are required to
meet the recurring costs for the institutions developed under the Program, and for continuation of
Programinitiatives. These factors will leadto a more than 12 % p.a. increase ineducation sector
recurrent expenditure in the post-PESRP period. Regarding the development expenditure,
additional funds would be requiredto meet the needs for growing enrollments at the primary level
and to meet the growing pressure on the middle and secondary school systems. Moreover, to
meet the demands on increased enrollments, new teacher positions may also be warranted. The
Government's strategy for reducingthe cost o f development schemes includes financing low cost
community-based construction through School Councils. Primary school enrollment increases
will warrant the need for additional classrooms in existing schools. However, as almost all
missing facilities in primary schools are expected to be provided under the PESRP, large
allocations for the missing facilities will no longer be required. The net effect o f these factors
will lead to a 9% increase in the development budget o f the education sector in 2006/07-
2011/12.26 Overall, expenditures in the education sector are projected to increase at 13% per
annum in the post-PESRP period.           These are likely to be sufficient to meet the significantly
increasedneeds of the recurrent budget as well as some increasesinthe development budget.

75.     Inorder to finance these andother highpriorityexpenditures, the PunjabGovernment has
devised a medium-term strategy to strengthen its finances which requires improving provincial
revenue collection, reducing non-productive expenditures, and improving the efficiency and
quality o f its expenditures. On the basis o f this strategy, the Government has formulated a
MediumTerm Budget Framework (MTBF) which shows substantial increases in allocations for
the education sector (more than doubling over the next four years). These increases do not pre-
empt resources from other highpriority sectors as the MTBF projects similar increases for other
highpriority expenditure^.^^

76.     This implies that after allowing for the increase in education and other high-priority
expenditures, the fiscal position of the Punjab Government will continue to improve and the large
fiscal deficit of 2003/04 i s projected to reduce and eventually turn into surplus by 2009/10.
Therefore, if the Punjab Government implements its overall reform program as designed and in
accordance with its medium-termstrategy, the fiscal sustainability o f PESRP will be maintained,
even under the scenario of mild fiscal shocks (e.g. some moderate increase in public sector
salaries, or shortfalls infederal revenue collections). Bank support for education beyondthe three
year program period will provide continued incentives to government and would also assist in
maintaining a focus on quality o f expenditures.




26As this increase of 9% will be on an already increasedbase establishedunder PESRP, the development
budget increases are deemed as appropriate for meeting the needs of the sector.
27 See Annex 3: Fiscal Management and Sustainability.



                                                                                                    28

Poverty, Gender and Social Impact Analysis

77.      Policies and programs supported by this Credit are pro-poor and aim at reducing
gender inequities. The program seeks to provide access to schooling for poor and underserved
areas.    Incidence analysis o f public education expenditures in Palustan shows that these
expenditures are clearly pro-poor and thus, even without the full impact of reforms, the increased
spending on public education will benefit the poor. The operation also aims at reducing gender
disparities by focusing on increasing girls' access to education, while reducing inequities by
emphasizing increased access to schooling for vulnerable urban andruralpoor.

78.      The program has been designed on the basis of extensive consultations with
stakeholders and beneBciaries, including in-depth meetings and discussions with local
government officials, district education teams, and NGOs. These consultations have built
ownership o f the program among the stakeholders. The emphasis onrevitalizing School Councils
i s a key element of the program, which aims to enhance community and parental involvement in
education, particularly to improve teacher and school management and enhance enrollments.
NGO participation is a major aspect of the program. The Government has engaged NGOs for
mobilization and capacity building of School Councils, as well as for increasing access in
underserved areas.      Other publidprivate partnership efforts will be supported through a
restructured Punjab Education Foundation which will provide financial support to low-cost
private sector institutions and NGOs to help increase access to schooling among the urban and
rural poor. Through supporting increased private participation in education service delivery, the
Punjab Government aims to ensure equity by focusing on districts with the lowest education
indicators, and emphasizing reductions in the urban-rural disparities by encouraging private
sector provision in underserved rural areas. Consultations with stakeholders have thus been
mainstreamed inthe programand are an on-going activity.

79.      An overarching objectiveof the PESRP is to reducegender inequities in theprovince.
To this end, the female scholarship program targeting girls inmiddle school (in the districts that
have the lowest literacy rates inthe first year) i s already helpingto increase girls' enrollment and
retention. Other efforts to address the gender issue include the Punjab Government's policy to
recruit female teachers, and the provision o f missing facilities such as boundary walls and toilets
for girls' schools. Over one half of the expenditures for provision of missing facilities have been
spent on improving girls' schools. In the context of gender sensitive approach for girl's schools,
the program involves mothers in the School Councils to represent parents. The appointment of
facility specific teachers at the local level benefits female teachers who will not need to travel
long distances. Under the new contract policy, preference i s also given to recruitment o f female
teachers.

Environmental Aspects

80.      The Punjab Government's policy confirms that no substantive large-scale construction
that i s likely to have irreversible environmental impacts i s planned.        Further, the policies
supported under the program are not likely to cause significant effects on the environment. The
Punjab Government's environment policy also ensures that environmental safeguards and
specifications are inplace against any possible adverse impacts associatedwith any rehabilitation
work. The TOPS also include environmental guidelines. The program will ensure that water
supplied to the schools meets the required quality standards. It will be tested annually and if
found lacking, mitigation measures will be undertaken. The water supply scheme will be located



                                                                                                   29

at a reasonable distance from toilets and septic tanks to prevent contamination of drinkmgwater.
The government's program provides missing facilities to schools. Under government's policy,
during construction for provision of missing facilities, steps will be taken to ensure safety of
students in the schools and for minimizing dust and noise. There are no new schools planned.
However, even if new schools are planned, there will be no involuntary land acquisition and
hence no resettlement. According to Punjab Government's policy and guidelines, should a need
for construction of new facilities arise, land will be acquired through voluntary donation, will be
free of encumbrance, identifiedby the community and the locationwill be feasible.

Monitoring and Evaluation System

81.     Systemic Changes. The Government of Punjab (GoP) has established the Program
Monitoring and Implementation Unit (PMIU) under the Provincial Education Department. The
PMIU is responsible for both: (a) monitoring and evaluating the impact o f the overall programon
public primary schooling; and (b) implementation o f certain key components o f the reform
program itself. The PMIU has revamped the Education Management InformationSystem (EMIS)
by: (a) building EMIS capacity at the district level; (b) strengthening the technical skills at the
EMIS district hub locatedwithin the district education office (EDO); (c) recruiting good quality
staff with computer skills at the district level who are trained by PMIU and external computer
consultancy firms; (d) extending the list o f data collected by EMIS to include reform program
monitoring variables; and (e) reducing the use of multiplesoftware by EMIS and using a standard
software which allows EMIS data to be fully accessible.

82.     Outcome and Output Indicators. The proposed Credit will support the Government of
Punjab in accomplishing the outcomes and outputs listed in the Matrix of Policy Reforms (see
Annex 2).     These indicators are also aligned with monitoring matrix developed by the
Government o f Pakistan for the education sector in the PRSP. The PRSP also emphasizes three
main output or intermediate indicators for the sector: (i)    number o f functioning schools, (ii)
number of trainedteachers and, (iii)   reduction in teacher absenteeism. These indicators are also
core intermediate indicators for the PESRP.

83.     OutcomeIndicators. The outcome indicators that are included inthe PRSP monitoring
framework are being used, including enrollment rates for primary and middle school levels, and
completionrates at the primary level (see Annex 2).

84.     Baseline and Impact Data. Baseline data on public school enrollment i s available from
the School Census 2002 and also the education department's district profile prepared in April
2003. Gaps in this baseline data have been filled by the P M N . A public school census was
conducted in February 2004 and a repeat census was conducted in October 2004 to assess the
enrollment trends. The reduction o f teacher absenteeism i s one of the main PESRP objectives
and the PMIU has launched a third party survey to collect this data. Data on overall school
enrollments will be available through the CWIQ household survey during2005.

85.     Independent Third-party Surveys. External agencies have been contracted to conduct
independent third-party surveys to verify implementation o f program interventions. While the
efficacy of the textbook distribution program can be assessed via internal PMIU generated
information, an external agency has been contracted to verify whether textbooks are actually
reaching the school/pupils (via a random survey of over 3000 schools). A thirdparty validation i s
also underway to assess via physical verification whether the eligible females are actually
receiving the stipend, and to verify from pupils and households whether the stipend i s reaching
the intendedbeneficiaries. The preliminary analysis indicates that the textbooks and stipends are
indeedreaching the intendedbeneficiaries. Altogether this constitutes a significant achievement


                                                                                                 30

in intemal and external data harmonization to provide policymakers with comprehensive and
credible information regardingthe reform program.

86.     Impact Evaluation. One o f the key objectives o f the program, related to the MDGs, is to
increase enrollment, retention and completion rates in public primary schools by improving the
accessibility, accountability and quality o f public primary schools. A rigorous impact evaluation
will be conducted to assess the impact of the reform program on overall primary school
enrollments inthe province Inview o f the large share o f private sector inschool enrollments, the
evaluation would need to take into account the possible influence of the reform program
interventionson parental choice betweenprivate andpublic schools.

87.      Initial Assessment of Impact of Stipends on Enrollment. Even though it i s premature to
conduct any thorough evaluation o f PESRP (on public or private schooling outcomes) a pre-
condition for the second Credit requiredan evaluation o f the female stipend program. The PMIU
has done a supplementary survey o f 50 randomly picked schools to look at the impact o f the
reform program. Preliminary analysis from that survey indicates a 20% increase inenrollment in
district in which females have received stipends While this does not suffice as a rigorous
evaluation, this evidence is consistent with the findings o f the October 2004 school census. The
Government i s currently taking the necessarysteps to conduct a rigorous impact evaluation of the
female stipend program incollaboration with the Bank. A draft report of the evaluation study on
the impact of the stipendprogramonpublic school enrollment i s expected to be completed during
2005. Based on the results of this evaluation, the Govemment will consider further expansion o f
the stipends program.

CapacityBuilding

88.      A comprehensive program for strengthening the existing monitoring and evaluation
system i s under implementation and i s fully financed under the program. Through this program,
specific support i s being provided to district education staff. In addition, the Government has
also allocated program budget for district capacity building activities including training in
financial management, accounting, and planning (for further details see Box 2).              Parallel
Technical Assistance (TA) through DFID i s now in an advanced stage of finalization, with
implementation expected by June 2005. DFIDTA will include support for School Councils, and
parallel support for provincial and district education departments' capacity enhancement
programs.

FiduciaryAspects

89.      An IMF Safeguards Assessment of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was conducted in
2001. It highlighted significant vulnerabilities at the SBP particularly as relating to its financial
statements and disclosure policies which fell short o f acceptable Central Bank standards.
However, since a program o f reform had since been agreed with the IMF and was being
implemented, the risks associated with foreign exchange management control have been
mitigated.

90.      The key fiduciary issue is the Government's ability to ensure that funds are used in the
manner and for the purposes for which they were intended. From the financial management
perspective, the CFAA revealed several weaknesses in data reliability, particularly below the
federal level. A number o f initiatives and actions are currently being implemented to remedy a
significant number o f lapses, inorder to further strengthen the accountability process. The CFAA
however concluded that notwithstanding the lapses which are currently being addressedthrough a
series o f reform measures, the fiduciary risk to Bank funds and other donor funds managed


                                                                                                  31

through mainstream government systems in Palustan i s minimal.           It cited improvements in
expenditure tracking and concluded that development policy loans disbursed and managed
through reliance on government-own financial management systems have shown satisfactory
outcomes. The report recognized however that greater effort is required inbuilding institutional
and personnel capacity to engender increased comfort and support the transition to full reliance
on government systems, controls and financial reporting.              Among the initiatives being
implementedat the moment i s the PIFRA at the federal, provincial and district levels. Punjab, as
a province, i s committedto adopting PFRA and is fully gearedto preparingthe provincial budget
for FY05/06 on the basis o f the new chart of accounts, which i s IMF `Government Financial
Statistics' (GFS) compliant.

91.       The Provincial Finance Department has responded to the need to improve financial
management at the district level and in all provincial departments by initiating the recruitment of
fifty qualified finance and accounting staff, many of whom will be located inthe districts. The
education department has also developed internal audit and control functions through the already
established PMIU in the Department o f Education which in addition to monitoring and program
evaluation, is overseeing the implementation of need-basedcapacity programs at the district level.
Recruitment of internal audit staff at the district level is underway.

92.       As a further measure for fiduciary risk management and control at the province, the
provincial government has agreed, in collaboration with the Bank, to the carrying out o f a
comprehensive `Financial Accountability Assessment' (PFAA) for the Province during FY05.
This would capture the additional specific strengths andweaknessesinfinancial accountability in
the province with a view to introducing further capacity buildingmeasures,where necessary. The
outcome of the Assessment will be included inthe prior actions of the third credit, and will form
part o f the reform agenda of the province for the following years.

93.       To ensure proper trackmg o f education sector expenditures under the reform program the
following specific measuresare being implemented:

              Education expenditures are being reported in greater detail through the introduction
              of specific heads of accounting;
              The District Accounts Office regularly prepare and send consolidated reports o f
              expenditures to the Education Department (PMIU), as well as to the provincial
              Finance Department. This information i s cross-checked with information available
              from the Executive District Officer (EDO-Finance);
              Information on utilization of funds i s tied to physical progress and targets for each
              district. This enables the Finance Department to justify additional financing requests
              for eachdistrict, whennecessary; and
              The PMIU has been staffed with qualified accountants who are working with the
              districts to develop focused programs to build district education departments'
              financial management capacities.

94.       The Government o f Punjab has also undertaken broad procurement reforms to improve
economy, transparency and accountability in the procurement process, and to eliminate
procedures and practices that impede competition.             Under the ADB supported PRMP the
Government has developed streamlined and simplified rules and procedures for use by the
procuring agencies at the provincial and local government level. The education sector program i s
benefitingfromreforms at the provincial level.

These include the following:



                                                                                                 32

        0    The Composite Schedule o f Rates (CSR) has been replaced by market-based
             schedule.
        0    The bidding process has now opened up with contractor qualification requirements
             and evaluation criteria specified in the bidding documents, and evaluation o f bids is
             conducted according to the specified criteria.
        0    Adequate time i s now allowed to bidders for preparation and submission o f bids, and
             the practice o f Gallop tendering has been restricted to emergencies in exceptional
             cases with prior approval o f the Heado f the implementing agency.
        0    Capacity development and training programs for procurement staff has been
             implemented at the provincial and district level.

CreditAdministration,Disbursements,andAudit

95.     Borrower and Credit Agreement. This proposed second Credit would be made to the
Islamic Republic o f Palustan, represented by the Federal Ministry o f Finance. The Credit
proceeds would be transferred by the Federal Govemment to the Govemment o f Punjab under
agreed IDA terms.

96.     Disbursements and Audit: The Govemment o f Pakistan shall establish a Special Deposit
Account with the State Bank o f Palustan (SBP) into which the proceeds o f the Credit will be
disbursed on a single tranche basis upon Credit effectiveness. The Rupees equivalent o f the funds
inthe Account will, within two worlung days, be transferred into the ConsolidatedFundo f the
Government o f Punjab (Account No. 1) held with the SBP. Disbursements from the Consolidated
Fund for activities to be financed under the Program by the Government o f Punjab shall not be
linked to any specific purchases, and n o special procurement requirement shall be needed. The
proceeds o f the Credit shall, however, not be applied to finance expenditures in the negative list
as defined in the Schedule of the DCA. Ifany portion o f the Credit i s used to finance ineligible
expenditures as so defined in the DCA, IDA shall require the Govemment to reimburse the
amount to the Special Deposit Account to finance eligible expenditures or refund the amount to
the IDA. The SBP, on behalf o f the Government, shall maintain an appropriate accounting
system in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles. For the purpose o f this
Credit, the Bank may request an audit to be carried out within 4 months o f receipt o f the funds
into the Special Deposit Account, with a view to providing a `special opinion' as to the receipt o f
funds into the special deposit account held with the SBP and the eventual transfer o f the local
currency equivalent o f such funds into the Consolidated Fund Account o f the Government o f
Punjab. Within forty-five days of receipt o f the proceeds o f the Credit in the Consolidated Fund
Account o f the Govemment o f Punjab, the Government o f Punjab, through the Finance Secretary
o f the province, shall provide a certificate to the Bank, attested by the Director General o f
Provincial Audit, Punjab, that the funds have indeed been received and credited to the Province's
Consolidated Account.

LessonsLearned

97.     This second development policy Credit draws upon and benefits from the early lessons
leamed from the first sector adjustment lending program for Punjab, the experience o f provincial
adjustment programs inPalustan, Bank-wide experience with adjustment lending, and experience
o f sector investment projects in Palustan. Instructive lessons have been leamed during the past
year:




                                                                                                 33

        Strong political championship, government ownership and commitment is essential for
        the success and continuity o f a reformprogram. This leads to high level monitoring and
        oversight, which creates a momentum in the system to focus on outcomes. Alignment of
        vision and strategy among the key set o f policy makers and implementation teams is
        essential. Financial and technical support o f an extemal agency, such as the Bank, can be
        meaningful if these conditions are in place. These conditions need to be matched with
        champions at the implementation level, supported by strong dedicated teams.

        A programmatic lending instrument based on a series o f annual single tranche
        disbursements works well when based on strong quantifiable prior actions, and when
        backed by intensive ongoing dialogue anchored on policy and implementation reviews.
        While this can pose additional administrative burden on both the Bank and the
        govemment, it can, and does, encourage timely course corrections.

        Analytical work prior to the program is important, but equally critical i s ongoing
        analytical work that can feed into annual program design. The second Credit builds on
        the findings o f the provincial expenditure review, emerging results from the teacher
        management study, and the public private partnership study.

        While reviewing the progress inreform implementation, it i s necessary to ensure eficient
        implementation of new reform areas in order for the program to remain credible. An
        example inthe Punjab programhas been the timely availability o f textbooks and stipends.

        Institutionalization of reforms in the mainstream government systems is important. While
        the first Credit did not have specific actions in this regard, the second operation focuses
         on this through the capacity buildingactions underway within the provincial and district
         education departments.

BenefitsandRisks

98.     Before thefirst Credit thisprogram was considered a high-benefit, high-risk program
but the first year of implementation shows a reduction in risk and higher benefits than
anticipated. The main benefits come from reversing the slide in education indicators, bringing
more children into school up to grade 8 (particularly poor children and girls) sooner than
previously expected, and providing them with better quality education. The program would
contribute to closing the social gap and helping the Country progress toward the MDGs related to
poverty reduction and Education For All (EFA). Improvements ineducation outcomes inPunjab,
the largest province o f Pakistan, would have a countrywide impact, and success could motivate
other provinces to follow a similar path and undertake sector-wide reforms. Another indirect, but
important, benefit is that the program i s strengthening decentralization by increasing the role o f
districts and promoting accountability between service users (parents and students) and service
providers (schools and teachers).

99.      The major risk expected came from Pakistan's history o f lack o f sustained support to the
education agenda. The factors mitigating this risk were: (a) the Punjab Government continues to
drive the reform program and has the full backing o f the provincial Chief Executive; (b) the
district governments regular engagement and support for education sector; (c) the increasing
realization in Pakistan o f the strong links between education -particularly girls' education - and
economic growth; and (d) a strong determination to reverse the slide in the Province's social
indicators. Early indications o f program implementation suggest that these riskmitigating factors
were appropriate. However, there i s always an inherent political risk in democratic systems that



                                                                                                 34

change in government through the electoral process can shift priorities. The intensive awareness
campaign and early indications of enrollment increaseshave generatedrising expectations among
the public. It i s likely that even ifthere i s a change of government, there will be continuedpublic
pressure to deliver.

100.     Preliminary outcomes data i s showing a rapid increase in enrollments. This can be a
major risk if these expanded numbers overwhelm the system by causing pressure on the already
extended physical infrastructure, and if quality improvements do not keep up with the increasing
numbers of children entering the public education system. Factors mitigating this risk are: (a)
identifying, through intense monitoring efforts, areas where schools are experiencing rapid
increases in enrollment, and malung provision o f additional physical facilities and staffing to
these schools; (b) launching a comprehensive professional development program for teachers to
improve quality of education; and (c) Government's agreement to increase sector expenditures in
accordance with the growing demand for education.

101.     Another major risk lay inthe evolving roles and responsibilitieso f the local govemments
relative to the Provincial Government, as devolved system of govemment was still gradually
talung shape. Factors mitigating this risk had been: (a) the Terms of Partnership agreements
clearly defined the roles and responsibilities o f the provincial and district govemments for
program implementation; (b) fiscal decentralization in Punjab was more advanced than in other
provinces; and (c) compared to other provinces, Punjab had greater alignment between district
governments and the province. The first year's experience proves that while the risk remains, it
i s less significant. Moreover, the early successes have added to the credibility of the program.
There i s however an inherent politicalriskas the local govemment elections are scheduled during
2005 when new elected representatives would take charge. The risk mitigating measure i s that
given the early successes o f the program, and the widespread awareness generated by the
Program, and the incentive o f increased resources for education, the new elected officials would
be likely to continue the partnership with the provincial government.

102.     Weak institutional capacity, especially at the district level, to implement and monitor the
program poses another risk. This risk is being addressed through the: (a) appointment o f new
ExecutiveDistrict Officer for Education in all districts; (b) creation o f new positions of District
Monitoring Officers in all districts; (c) implementation of capacity development programs for
district staff; and (d) strengtheningo f district levelEMIScapacity.

103.     There were potential risks from weak financial management capacity at the provincial
and district levels that could hamper implementation of the reform program. These risks are
beingmitigated by actions taken duringthe first program and in the progressive implementation
o f PIFRA. Essentially, the fiduciary risk for this sectoral program i s now rated `low' due to the
series o f reform actions taken within the education sector to address the hitherto core lapses of
financial control.

104.     There is continuing risk that School Councils (SCs) will not be allowed to function as
needed, or they may have weak capacity. This riskwas mitigatedby issuingappropriate financial
and administrative guidelines to empower SCs, as well as by contracting with NGOs for capacity
development o f School Councils. Duringthe secondprogram year, SCs are authorized to receive
school-based budgets, for both civil works and recurring expenditures. To enable SCs to fulfill
these responsibilities, parallel capacity support has been builtinto the program.

I    Subject:          LETTER OF SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY
I
I
!    The Punjab Government has shown its firm commitment to put into operation far reaching
     reforms to bring about visible improvements in the education sector. Education is the core
i    and foremost priority of the Punjab Government, This commitment has beendemonstrated by
     the achievements made in the first year of the Punjab Government's education sector reform
     program being implemented with support from the World Bank. The full programme
     objectives and parameters were presented in the Letter o f Sector Development Policy issued
     by Government o f Punjab on December 26, 2003. This letter reiterates the policy framework
     and provides updates based on the experience of the first year.


     AS a result of intervcntions made under the reform program, we are seeing impressive
     increase in public school enrollments (more than 13% over a one year period) at the primary
     level and a rise in public confidence   in education service delivery in the province. A key
      achievement o f the programme has been managing on time delivery of free primary school
     textbooks and stipends     - for the first time ever in Punjab, almost all the primary school
      students in government schools had their textbooks in hand at the start of the school year in
      April 2004. Stipends for middle school girls enrolled in government schools in fifteen low
      literacy districts o f the province are being distributed, and have already resulted in an
      increase in female enrollment in these grades by 23% (from 175,000 to 216,000).        Other
      achievements include the restructuring of the monitoring and evaluation system and
      development of credible data bases; initiation of district capacity building programmes;
      enhancement in the role of school councils in school management; provision o f missing

      facilities to schools; and successful commencement of quaIity and access enhancing reforms
      such as opening up textbook development and restructuring of the teacher professional
       development system. A clear indicator of our commitment to education is the unprecedented
       increase in allocation for education in the 2003-04 and 2004-05 budgets.




                                                                                                   1

     implement this education reform programme.            A province wide education awareness
     campaign has been successfully launched which has generated public interest and provided
     ongoing awareness about the programme interventions and objectives.                The reform
     programme measures are being institutionalised at both provincial axid district levels to




     These measures are beginning to reverse the past trends of poor performance o f the education
     sector in Punjab. The sector had been beset historically with a host o f issues that have
      impeded the provision o f quality education in public schools. These issues ranged from
      uneven political commitment to improvements in access to and quality o f education,
      insuficient allocations, lack of expenditure prioritization, frequent policy changes, high
      turnover o f personnel in leadership positions, poor governance practices, and unwillingness

I     or inability of service providers to comprehend and tackle the demand side problems. All of
      these contributed to low participation and retention rates.


      Moreover, spending on education as a proportion of recurrent expenditures had also declined,
       from around 30.9% (in which the share of elementary education is between 55% to 58%) in
       1997-98 to just over 26% in 2000-01. Similarly, the share o f education in development
       expenditures fell sharply from around 9% in 1997-98 to approximately 5% in2002-03.


       The last PIHS of 2001/2002 did not show improvement in education outcomes,           Punjab's
       primary Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) of 76% and Net Enrollment Rate o f 45%, (though
       marginally higher than the national averages o f 72% and 42%, respectively) illustrate the
       problemof limited access to education, which is more severe in the case of females and rural
        inhabitants. The provincial GER for boys (84%) is 15 percentage points higher than that for
        girls at 69%, while the urban-rural differential is even starker (the urban GER is 94% while
        the rural enrollment rate stands at only 70%). T h e Department of Education estimates the
        dropout rate at primary level in government schools to be 55%, while that at the elementary
        level to be almost 80%, signaling poor efficiency o f the public education system.


                                                                                                    2

    ' '      The low participation rates at the higher levels of education further signify the public

I            system's inability to retain students. The Punjab GER at the middle level o f education was
!
i            45% in 2001-02 With an urban GER of 65% and a rural rate o f 36%. At the secondary level,
I            the urban and rural GERS for Punjab were 66% and 33% respectively, giving an overall
             participation rate o f 42%. GERS at the secondary level exhibited a wide gender differential,
 i           withthe GER for malesbeing55% compared with the GER for females of 34%.

 I
 1           While the disappointing levels of enrollment are partly related to household poverty, other

 i           factors that have affected participation rates to date include a sex-segregated system of
             schooling, poor siting o f schools, the imbalanced provision of infrastructure and non-salary
             inputs-with a large number of insti&tions lacking basic facilities, the non-availability and
             mal-distribution of teachers and their casual attitude towards duty.            Non merit-based
              recruitment o f teachers coupled with poor supervision, weak accountability mechanisms and
              inadequate training of staff resulted in teacher absenteeism and a workforce that was ill-
              equipped to fulfill its teaching responsibilities, thereby adversely affecting the quality of
              instruction ingovernment schools,


              At the start of the reform programme several schools were closednon-functional due to the
              inappropriate location o f schools or non-appointment of teachers due to long periods of
               recruitment bans. Moreover, many schools were in need of critical infrastructure such as
               boundary walls, additional classrooms, toilets, and water and sanitation facilities. On the
               basis o f a comprehensive survey that helped prepate a detailed needs assessment, a
               programme is under implementationwhich is providing missing facilities to schools.


               `The inferior quality of schooling delivered by the public school system has been forcing even
               the less privilegedhouseholds to seek education for their children in private schools that cater
               to all income ranges. The private sector is taking on a more prominent role, not only in the
                man urban centers (where 65% of the private schools are located) but also in rural areas of
                the relatively affluent districts of the province. We, therefore, find that of the 36,000 private
                schools in the country, 24,000 are located in Punjab, of which 78%, 15% and 5% are
                involved in delivering primary, middle and higher education respectively, with 94%
                providing mixed schooling.

          Punjab Education Sector Reform Programme (PESRP)


         Recognizing the importance o f education for economic growth and social harmony, the
          Government of Punjab decided to undertake far-reaching reforms inthe education sector, and
          launched a three year Punjab Education Sector R e f o m Programme (PESRP) in 2003-2004.
          These reforms tie-in perfectly with: a) the govemance reforms under the national devolution
          programme aimed at improvements in efficiency, equity, effectiveness and sustainability of
          public' service delivcry through the creation o f local ownership, responsiveness to local needs
          and accountability to the public; and b) the wide-ranging economic reform programme
          launched by the Government o f the Punjab (GoP) with the support of the Asian Development
          Bank (A-DB) through the Punjab Resource Management Programme (PRMP) that aims to
          create fiscal   space for financing priority expenditures through the rationalization and
           restructuring of provincial revenue sources, the broadening o f the tax base and reduction in
          provincial debt. The education sector reforms are also consistent with national priorities, as
           appropriately reflected in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the goals of the
           provincial PRSP


           The PESRF aims to improve access and quality of education and reduce gender and regional
           disparities by addressing the endemic weaknesses plaguing the delivery of quality education.
           l h e decision to make schooling free up to the secondary level and o f giving stipends to girls
           students of elementary classes in more disadvantaged districts of the province clearly reflects

           our strong commitment to a more equitable access to all levels o f school education.


            The primary objective is to bring about an increase in enrollment and retention in government
            schools, SO as to enhance the gross enrollment rates at the primary and middle level and
            improve the quality o f service delivery. The programme was launched during 2003-04, and
            the results expected from these reforms have far exceeded the targets set in the originally
            envisioned Education Sector Reforms strategy.          In fact, based on latest school census
            conducted in October 2004, Punjab has experienced a phenomenal 13% increased in primary
            enrolment since the programme interventions have been made. The increase in girls' middle

            school enrolment in the fifteen low literacy districts is about 23%. Keeping this in view new
             targets for 2004-05 and 2005-06 are being worked out to keep up with the increased




                                                                                                           4

              demands. The Government is also taking rapid steps to meet the increase in demand wlth  Annex 1-
    I..:
    '' ;I. q.,,timely  provision of teachingstaff and additional classrooms.


              Since education up to college level has been mandatedto district govemments, ownership of
              the broad contours of ihe reform strategy has been developed at the local level through
              extensive dialogue with representatives of district governments, Nazims, Nib-Nazims,
              DCOs and EDOs, interactions with community representatives in School Councils and
              NGOs. Their concems and recommendationshave been appropriately reflected inthe design
              and implementation of the reform programme detailedbelow. Follow up consultationshave
              beenheld during the pastyear to take course corrections during programmeimplementation.


              The government's priorities for the education sector hinge on three core areas of focus:
              (a) creating a better environment for learning (through an infrastructure improvement
              plan and increased provision OF non-salary inputs to existing schools); (b) enhancing

              teacher capabilities and ensuring their presence in schools; and (c) increasing enrollment
               and retention rates through the provision of incentives for parents to sendtheir children to
               schools, all contributing to improvements in access to, and quality of, education. The

I              multi-pronged reform agenda to achieve these objectives focus on raising enrollment

1              levels at rates that vary for different parts of the Punjab, by selecting an appropriate

I               composition of interventions. The core elements of the strategy include distribution of

                 The government is committed to increasing the resources available for education. Due to
                  sizeable allocations provided for the initiatives of PESRP, the 2003-04 provincial budget
                  showed an increase of 39% for education. Overall, expenditure on education was higher by
                  41% in 2003-04. In 2004-05 the provincial budget has been increased by 18% over the
                  previousyear i.e. to Rs. 52 billion. O f the additional allocation of Rs. 8.3 billion in the 2004-
                  05 development budget, Rs. 5 billion have again been set aside for infrastructural

                     To improve both the transparency and the efficiency in the financing and managementof the
                     education sector and to ensure that the funds provided are utilizedfor the purposes intended,
                     contractual agreements through appropriately designed terms of partnership agreements (that
                     set out the responsibilities of the provincial and district governments with respect to
                     programme implementation, monitoring and utilization of funds) are signed with all the
                     district governments. For the second year of the programme covering 2004-05, TOPs have

  I                  been signed to take into account the updated output and outcome indicator targets. The

  I                  distribution of funds has been on the basis of a need cum performance formula endorsed by
  I                  Provincial Finance Commission (PFC).



   i                 After the determined initial push in the first two years of the reform program, efforts in

   I                 subsequentyears will focus on the consolidation of the resulting gains and its expansion at
                     the elementary and secondary levels to accommodate the growing number enrolling, or
                     continuing to stay, in mainstreameducation by graduating from the lower levels. The revised
                      Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF) reflects provincial government's                      firm
                      commitment to further increase the education sector allocations by an average of 17% per
                      annum for the next threeyears.


                      Overall, during the current fiscal year, the framework of reform programme continues to be

                      anchored on governance, devolution and economic management reforms backed by sector .

    I                 specific reforms. During the current year, in addition to continuation of the overdl reform
                      framework, there is a special focus on the following sector-specific areas to enhance both
                      quality and access to education, and to improve the governance of the education sector:



                                                                                                                   6

.   "

            To address teacher quality issues, the programme has developed a merit based teacher
            selection criteria with higher weightage for graduate teachers.    Over thirty thousand new

i           contract facility based teachers have been recruited to date, under a transparent recruitment
i           process.
i                     Data available from the district governments is being analyzed for re-deploying
i           teachers to rationalizepupil-teacherratios. Shortages in teaching staff after the completionof

i
1'!         this redeployment exercise will be met through additional contract based facility-specific
            contracts.


            In view of the importance of enhancing teacher' capabilities and skills, a comprehensive
            professional development programme (with a detailedactionplan for the first year) has been
            developed. The Directorate of Staff Development (DSD) has been de-linked from the
            University of Education (UoE) and given the task of developing professional development
            programmes for in-service teachers. Partnerships are being developed with private sector
            training institutions to complement Government efforts. A Third Party Review of teacher
             competency will be conductedafter each trainingprogrammeto assess its efficacy.


                     CommunityInvolvement


             The Governmentof Punjab realizes the needto encourage greater community participationin
             the monitoringand managemento f education relatedservices and has decided to promote the
             institution of School Councils (SCs).      The Punjab Government has already re-notified
             guidelines for SCs in order to clarify their membership constitution and their functions. It
             has launched a pilot capacity building programme in six districts by contracting NGOSto
             strengthen the capacity of SCs. SCs were authorized to implement civil works up to Rs.
             200,000, which has now beenenhancedto Rs. 400,000. Further,the Punjab Government has
             approved and issued policy guidelines for establishment of schoo1,basedbudgets, and this is
             now being implemented. Twenty districts have provided these budgets, and districts have
              also started release of funds to the SCs' accounts, enabling them to undertake small works
              and improvements for the school.

           The girls' stipend programme, which provides a monthly stipend to girls in government

!i         middle school grades in fifteen low literacy districts, has been extremely successful and has
           resulted in 23% increase in enrolment of girls at middle level. It is expected that the stipend
           programme would be extended to other districts and classes in the coming years once a
           complete impactevaluation is conducted.

            A fimd for financing improvement and provision of missing facilities to schools has been

  I         established to address the huge needs of the sector, To ensure the efficient utilization of

  I         these resources, district governments have prepared a complete inventory of the status of
            their stock of physical facilities in schools. Resultantly, development works for providing
            missing facilities to schools are now beingcarried out on the basis of the identified needs of
            the sector, as reflectedin these district profiles.

                     The Role ofPrivateSector


             Recognizing the important role being played by the private sector in the provision of
             education, the Government of Punjab advocates a broader role for the private sector and
             plans to facilitate its activities through a number of measures, including public private
             partnershipschemes inwhich private schools can complement the public sector in increasing

     + !.    I                                                                                   Annex 1-
               access. The Punjab Education Foundation (PEF) has been restructured through an Act of the
.I       .'. sq
   'I

I              Provincial Assembly. The PEF will be the forum to support public-private partnerships. As

.   n          part of expanding access to education in underserved areas of the province, a comprehensive
               policy for the private sector will be developed. A Board of the Foundation, ledby the private
               sector, has been notified, and is preparing to begin its work. Government o f Punjab is also
               examining the concept of expanding the programme for free textbooks and stipends to low
               cost private schools.


                       Monitoring and Evaluation


               The Government of Punjab has established strong monitoring and evaluation systems for the
               education sector in the province. The four major elements of monitoring and evaluation
               being undertaken for the PESRP include: a) improved database management (through a
               revamped EMIS); b) intemal verification work by way of ongoing monitoring efforts; c)           ,

               Third Party Validation (TPV) exercises to provide an extemal.verification source of delivery
               of inputs; and, d) impact and evaluation studies to help assess progress inachieving outcomes
               and social gains of the program. The new system of database management and ongoing
               monitoring is based on demand-based information needs to provide data and information for
               key policy and reform elements, To support these efforts, third party validation exercises
               have been initiated and are being institutionalized as part o f keeping a close check on
                programme inputs and them reaching the children and schools. Already TF'Vs have been
                conducted to assess availability of textbooks and stipends, and also to verify the enrollment
                figures collected under the school census. Another source of external validation for the
                programme is the Chief Minister's Monitoring Teams that also provide a check on
                programme inputs. The Punjab Government is also making efforts to conduct an interim
                impact study by analyzing enrollment data, specifically    to determine the impact of various
                inputs (such as stipends, free textbooks, recruitment o f contract teachers, improved
                infrastructure) on enrollments.


                The Government of Punjab is confident of the sustainability of the reform program
                because: (a) similar policies are being pursued nationally; (b) the fiscal situation has
                 improved substantially (with GDP and fiscal revenues growing at higher than expected
                 rates) and there is adequate fiscal space for continuing with program interventions in the
                 future from the savings on debt senticing arising from the accelerated repayments of debt


                                                                                                             9

   i--j         with ADB's support under the PRMP; (c) the strategy was derived through extensive
          '7    consultations with district governments that articulated local priorities and needs,
                strengthened by the channeling of the funds for the bulk of the interventions through
                Account no. IV maintainedby the district governments; (d) the district governments have
                entered into partnership agreements with the provincial government that clearly set out
                the roles and responsibilities of both parties in the implementation of the program; (e)
                reduced potential for conflict between the district governments and the provincial
                government since they are aligned politically; (f) a number of major steps have been
                taken as prior actions making reversibility dificult; and (g) the institutional changes
                brought about through the reform programme form an integral part of the education
                sector as a whole (for example, the implementationof transparentcriteria to ensure merit-
                based recmitments, the re-structuring of the PEF to support public-private partnerships,
                and strengthening and reactivation of School Councils) which will be reinforced
                wherever necessary by legislative changes,


                In 2003, the Punjab Government, through Economic Affairs Division, had requested the
                World Bank to provide financing for its three-year reform program. A total of USS300
                 million IDA assistance is required over a three-year period commencing in FY2004, with
                 $100 million already provided under the first Credit. It was agreed that the three-year
                 programme will be supported through annual $100 IDA credits, depending on continued
                 successful implementationof the reformprogramme.


                 Building uponthe initial'successes of the reform program, particularly the positive response
                 from the public reflected through enrollment surges, the Government of Punjab's vision for
                 PESRP is now for a long-term programme that will continue to take the achievements
                 forward and to sustain the improvements. The Punjab Government sees the programme
                  continue beyond a three year period to move towards a multi-year reform programmethat
   6 I &         ..willhelp Punjab meet the Millennium Development Goals in the education sector. With this

                          FISCAL   MANAGEMENT      AND SUSTAINABILITY

1.      The provincial government's strategy for ensuring sustainability o f provincial finances
and creating fiscal space for high-priority expenditure i s based on: (i)raising the provinces own
revenues through streamlining and rationalizationo f provincial taxes and user charges; (ii) debt
                                                                                             a
management strategy which requires reducing more expensive debt by utilization o f idle cash
balances and through raising less expensive loans; and (iii)improving the quality o f its
expenditure by reducing untargeted and generally ineffective provincial subsidies, and by
improving overall financial management within the public sector.

2.      The FY04 provincial budget was the first budget formulated under the Medium-Term
Budget Framework (MTBF). The fiscal outcome for FY04 shows that the financial position o f
the province has remained sound. A much improved revenue collection helped the province in
reducing its fiscal deficit, albeit marginally, despite a large increase in development spending
Table 1). The FY04 revised estimates reveal that provincial revenue was 7% (Rs. 11 billion)
higher than the budget target. Whereas receipts from the federal government (including grants)
were higher by only 3% (about Rs. 4 billion) and foreign grants were up by Rs. 2 billion,
provincial own revenue collection was higher by 18% (Rs. 5 billion). The latter was mainly an
outcome o f improved economic activity, especially in real estate and land markets, but
government's attempts to streamline professional taxes also contributed to this good revenue
performance.

3.       On the expenditure side, the current expenditure o f the province was higher than the
budget target by only 1% despite a 15% increase in salaries o f government employees. Lower
domestic interest rates helped the provincial government to reduce its interest payments
(especially on the provident fund) by 46% below the budget estimate.              However, as the
development expenditure exceeded the budget estimates by 27%, total provincial expenditure was
higher by 6%. The increase in development expenditure was made possible by significantly
higher current account surplus generated by higher (than budgeted) revenue collection and
savings on current expenditure. Nevertheless, a part o f the increase in development spending i s
merely due to accounting protocol and i s not real. The provincial accounting procedures require
all outflows out o f Provincial Consolidated Fund (Le. Account I)       to be treated as provincial
expenditure.    In this regard, all transfers to local governments are treated as provincial
expenditure, irrespective o f whether the local governments utilize these funds or not.

4.       Compared with FY04, the FY05 budget projects a 21% increase in overall provincial
revenue. With provincial expenditure projectedto increase by only 16%, provincial fiscal deficit
i s estimated to decline to about half the FY04 level, indicating a continued improvement in
provincial finances.

5.        Provincial own revenue i s estimated to increase by 19% with provincial taxes showing an
increase of 31%. A lower (7.6%) increase in non-tax revenue i s mainly due to reclassificationo f
receipts from maturing provincial investments from non-tax revenue to public accounts receipts.'
However, due to much improved revenue collection in FY04, the increase in province's own
revenue vis-&vis the FY04 outcome i s almost negligible. The provincial authorities admit that
revenue targets are extremely conservative and expect that the FY05 outcome would also show
substantially higher revenue collection.

6.        Provincial recurrent expenditure i s expected to increase by 10% and locally financed
development expenditure i s budgeted to increase by 42%. The relatively smaller increase in
recurrent expenditure i s mainly an outcome of a sharp decline (by 38%) in provincial subsidies

This indicates a continuation o f provincial debt management strategy and replacing provincial
untargeted subsidies to more efficient and cost effective system o f subsidies.

7.         Revised estimates o f provincial recurrent expenditure on education show a minor (1.2%)
shortfall vis-a-vis the budget target (Table 2). This, however, was mainly due to overestimation
o f expenditures on PESRP in the FY04 budget. The FY04 budget allocated Rs. 2.2 billion (as
block allocation) under the recurrent budget for PESRP, which was mainly for provision o f flee
textbooks, stipends to girl students, runningthe awareness campaign, establishment o f PMIU, etc.
While all these activities were implemented in line with the implementation schedule, the revised
estimates reveal that only Rs. 916 million was actually spent on these activities.

8.         An amount o f Rs. 5 billion was allocated for provision o f missing infrastructure which
was transferred in district Account 4 upon signing o f Terms o f Partnership agreements. The
revised estimates also show that the development expenditure on education exceeded the budget
target by 10%. As mentioned above, this i s mainly due to the accountingpractices, as initial data
from the districts indicate that approximately 30% o f funds releasedby the provincial government




* InFY04, the provincial govemment earmarkedRs. 17 billion for retirementof expensive federal loans. However, the
provincial govemment could retire only Rs. 15 billion of these loans last year, which would yield an annual saving of
Rs. 2 billion inreducedinterestpayments. Another retirementworth Rs. 14 billion is planned for FY05.

for provision o f missing facilities was actually utilizedby end o f last fiscal year.3 L o w utilization
o f these funds was mainly due to: (i)               a delay o f 5-6 months in release o f funds to district
governments as signing o f Terms o f Partnership between the provincial and district government
took a long time; (ii)delays in identification o f schemes to be executed in FY04; and (iii)
procedural delays and capacity bottlenecks inthe districts. The actual work on missing facilities
started only 1-3 months prior to the close o f the fiscal year.                       "Thin spreading" o f district
governments, (and private contractors') manpower and financial resources has not helped the
cause o f quick and effective utilization o f these funds. Schemes were selected with an objective
o f "benefiting" the maximum number o f schools. This not only compromised the economies o f
scale, but also led to a thin spreading o f governments and contractors' resources causing further
implementation delays.

9.        Given that the unused funds remain with the district governments and have been
revalidated by the district governments in FY05 for continuation o f civil works on missing
facilities, there i s a concern about the district governments' capacity to implement the FY05
program concurrently with the large remaining portion o f the FY04 program. Execution of work
on missing facilities i s being facilitated by reducing the delays in identification o f schemes. In
addition, community construction through School Councils i s being supported which will assist in
addressing the capacity constraints o f the district governments.

10.       For FY05, allocation o f education sector has been increased by 18% (34% o f the
provincial and 13% for district programs). While the large increase in provincially administered
programs was mainly for a large block allocation made for PMrU to undertake all the activities o f
PESRP, a 14% increase in education allocation in the district budgets allays the apprehension o f
districts trying to substitute additional funds received from the province by allocating their own
resources to other sectors. Even more encouraging i s a 15% increase budgeted by the districts in
the FY05 for non-salary expenditure, as these would not only provide for quality related school
materials but would also be usedfor repairs and maintenance o f school facilities.

The 2004/05-2007/08 MTBF

11.       With technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the design o f the
provincial government MTBF has been significantly improved through: (i)more robust
projections o f available resources; (ii)         better estimation o f funding needs; and (iii)         expansion o f
debt management strategy to include contingent and deferred liabilities. As a first step toward a
medium-term budgeting and planning framework, the provincial government's 2005/06 Budget
Call Circulars for the recurrent and development budgets instruct the line departments to prepare
three-year and annual physical targets and financing needs.                         However, the most important
development in strengthening the MTBF was inculcating political and departmental ownership
for the MTBF concept. Inthis regard, a detailed presentation was given to the Chief Minister on
the philosophy and strategy o f institutionalizing MTBF. The ChiefMinister gave his approval for
an accelerated implementation o f the MTBF.

12.       The 2004/05 MTBF envisages a steady increase inprovincial revenue receipts from 6.5%
o f provincial GDP in 2003/04 to 7.9% in 2007/08. Provincial expenditure too are projected to




 Data compiled by P M I U directly from the districts indicate a 30% utilization o f PESRP funds (i.e. about Rs 1.5
billion) on missing facilities. Utilization rate had increased to about 60% by end-December 2004.


                                                                                                                    4

  increase in same proportion (from 6.8% o f GDP in2003104 to 8.3% in 2007108) thereby keeping
  the fiscal deficit to more or less at 0.4% o f GDP (see Table 1).

  Resource Availability


.  13.      On the basis o f rather conservative assumptions about the outcome o f the next National
  Finance Commission (NFC) Award, revenue transfer from the federal government are projected
   to increase by 19% p.a. between 2003104 and 2007108. Realizing that the province has to reduce
   i t s dependence on federal revenue transfers, the provincial government has constituted a
  ministerial committee on resource mobilization, which will formulate a new resource
  mobilization strategy for Punjab. Nevertheless, on the assumption o f implementing the existing
  resource mobilization strategy, province's own revenue i s also projected to increase by 19% p.a.
  However, the projected increase in tax revenue (at 21% p.a.) i s significantly higher than that o f
  non-tax revenue (16%), despite the province forgoing its share in property tax in favor o f Tehsil
  Municipal Administrations (TMAs). This increase intax revenue i s based on an expansion o f the
  tax base and better assessment and collection of all major taxes in the provincial domain,
   including the agricultural income tax, the profession and callings tax, stamp duty, sales tax on
   services, etc. In addition, assessment has also been made o f possible revenue sources o f district
   governments and resources that would be available from other financing sources, e.g. donor
   assistance and through innovative financing schemes (see Table 3).4 In addition, the province
   intends to utilize its idle cash balances by maintaining only the minimumbalances required to
   meet contingencies.

Debt Management Strategy

16.          Debt servicing has been a heavy burden due to a lack of fiscal indiscipline inthe past. To
reduce the debt-servicing component in non-development budget, the provincial government has
formulated an effective debt management strategy which aims at reducing expensive provincial
debt (mainly o f federal government) by raising l o w cost donor assistance and utilizing the
provincial idle cash balances, thereby reducing the future interest liability and ensuring
sustainability o f provincial finances.

17.          Under this strategy, the Punjab Govemment has already retired federal cash development
loans o f about Rs. 13 billion against the proceeds of the first tranche o f the Asian Development



                                                                                                                               6

                                                                                        Annex 3



Bank loan for the Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP) and the World Bank's Punjab
Education Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC).

18.     For future, the provincial government intends to utilize a bulk o f proceeds from PRMP
and future Education Development Policy Credits to prematurely retire expensive domestic debt
owed by government o f the Punjab to the federal government. Under this program approximately
Rs 11- 12billionwould beretiredineach o f FY05, FY06, FY07 and FY08.

19.      Inaddition to the above retirements, regular repayments of domestic and foreign debt in
the medium term would amount to Rs. 4.6 billion in FY05, Rs. 3.75 billion in FY06, Rs. 3.14
billion in FY07 and Rs.3.16 billion in FY08. The government o f Punjab intends to issue new
public debt at market rates to make the above debt repayments.

20.      As a result of pursuingthis strategy, the debt profile o f the govemment o f the Punjab
would undergo a major transformation. With the replacement o f expensive debt with cheaper
foreign and domestic debt, the debt servicing ratios o f Punjab improve significantly and as a
result create additional debt capacity for the Punjab government. By 2007/08, debt servicing will
only be 2.9% o f total expenditures against an acceptable upper limit o f say 10% o f total
expenditures (Table 5). This would greatly enhance the sustainability o f provincial finances and
create enough fiscal space for the provincial government to make significant investments in
provincial infrastructure and public services.

                     Table 5: PUNJABDEBT PROFILE: 2003/04-2007/08
                                                                                    (Rs millions)




Expenditure Reallocation

21.      The total expenditure o f the province i s projected to grow at the same pace as total
resources, i.e. at 19% p.a. (Table 4). However, in view o f the large development needs, the
current expenditure i s pitched to increase at a much slower pace (9% p.a.) than the development
expenditure (49% p.a.). This change in composition o f provincial expenditure i s to be brought
about by a strategic reallocation o f resources away from administrative overheads and towards
development o fpublic services and infrastructure.

22.      Expenditures on human resource development (education, health. etc.), is given the top
priority. Expenditure on these heads i s projected to increase from 38.5% o f total expenditure in
2004105 to 41% by 2007108, indicating an annual growth o f 17.5%. Although, expenditure on
provincial infrastructure takes a smaller share o f provincial budget than human resource
development (27% in 2004105). However, this expenditure i s projected to increase by 20% p.a.
during the MTBF period.        By 2007108 these expenditures would amount to 31% o f total
expenditures. Expenditures on governance (Access to Justice programs) which constitute 10% of
total expenditures will go down to 9% of total expenditures by FY 2007108. Owing to effective
debt management strategy, the share o f non PRSP expenditure (Le. interest, pensions, general


                                                                                                 7

                                                                                          Annex 3



administration, etc.) would decrease from 20% o f total expenditure in 2004/05 to 13% in FY
2007/08. During this time period 2004/08 about Rs. 23 billion will be allocated for a funded
pension plan.

Sustainability of PESRP

23.      Although the government has taken credible actions to strengthen provincial finances,
sustainability o f PESRP has to be viewed in terms o f its emerging needs within the education
sector and other priority areas. Looking into the future, it i s apparent that with the completion of
missing facilities, there would be very little, if any, need for financing this activity from the
development budget.      After the completion of the three year PESRP period in FY06, the
enhanced level o f allocation for the development budget (which was increased by over 300% in
FY04) will be sufficient to meet the growing infi-astructure needs o f the sector, beyond the
primary sub-sector. However, the repairs and maintenance needs o f the newly provided facilities
and, indeed, o f the school infrastructure, would require a significant increase inrecurrent budget
for school education. Moreover, to improve education access and to meet the demands o f growth
in enrollments, teacher vacancies will need to be reduced. In addition, the sharp increase in
enrollments would require creation and filling o f additional posts for teaching staff as well as
additional classrooms/schools for the newly enrolled children along with overheads like furniture,
electricity, drinking water, latrines, etc. Similarly, the new entrants need to be provided with
textbooks and qualifying girl students with stipends. Also, plans need to be made now to expand
the secondary school system so as to cater for the increased inflow o f students (due to higher
elementary level enrollments) to avoid problems in future. All this would require a significant
increase in the recurrent budget (along with some increase in the development budget) for school
education.

24.         Inorder to finance these and other priority expenditures on sustainable basis, the Punjab
government has devised a medium-term strategy to strengthen its finances (see paragraph 1)
through an appropriately designed debt management strategy. On the basis o f this strategy, the
Punjab government has formulated a Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF). As per
government's commitment, the MTBF shows substantial increases (17.1% p.a. between 2003/04
and 2007/08) inallocations for education, thereby more than doubling the allocation for the sector
over the next 4 years. These increased allocations for education sector, however, do not pre-empt
resources from other priority expenditures as the MTBF has budgeted similar (and at times
higher) increase for most high-priority sectors.
25.        A bulk o f financing for these higher levels o f public spending is expected to come from
province's share in federal revenue. The Punjab government assumes that the present National
Finance Commission would enhance the share o f provinces in federal pool o f divisible taxes.



                                                                                                                       9

                                                                                        Annex 3



Nonetheless, inthe case o f Punjab, the increased share o f provinces (from 42.5% to 47%) makes
only a nominal difference in overall revenue transfer for the province.      On the other hand,
provincial own revenue has shown substantial increase in FY04. In addition, the province i s
planning to improve its tax administrationmachinery and restructure most o f its major taxes so as
to improve their revenue potential. The province also expects significant revenue from hydel
profits from Ghazi-Brotha power project, and from improving district government revenue
collection. Moreover, Punjab has already started some innovative schemes, e.g. Punjab
Development Fund, to mobilize additional finances. Finally, sustainability o f these expenditures
i s being ensured by reducing provincial subsidies and debt servicing expenditure. For the latter,
the provincial govemment has already started to retire its more expensive federal debt by
contractingless expensive donor assistance.

26.      The fiscal sustainability o f the education sector (and other high-priority) expenditure,
would therefore depend on the continued implementation o f government's strategy for fortifying
its financial position, which in turn would depend on the political will o f the government to
undertake fiscal and financial management reforms. The political will displayed by the Punjab
govemment over the last two years gives comfort about future sustainability o f public finances
and education sector expenditures.

       IMF Executive Board Complctcs Final Review Under Pakistaii's PKCL; Arrangciiieiil

The Executive Board o f the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) completed today the ninthand
final review under Pakistan's three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. While completion o f this review enables the release o f the equivalent o f
SDR 172.3 million (about US$262 million), the Pakistan authorities have already stated that they
will not draw the final tranche available under the arrangement, and that they will not seek a
successor arrangement once the current PRGF arrangement expires inDecember 2004.
Incompletingthe finalreviewofthe arrangement, theExecutiveBoardalso approvedPakistan's
request for waivers for the nonobservance o f three structural performance criteria and o f a
continuous performance criterion against the imposition or intensification o f exchange
restrictions.

Total disbursements under the PRGF arrangement approved on December 6,2001
(see Press Release No. 01/51) have amounted to the equivalent o f SDR 861.4 million
(about US$1.3 1billion). The PRGFi s the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries.
PRGFloans carry an annual interestrate o f 0.5 percent, and are payable over 10 years with a 5%-
year grace period on principal payments.

Following the Executive Board's discussion o f Pakistan's economic performance,
AgustinCarstens, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
"DuringPakistan's three-year arrangement under the PovertyReductionand GrowthFacility
(PRGF), the country has made a strong recovery from the economic crisis o fthe late 1990s.
Tighter macroeconomic policies and structural reforms have resulted ina stronger external
position, a lower public debt burden, renewed access to internationalcapital markets, and a
revival ingrowth, albeit accompanied lately by some increase ininflation. Extemal support has
played a part inPakistan's recovery, but the turnaround has been primarily due to the
implementation o f strongly owned government policies.

"Executive Directors commended Pakistan on the successful completion o f its arrangement under
the PRGF.Directors welcomed the authorities' decision not to draw the final tranche, given
Pakistan's improved economic situation, so that these resources become available for other
countries inneedo f concessional support from the Fund.The authorities have indicated that they
do not wish to seek a successor arrangement following the expiration o f the current arrangement.
Instead, Pakistan will rely on domestic and international capital markets to meet its financing
needs, complemented by continued support from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,
and bilateral donors. The Fundwill maintain a dialogue with the authorities on economic and
financial developments and policies inthe context o f the Fund'snormal consultations with
member countries.

"Pakistan continues to face major challenges intrying to meet its Millennium Development
Goals. Social indicators remain weak. T o achieve a significant and lasting reduction inpoverty,



                                                                                                 1

                                                                                           Annex 5


strong, non-inflationary growth will needto be maintained, but the authorities will also needto
ensure that growth will benefit the poor. Maintaining highrates o f economic growth will require
the continued implementation o f sound macroeconomic policies, with monetary policy focusing
on maintaining low inflation and avoiding the entrenchment o f inflationary expectations, as well
as structural reforms. A continued fiscal effort will be needed to reduce the public debt burden
further, while increasing funding for social spending, consistent with Pakistan's Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper. The authorities will furthermore need to ensure that provincial and
local governments have the administrative and financial means to carry out their increased
responsibilities for the delivery o f key public services, includinghealth care and education,"
Mr.Carstens said.
