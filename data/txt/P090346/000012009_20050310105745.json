The main benefits\n            will be reversing the slide in education indicators,\n            bringing more children into school up to grade 8\n            (particularly poor children and girls) sooner than\n            previously expected, providing better quality education. The\n            program would contribute to closing the social gap and\n            helping the Country progress toward the Millennium\n            Development Goals (MDGs) related to poverty reduction and\n            Education for All (EFA). Another indirect, but important,\n            benefit is that the program is strengthening\n            decentralization by increasing the role of districts, and\n            promoting accountability between service users (parents and\n            students) and service providers (schools and teachers).\n            Overall, given the success of the first year program, the\n            risk rating is moderate for the second year program,\n            proposed to be supported under this project. Nevertheless,\n            there is a need to maintain continued vigilance in case of a\n            change of priorities and focus at the political level, both\n            at the province and districts."}, "docdt": "2005-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
