2. Overall progress toward the achievement of the project objective is satisfactory. The
   last Implementation Status Report rated both PDO and IP satisfactory. The Project
   has been effective for over 2 years yet approximately 66% is disbursed/committed as
   of June 2010. The most notable achievement of the SESP to date has been the
   successes of decentralizing resources to the schools and communities (SBMCs) with
   key support from the local government administrators and ministry support teams.
   Schools are already receiving their second cycle of school grants. The textbook and
   infrastructure procurement demonstrated the benefits of a competitive process with

                                           3
   real cost effectiveness in both the savings generated (up to 40% versus projected cost
   of school construction and textbooks) and the evident quality of the investments.
   More limited progress has been made with regard to changing teaching behaviors and
   improving the teaching methods, although no formal assessment has been conducted.
   Capacity building initiatives have slowly begun to bear fruit with the completion of a
   Medium Term Sector Strategy (MTSS) in each of the States, inspectorate reform
   taking off in Kwara and revitalization of a credible school census process. The data
   issue remains problematic, but current efforts on the 2009/2010 school survey are
   expected to provide an update for key project indicators by July 2010. The large
   procurement packages for textbooks and infrastructure have been awarded and goods
   are being received and all contracts for civil works are well underway.

Disbursement

3. Disbursements are currently US$37.5 million (as of June, 2010), but outstanding total
   commitments include another US$ 9.1 million.

Rationale for Reallocation

4. The proposed reallocation is necessary in order to redistribute the unallocated funds
   across States and categories as originally intended as per the project agreement. This
   reallocation was anticipated during the project preparation and a notional allocation
   was originally assigned for each of the States and therefore, does not in any way
   affect the Project Development Objectives (PDO). However, as part of the initial
   design of SESP, US$20 million remained unallocated so as to be distributed after the
   Mid-term Review (MTR) in light of implementation under the first years of project
   implementation. In a letter dated July 5, 2010, the Federal Government of Nigeria
   requested the reallocation of the proceeds of the Credits.

5. Given the success of providing key inputs to schools, all three States have agreed to
   focus their remaining resources on improving learning in these schools. Therefore,
   the remaining US$20 million (and the undisbursed PPF funds) were strategically
   allocated during the MTR to support priority investments in strengthening and
   expanding the school grants which does not affect the target values in the revised
   result framework, conducting impact assessment, especially on learning outcomes,
   finding more cost-effective strategies for delivering teacher training/strengthening,
   supporting training and establishment of Early Childhood Development programs and
   technical assistance and training to introduce MDG-funded Conditional Cash
   Transfers (CCT) for girls participation. The three States are also planning to use the
   additional resources to enhance their data collection and analysis in order to improve
   the monitoring of project results. Additionally, the project will support some of the
   technical assistance originally planned under DFID's program, but subsequently
   revised during the roll out of ESSPIN. The reallocation of funds will help the States
   to continue the activities and components that are well underway support key quality
   improvements and better document and analyze results.

6. The reallocation will be financed from the Unallocated Category (7) and Refund of
   PPF Category (6) to supplement ongoing activities under the existing categories of
   goods, works, consultant services, training, school grants and operating costs. This
                                           4
reallocation was anticipated during project preparation and notional allocations were
originally assigned for each of the States. The reallocation is based on detailed
workplans by each of the States for the remaining project period.
