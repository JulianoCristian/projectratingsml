The proposed\n            reallocation is necessary in order to redistribute the\n            unallocated funds across States and categories as originally\n            intended as per the project agreement. This reallocation was\n            anticipated during the project preparation and a notional\n            allocation was originally assigned for each of the States\n            and therefore, does not in any way affect the Project\n            Development Objectives (PDO). However, as part of the\n            initial design of SESP, US$20 million remained unallocated\n            so as to be distributed after the Mid-term Review (MTR) in\n            light of implementation under the first years of project\n            implementation. In a letter dated July 5, 2010, the Federal\n            Government of Nigeria requested the reallocation of the\n            proceeds of the credits. The reallocation will be financed\n            from the unallocated category and refund of Public Property\n            Fund (PPF) category to supplement ongoing activities under\n            the existing categories of goods, works, consultant\n            services, training, school grants and operating costs. This\n            reallocation was anticipated during project preparation and\n            notional allocations were originally assigned for each of\n            the States. The reallocation is based on detailed work plans\n            by each of the States for the remaining project period."}, "docdt": "2010-08-23T00:00:00Z"}
