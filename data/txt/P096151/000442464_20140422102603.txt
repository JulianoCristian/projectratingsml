            IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in
                                         independent evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://ieg.worldbankgroup.org).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Project Performance Assessment Report of the State Education Sector Project in
the Federal Republic of Nigeria, financed through IBRD Loan No. 42950, in the amount
of US$65 million equivalent (SDR43.3 million). The project was approved on April 26,
2007, became effective on April 25, 2008, because of the time it took with Nigeria’s
Federal processes approving and ratifying a World Bank project. It closed on July 1,
2011 without any extension.

This report was prepared by Susan Caceres, Senior Education Specialist, IEG. Data
analyses of the Annual School Census Reports was provided by Ms. Segen Teklu Moges,
under the supervision of Susan Caceres. The findings are largely based on a two-week
mission to Nigeria from May 28, 2013 to June 7, 2013, conducted by Susan Caceres,
Senior Education Specialist. During the same time period, Ms. Elena Bardasi, Senior
Economist, also conducted a mission to examine the Community Based Poverty
Reduction Project (P069086). The mission met with education authorities in the
implementing agency, the State Ministry of Education and State Universal Basic
Education Board in Kwara and interviewed representatives from the States of Kano and
Kaduna. Representatives from the Federal Ministry of Education were also interviewed.
The mission only visited schools in Kwara, as security conditions did not permit visits to
Kaduna and Kano. During the mission in Kwara, a representative of the Federal Ministry
of Finance accompanied the visits to schools and the interviews. The mission also met
with key staff and managers of the Bank in Washington and Abuja, as well as key staff
and managers of DfID. The list of persons met is in Annex C. Preparation for the mission
and report involved examination of: (a) World Bank project files, (b) Project related
reporting documents and evaluations, and (c) Education studies with data from the
government and other development partners, as well as the relevant research literature.

The IEG team gratefully acknowledges the logistical assistance and support of the staff in
the Abuja Office of the World Bank and the support from the Kwara State Ministry of
Education personnel, particularly Mr. Rasaq Alabare.

Following standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft report was sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and feedback. Their comments are
presented in Annex D.

Summary
Context

In Nigeria national school enrollment data mask differences across the six geo-political
zones. The North East and North West have respective primary gross enrollment rates of
67 percent and 64 percent, while rates in the North Central, South East, South West, and
South South are 100 percent. There are also inequalities in enrollment in terms of
gender. In the Northern Regions enrollment rates are the lowest in the country for girls.
At the start of the project the gap in primary enrollment between boys and girls was 17
percent in Kano, while the difference between boys and girls enrollment in Kaduna was
11 percent and 3 percent in Kwara (World Bank 2007).

State Education Support Project

The objective of the US$65.40 million equivalent State Education Support Project (2008-
2011), as stated in the Credit Agreement (p. 5) was "to improve the quality of basic
education in targeted Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the participating States,
focusing particularly on girls' participation", as measured by improved learning
conditions 1, increased transition and completion rates for boys and girls in targeted
LGAs. The same objective was noted in the appraisal documents.

The activities to attain the objective of improving the quality of basic education included:
provision of school grants, textbooks, rehabilitation of targeted schools, teacher training,
state and local government capacity building, reform of the inspection services, and an
Early Childhood Development pilot. Design focused on improving inputs into learning,
but neglected others that more needed to improve education quality and learning
outcomes such as teachers and their unequal distribution among schools, particularly
rural ones. Textbooks were printed in English, despite a national policy specifying a
gradual transition to English as the medium of instruction during the primary grades
(fourth to sixth). There were few targeted activities to increase the participation of girls.
The conditional cash transfer pilot implemented in Kano after the midterm review, only
supported the first grant payment to girls. The pilot continued with the support of
ESSPIN and the Kano State Ministry of Education, but its future was uncertain2 .

The relevance of objectives is high given the commitment, consistent with the Federal
Ministry of Education's Ten Year Strategic Plan, to promote delivery of quality
education and establishment of quality assurance procedures. The project's objective was
also highly relevant to each State Education Sector Plan, which aimed to accelerate
progress toward the key education Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), creating the
basis for sustainable development by emphasizing improvements to quality in areas with
low schooling participation levels, especially among girls. The Bank's current Country
Partnership Strategy (20 10-2013, current at lEG Mission) stresses a state (rather than

1
    This key performance indicator was subsequently changed to the measurement of student learning.
2
  The Bank is supporting a conditional cash transfer program for poor households. This program is not
targeted at girls.

federal-level) approach to improve access, quality, efficiency, and equity in education,
with a particular emphasis on girls' education.

During the project, 3 million textbooks were distributed to primary and junior secondary
schools within the three States, which achieved a 1: 1 student to textbook ratio in the core
subject areas in Kwara and Kaduna, but their effective use has not been assessed. School
renovations improved the physical conditions for learning and helped reduce
overcrowding in classrooms. Professional development was provided to 6,456 teachers in
the States of Kaduna, Kwara, and Kario, but there were problems related to the relevance
and impact of training, and many teachers were subsequently transferred to other schools,
which head teachers reported was a barrier to sustaining pedagogical changes. The
percentage of girls enrolled in primary schools in Kano increased slightly more in project
LGAs (47 percent in 2009 to 50 percent in 2011) than in non-project LGAs (47 percent to
48 percent in 2011). The rate remained steady in primary schools in Kwara and Kaduna
in both project and non-project LGAs.

The project's outcome is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, and is based upon high
relevance of the objectives, modest relevance of design, modest achievement in
improving quality, and modest achievement of increasing girls' participation. Efficiency
was rated substantial because of the cost savings the project demonstrated from its use of
competitive bidding for civil works and textbooks. The risk to development outcome is
significant, given weak institutional management capacity, teacher posting policies, and
changing government priorities. The performance of the Bank is rated moderately
unsatisfactory at entry, during supervision, and overall. The Borrower's performance is
rated moderately satisfactory. The Government and States remained committed to
improving education and increasing girls' participation, but there were some
shortcomings in performance. Both Government and implementing agency performance
were moderately satisfactory.

Lessons

Based on the experience of this project, several lessons can be drawn:

   •   Learning and sustainability of pilot activities are limited when there is an
       absence of clear design, an explicit mechanism for evaluating, and a
       sufficient implementation time frame. Initiating the girls CCT during the last
       year of the project provided insufficient time to implement the pilot. As well, it is
       difficult to determine the benefits and effectiveness of the pilot ECD activities,
       given the absence of the monitoring and evaluation system and implementation
       plan. Without strong design and evaluation, there is no way to identify whether
       the pilot activity is worthy of scaling-up or sustaining. Pilots generate further
       interest in sustaining or scaling-up when robust data are collected.

   •   Setting up a monitoring and evaluation system takes more time than
       Governments and TTLs often recogniz;e and provide. An overly complex
       system was designed and replaced with a simplified one. In environments with
       low capacity, understanding the critical data needs of the Government is essential,
       as well as the amount of technical assistance that will be required. During this
                                          xi

    project, it took considerable time for the s·tates to collect and analyze the Annual
    School Census.

•   A prior unsuccessful project can result in learning, but it depends upon an
    accurate understanding of performance issues. This project avoided some of
    the shortcomings in the predecessor Bank project, Universal Basic Education
    Project. DfiD's TAwas aligned with the objective of this project. However, each
    partner worked separately to complete respective responsibilities within the
    project. Better coordination between the work of the Bank and DfiD could have
    enhanced the EMIS, state and local capacity building efforts and teacher
    professional development.

•   Even with a State-focused project, the involvement of the Federal Ministry of
    Education is critical given its central role in policy. The difficulties related to
    the Federal implementation in the Universal Basic Education project were not
    fully understood. During preparation, instead of designing approaches to
    overcome the challenges experienced by the Federal Ministry of Education with
    the Universal Basic Education Project, the Federal role was minimal. This
    reduced the buy-in by the Federal Ministry of Education and likelihood of
    replicating project activities in other states.

•   Improving inputs into learning (facilities, textbooks, etc.) needs to be
    accompanied by defining and addressing quality requirements in terms of
    minimum standards for student learning. While this project improved the
    inputs and physical conditions for learning, these may not translate into improved
    student learning, as the key issue of teachers' capacities was insufficiently
    addressed by the project. When teachers' numeracy, literacy, and language skills
    are low, children's learning will be compromised. This is particularly true in rural
    areas as more skill deficiencies were found among rural teachers. There also
    continue to be issues in how teachers are allocated amongst schools.

1. Background and Context
1.1    This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the experience and
achievements of World Bank support for basic education in the Nigeria State Education
Sector Project (SESP). It was approved on April 26, 2007, and became effective on April 25,
2008, because of the time it took with the Federal processes for approving and ratifying a
World Bank project. The project was financed by an International Development Association
(IDA) credit of US$65.40 million equivalent. The British Department for International
Development provided US$1.67 million in parallel financing for the components related to
Education Management Information System (EMIS), Reform of the Inspectorate, and
Capacity Building for Planning and Management.

1.2     This project was selected for a field-based assessment since it focused on improving
the quality of education, increasing the participation of girls, and also implemented pilot
activities to support early childhood development. The information gained from this field-
based study will be utilized as an input into IEG’s upcoming evaluation of Bank support for
early childhood development and nutrition programs.

Socio-Economic Context of Nigeria
1.3     In the period 2001-2009 Nigeria experienced rapid economic growth. Growth has
averaged 9.2 percent annually, then slowed in the later years to 6.4 percent (World Bank
2011). Despite this robust growth, there has not been significant improvement in social
indicators. In the midst of dynamic economic growth, the poverty headcount ratio increased
from 63.07 percent in 2004 to 67.98 percent in 2010. In 2011 Nigeria’s Human Development
Index, HDI, was 0.459, ranking 156 out of a total of 187 countries, sharing that position with
Senegal, and just one position above Haiti (0. 454), both countries with a much lower per
capita gross domestic product. Nigeria’s 2011 HDI revealed that life expectancy at birth,
mean years of schooling, and expected years of schooling are lower than those of other Sub
Saharan African countries. The levels of stunting and wasting in Nigeria are 41% and 26.7%
respectively, which are higher than those of other Sub Saharan African countries such as
Gambia, Uganda, Togo, and Cote d’Ivoire.

1.4     Across the six geo-political zones, there are sharp socioeconomic disparities. The
southern region has lower levels of poverty than the more populated Northern region (See
Table 1). The north western and north eastern zones have the highest children malnutrition
rates of 35 and 34 percent respectively, while the south east and south south regions have the
lowest rates of 10 percent and 12 percent respectively (World Bank 2011). The three States
covered by this project are Kwara, Kano, and Kaduna. Kwara is part of the north central
Zone, while Kano and Kaduna are in the north west.

Education in Nigeria
1.5     The education system includes primary (six years), junior secondary (three years),
senior secondary (three years), and tertiary education (various years with at least four years
for university). Basic education is composed of early childhood care and development,
primary, and junior secondary education. State Universal Basic Education Boards (SUBEB)
and the State Ministry of Education work with Local Government Authorities (LGAs) to
manage and provide basic education. States also have responsibility for secondary education.
Tertiary education is managed and financed by both the Federal and State governments.
However, more than three-quarters of students attend federal institutions. Federal policies
have not been uniformly implemented across the States. At all levels, the Federal
government is responsible for policy setting and monitoring of education standards.

1.6     In 2004 the Federal Government introduced the Universal Basic Education law,
which has been ratified by the States. The intent of this legislation was to provide nine years
of free compulsory basic education (six years for primary and three years at junior
secondary)3. The law established the Universal Basic Education Commission which oversees
the allocation of the guaranteed funding of not less than two percent of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund to the States.

1.7     Most of the funding for basic education is from the local governments' allocation
from the Federation Account. The Federal government is not responsible for basic education,
but provides financial support through the Education Trust Fund, Virtual Poverty Fund, and
Universal Basic Education Commission. Because there are differences between States and
local governments in their efforts to fund education, the total share of education expenditure
varies across States (World Bank 2003). National enrollment figures show an increase and
then decline in primary education, while secondary is steadily growing (See Table 2). Some
respondents interviewed for this report speculated that the decline may be related to
unreliability in data, as well as the discontinuation of the school feeding program. The gross
enrollment rate for pre-primary has remained around 14 percent; however, private providers

    There are efforts to add one year of pre-primary.
                                                              3


accounted for more than 80 percent of preschool enrollment (World Bank 2008). Official
data show that gross primary enrollment reached 100 percent in 2005, but declined to 83
percent in 2010. Secondary enrollment has steadily increased. Data are viewed by many as
unreliable.

1.8     National enrollment data mask differences across geo-political zones. As Table 3
shows, primary enrollment was over 100 percent in the North Central, South East, South
West, and South South. In comparison, the North East and North West had respective
primary enrollment rates of 67 percent and 64 percent. In 2006 the state of Kano had an even
lower rate for primary education (48 percent), while Kwara (80 percent) and Kaduna (66
percent) were higher. The Junior Secondary School enrollment rate was 42 percent in
Kaduna, 48 percent in Kwara, and 27 percent in Kano. Thus, at the beginning of the project,
Kwara had the highest enrollment rates in primary and junior secondary, while Kano had the
lowest.

1.10 There are inequalities in enrollment in terms of gender. Across the country, the gap
in enrollment between boys and girls is largest at the postsecondary (10.7), with primary
(7.6) and junior secondary levels (6.7) having slightly smaller gap (See Table 4). At the
senior secondary level, the difference is the smallest (4.3), since many boys enter the labor
market and drop out. In the Northern Regions enrollment rates are the lowest in the country
for girls. In Kano the gap in primary enrollment between boys and girls was 17 percent,
while the difference between boys and girls enrollment in Kaduna was 11 percent and 3
percent in Kwara (World Bank 2007). At the junior secondary level, Kano also had the
largest enrollment gap between boys and girls (23 percent), while the difference between
boys and girls in junior secondary enrollment was 13 percentage points in Kaduna and
                                                4


Kwara. Thus, increasing girls’ enrollment in the Northern geo-political zones was key for
Nigeria to meet the Millennium Development Goals.

1.11 Private schools comprise a low percentage of total enrollment at the primary (13
percent for male and 11 percent for female) and secondary levels (10 percent of male and 13
percent of female) (World Bank 2008). However, private schools are increasing in the south
where there is demand and ability to pay for education. There are a large number of non-
formal religious schools in the north, but data is not available, since these schools fall outside
the monitoring of the state government.

1.12 Data and monitoring capacity are challenges in the education sector. While
educational data are available, it is not viewed as reliable. There is also the need to
strengthen the data from schools. Monitoring and evaluation capacity is low, according to
respondents. Inadequate monitoring from the inspectorate services in the State Ministry of
Education is another limitation.

1.13 There are inadequate conditions for learning. There are shortage of core textbooks
and teaching and learning materials. Before the project, approximately three students had to
share core textbooks in Kwara, Kaduna and Kano (World Bank 2007). The physical
conditions of learning is poor, since there is overcrowding in primary schools in Kaduna,
Kano, and Kwara and insufficient number of classrooms to meet the demand to achieve
universal enrollment. Buildings are based on outdated construction standards. Schools are
poorly maintained. Across States there are large differences in the deployment of teachers
with the teacher-student ratio ranging from 1:36 in Kwara, 1:88 in Kaduna and 1:100 in Kano
(Abe, 2011).

1.14 Improvements are needed in the teaching-learning process. Teachers utilize few
methods to develop literacy skills. Many teachers also do not have a good command of the
English language and so they are unable to explain lessons and effectively utilize English
textbooks. Teachers’ rely on chalk and talk techniques and do not understand how to engage
students actively in learning. Students do not spend enough time on productive learning
activities (Adekola 2007). Teachers do not have tools and techniques to monitor students’
progress. Primary school teachers do not regularly plan their lessons or prepare instructional
materials for use in their lesson (Adekola 2007).

1.15 Learning assessment data in primary grades have shown low student achievement. In
2003 the Universal Basic Education Commission carried out a criterion referenced test in the
subject areas of English, mathematics, science, and social studies, for a sample of students in
                                                5


grades four, five, and six. Students in fourth grade answered 25-50 percent of the questions
correctly. Fifth grade scores ranged from 25-39 percent across the four subjects, while scores
of sixth graders were 21-40 percent (World Bank 2008). In cross-national studies Nigerian
children also did worse in comparison to other African countries (Adekola 2007). Reasons
for this relate to students’ limited fluency in English and basic knowledge of the concepts
(Adekola 2007).


2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
2.1     According to the Financing Agreement (World Bank 2007 p. 5) and the Project
Appraisal Document (World Bank 2007 p. 9), the objective of the project was "to improve
the quality of basic education in targeted Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the
participating States, focusing particularly on girls’ participation." The project operated in the
States of Kano, Kwara, and Kaduna. While the objectives remained the same during the
course of the project, one of the key performance indicators was changed during a project
restructuring.

2.2     The project selected the three States based on their demonstrated commitment to the
education sector, quality of Sector Plan, and poor educational indicators; all three were
northern States, but not those with the highest level of poverty, or the lowest education
indicators. Within the States, Local Government Areas were targeted (e.g. six in Kaduna,
nine in Kano, and six in Kwara) using criteria such as poverty, readiness and willingness of
key officials to implement reforms, enrollment rate in basic education, per capita public
spending on primary and secondary education, and absence of other externally funded
projects. Gender disparity was another criterion used to select the 21 Local Government
Areas from which 1,523 schools were selected.

Relevance of Objective
2.3     Relevance of Objective is rated High. Nigeria was significantly behind its goal to
achieve universal basic education, with low primary and junior secondary enrollment rates in
the Northern areas, especially among girls. In Kano the gross junior secondary enrollment
rate was 56 percent for boys and 31 percent for girls (World Bank 2007). In Kaduna the gross
junior secondary enrollment rate was 74 percent for boys and 61 percent for girls (World
Bank 2007). In Kwara the gross junior secondary enrollment rate was 82 percent for boys
and 69 percent for girls (World Bank 2007). Moreover, improving the quality of education
was a priority within each state. Thus, the focus on girls’ participation and improving quality
was highly relevant for each of the States.

2.4     The Country Partnership Strategy (2010-2013) at project closure stressed a state
(rather than federal-level) approach to improve access, quality, efficiency, and equality in
education, with a particular emphasis on girls’ education. The Country Partnership Strategy
also promotes the use of school-based management committees as a means to improve
governance in the education sector to ensure proper use of resources, and hold teachers and
schools accountable for good quality education. This is consistent with the project’s use of
school grants and school management committees to improve quality and girls’ participation.
                                               6


2.5     The project's objective is also highly relevant to each State’s Education Sector Plan,
which aim to accelerate progress toward the key education Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), creating the basis for sustainable development by emphasizing improvements to
quality in areas with low schooling participation levels, especially among girls. It also aligns
with the Federal Ministry of Education Ten Year Strategic Plan to promote delivery of
quality education, as well as the establishment of quality assurance procedures. The strategy
affirms that “every Nigerian shall have a right to equal education opportunity irrespective of
gender, social status, age, religion, ethnic background, geographical locations and any
peculiar challenges”.

Design
2.6      Components. The project had four components. Table 5 summarizes the main
activities of each component. The first component provided school grants. The second
component focused on teacher training, textbooks, and school rehabilitation, expansion, and
upgrading. The third component strengthened aspects of the State Ministry of Education
such as school inspection services, data collection and monitoring, and developed an
Education Management Information System. The fourth component supported project
implementation, monitoring, and an information strategy to communicate the benefits of
girls’ education. The subsequent section provides an overview of the design.

2.7     The project focused on the basic inputs as the means to improve quality. It provided
school grants, in-service training to teachers, learning materials/textbooks to classrooms, and
infrastructure enhancements. School committees were provided training to develop school
plans and manage the school grants, which were intended to be used for investments to
improve education quality (as well as improve girls’ participation). The involvement of the
community was to create transparency in the use of the funds. The teacher training related to
learner-centered activities. Professional development included: training for teachers, follow-
up mentoring visits, peer assisted learning, as well as leadership support for head teachers,
school principals, and school supervisors.

2.8     Another strategy the project employed to improve education quality was enhancing
the functioning of each State’s school inspection services and building State and LGA
capacity. A Basic Education Inspectorate was to be developed to improve accountability for
the delivery of education services. The process was to ensure the appropriate linkages
between the federal and state level reforms and the rationalization of units currently
                                                      8


providing inspectorate services. New inspection instruments were to focus on education
quality and learning, rather than the physical infrastructure in the school.

2.9     The project focused on building state-level capacity to collect better data and ensure
that budgetary allocations were properly directed towards activities and recurrent costs. State
Sector Plans and Operational Plans were to be developed and used to improve budgeting and
financial management and teacher recruitment/ deployment. Given the unreliability of data,
the project focused on collecting and disseminating data, as well as developing an Education
Information Management System for State Ministry of Education and State Universal Basic
Education Board. These activities were intended to improve strategic planning and
budgeting.

2.10 By improving quality, it was also thought that more parents would send their children
(and daughters) to school. Thus, the design of the project utilized a whole school approach to
improve quality and girls’ participation and integrated a focus on girls within the main
activities. Respondents told the IEG Mission that improving quality was an appropriate
strategy for Nigerian schools, since access to learning was what was needed.

2.11 To address attitudes towards girls' enrollment the project employed sensitization and
training for selected school committee members. It was thought that with the training, they
would then identify areas within their school plans and resources from the school grant
scheme to encourage girls' participation. However, changing cultural attitudes towards girls'
enrollment would likely need additional interventions to foster behavioral changes among
men, the decision-makers within the families, as well as additional advocacy efforts beyond
the project's information and awareness strategy may have also been needed.

2.12 Schools were encouraged to spend at least 35 percent of the grant annually on
activities to benefit girls (World Bank 2007). Interventions that schools could finance with
their grants and outlined in the manual were: school uniforms, after-school activities, and
vocational training. Given the lack of decision-making of women and their constrained
status, it seems optimistic to expect school-management committees would prioritize
resources for girls’ participation, considering the dilapidated school conditions that were
noted in the Aide Memoires during project preparation.

2.13 After the midterm review, two activities were added to the project from the
unallocated funds and savings from exchange rate fluctuation, which combined amounted to
US$ 20 million. A pilot project was implemented in the state of Kano to improve the
participation of girls through a Conditional Cash Transfer program. Since this activity was
added and needed to be timed with the start of the school year it began in September 2010,
which permitted funding only one round of grants4 to support the transition of girls from
primary to junior secondary school during the project. A local information dissemination
campaign of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program was included so that the
community would know about the program and enroll their daughters in it. Second, early

 The second round of funding did not get to the Implementing Agency’s account before the closing date of the
project.

childhood education5 activities were implemented in each state, which supported both project
objectives of improving girls’ participation and education quality. While project documents
report an Early Childhood pilot, the implementation was not designed to test the
effectiveness of an approach or strategy that could later scaled-up, if warranted. However,
each State developed a list of activities and corresponding budgets. Activities included: (1)
providing additional grant money in schools that offered early childhood services, (2)
examining pre-service training institutes within the States to identify capacities and
constraints, (3) developing state plans for early childhood education, and (4) study tours.

Implementation Arrangements
2.14 The project was implemented by the State Ministry of Education in the States of
Kaduna, Kano, and Kwara in close coordination with the state parastatal organization
(SUBEB) and federal parastatal organization, Universal Basic Education Commission
(UBEC), as well as the 21 participating Local Government Agencies. The State Ministry of
Education oversaw all activities under the project, with support from a project
implementation unit that assisted with the coordination and fiduciary management. The unit
was filled with staff on secondment from the State Ministry of Education. The project
implementation unit collaborated with each State technical department to monitor project
implementation and ensured smooth disbursement of funds. A Consultative Steering
Committee was planned to share knowledge about the project at the State and Federal level.

Monitoring and Evaluation Design
2.15 The Project Appraisal Document provided a detailed plan for monitoring and
evaluation. It specified anticipated uses for the project’s data including empowering
communities to better manage their schools, informing policy, planning and management of
basic education, ensuring effective quality and supervision and public accountability. There
was a clear timeline for data collection and analysis, and explicit assignment of responsibility
for various types and levels of data collection. At the time of preparation, baseline
enrollment data was not available by LGA, and the State figures were reported to be
unreliable.

2.16 The Results Framework specified a mix of outcome and output indicators to measure
attainment of the objectives (See Table 6). Key performance indicators were (i) improved
learning conditions from 2007 baseline, (ii) increased primary and junior secondary
completion rates (disaggregated by gender) and (iii) increased transition rate from primary to
junior secondary (disaggregated by gender). During restructuring, improved learning
conditions was replaced with a new key performance indicator, the measurement of student
learning. Output indicators included: number of school implementing school development
plans, number of teachers trained, pupil-to-textbook ratio, teacher-to-textbook ratio, pupil-to-
classroom ratio, number of schools with upgraded facilities, annual education statistics report
and sector analysis, school report card, quality assurance inspection in schools, and

actively learn with peers to prepare for primary school entry; generally refers to interventions for children age 36-83
months of age” (World Bank forthcoming).

2.17 An impact evaluation was designed for the pilot conditional cash transfer program to
provide evidence of the results, and monitor fidelity of the implementation. The study was
designed to provide information related to effectiveness of various operational mechanisms,
cost-effectiveness, and measure whether the poorest were reached. Since two groups of
students (e.g. students with junior secondary schools in surrounding area and those without)
would be evaluated, ( the evaluation was designed to test whether the CCT could counteract
school supply or distance constraints to secondary education. The study was financed by
DfID’s Education Sector Support Programme in Nigeria (ESSPIN) and Bank provided
technical assistance (See Achievement of Objectives, para 4.35, for preliminary evaluation
findings).

2.18 Project documents indicate plans for an impact evaluation of the Early Childhood
Development (ECD) pilot, but project records provide no evidence of its design. No impact
evaluation was conducted of the ECD pilot activities; however there was low feasibility of
completing an impact evaluation with what was implemented. Indicators could have been
developed, but none were.

Relevance of Design
2.19 Relevance of design is modest. The project's objectives, components, sub-
components, and outcome measures were linked logically, but there were weaknesses.

2.20 The project design (See Components) provided a cohesive and consistent framework
of common technical guidelines, activities, and monitoring, but there were appropriate
allowances for variations across States in implementation of the activities. The variations
were based on the needs identified in each State’s education Sector Plan. For example, there
were differences across the States in length of training time, use of different service
providers, and provision of follow-up support. This was consistent with the Federalized
responsibility for education, as well as consistent with the Education Sector Support Plan
developed by each State.

2.21 There were a number of design shortcomings, especially in relation to the underlying
results chain. There were no targeted activities to increase girls’ participation, with the
exception of a planned information education campaign to highlight the benefits of girls’
education. While the project appraisal document noted that culture and poverty were the
main reason why girls did not participate in school, there were no demand-side interventions.
As the project was ending, a pilot conditional cash transfer was implemented in one state to
address poverty constraints to girls' enrollment. The conditional cash transfer program was
targeted to girls (fifth, sixth, and JSS1) from the poorest families in an effort to encourage
continued participation into junior secondary school and counter early marriage, which was
common reason for girls dropping out of school. The highest rate of girls' primary school
drop-out occurs in sixth grade, according to the Annual School Census.

2.22     Design focused on improving inputs into learning (i.e. grants, textbooks, renovations
etc.), and neglected others that would be needed to improve education quality and learning
outcomes such as teachers and their unequal distribution among schools, particularly rural
ones. Inservice training would not be sufficient to address teachers’ literacy, numeracy, and
                                              12


English language skills, as many of them did not have sixth grade levels when tested. The
project did not produce materials for students or teachers in languages other than English.
There was no implementation plan for the early childhood pilot and it as well as the girls
conditional cash transfer pilot were implemented too late in the project’s life (World Bank
2012). Grants were to be allocated to improving quality and girls’ participation, which did
not match local priorities.

2.23 Important project activities were to be supported by DfID’s Capacity for Universal
Basic Education (CUBE) and specified in the project appraisal document, yet CUBE was
scheduled to end in July 2008, around the time the project was just effective. Specific roles
included: capacity building for LGEAs, and States Ministries of Education, design and
development of the teacher professional support program and materials, provision of
professional architectural and engineering expertise, and support to States related to EMIS,
reform of inspectorate and capacity development for management and planning. While DfID
was expected to continue working with the Bank in Nigeria beyond 2008 (and has continued
working in Nigeria), the scope of DfID’s follow-up project would not have been known at
the time of preparation. Technical assistance was important, given the lack of State capacity.
The complexity of the task and the time it would take was underestimated. Integrating
another development partner’s project which was slated to end during the early stage of
implementation meant that the States had to utilize IDA resources to cover aspect’s not
originally planned, as an agreement for a more limited scope of work was reached between
ESSPIN and the Bank.

2.24 The design provided a very limited role for the Federal Ministry of Education in the
implementation of the project. A Consultative Forum was established (no funding was
allocated, but the appraisal document stated that DfID’s CUBE would subsidize expenses for
workshops). Given the Federal Ministry’s responsibility to coordinate policy across the
States, a role in the project may have resulted in improved synergies between the States and
Federal involvement in the project. Respondents indicated that this was a poor decision and
subsequent Bank projects have defined a role for the Federal Ministry of Education.

2.25 Several of the key performance indicators were not defined and thus making them
open to interpretation and difficult to measure. For example, the intent of “improved
learning conditions from baseline survey” and “measurement of student learning” were not
clear. Was the original indicator aimed at changes in physical infrastructure in a classroom
or school, changes in how teachers taught, or changes in student learning? Was the goal of
the revised indicator to establish a system of student performance, measure the learning at
one point in time from a sample of students, or improve the learning of students? The lack of
precision in the wording of both of versions of indicators creates challenges in determining
the attainment of the objective (improved quality of basic education). These indicators do
not define the minimum conditions for learning.

2.26 There were also shortcomings with the key performance indicators to measure girls’
participation. Some of these issues related to data limitations, but also due to the choice of
                                                     13


indicators. Considering the unreliability in the Nigerian Population Census 2006 6,
enrollment rates (e.g. overall and by gender) were logically not selected as a key performance
indicator. Completion and transition rates were to provide measures of girls staying longer in
school. However, the Annual School Census did not report all the information needed to
calculate these rates by LGA (e.g. repeaters by LGA and the total number of public enrolled
children of official graduation age). Thus, the primary completion rate can reliably only be
calculated on a state basis, making the comparison between project LGAs and non-project
not feasible. Other proxies to measure the increasing duration of girls in school were not
selected. The other key performance indicator, transition rate between primary and
secondary, was sensitive to space constraints in junior secondary schools, which was beyond
the scope of the project’s interventions.

2.27 Several of the intermediate outcome indicators were also poorly defined making them
difficult to measure (i.e. Results based monitoring and evaluation system established and
implemented continuously, primary and junior secondary schools have quality assurance
inspection resulting in Annual Basic Education Report, education sector analysis produced
by 2008 leading to improved strategic planning and budgeting, number of head teachers and
principals trained that demonstrate enhanced school management and leadership skills).


3. Implementation
3.1     The project was approved on April 26, 2007, became effective on April 25, 2008, and
closed on July 1, 2011. Despite the delay in effectiveness due to the revisions in the Federal
Government’s process for approving World Bank projects, there were no extensions.
During preparation and prior to project effectiveness, training in monitoring and evaluation,
procurement and financial management, and sensitization workshops were financed by DfID
for officials in the 21 participating Local Government Agencies. During this time, Terms of
References, Request for Proposals, and bidding documents were also prepared.

3.2     Throughout the implementation, the project was rated satisfactory for
implementation progress and progress on the development objective in the Implementation
Status Reports. Disbursement took place at a pace close to the planned schedule. Due to
exchange rate fluctuations, some of the revised credit went undisbursed; however, 95 percent
of the original Credit, US$65.4 million disbursed. As Table 7 shows, the components where
spending was higher were Quality Improvement and Project Management (World Bank
2012).

IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

3.3     The predecessor Bank project, Universal Basic Education Project, closed two years
early at the request of the Government with cancellation of 35 percent of the credit. While
the state activities performed better than the federal ones, the project had several
implementation challenges. The technical assistance provided by DfID was not coordinated
with the project objective and there was the need for more supervision of the TA by the Bank
(IEG 2008). There were fundamental flaws in the design of the project, and weak readiness
for implementation (IEG 2008). After that experience, all parties reported the desire to learn
from the mistakes and avoid them again.

3.4     During preparation, technical assistance was provided by DfID to the States
Ministries of Education, as well as LGAs and SUBEB. This support directly addressed key
aspects of implementation (i.e., procurement, monitoring and evaluation, development of
sector plans). CUBE consultants worked with each state team. For example, the criteria to
select schools for infrastructure enhancements were developed, lists of schools receiving
grants and civil works were identified, as well as Terms of Reference for the teacher
professional development providers, among other things. Because of DfID’s assistance
through CUBE, each state was ready to implement and was able to accelerate the
procurement schedule, despite the delay in effectiveness.

3.5    Each State Ministry of Education initiated its own parallel civil works projects to
renovate and build additional classrooms. In the State of Kwara SUBEB constructed 534
new primary classrooms and 140 new classrooms in junior secondary schools, as well as
renovated 65 primary classrooms and 17 classrooms in junior secondary schools between
2008 and 2011, according to Ministry data. In addition, the Kwara State Ministry of
Education renovated 40 classrooms in Grammar Schools and 8 classrooms in junior
secondary schools. The number of additional classrooms created outside the project in
Kaduna and Kano could not be confirmed.

3.6     There were delays in establishing the State Education Information Management
System. The system was to be a tool to monitor progress of the project and outcomes of the
State Education Sector Plan. The system was expected to track data on teacher training,
school enrollment, and school facilities, but by mid-term review was not functioning in any
of the States. A system was developed, but it was never operationalized because of its
complexity. There was resistance from the Federal Ministry of Education, which left the
States unsure how to proceed with the development of the management information systems
and collect school census data. As a result, for much of the project the States were not able to
report project outcome data except intermediate indicators, until the States published the
                                              15


2009/2010 school census. This was the only annual school census that was published during
project implementation, resulting in limited data to assess attainment of objectives.

3.7     While a Consultative Steering Committee was planned, as a means to share
knowledge about the project at the State and Federal level, this Committee was not
established until the final year of the project. Only one meeting was held. As a result, there
was limited involvement in the project from the Federal Ministry of Education.

3.8     There were political factors in Kwara which assisted the State in making further
implementation advances. Leaders in the state of Kwara made personnel changes in the
SUBEB and the LGA and supported the redefinition and restructuring of organization roles
and responsibilities. In Kwara a needs assessment of teachers was conducted, and reform of
the preservice teacher education colleges was done. This facilitated further changes in
Kwara, not experienced in the other States, which may be one explanation why project
implementation and results were noted in supervision reports to have been more advanced.

3.9     There were several other donors that were involved in education in Nigeria,
including: DfID, USAID, ADB, JICA, and UNICEF. The Bank partnered with DfID which
provided parallel financing for capacity development, EMIS, and reform of the inspectorate.
DfID and the Bank largely worked separately related to their areas of responsibility, but there
was a joint midterm review and joint supervision missions. While JICA and USAID worked
within similar States, the Bank did not coordinate its activities with them, instead advised the
State teams to engage these donors with their education sector support plans. After mid-term
review, when the project implemented activities related to ECD, the Bank partnered with
UNICEF and USAID related to this work to complement efforts and avoid duplication.

3.10 The mid-term review occurred in November 2009, at which time about 70 percent of
the project funds had been disbursed or committed, according to project records. At the
review, plans for the new activities (ECD and CCT) were discussed. Other topics noted at
the meeting were the Consultative Steering Committee, Education Management Information
System, and implementation progress.

Safeguards
3.11 The project was classified as category B for Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)
due to enhancement/rehabilitation activities in schools in the States of Kaduna, Kwara, and
Kano. The government disclosed the Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) on January 10, 2007, prior to appraisal. This document contained a screening
mechanism to identify adverse impacts from proposed construction activities (World Bank
2008). The implementing agency in each state monitored the Framework. Supervisory firms
were hired to ensure contractors complied with environmental protections. Satisfactory
ratings for safeguard compliance were noted in Implementation Supervision Reports
throughout the project and no issues were noted in project records or reported. By the close
of the project each implementing agency submitted to the Bank an Environmental Report
detailing its safeguard compliance. At the time of the IEG Mission, there were three
unfinished civil works in the State of Kwara. The completion status of all civil works
activities was reported by Kwara to the Bank before the close of the project. The IEG
                                              16


Mission did not visit any of the three sites. The safety impact to students from the unfinished
buildings in these three schools cannot be determined.

Fiduciary
3.12 Project ratings for fiduciary compliance were satisfactory. Acceptable financial
arrangements were established in Kaduna and Kwara, but it took longer to establish them in
Kano. Financial statements from each state were submitted on time and were unqualified, but
interim financial reports were delayed. There were no outstanding financial reports.

3.13 Procurement compliance was rated satisfactory, but there were a few shortcomings.
There were issues in the quality of tender documents, execution of bid documents and
contracts, and maintenance of proper documentation. It took longer to receive No Objections
from the Bank because incomplete documents were submitted. The Bank provided training
for the officers in the Project Implementation Unit. The Bank addressed procurement issues
with the Implementing Agency via dialogue and monthly meetings. Respondents in Kwara
noted that once they became familiar with the Bank’s procedures, they were able to easily
follow its guidelines even though this was the first Bank project that they had implemented.

Implementation of Monitoring and Evaluation
3.14 The Project Implementation Unit was responsible for monitoring project performance
indicators. Baseline data were updated in 2010, since the data contained in the appraisal
document were unreliable and based on state-wide numbers. The Results Framework was
not updated to provide measures in relation to the activities added after the midterm review
(ECD and CCT). However, an impact evaluation was implemented to assess the
effectiveness of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program. Preliminary findings were shared
with IEG, but not the final report (See Achievement of Objectives, para 4.35).

3.15 Given the delay in establishing the State-level EMIS (partly related to delays in
Federal EMIS) and the delay for States to produce and analyze the data, project outcome data
were not available until the end of project implementation. However, intermediate
indicators were tracked throughout the project. ESSPIN supported school censuses in each
project state.

3.16 Consultants conducted evaluations of the main project activities. These included:
School Development Scheme Assessment, Learning Assessment (pre and post), and Teacher
Professional Development Evaluation. These reports provided descriptive and qualitative
data to assist in making determinations of the effectiveness of the interventions.

3.17 Ratings in Supervision Reports for M&E were satisfactory and moderately
satisfactory over the course of the project, but one was rated moderately unsatisfactory. The
low rating was given after delay in updating baseline data and questions on the reliability of
what was submitted. A consultant was hired to analyze and review collected data from the
school census survey. By the end of the project, there were improvements in M&E capacity
at the State level, as well as improvements in the quality of data.

4. Achievement of the Objectives
Improve the Quality of Basic Education
4.1        The objective of improving the quality of basic education was modestly achieved.

4.2     There were seven activities that the project supported to improve quality: provision of
school grants, textbooks, rehabilitation of targeted schools, teacher training, state and local
government capacity building, reform of the inspection services, and top-up grants for pre-
primary classrooms. The evidence of the implementation of these activities and their impact
is presented below.

Outputs

4.3     Schools grants. School grants were provided and utilized by schools, which tended to
use them primarily for construction and repair and not for originally intended activities aimed
at improving quality and student learning. Over the course of two years (2009-2011), school
grants were awarded to 1,974 schools, with 499 of them receiving two years of funding.
Grants in one year averaged N597,127 (US$ 3,852) per school, which represented
approximately N41,154 per student (US$265) (Balarabe, Zakariaya, & Garba 2011).
Schools7 developed the plans according to the guidelines and each school established a
committee (Balarabe, Zakariaya, & Garba 2011). Schools welcomed the opportunity to
manage their own resources. Based on reports to the IEG Mission, community participation
increased and the resources were a catalyst for leveraging addition funding for
complementary investments in some schools, which is consistent with finding of grant
programs in other settings (Krishnaratne, White, Carpenter 2013). Minimal cases of grant
misuse were reported in project records. School management committees enhanced the
accountability of the resources to the community; however, female participation in the
committees was much lower than male. Since the closure of the project, ESSPIN has found
it necessary to create women’s committees as a way to facilitate the participation of women
in decision-making.

4.4      After the first round of grants to 499 schools, the Bank requested that States ensure
that schools use the money to improve quality and student learning; however committees
primarily used the grants for construction and repair. Additional sensitization training for
school committees was conducted so that they identified interventions to support learning.
However, construction continued to be prevalent, rather than learning materials (See Table
8). The most common type of general renovation was replacement and repair of windows
and doors, construction and repair of latrines, and flooring and patching of walls and floors
(State of Kwara Ministry of Education Science and Technology 2009). The school grants
helped to improve the adequacy and supply of facilities (Abe 2011). They also improve the
dilapidated conditions with the rehabilitation and painting of classrooms and construction of
toilets, as reported by respondents.

4.5     Committee members reported that there was a conflict between the grant guidelines
on how to spend the money and the actual needs of the school (Balarabe, Zakariaya, & Garba
2011). They felt that schools had pressing renovation needs, while the guidelines indicated
that no more than 40 percent should be spent on renovation, provision of water and
sanitation. Survey respondents reported that the grants contributed to improving quality,
since the classrooms became more conducive for teaching and learning (Balarabe, Zakariaya,
& Garba 2011). Similarly, they reported that parents were more inclined to send their
children to the schools after the repairs. If schools do not have adequate protection, students
can lose valuable instructional time due to leaking roofs (White 2004). For this reason,
community members indicated to the IEG Mission that the conditions of the school were of
primary importance and improved the environment where their children learned.

4.6     School Renovations. School renovations improved the physical conditions for
learning and helped reduce overcrowding in classrooms. 98 schools were provided with
upgraded learning facilities, which improved the physical conditions for learning. These
schools were selected during preparation, based upon a needs assessment. This work
prioritized the building of classrooms, laboratories, libraries and toilets, aspects to support
learning through a whole-school approach. It also selected schools with serious
overcrowding issues. By the end of the project, there was construction or upgrading of 640
classrooms, and installation of 720 toilets and 75 boreholes. Given the poor conditions that
were reported in the appraisal document and the fundamental necessity of ensuring adequate
learning environment, these investments were needed. Deprivation of school resources
affects the educational attainment, as well as future returns to education (Case & Yogo
1999). School inputs such as adequate sitting and writing space for children, education
materials such as textbooks, and other learning resources contribute to student learning
(Glewwe, Hanushek, Humpage & Ravina 2011). In schools visited by the IEG mission,
construction appeared to be of adequate quality with no evident deficiencies. However, in
Kwara all civil works activities were not completed by the close of the project, as three
projects were still unfinished at the time of the IEG mission.

4.7     While classroom overcrowding was reduced within each state, this is largely
attributable to SUBEB, and less so to the project. Annual School Census shows a decrease in
the classroom to pupil ratios in 2011 (i.e., average 59:1 for Kaduna, 87:1 for Kano, and in
                                                        19


Kwara 34:1 ) from the start of the project as noted in the appraisal document (i.e., 93:1 for
Kaduna, 192:1 for Kano, and 48:1 in Kwara). The scale of new classrooms constructed by
this project was much smaller than what SUBEB conducted on its own. For example, in
Kwara 135 new classrooms were constructed by this project. While SUBEB in Kwara
constructed 534 new primary classrooms and 140 new classrooms in junior secondary
schools, according to State Ministry of Education data.

4.8     Quality improvements in the conditions of schools and classrooms were noted by
respondents, which are likely attributed to SUBEB and the project. Kwara Annual School
Census Data overall demonstrate a trend in project LGAs in terms of decreasing percentages
of classrooms needing major repair, having insufficient seating, and containing no source of
water (See Anne B). For example, the percentage of classrooms in primary schools in need
of major repair declined in 5 out of 6 project LGAs in Kwara and 4 out of 6 project LGAs in
Kaduna. The percentage of schools without a source for water declined from 2009-2011 in
primary schools in two out of six project LGAs in Kwara and four out of six project LGAs in
Kaduna. Unfortunately, data from the Annual School Census Reports in Kano showed no
consistent pattern, suggesting possible inaccuracies in its collection. (See Annex B)

4.9     Provision of Textbooks. The provision of textbooks under the project enabled the
achievement of 1:1 student-to-textbook and teacher-to-textbook ratios in the targeted states,
but their effective use has not been assessed. 3 million textbooks were distributed to primary
and junior secondary schools within the three States, which achieved a 1:1 ratio in the core
subject areas in Kwara and Kaduna. This was a significant improvement from the baseline in
Kwara, where the ratio was 3.3:1 in 2006. Since no baseline was established in Kano and
Kaduna the extent of improvement is not determinable. Within each of the three States, the
primary teacher-to-textbook ratio improved from 5:1 in 2006 to 1:1 in 2011, so that now all
teachers have curriculum guides and core subject textbooks. Learning materials help students
follow along and support teachers in their lessons. There are also positive impacts in
mathematic scores, when learning materials are provided (Krisnaratne, White, Carpenter
2013). However, no data were collected during the project to assess the effective use of the
textbooks by teachers and students, despite the fact that this was noted in the appraisal
document. During the IEG mission to schools in Kwara, which were selected by the
Ministry of Education8, textbooks were available in the classrooms. During approximately 5
out of 8 observations in primary and JSS classrooms, students were using the textbooks
during their learning activities. It was beyond the scope of this mission to analyze the content
of the textbooks.

4.10 While national policy specifies a gradual transition to English as the medium of
instruction during the primary grades four through six, it has not been implemented in the
States. English has become the default language of instruction at all levels of primary
school (World Bank 2007), even though there are benefits to teaching children in a language
they understand. During IEG mission, English language instruction was observed in all pre-
primary and primary classrooms, while two JSS classrooms utilized some mother tongue.
Lack of textbooks in languages other than English is one of the reasons the mother-tongue

8
  IEG requested to visit schools that had civil works, but the specific schools were selected by the State Ministry
in Kwara.
                                              20


policy has not been implemented. Local language textbooks were not evident during IEG’s
visits to schools and classroom. Yet, the project printed textbooks in English, which was a
decision of the State Ministry textbook committee.

4.11 Another challenge to implementing the mother-tongue policy is the difficulty in
finding teachers able to instruct in all of the main Nigerian languages, as a classrooms can be
filled with students speaking more than one language. There are three dominant languages:
Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo.

4.12 On the other hand, a consequence of having teachers instruct in English, is the
difficulty recruiting teachers (particularly in rural areas) with adequate English language
competencies. Given that children may only be exposed to English during school, they need
an appropriate English speaking and writing model, which may be lacking particularly in
rural schools. In the classrooms visited by the IEG Mission in urban and rural schools
(which were selected by the State Ministry of Education), teachers had adequate command of
English; however, teachers’ spelling errors could be seen in a few classrooms.

4.13 Teacher Inservice Training. Teacher inservice training targets were exceeded, albeit
with some issues related to the quality and impact of the training. The relevance of the
training and the large number of trained teachers transferred out of project schools indicated
issues requiring further follow-up. Professional development was provided to 6,456 teachers
in the States of Kaduna, Kwara, and Kano, which is more than what was planned (5,808).
Inservice addressed topics such as: teaching methods to promote student-centered learning,
use of assessment methods to monitor learners’ progress, and content within the areas of
science, social studies, mathematics, and English. However, the predominant topic was
student-centered learning, based on content analysis of the training modules. The modules
could have benefited from more emphasis on subject area content. The materials developed
by the project were only written in English.

4.14 The training was followed up by mentoring visits and teacher meetings to give
additional opportunities to share experiences and support, which is needed for teachers to be
able to apply what was learned (Garet and others 2001). As well, the mentors provided
assistance to other teachers in the school who did not attend the training, which was a way of
furthering the impact of the training.

4.15 Project records and the evaluation of the training program pointed to issues with the
training. Head teachers had limited involvement in the selection of teachers. Other concerns
about the training were that more men than women participated. At the initial stage of the
project, there was conflicting information between what was presented in workshops and
quality assurance supervisors’ advice, suggesting a lack of coherence between the training
for teachers and inspectors. Respondents believed that many of these issues were addressed
during the project.

4.16 After the first round of training, some changes were made to the program and its
delivery. Bank staff reported that the training was adapted to accommodate teachers with
lower levels of education. As well, the state of Kwara conducted an assessment of teachers
to identify their needs in relation to teaching literacy and numeracy. This was used to
                                               21


identify effective teachers for future appointment as lead teachers instead of appointment by
political patronage. Even with the changes made to the professional development program,
teachers who were surveyed perceived the training to have limited relevance (Abe 2011)9.

4.17 In basic instructional skills such as setting the purpose of the lesson, ensuring the
participation of children in the activity and reinforcing was what learned, there was minimal
improvement from baseline (Abe 2011). However, the same teachers were not assessed from
baseline. No data were collected to demonstrate that trained teachers were effectively using
the textbooks and guides, despite being noted in the appraisal document. During the IEG
visit to schools selected by the Kwara State Ministry, teachers applied learner-centered
techniques. In several of the observations, teachers had prepared materials or props that they
incorporated into the lesson to make the lesson more engaging for students. However, these
observations showed a continued need for content specific pedagogical training. As well,
during observations of mathematics lessons by the IEG Mission, teachers stressed rote
techniques as opposed to conceptual understanding. In primary classrooms there was a
particular need for literacy and numeracy training. In primary classrooms more
heterogeneity was observed in the skills of children, suggesting that basic skill-building and
monitoring of the “slower learners” was required.

4.18 Two factors have diminished the expected results from the professional development.
First, a large number of trained primary teachers were transferred to Junior Secondary
Schools (Abe 2011) or other primary schools. The topic of teacher transfer was noted by
Head teachers and principals during the IEG Mission. Similarly, some pre-primary teachers
went to other schools. Transferring trained teachers was an obstacle to sustaining
instructional improvements in the schools and created the need for further follow-up.

4.19 Another factor that impacted the effectiveness of the training was the teachers’
knowledge. Unfortunately, many of the teachers in the project schools did not have sixth
grade literacy and numeracy skills (Abe 2011). A sample of urban teachers scored 91
percent in literacy and 45 percent in numeracy, while a sample of rural teachers scored 9
percent in literacy and 6 percent in numeracy (Abe 2011). This points to the much deeper
skill formation need that may be present amongst rural teachers beyond the scope of the in-
service training employed by this project.

4.20 State and Local Government Capacity Building. State and local government
capacity building has culminated in improved use of data in the budget preparation process,
but the results-based monitoring and evaluation system did not materialize as planned. It is
not possible to isolate the effect of ESSPIN’s training during this project from its continued
support provided to the States. Trainings in management, administration, state education
budget preparation were provided during the project by ESSPIN and after the project ended.
For example, respondents from the State Ministry of Education in Kwara reported that the
budget preparation process is now different, as it utilizes data to help in its formulation. The

9
  IEG Mission was not able to talk with teachers to obtain their views, as they were busy with
classroom instruction during the observation.
                                              22


amount devoted to renovation is based on the Annual School Census data, while previously
there was no basis for the determination of the amount. Project records noted that the
Medium-term sector strategies were finalized.

4.21 School Inspections and Reform of Inspectorate. The project supported reform of
the school inspection services to enable a stronger focus on learning. However, there was no
evidence from project documents or respondents to show that these reforms improved
accountability or service delivery. The school inspection services were reformed to focus on
the learning environment, rather than documentation of physical facility. A Handbook and
National Policy for Quality Assurance was developed under the support of ESSPIN. As well,
a Quality Assurance Manual was created. Twenty inspectors were trained. The first cycle of
outcome-based school inspections were implemented in 2009/2010 and this has continued to
present. This gave feedback to school staff and parents on ways to improve teaching and
student learning. In Kwara schools completed a self-evaluation to help them identify areas
needing improvement and strategies. Prior to the project, there was inadequate logistical
support for transportation to schools, but improvements were realized as motorbikes were
purchased for inspectors during the project.

4.22 Early Childhood Development Pilot. The early childhood development pilot does
not appear to have culminated in the establishment of centers that provide the minimum
standards for preschool that would contribute to improved learning prospects in primary
school. Moreover, this pilot was developed too late in the project life to enable a true
learning and evaluative process inherent in a pilot design. The quality of children’s lives,
their family and community circumstances, greatly influence the kind of learners they
become. For this reason, compensatory interventions such as early childhood development
can be viewed as proactive measures to improve student learning, since it can increase
children’s readiness for school. This pilot focused exclusively on education interventions at
the pre-primary level, and did not integrate other aspects such as child health, nutrition, or
child protection. The Bank team reported that other child development interventions were
supported by other partner agencies.

4.23 In communities where there were preprimary classrooms attached to primary schools,
the project augmented the school grants to provide resources for early learning. In Kwara
408 Pre-primary classrooms in 9 LGAs received 41,583,000 Naira in grants (approximately
US$268, 277 or $657 per classroom). In Kano 784 Pre-primary classrooms received
78,400,000 Naira in grants (approximately US$ 500, 806 or $645 for each classroom). In
Kaduna there was 61, 500,000 Naira (approximately US$ 396,774) allocated for pre-primary
grants. The number of children attending these classrooms and supported by these grants
was not tracked by the project. Given the young age (three to five years old), only those
located in close proximity are those who are likely to attend.

4.24 During the IEG Mission head teachers in Kwara pointed out the classroom supplies
(e.g. tables, chairs, mats) and learning materials such as pictures and teacher materials
purchased. Pre-primary classrooms (for children age 3-5) observed by the IEG Mission had
limited supplies and so the additional materials were needed to create a developmentally
appropriate learning environment. None of the pre-primary classrooms observed by the IEG
Mission had an adequate amount of resources.
                                               23


4.25 During the IEG Mission, head teachers reported that many of the pre-primary
teachers who were trained during the project had been transferred. This was viewed as a
constraint to improving education quality. In the pre-primary classrooms visited by the IEG
Mission, there was a continued need to improve the practices to make them more
developmentally focused. While the IEG Mission did not stay for the entire class period,
across all pre-primary classrooms visited the same weaknesses were observed. Children
were engaged only in whole group instruction. No small group or individualized instruction
occurred. Children were seated in chairs the whole time and rose when the teacher prompted
during an activity or song. Students were not engaged in dramatic or play activities.
Teachers directed the instructional activities in the English language, which provided the
children’s first exposure to English. Lessons focused on exposure to letters and English
words. No reading activities were observed- either teachers reading aloud or children
interacting with books. Teachers did not utilize manipulatives to give children a concrete
way to understand the concept, instead the teachers pointed to numbers. No snack was
provided.

4.26 The States also engaged in other early childhood related activities. Thirty early
childhood education personnel obtained international diplomas in Early Childhood
Development from a ‘virtual University’. It was anticipated that the training beneficiaries
would become leaders within the States on the topic of early childhood development. States
completed work plans, stock taking exercise, and assessment of the pre-service teacher
programs related to ECD with the assistance of hired consultants and specialists from the
Bank and UNICEF. Staff from the Ministry participated in study tours of other African
countries. Copies of ECD curriculum and Teachers Guides were printed. During the IEG
Mission, head teachers showed the guides, which were utilized by teachers.

4.27 Outcomes. State-level reading comprehension and math skills of 4th and 6th graders
were assessed in 2007 and 2011, but are not comparable for methodological reasons (Annex
B). Nevertheless, both assessments suggest a continued low level of learning (World Bank
2012; Abe 2011; Johnson, Hsief, Oniborn, 2007). For example, the majority (55 percent) of
fourth and sixth graders who were tested in 2011 did not answer any question correctly, and
even with the enumerator reading the test, the mean percentage score for reading ranged
between 20 to 25 percent (Abe 2011). As well, in mathematics the mean percentage score in
grade four was 20 percent (Abel 2011).

Improve Girls Participation
4.28 Improve girls participation is rated modest. There were three specific activities that
the project supported to improve girls participation: conditional cash transfer pilot, dedicating
resources from the school grant to encourage girls’ participation, and provision of toilets. As
well, respondents reported to the IEG Mission that the broad strategy of the project,
improving the quality of education, encouraged more parents to send their daughters to
school; however, data from Annual School Census do not support this claim.
                                                       24


Outputs

4.29 Pilot Conditional Cash Transfer Program. Because of the late start, the Bank only
financed the first round payment under the pilot conditional cash transfer program, after
which the program was suspended for a period of time. The CCT pilot in Kano State to
encourage girls’ participation was targeted to 12,000 of them in twelve LGAs. The first
round of payment was made in February 2011 for a total of 41 million Naira (approximately
US$260,000) was distributed to 11,000 girls, as some of the identified and eligible girls did
not show up to receive the grant money. For this payment, the Bank provided 75 percent of
the amount and ESSPIN gave the remaining 25 percent. The second payment was scheduled
for June 2011. However, the Bank’s transfer did not get to the Implementing Agency’s
account before the project closing date (June 30, 2011). As a result, the Governor of Kano
initiated a review and suspended the program. In November 2011 ESSPIN and the Kano
State Ministry of Education restarted the program, but there was a delay with the
Memorandum of Understanding, which resulted in further postponement in the second
payment. By the time of the IEG Mission, respondents noted that the program had continued
with the support of ESSPIN and the Kano State Ministry of Education, but the future of the
program was uncertain.

4.30 School Grants. While school grants were designed to emphasize the participation of
girls, the spending patterns benefited both boys and girls. The school grants helped to
improve health practices (i.e. sanitation and toilets) and make more attractive and welcoming
schools (State of Kwara Ministry of Education and Science Technology 2009). Parents and
school officials reported to the IEG Mission that the renovations made to the school (as well
as the provision of additional toilets) encouraged more families to send their children to
school, including girls. However, in rural LGAs with higher concentration of poor students,
grant resources were used to purchase school uniforms for poor children, which were
reported to be a barrier to enrollment (State of Kwara Ministry of Education and Science and
Technology).

4.31 Toilets to Encourage Girls Participation. The project increased girls’ access to
proper sanitation facilities, but data are inconsistent. Proper water and sanitation are one
component of a safe and healthy school environment. Lack of female-only sanitation can be
a barrier to girls’ participation, particularly as they enter puberty. At the start of the project
there were high percentages of schools containing no toilets ranging from 43 percent to 95
percent of primary schools in LGAs in Kwara and 64 percent to 88 percent in primary
schools in LGAs in Kano10 (See Appendix B). At the end of the project, there was a clear
decreasing trend of the percentage of primary schools without toilets in Kwara (e.g. ranging
from 13 percent to 71 percent) and Kano11 (e.g. ranging from 39 percent to 63 percent ). In
Kaduna that data were inconsistent, as the percentage reported in a subsequent year was
higher than a previous year, suggesting issues with the data collection. Similar trends were

also observed in JSS in Kwara while the data was inconsistent in Kaduna and Kano (See
Appendix B).

Outcomes

4.32 There was an increase in the number of girls enrolled in primary schools in Kwara,
Kaduna, and Kano during the project years in both project LGAs and non-project LGAs, but
the share did not change (See Table 9). In project LGAs the percentage of girls enrolled in
primary schools remained steady in Kaduna (44 percent in 2009 to 45 percent in 2011) and
Kwara (46 percent in 2009 to 47 percent in 2011). In Kano the share of girls enrolled
slightly increased more in project LGAs (47 percent in 2009 to 50 percent in 2011) than in
non-project LGAs (47 percent to 48 percent in 2011). It should be noted that Kano had the
lowest primary enrolment of girls from the three States at the beginning of the project.

4.33 Across the three States there were differences in relation to the upward progression of
girls into later grades of primary school, as measured by the ratio of girls enrolled between
class 6 and 1 (See Appendix B)12. Using this proxy, girls in Kwara participate longer in
primary school than in the other States, as this ratio increased from 2009 to 2011 in project
LGAs (78 percent in 2009 to 79 percent in 2011), while it decreased in non-project LGAs (77
percent in 2009 to 70 percent in 2011). In Kaduna, this ratio increased from 2009 to 2011 in
project LGAs (from 57 percent to 58 percent) and non-project LGAs (from 53 percent to 55
percent). In other words, in 2009 in project LGAs in Kaduna 57 percent of the girls enrolled
in class one were in class six, while in 2011 58 percent of those enrolled in class one were in
class six. In Kano, this ratio decreased from 2009 to 2011, with a lower proportion in project
LGAs than non-project LGAs. In Kano in 2009, 47 percent of girls enrolled in class one

sections on M&E for explanation.

enrolled in class six in project LGAs, while in 2011 only 41 percent of those enrolled in class
one were in class six. This ratio also decreased slightly in non-project LGAs in Kano from 57
percent in 2009 to 53 percent in 2011.

4.34 There was a consistent positive pattern in girls’ enrollment at the JSS level in Kwara
and Kano, but not in Kaduna. In Kwara the number of girls enrolled in JSS schools
increased in project LGAs and non-project LGAs, and the percentage of girls enrolled
remained steady in project LGAs (48 percent) and slightly declined in non-project LGAs (46
percent to 45 percent). (See Table 10). In Kano, there was a large increase in the number of
girls enrolled in JSS from 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 in project and non-project LGAs, with
slightly greater gains in the percentage girls enrolled in project LGAs in Kano (from 24
percent to 33 percent) than non-project LGAs (from 37 percent to 42 percent). In Kaduna
the number of girls enrolled in JSS steadily increased in non-project LGAs, but declined in
project LGAs between 2009/2010 and 201113. It should be noted that an examination of the
ratio between class three to class one in JSS is not presented, as each state reported more girls
enrolled in class three than in class one, which may suggest issues with the reliability of the
data14. Other factors that might have also contributed to these observed outcomes were the
Government of Kano’s increased focus on girls, and the program implemented by the
Universal Basic Education Commission (World Bank 2012).

4.35 The impact evaluation of the girls CCT pilot showed that attendance for girls
increased after the first payment, but due to the disruption in the program impacts diminished
(World Bank 2014; World Bank 2011; Work Bank 2012). Attendance for girls in grade six
showed the largest gain in comparison to the control group. Beneficiary girls had an average

  This figure included the number of girls from both categories (JSS and rearticulated JSS) in the Annual
School Census.

     Data were repeatedly checked to ensure there were not errors in transposing the data into spreadsheets.
                                              27


attendance rate of 66 percent (with the impacts concentrated in the Grade 5 cohort), while
those without the CCT attended nearly the same amount of time, (63 percent).

4.36 The impact evaluation of the girls CCT pilot found that over the program the
transition rate increased from JSS1 to JSS2. After the first payment, the transition rate for
girls from primary to junior secondary was slightly higher among grantees (23 percent), than
non-grantees (17 percent) (World Bank 2012; Sabarwal & Habyarimana 2014). There was
more pronounced impact in the urban area, while the rate for rural girls was similar between
grantees and non-grantees but slightly higher for those who did not receive the payment (20
percent than 18 percent). For the second year of the program, there was a statistically higher
transition rate from JSS1 to JSS2 for girls receiving the grant (60 percent) than non-grantees
(29 percent). The evaluation did not report whether similar results were observed, when
results were disaggregated for rural students. It was learned that families may not send their
younger daughter to school, despite sending the one getting the grant (Sabarwal &
Habyarimana 2014). As well, providing broader coverage with smaller grants may be
advisable. This suggests the need for CCT programs with sustained and predictable payments
over multiple cohorts to create parental behavior change (Sabarwal & Habyarimana 2014).


5. Efficiency
5.1    Efficiency is rated Substantial.

5.2     The international competitive bidding that was used for infrastructure procurement
provided value for money. As Table 11 shows, the cost of project construction activities in
nearly all cases were less than comparable government costs. For example, the project had
much lower unit costs than in State Government in 11 out of 13 civil works activities (with
comparable size and quality). In the case of the construction of laboratories, the project with
its competitive bidding was 33 percent of the cost of the Government. Savings were attained
because the contractor with the lowest bid was selected by the project implementation unit.
In Kano the actual costs were US$7.9 million, rather than the estimated US$9 million. In
Kaduna the savings was approximately US$0.5 million. Kano adopted a prototype classroom
design to be able to create efficiencies. The savings permitted purchasing additional
textbooks to achieve a 1:1 student-to-textbook ratio in core subjects in all targeted LGAs in
Kaduna and Kwara. In Kano the savings were spent on the construction of additional bore
holes and toilets in the schools.

5.3     While construction quality was good, there were deviations from design specification.
For example in Kwara the roof structure was changed from steel to wood, ceilings from
plaster to synthetic panels, and windows and door frame sizes were reduced. These changes
impact the durability of the construction, or in the case of the windows and doors reduce the
amount of light.

5.4     The project was completed with no extensions, despite the fact that there was a delay
in credit effectiveness. As a result, the project closed in three years and two months, rather
than the planned four years. This was a result of the parallel preparation that was done at
entry, as well as the solid implementation during the course of the project.

5.5     While the project had no cost overruns, project management expenses were higher
than anticipated. The reason for this is not clear, as the implementation time was shorter than
anticipated.

6. Ratings
Outcome
6.1     Outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. This is based on high Relevance of
Objectives; modest Relevance of Design; modest achievement for both objectives (i.e. to
improve quality and improve girls’ participation). Efficiency was substantial. The share of
girls enrolled in primary schools in both project and non-project LGAs in Kaduna and Kwara
did not change. There was a slight increase in the percentage of girls enrolled in primary
schools in Kano in project LGAs in comparison to non-project LGAs. While the project
demonstrated improvements in textbook ratio, school renovations, and training of teachers,
these outputs did not culminate in improved quality of basic education, as design did not

15
  The project used steel rafters for classroom construction, rather than wood in comparable government
classrooms. The project provided 8 toilets, while the government constructed 6.
                                               29


adequately establish the minimum conditions for learning. Training was not adequately
focused on the core subjects and its effectiveness was reduced with the subsequent transfer of
trained teachers. The two pilot programs were developed and implemented late in the project
life to demonstrate results, as well as enable a true learning and evaluative process.

Risk to Development Outcome

6.2     There has been some institutionalization of the project's interventions. The Annual
School Census has been collected and disseminated with the support of ESSPIN in each of
the States annually since the close of the project. The EMIS is operational and utilized by the
State Ministry of Education’s EMIS Unit. School management committees continue.
Communities have a strong commitment to their schools. Textbooks are provided directly to
each State by the Universal Basic Education Commission. SUBEB continues to renovate and
build additional classrooms. Inspectors now examine educational quality and in Kwara they
work with schools to address the areas to improve (as self-identified by the school). In
Kwara School Support Officers go to schools to assist teachers in an effort to institutionalize
the professional development provided to teachers. ESSPIN continues to work and support
all three of the States. At the time of the IEG Mission, preparation was underway for a new
project in Kano and Kaduna funded by the Global Partnership for Education. All of these
factors help reduce the risk to the development outcome.

6.3     Sustainability of project activities will depend on several factors. There is a need for
sufficient allocation from the State budget for professional development for teachers and
further activities to enroll more girls in school, particularly in Kaduna and Kano. As well,
school maintenance costs are not included in the State budget and so School Management
Committees have a large role in financing the minor repairs and maintenance. Many teachers
assessed by ESSPIN demonstrated low levels of understanding of basic concepts, suggesting
that many need development beyond the scope of in-service training. As well, reliability of
school-level data need to be improved for the States to have accurate information from which
to make their decisions.

6.4     While there is political will in support of basic education and girls education, there is
a significant risk to the development outcome because of three factors: weak institutional
management capacity, teacher posting policies, and changing government priorities.
Functions related to monitoring and evaluation continue to need strengthening within each
State. Decisions about teacher deployment to rural posts can be easily reversed based on
political decision-making, which leave rural schools at a serious disadvantage in creating
adequate learning conditions, given the central role teacher play in student learning. Annual
School data for 2011-2012 show low primary teacher to student ratios (e.g. Kwara 1:15,
Kaduna 1:29, and Kano 1:46) , yet when classrooms were observed in Kwara higher teacher-
to-student ratios were evident, suggesting issues in the deployment and distribution of
teachers, which are particularly striking in the rural areas. Since the closure of the project,
there has been a new Commissioner of Education in Kwara. Some of the reform efforts
previously begun in Kwara have not continued. While there was initial support from the State
of Kano for the Conditional Cash Transfer program, when the new Governor came to office
the program was initially suspended. The CCT program continued with the support of
ESSPIN, but over the years the commitment from the government in Kano has waned and its
                                              30


financial support has decreased. While the Bank is financing a follow-up operation with a
conditional cash transfer program to poor households, this program is not targeted to girls
(World Bank 2013). Bank Performance

6.5    Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Quality at Entry

6.6    Quality at entry is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6.7     Project preparation was thorough with the support from CUBE, which laid the
foundation for rapid and effective implementation. Simultaneous to the Bank preparation,
State teams were engaged in preparatory implementation activities. Preparation included
the participation of all levels of State Government, which effectively secured their buy-in.
The Bank provided a clear timeline and next steps that each State preparation team had to
complete before the subsequent mission. Technical papers were prepared to assist in the
design of the school grants and a detailed operational manual was developed. The manual
clearly described the process for schools to follow and the forms to complete to make the
grants part of an improvement and planning process. However, project preparation did not
take account local needs and priorities for school grants. A formula was developed to
allocate resources to schools. Schools were selected in advance for civil works, based on an
agreed upon criteria. School designs and standards were established during appraisal by
qualified firms to avoid problems previously encountered with the standard drawings used by
the UBEC which were not well designed.

6.8     The Bank utilized a collaborative process with the States during preparation. The
Bank team took the feedback from the State preparation teams into account in finalizing
design options. When the Bank suggested expanding the school grants to include purchasing
of textbooks and teacher training, the States expressed concerns that school-focused
implementation and procurement was risky, given the lack of establishment of School Based
Management Committees. Institutional arrangements, including monitoring and evaluation,
were clarified. Procurement arrangements reflecting State’s concerns were agreed upon.

6.9     During the delay in project effectiveness, the Bank and CUBE continued to work with
State teams to finalize preparatory documents such as bidding documents, training manuals,
selection of key consultants and development of Terms of References. When changes in lead
personnel were made, the Bank team advised the States that they needed to ensure that few
changes were made over the course of the project, and that new staff are fully aware of the
project.

6.10 A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was conducted in November 2006 that
concurred with the project's state-based approach, but suggested the need for more clarity on
the whole school approach, in relation to: (1) how various inputs would be integrated into
packages; and (2) the relationship between demand-driven school grants and the funding by
state governments through centralized procurement (World Bank 2012). This feedback was
used to make revisions with the design.
                                               31


6.11 There were several shortcomings in preparation. Preparation underestimated the
complexity of the task of establishing the information management system and data
collection process and the time this would take. It was evident that CUBE would end during
the initial stage of implementation, yet its support was a critical part of design that would be
needed until the end of the project. For example, CUBE was to support each state with a
National Procurement Consultant and International Procurement Consultant during the
project implementation, despite the fact that the project would end. It was reasonable to
provide this technical support, given that Kano and Kwara did not have experience
implementing Bank financed education projects. However, this role would seem more likely
for the Bank, since Bank personnel were in a better position to advise about its operational
procedures. While the project appraisal document noted that culture and poverty were the
main reason why girls did not participate in school, there were no studies to explore the
socio-cultural and religious resistance to girls’ education to better inform design. However,
the Bank team reported that information from Dfid’s implementation of the Girls Education
Program was utilized during preparation. There were weaknesses in the design of the project
(See Relevance of Design) and monitoring and evaluation (See Monitoring and Evaluation
Design and Relevance of Design).

6.12 While the Federal Ministry of Education was involved in project preparation, it had a
very limited role in this project. The limited role related to problems with the previous
Universal Basic Education project, but this decision to minimize the Federal role reduced the
knowledge sharing and demonstration effects from the project, according to respondents.
Subsequent Bank education projects have ensured a Federal role in the education projects to
create greater synergy between the project and ongoing national reforms and interventions.

Quality of Supervision
6.13   Quality of Supervision is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6.14 There was a smooth transition between the task team leaders at preparation and
supervision. One task team leader (TTL) was dedicated to each State throughout the course
of the project. This allowed for each State team to have more contact with a Bank team
member, as well as allowed for each TTL to spend more time in each State during
supervision missions, given the geography in Nigeria. The Bank team worked closely with
the implementation unit through monthly video-conferences where the State teams came to
Abuja and were connected with staff in Washington. Implementation was also enhanced,
since one of the TTLs was based in Abuja, which provided county knowledge, as well as
permitted States closer contact with the Bank team.

6.15 The Bank team continued its policy dialogue with education officials in each State.
Opportunities for further advocacy related to girls’ education presented during the Mid-term
Review. During the early childhood development pilot, the Bank held workshops that
engaged ECD experts, as well as other development partners and each State’s Ministry of
Health and Education.

6.16 The Bank and DfID worked separately on their respective activities, but jointly
conducted the mid-term review. Better coordination between the work of the Bank and DfID
                                               32


may have enhanced the EMIS, state and local capacity building efforts and teacher
professional development.

6.17 The Bank expressed concern when baseline data were delayed, but its supervision
ratings such as progress on the development objective and monitoring and evaluation were
not used to signal its concerns. While the issue of reliable project data was consistently
communicated by the Bank team to the implementation unit, most ratings were in the
satisfactory range across the life of the project, even though outcome data were lacking to be
able to substantiate progress on the development objective and monitoring and evaluation.

6.18 There were major shortcomings in the activities added at Midterm review, as well as
other aspects of supervision. The conditional transfer program was implemented during the
final phase of the project. The moral repercussions of beginning the program at the project’s
final months were minimized because DfID continued its support to the program. Design
was lacking in relation to the ECD pilot, as well as tracking, which did not permit a clear
understanding of what was attained nor ability to test the merits of a small-scale intervention.
Weaknesses in monitoring evaluation were not addressed during supervision. No indicators
were incorporated in relation to the two pilot activities added at Midterm review. The project
closed as planned despite the fact that the project had ten fewer months to implement. An
extension may have provided time for the three outstanding projects in Kwara to be
completed. The completion status of the civil works was reported to the Bank. As a
consequence, the three civil works projects were unfinished at the time of the IEG mission.
As well, a later closing date may have permitted funding for another round of grants for the
CCT pilot, as the second payment did not reach the Implementing Agency’s account before
the closing date.

Borrower Performance
6.19   Government Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6.20 The Federal Government demonstrated commitment to basic education and girls’
education. It adopted a National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy
(2003), which emphasized reform of education as the means to socioeconomic
empowerment. A representative from the Federal Ministry of Finance participated in the
IEG Mission in Kwara.

6.21 While the Federal Ministry of Education was involved in project preparation, it had
limited involvement in the project, restricted to the National Steering Committee.
Representatives from the Federal Ministry of Education participated in some supervision
missions with the Bank team.

6.22   Implementing Agency Performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6.23 State government officials and the State Ministry of Education were committed to the
project, even during elections and bureaucratic changes. Commissioners of Education and
other State representatives participated in the project launch.
                                               33


6.24 Members of each States preparation team worked under short timelines to deliver the
required documents. With the support of CUBE, they developed the Education Sector Plan,
operational plans, project manuals, and technical papers, and many other preparatory
documents.

6.25 A project implementation unit within each State Ministry of Education oversaw the
project management and fiduciary responsibilities. Staff from the State Ministry of
Education were on secondment to the project implementation unit from the State Ministry of
Education. In this way, capacity built during the project remained with the Ministry. It was
also reported to be a way to ensure staff had adequate time to devote to the project.
Performance by the implementation teams in the three States steadily improved as a result of
the careful selection of personnel and technical assistance. Meetings were held between the
States and the participating LGAs to inform them on the activities, implementation
arrangements, and their respective roles and responsibilities in the project. The original level
of commitment for CCT amongst Government officials in Kano is unclear, and their support
appears to have waned.

6.26      Monitoring and evaluation proved to be more difficult than anticipated. There was
slow progress on data entry and reporting by the States, as well as longer time to collect
Annual School Census data. There were delays in setting up the EMIS, which related to
difficulties in harmonizing a Federal EMIS and, complexity of the system’s original design.
There was slow attention to analysis of Annual School Census.

Monitoring and Evaluation
6.27   The quality of M&E is rated Modest.

6.28 M&E Design: While the appraisal document provided targets for key indicators,
baseline data, timetable and responsibility for implementation, there were shortcomings (See
Monitoring and Evaluation Design). The key performance indicators were transition and
completion rates, and measurement of reading and mathematics learning. Most of the other
indicators in the Results Frameworks were outputs: school development plans, teachers
trained, schools rehabilitated, textbooks, and quality assurance inspection, relating mainly to
the quality objective. No indicators were selected to assess the ECD or CCT pilots.
Baselines were revised in 2010, because the data in the appraisal document was unreliable
and not disaggregated by LGA.

6.29 An impact evaluation was designed for the pilot conditional cash transfer program.
The evaluation was to provide evidence of the results, and monitor the fidelity of the
implementation. The evaluation was designed to test whether CCT counteract school supply
or distance constraints to secondary education. It also studied the differential effect of
different amounts of subsidy (e.g. higher transfer of approximately US$ 130 and lower
amount US$ 65). The study was financed by ESSPIN and Bank provided technical
assistance. At the time of IEG’s Mission, preliminary results of the program were available,
but not the final report. The benefit to the Government in using the results of the evaluation
to make informed decisions about continuing the pilot may be reduced with this delay.
                                                 34


6.30 M&E Implementation: The Project Support Unit was responsible for monitoring
project performance indicators. Given the delay in establishing the State-level EMIS (related
to delays in Federal EMIS), as well as the time it took to conduct the Annual School Census,
project outcome data was not available until 2010 (nearly two years after project inception).
This became the project baseline, since the data available at preparation was state-level,
rather than LGA disaggregated. This left the project with no trend data, since the subsequent
Annual School Census report was not available by the close of the project. Intermediate
indicators were tracked throughout the project. Since the IEG Mission, Annual School
Census Reports were available in each State for 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2011-2012, but
there was delay with the release of the 2012-2013 data and were unavailable at the time of
the IEG Mission.

6.31 Reliability of school-level data is a continued concern expressed by respondents. In
2009 a validation of the School Census was done, which found some over reporting, but the
report largely confirmed the validity of the results. In the preparation of this report,
arithmetical errors were found in the reports from Kaduna and Kano, as well as other data
inconsistencies.

6.32 M&E Utilization: Despite the capacity building efforts conducted during the project,
the State Ministries of Education exhibited modest utilization of M&E as a tool to inform
policy or make decisions. The changes reported mainly related to compiling data. School
Report Cards were produced and disseminated in 2010. An Education Sector Analysis Report
was produced annually beginning in 2009.


7. Lessons
7.1       Based on the experience of this project, several lessons can be drawn:

         Learning and sustainability of pilot activities are limited when there is an
          absence of clear design, an explicit mechanism for evaluating, and a sufficient
          implementation time frame. Initiating the girls CCT during the last year of the
          project provided insufficient time to implement the pilot. As well, it is difficult to
          determine the benefits and effectiveness of the pilot ECD activities, given the absence
          of the monitoring and evaluation system and implementation plan. Without strong
          design and evaluation, there is no way to identify whether the pilot activity is worthy
          of scaling-up or sustaining. Pilots generate further interest in sustaining or scaling-up
          when robust data are collected.

         Setting up a monitoring and evaluation system takes more time than
          Governments and TTLs often recognize and provide. An overly complex system
          was designed and replaced with a simplified one. In environments with low capacity,
          understanding the critical data needs of the Government is essential, as well as the
          amount of technical assistance that will be required. During this project, it took
          considerable time for the States to collect and analyze the Annual School Census.
                                          35


   A prior unsuccessful project can result in learning, but it depends upon an
    accurate understanding of the performance issue. This project avoided some of
    the shortcomings in the predecessor Bank project, Universal Basic Education Project.
    DfID’s TA was aligned with the objective of this project. However, each partner
    worked separately to complete respective responsibilities within the project. Better
    coordination between the work of the Bank and DfID may have enhanced the EMIS,
    state and local capacity building efforts and teacher professional development.

   Even with a State-focused project, the involvement of the Federal Ministry of
    Education is critical given its central role in policy. However, the difficulties
    related to the Federal implementation in the Universal Basic Education project were
    not fully understood. During preparation, instead of designing approaches to
    overcome the challenges experienced by the Federal Ministry of Education with the
    Universal Basic Education Project, the Federal role was minimal. This reduced the
    buy-in by the Federal Ministry of Education and likelihood of replicating project
    activities in other states.

   Improving inputs into learning (facilities, textbooks, etc.) needs to be
    accompanied by defining and addressing quality requirements in terms of
    minimum standards for student learning. While this project improved the inputs
    and physical conditions for learning, these may not translate into improved student
    learning, as the key issue of teachers’ capacities was insufficiently addressed by the
    project. When teachers’ numeracy, literacy, and language skills are low, children’s
    learning will be compromised. This is particularly true in rural areas as more skill
    deficiencies were found among rural teachers. There also continue to be issues in how
    teachers are allocated amongst schools.

Some caveats should be noted about these studies. These evaluations tested a sample of
fourth and sixth grade students in Kwara, Kaduna, and Kano using some items from the
Monitoring and Learning Achievement (Johnson, Hsief, Oniborn, 2007; Abe 2011). While
the test was the same between the baseline and end study, there was difference in the
assessment method to test reading comprehension. The baseline study directly assessed what
children were actually able to read by providing a 51 word passage to children, while the end
study had enumerators read the passage to students, which tested listening comprehension.
As well, each evaluation utilized a different sample of students (baseline sample of grade
four students was 1,873 in reading and 1,814 in mathematics; end sample of grade four
students was 3,810 in reading and 2,765 in mathematics) and neither controlled for other
factors. The process to develop the sample was not described in either report, thus, it is not
clear whether the samples are representative of students in project LGAs. Given these
limitations, direct comparisons of the 2007 and 2011 results should not be made.

Subject:        RE: PPAR

Sir/Madam

Please find below a draft of our response to the PPAR.

           KADUNA STATE RESPONSE TO THE ESP (P096151) DRAFT BY THE IEG

1. PRINCIPAL RATING pg v
All the ratings are in order but we wished that the PPAR's rating on ' outcome' which is
'moderately unsatisfactory' would have been 'moderately satisfactory' since the project
design, though might not have been perfect, but was tailored towards the stated objectives.
To a larger extend, the efficacy dimension was equally achieved. However this observation is
subject to the results sheet presented.

2. LESSONS pg x
All lessons drawn from this project are accurate. If there will be another SESP or similar
projects, and I hope there will be lessons drawn will be very useful. This lesson will need to
be taken up early to succeed.

3. EFFICIENCY pg 28
This project was executed in just 3years 2 months as rightly observed. The execution time
was very short against the original plan. We wish we had full time.

CONCLUSION
We acknowledged and commended the thorough work of the IEG which has opened our eyes
to so many potholes from design to implementation. We appreciate all observations and
ratings. We appreciate the entire concept of the project which has become a guide to
government's roadmap for education. However, SEEP was a pilot project which was done in
only 3 States and only 6 LGAs out of the project23 Kaduna has. Also only in some few
schools in the project LGAs. We will therefore appreciate it much if the IEG will recommend
a scaling up to a full national project because the need for education by the teaming
population is enormous and the funding gap is very wide for any state to shoulder. There are
quite lot children out there who need education but the resources are limited. There are many
girls out there who have no option than to go and marry because their parents would rather
sponsor the boy child.

Yours sincerely,

Director/PRS
Kaduna State
