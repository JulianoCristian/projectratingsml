epidemic diseases among the\n            Senegalese populations, with a reduction of malaria,\n            schistosomiasis and onchocerciasis. For the year 2002, the\n            following benchmarks are established: (1) reduce by 25\n            percent infant mortality attributable to malaria; (2) reduce\n            by 90 percent school-age children morbidity attributable to\n            urinary schistosomiasis; and (3) eliminate the risk of\n            blindness due to onchocerciasis. To achieve these\n            objectives, the project will support policy measures\n            designed to: (1) improve management and implementation of\n            disease control activities; (2) develop an integrated and\n            computerized health management information system (SIG) and\n            its use; and (3) strengthen the National Endemic Disease\n            Service's (SNGE) capabilities and the Hygiene and\n            Public Health Directorate's (DHSP) ability in project\n            management. Specifically, project support will take the form\n            of financing consultant services to design and produce\n            information campaigns and national control programs, and\n            studies and operational research; the education of\n            opinionmakers and householders; using preventative measures\n            and dispensing pharmaceuticals to treat schoolchildren;\n            training nurses and the national endemic disease service\n            staff; the procurement of computer hardware and software,\n            furniture and other equipment; and the design and\n            supervision of civil works."}, "docdt": "1997-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
