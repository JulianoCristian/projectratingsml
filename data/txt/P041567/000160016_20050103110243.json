Several lessons were gleaned from this\n            project: concerning addressing institutional issues under a\n            programmatic approach; avoiding sole reliance on strong\n            technical project preparation without paying attention to\n            the operationally integrating this project into the\n            Integrated Health Sector Development Program; carefully\n            assessing the benefits from financing construction of\n            headquarters for Ministries or other government agencies;\n            decentralizing the responsibility for managing activities\n            and finances be decentralized to foster strong ownership of\n            projects by the regions and the districts ; resorting to\n            alternative service delivery mechanisms (for distributing\n            malaria bed nets and for schistosomiasis treatment) to\n            improve project performance; and 6) ensuring  strong\n            coordination exists between the two teams, the\n            projects' objectives and implementation strategies are\n            complementary; and there is strong, balanced government\n            leadership for both projects before IDA prepares\n            simultaneous projects in the same sector. Other lessons\n            addressed the need for consensus and clarity in the\n            institutional set up of projects, clearly defining the lines\n            of responsibility for project management, effective\n            supervision with strong support from the country office, the\n            fallacy of relying on  disbursement as a reliable indicator\n            of project success, and collecting indicators for project\n            monitoring as an integral part of project preparation and supervision."}, "docdt": "2004-12-14T00:00:00Z"}
