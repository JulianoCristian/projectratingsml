Corrigendum
The second sentence in paragraph 42 of the President's Report and
Recommendation on a proposed loan to Fabrika Odlivaka Beograd (R74-30)
contains an inadvertent error. The sentence should read as follows:
"The remaining financing required of US$33.7 million (plus
duties and taxes and interest during construction which
together total US$20.3 million) would be met from internal
cash generation, a loan from Beogradska Banka and a small
loan from IMT (which is FOB's major customer)."

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
FABRIKA ODLIVAKA BEOCRAD WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Fahrika Odlivaka Beograd (FOB), with the guarantee of the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, for the equivalent of USS15.0 million to help
finance an iron foundry project. The loan would have a term of 14 years, in-
cluding four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The
Government of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, which would provide a prior
guarantee required under Yugoslav law, would charge a guarantee fee of 1-3/4
percent per annum on the outstanding amount of the Bank loan, bringing the
cost of the loan to the enterprise to 9 percent per annum.
PART I - TIIE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Yugoslavia in October/November
1972, and its report entitled "The Economic Development of Yugoslavia" dated
November 26, 1973, (R74-1) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
January 2, 1974. An updating mission visited Yugoslavia in October 1973.
Its report is under-preparation. Basic data on the economy of Yugoslavia
are given in Annex I.
3.        Yugoslavia has experienced rapid economic growth and rising living
standards during the last decade, with total GDP at constant prices having in-
creased at about 5-1/2 percent per year and per capita GDP at over 4-1/2
percent a year. Economic growth has proceeded in an environment of major
institutional and organizational changes, characterized by the decentraliza-
tion of economic management, the creation of a market economy and the opening
un of the economy to international trade, with the objective of increasing
economic efficiency and improving the allocation of resources.
4.        The poptulation growth rate, averaged 1.0 percent per year during the
last decade; the rate in the less-developed Republics was 1.6 percent compared
to 0.7 percent in the developed Republics. There is little open unemployment.
There is, however, some evidence of growing regional and occupational imbal-
ance in labor demand and supply. This results from the low mobility between
labor surplus less-developed regions and labor-scarce developed regions, and
a discrepancy between the skills needed in a fast-changing economy and those
supplied by the present education system.
5.        Economic growth in the less-developed regions has been as rapid as
that of the more developed, but the per capita income in the former regions
has increased more slowly because of faster population growqth. Consequently,
regional inequalities have widened. Yugoslavia has had an active regional



-2-
developnent policy for more than two decades. The policy aims at reducing
regional inequality by achieving a growth rate above the national average in
the less-developed regions, financed by a transfer of resources mainly through
the Fund for the Accelerated Development of Underdeveloped Regions. In ad-
dition, Federal budgetary grants are provided to the less-developed regions
for current expenditure for social purposes such as health and education.
Recent Developments
6.        Economic development during 1968-1971 was characterized by a rela-
tively rapid increase in exports and production (averaging 12 and 7 percent
per year in real terms, respectively), the emergence of serious inflationary
pressures and substantial balance of payments deficits (averaging $220 million).
In 1970 the Government adopted measures to counter the rising inflationary
pressures and improve the external payments position. These measures aimed
at restricting monetary expansion, limiting public expenditures, strengthening
price controls, imposing financial discipline on enterprises and developing an
incomes policv. In addition, it adopted a policy of frequent exchange rate ad-
justments in order to neutralize the effect of inflationary pressures on the
balance of payments. After a period of unchanged rates, following a major
devaluation in 1965, the dinar was devalued by 16.6 percent in January 1971.
In the course of the international currency realignment in December 1971,
Yugoslavia devalued again by 18.8 percent against gold and by 11.8 percent
against the dollar. Followving the more recent devaluation of the dollar,
Yugoslavia adjusted the gold parity of the dinar to maintain its parity with
the dollar until mid-July 1973. Since then the dinar has been floating vis-
a-vis the US dollar along with other European currencies.
7.        Largely as a result of the policy measures undertaken since 1970,
export growth picked up, import growth declined, and the investment boom
slowed down. In 1972 and 1973, exports of goods and services increased bv an
average of 24 nercent while imports grew only at an average rate of about 15
percent. Workers' remittances increased by 36 percent per year to $890 mil-
lion in 1972 and an estimated $1.2 billion in 1973. Consenuently, the current
account showed a surplus of about $420 million in 1972 compared to a deficit
of about $3?0 million in 1971. In 1°73, a current account surplus is again
anticipated, although not as large as in 1972. Foreign exchange reserves,
which were equivalent to about one month's imports in 1970 and 1971, have
increased to the equivalent of nearly six montlhs' merchandise imports at
present.
8.        Uhile the restrictive measures, which have now been rescinded or
relaxed, were successful in improving the external payments position and the
financial situation of enterprises, there has been no slowdown in the rate of
inflation. Prices continue to rise at 15-20 percent a year. The 1970 policy
measures have also reduced economic growth. Real GDP increased by 4.4 percent
in 1972 and an estimated 6 percent in 1973 as against 8.8 percent in 1971.



-3-
Prospects
9.        With the relaxation of the restrictive measures, real GDP is expec-
ted to groiw at about 6 percent in 1974 and, barring unfavorable external de-
velopments, further satisfactory growth may be expected beyond 1974. Hiowever,
a favorable balance of payments situation is not assured. For 1974 a current
account surplus is not envisaged; export and import growth may be expected to
return to pre-1972 levels. The growth of workers' remittances can no longer
se counted on as a major additional revenue source, because the Government has
instituted a policy to stop the growth of the external labor force.
10.       The direct impact of the oil price situation on the Yugoslav economy
is likely to be limited. The government encourages the use of domestic energy
sources and 77 percent (in caloric terms) of Yugoslavia's energy needs are met
therefrom. Domestically-mined coal is the main fuel. Most thermal electricity
plants are coal fired. Hydro-generation provides more than half of the coun-
try's electricity; only one-third of hydro-generation potential has been de-
veloped. Oil is used mostly to produce gasoline and diesel fuel. Yugoslavia
imports about 40 percent of its crude oil consumption from the USSR and the
remainder from YN!iddle Eastern countries. It maintains friendly relations with
nearby oil producers and its import supplies are not expected to be endangered.
However, the price increases are expected to raise the country's import bill
bv about $320 million or about 6 percent of 1974 imports. Emerging shortages
of electricity are due more to delays in plant construction and a recent drought
(reducing hydro-po%.ier output) than to fuel shortages. The indirect consequences
of the energy crisis are far from clear. Since most factories and thermal power
plants are fueled by coal and the price of coal can be influenced by the govern-
ment, the country's international competitive position should improve. On the
other hand, exports and opportunities for Yugoslavs to find employment abroad
may diminish if economic activity in Western Europe slows down.
11.       The 1971-1975 Social. Development Plan, adopted in June 1972, aims
at an overall growth rate of 7.5 percent per year with agricultural production
growiing at an average rate of 3.2 percent and industrial production at an aver-
age rate of 8 percent per year. Exports are projected to grow at about 11-13
percenit per year and imports at about 9-11 percent annually. The Plan stresses
the importance of achieving domestic stabilization, improving resource allocation
and increasing productive efficiency to attain these targets. Domestic savings
rates are expected to be maintained at the present level of around 23 percent
of GDP, and would finance about 80 percent of gross investment. The bulk of
the projected external resource gap would be covered largely from workers'
remittances from abroad. Present indications are that the Plan targets of a
CDP growth rate of 7.5 percent and an inflation rate of 6.5 percent per annum
are unlikely to be achieved. With both exports and imports running at higher
than Plan projected rates and the current account in surplus in 1973, the
balance of payments targets appear feasible.
12.       The prospects for continued economic growth in the medium-term are
good. The endowmnent of natural and human resources, together with the prag-
matic and dynamic approach to the solution of economic problems, the readi-
ness to consider and undertake necessary institutional changes, and the



-
strong commitment to an open, market-oriented economy, give grounds for a
favorable assessment of future prospects.
External Assistance
13.       Gross capital inflows have more than tripled during the last five
years, reaching US$1,250 million in 1973. Most of thiese funds are medium-term
commercial credits, reflecting the limited assistance from govermnents, and
the liberalization of foreign trade and borrowing regulations following the
1965 Economic Reform. The inflow of bilateral and commercial credits has
been largely from the United States, Federal Republic of Germany, Switzerland,
Italy and the United Kingdom. IBRD loans have been the main source of long-
term capital since 1968. Yugoslavia has, so far, not been able to place pub-
lic bond issues on the world capital markets. However, three private place-
ments (medium-term) totalling US$115 millior, were made in 1972 in the U.S.,
and other possibilities for raising long-tei-m funds are being explored.
14.       The dependence of Yugoslav industrial production on imported equip-
ment and raw materials continues to create a strong link between the growth
rate of GDP and import demand. With a foreign exchange earnings growth rate
of about 11 percent a year, the 1974-79 growth rate of GDP, compatible with a
manar-eable current account deficit, would be about 7.5 percent.  This forecast
is based on the latest information on the possible impact of the fuel price
increases on the Yugoslav economy. It implies au import elasticity between
1974 and 1979 of 1.5 (compared to 1.9 during the 1966-69 period and results
in an average net foreign exchange financing requirement of around $370 mil-
lion a year between 1974 and 1979, mainly in convertible currencies. Allow-
ing for further borrowings on present average terms (7 years, 6 percent in-
terest), this needed net inflow implies a much hiigher level for the gross
inflow, rising to $2.6 billion in 1979 from its 1972 level of about $1.1
billion.
15.       Already agreed bilateral loans in converti'ble currencies (mostly
from the United States, Italy, France, Federal Republic of Germany and Japan)
should result in a gross inflow of about $180 million per annum in the medium-
term. The Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to provide in addition de-
velonment credits equal to $260 million on concessionary terms. The gross
inflow from multilateral sources, mostly the World Bank, should increase from
a level of about $49 million in 1973 to about $155 millioo In 1979. Official
sources of convertible currencies would then provide around 22 percent of the
gross inflow.  In late 1972 Yugoslavia negoti:ted a long-tx:tm credit of $540
million equivalent with the Soviet ITnion for financinlg imports of investment
goods during 1973-75. The agreemer;t foresees a *ontinuation of financing in-
vestment goods imports of $450 mnillion after 1975. These credits are expected
to be used mainly to finiaice prolects in tLle coal, oil, eletAric power, ferrous
and non-ferrous metal industries,  The dent service burden of these credits
will be fairly low due to the soft terms they carry.   lhei-e have been diffi-
culties in utilizing the credit because of thie lack of suitable technology and
design of Soviet manufactured products.



16.       The Government has tried to encourage private foreign investment
through special legislation enacted in 1967, and by November 1973, 80 joint
venture agreements had been signed between local and foreign enterprises,
involving a total investment of about US$120 million. The conditions ;-,or
foreign partners in joint ventures with Yugoslav enterprises have recently
been further improved in an effort to encourage a more rapid flow of foreign
investment.
17.       Private credits necded to fill the gap will have to increase from
the 1973 level of about $900 million to approximately $2.2 billion in 1979.
So far little difficulty has been experienced in obtaining the amounts of
financial and suppliers' credits needed, but the terms have become harder.
External Debt MTanagement
18.       The pattern of capital inflow since the mid-1960's has led to a
deterioration in the maturity structure of external debt. The Government,
aware of the dangers of unregulated growth of external debt, has embarked
on an active debt management policy. Since mid-1971, all foreign credits
have to be registered with the National Bank to ensure that contracted
credits remain within the ceilings determined by the Federal Government and
the N1ational Bank, and that the terms of borrowing are appropriate to the
transaction and to the general economic situation. In April 1972, a new
system for regulating external borrowing was adopted. It operates by in-
fluencing the cost of external borrowing through varying dinar deposit re-
quirements according to the terms and purpose of the credit. Moreover, the
National Bank has been given authority to veto any credit arrangement. The
Government has also embarked on a stabilization program that includes re-
scheduling or refinancing existing debts and obtaining longer term credits.
The United States agreed to reschedule US$58.5 million of debt payments
falling due in 1971 and 1972, and Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany,
France, Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed to extend financial cred-
its to relieve the debt burden (see para. 15).
19.       Total external public and publicly-guaranteed debt outstanding as
of December 31, 1972 was US$1,730 million.   In addition, there was US$1,820
million non-guaranteed external debt outstanding on that date. Total debt
service payments in 1973 are estimated to amount to about US$1,270 million,
mostly in convertible currencies. This represented 19 percent of the countr,y's
foreign exchange earnings. The percentage increases to 25 percent if the debts
and earnings in non-convertible currencies are excluded. The debt service
ratio is expected to remain at about the 1973 level during the next five years.
Takin', into account Yugoslavia's debt service record and the new measures
for improved external debt management, the prospective growth of production
and exports and the expected foreign exchange earnings from tourism and
workers' remittances, Yugoslavia is creditworthy for substantial Bank lending.



-6-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
20.       The Bank has made 24 loans to Yugoslavia totalling about US$765
million equivalent. The proposed loan would be the second of three direct
loans for industry in Yugoslavia (the recently approved loan for the Kikinda
Iron Foundry Project being the first and the proposed loan for IMT, being pre-
sented to the Executive Directors at the same time as this loan, the third).
Of the previous loans for indtustry (four loans totalling US$46.9 million)
three were channelled through the Yugoslav Investment Bank and one through
the Yugoslav Government. In general, Bank lending has been concentrated in
infrastructure projects such as transportation (five highway loans totalling
US$150 million, three railway loans totalling US$155 million, and one gas pipe-
line loan of $59.4 million), power (three loans totalling US$135 million),
telecommunications (US$40 million) and three multipurpose projects (totalling
US$103 million). Loans have also been made for tourism (two loans totalling
US$30 million) and for an agricultural industries project (US$31 million).
IFC has made seven investments totalling about US$70 million in Yugoslavia.
Its most recent operation, a loan (with some equity conversion rights) of
US$10 million to the Zelezarna Jesenice/ARMCO joint venture for manufacturing
special steel, was approved by the Executive Directors on January 29, 1974.
21 .      There have been delays in the execution of several projects, partic-
ularly the Railway Modernization Program of FY 65 (Loan 395-YE), the Belgrade-
Bar Railway Project of TY 68 (Loan 531-YU) and the Babin Kuk Tourism Project
of FY 71 (Loan 782-YU). The main reason for the delays lies in the decentral-
ization of political and economic management in Yugoslavia. The problems have
been exacerbated by financial and technical difficulties, cost overruns and the
shortage of domestic financing.   The Banlk has increased its efforts to deal
with these problems, especially by providing assistance to review the situation
of the railwvays and by increasing the number of supervision and other missions.
The situation is improving. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IFC investments as at December 31, 1973 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects.
22.       The major objectives of Bank lending to Yugoslavia are:    (a) to ac-
celerate development in the less-developed regions of the country; (b) to pro-
mote agricultural development, particularly in the private sector, by providing
basic infrastructure and credit for the financing of farm development, equip-
ment and processing facilities; (c) to promote structural reforms in major
sectors of the economy through improved coordination, the strengthening of
institutions and technical assistance, and (d) to provide Yugoslavia with
long-term external capital and thus help reduce the country's dependence on
short-term external borrowings. These objectives are basically the same as
those which guided lending in previous years, but efforts to give snecial
support to the less-developed regions and the small farmers in the private
sector are bein,, strengthened, and a continuing high level of technical as-
sistance will be provided in aDpropriate cases.



23.       To achieve these objectives, loans for further support of railway
modernization, expansion of the port facilities of Bar, river regulation,
urban pollution control, roads and highways, power generation and transmis-
sion and an oil pipeline are envisaged during the next two years. Also
planned for this period are an agricultural credit project to promote the
development of private sector farms, as well as social sector agriculture,
and an industrial line of credit to assist small- and medium-size industrial
enterprises. IFC is currently investigating several new investment opportun-
ities to encourage joint ventures which will provide technical, management
and marketing expertise as well as long-term capital.
24.       In addition, the Bank's technical assistance has included reviews
of the power, tourism and transnortation sectors. Other current Bank activ-
ities include EDI assistance for a project appraisal training institution,
including training some of its teachers; assistance with a study of the
Yiuooslav capital market, which should help improve resource mobilization and
allocation, and lhelp in establishing a training program for auditors in
Yugoslavia's Social Accounting Service, which audits all enterprises and gov-
ernment activities, including several Bank-financed projects.
25.       Bank commitments to Yugoslavia have averaged close to US$100 mil-
lion annuallv in the last three years. Although this represents only a rela-
tively small proportion of the countrv's need for external finance, it is
equivalent to almost one third of the annual long-term official capital in-
flow in convertible currencies. Assuming that the level of Bank lending rises
during the next five years, the outstanding debt to the Bank could rise from
12 percent of Yugoslavia's total external debt in 1972, to 19 percent by 1978.
Service on Bank loans as a proportion of total debt service would increase
from 4 percent to 7 percent during the same period.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IN YUGOSLAVIA
26.       The main objective of Yugoslavia's development strategy during the
past two decades has been the transformation of a predominantly primary pro-
ducing economy into a highly industrialized economy. Rapid industrialization,
modernizationt and integration of the economy with the world market have been
emplhasized. Industrial development policy has included both import substitu-
tioIn and exnort promotion, with the emphasis varying by sub-sectors and their
stage of development. In the first postwar decade priority was given to in-
vestments in heavy industries and power generation. In the late 1950's the
strategy changed to the stimulation of manufacturing industries. Since the
dependence of the economy on imports, particularly raw materials and invest-
ment ,oods, has increased significantly, the current Five-Year Social Develop-
ment Plan (1971-1975) projects growth of industrial output at 8 percent per
annum and emphasizes the need to accelerate the development of domestic
resource-based industries, both for export and use in domestic production.
For example, the production of steel and steel products is expected to grow
at around 15 percent per year and by 1975 should provide 70 percent of the
estimated domestic demand.



27.       Industry has played a key role in Yugoslavia's economic growth.
It accounts for about one-third of GDP, one-half of economic investments
and 39 Dercent of social sector employment. Industrial output rose at about
9 percent annually in real terms over the last decade; industrial exports
grew at about 14 percent annually and accounted for 85 percent of total mer-
chandise exports in 1972. Yugoslavia has become more competitive, particularly
in western markets, as a result of its diversified production and export struc-
ture, and persistent efforts to increase efficiency. A number of cooperative
and joint venture agreements with foreign partners have been concluded.
28.       Despite a long period of rapid growth, the development of the in-
dustrial sector has suffered from a number of problems including deficiencies
in the countrywide coordination of investment planning, lack of mobility of
both labor and capital, distortions in the allocation of resources, and in-
creasing dependence on raw materials and investment goods imports. Growing
foreign debt service payments of industrial enterprises, due to heavy short-
and medium-term borrowing on relatively hard terms over the last five years,
have increased the need for long-term external finance.
29.       The Bank's lending to industry is directed at supportinv the Gov-
ernment in its efforts to improve the allocation of resources, reduce import
dependence and strengthen export capacity. It will also help improve the
structure and terms of the industrial sector's external borrowing. The pro-
posed project is in line with these objectives.
PART IV - ThE PROJECT
30.       Following an industrial identification mission in April 1971, the
Government in May 1972 submitted eight industrial projects to the Bank for
financing, including the expansion of Fabrika Odlivaka Beograd (FOB). A Bank
mission in December 1972 assisted in the preparation of the project, which
was appraised during April/May 1973. Negotiations were held in December 1973
in Washington. The Yugoslav delegation was led bv Mr. Gavra Popovic, Assist-
ant Federal Secretary for Finance, and included renresentatives of the Federal
Government, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Serbia, Beogradska
Banka and FOB (the Borrower).
The Foun dry Ind U5stry
31.       The domestic demand for castings is expected to increase from 375,000
tons in 1973 to abotut 690,000 tons in 1978.  The najor domestic consumers of
castings -- the agriculture machinery, motor vehicle, machine tool, electrical
and non-electrical equipment, rail wagon, construction and shipbuilding in-
dustries -- are expected to grow at average annual rates ranging from 9 to 19
percent.  The exnort demand for Yugoslav castings is also growing.    Taking the
two together, demand is projected to outstrip supply by 144,500 tons in 1978
even with the current expansion programs coinlng onstream.  If no castings were
ex;)orted demiand would still e-:ceed the supply by 36,000 tons in 1978.



-9-
Thc Borrower
32.       FOB is the second lar-gest iron castings producer in Yugoslavia.
Its headnuarters and production facilities -- a foundry with a capacity of
25,0'0 tons per year (TPY) and a pattern shon -- are located in New Belgrade.
Until recently it also operated two small foundries with a total capacity of
8,000 TPY at Rakovica, 5 km away. The Rakovica plant separated from FOB at
the end of 1973. The effect of the separation would be minor and would not
seriously affect FOB's operations, financial position or execution of the
project. FOB's facilities at New Belgrade started operations in 1947/48
witlh the production of cast iron pipes.   Following a number of changes and
expansion programs, FOB now concentrates on the manufacture of gray and nod-
ular iron castings for tractors and agricultural implements, motor vehicles
3nd ships.
33.       In 1970, the pattern shop and foundry in New Belgrade and the
fo'1ndries at Rakovica were merged to form FOB, as an autonomous, self-managed,
s.ciallv-owned enterprise.   At the same time it became a new member of
Udruzena Metailska Industrija (UMI), an association of seven enterprises
with common interests and coordinated general production, marketing and
development nrograms. Although UMI's approval is required for major in-
vestment projects, each member is a separate legal entity anid, in practice,
indenendent in its detailed produaction and marketing programs.
34.       FOB's organization follows the general Yugoslav concept of decen-
tralized economic decision-making, autonomy of the enterprise and workers'
self-management of social property. The policy-making body for each enter-
prise is a Workers' Council which is elected by the employees of the enter-
prise.  The W4orkers' Council appoints the General Manager and other key mem-
bers of management as well as the Executive Board consisting, in the case of
FOB, of eleven memhers (including the General Manager).    FOB management and
staff are generally well-trained and capable.    During its three years of
independent existence the enterprise has successfully increased production
and net income. The Bank staff has proposed some strengthening of FOB's
financial. and qu.ality control departments. The enterprise has accepted
these proposals and the arrangements are considered adequate.
Prolect De.s cr pt ion
35.       The pronosed project is of key significance for Yugoslavia's eco-
nomic development.   Both the Federal Government and the Government of Serbia
are giving high priority to this project.    It is also in line with the Social
Development PlAn 1971-75 of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia.
36.       A Loan and Project Sumnary is attached as Annex III.    The Appraisal
Report entitled 'Appraisal of FOB Foundry Expansion Project", No. 256a-YU,
dated January 23, 1974, is being distributed senarately to the Executive
Directors.  The project would include the modernization and expansion of:
(a) the iron foundrv (to increase annual production capacity
from 25,000 tons to about 90,000 tons);
(h) the pattern shop (to ahout double its current canacity);



- 10 -
(c) the storage and material handling system;
(d) the existing utility installations;
(p) the present infrastructure facilities; and
(f) the existing pollution control system.
The project would also improve FOB's budget, accounting and financial con-
trol svstems.
37.       The project is technically well conceived and designed to improve
productivity and Product quality while allowing sufficient flexibility to
change the product mix in keeping with changes in demand. It would be im-
plemented during 1974 to 1977 without significantly interfering with pro-
duction in the existing facilities.
38.       The proposed project would require the relocation of the Industrija
Masina i Traktora (1fiT) implement assembly plant which is currently located
on FOB property. FOB has received a commitment from IMT to remove the plant
lefore 1975, in time for the execution of FOB's project.   FOB has also obtained
commitments from the utility enterprises concerned for the timely development
of the necessary infrastructure facilities.
Project Execution
39.       FOB has established a special development division to execute the
project. Its current staff, although of high caliber, is too small to ade-
quately monitor Project execution. Also FOB's budget, accounting and finan-
cial control systems need improvement. FOB has given assurances that the
development division and the financial department will be augmented to provide
adequate staff for the task ahead. FOB has appointed an experienced consult-
ant firm to assist with implementing the project and improving the enterprise's
accounting and financial control system.
40.       The consultants would also assist in the preparation of specifications
for international competitive bidding and evaluation of tenders. An amount of
up to US$150,000 retroactive financing for these services is recommended. Civil
construction and erection of equipment would be carried out by Yugoslav con-
tractors, while FOB's own construction department would be responsible for
additions and alterations to the existing facilities. Equipment suppliers
would provide assistance in erection and start-up, and provide an operation
guaranitee.
Project Cost
41.       The total cost of the project, excluding duties and taxes of US$3.8
million, equivalent, would be US$48.7 million, with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$15.7 million (about 32 percent of the total project cost, exclud-
ing duties and taxes).  The proposed Bank loan of US$15.0 million would cover
about 96 percent of the total foreign exchange cost. Incremental working



- 11 -
capital requirements due to the project would be US$7.6 million and interest
during construction would amount to US$16.5 million. Equipment cost estimates
are derived from quotations received by FOB in the first quarter of 1973 from
suppliers in western countries. Pre-operating cost and start-up expenses are
based on FOB's previous experience. Civil engineering and construction costs
are based on quotations received by FOB in early 1973. Physical contingencies
equivalent to 10 percent of equipment and civil works cost estimates have been
included. The price contingency provision is based on the assumptions of a
6 percent annual rise in foreign equipment costs and annual increases in local
costs between 10 and 6 percent during 1973 and 1976.
Financing
42.       The proposed Bank loan would finance the costs of foreign equip-
ment and spare parts, except for the flaskless molding line, and foreign
consultant services as well as the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured
items included in foreign bids on large packages. The remaining financing
required of US$33.7 million (plus duties and taxes, incremental working cap-
ital and interest during construction which together total US$27.9 million)
would be met from internal cash generation, a loan from Beogradska Banka and
a small loan from IMT (which is FOB's major customer). Should additional
financing in domestic or foreign currencies be required at any time, FOB
would finance it with credits from Beogradska Banka. An agreement between
FOB and Beogradska Banka to this effect has been concluded.
Cost of Loan
43.       FOB would, in addition to the interest on the proposed Bank loan,
pay a guarantee fee of 1--3/4 percent to the Socialist Republic of Serbia. 1/
Thus the effective cost of the Bank loan to FOB would be 9 percent per annum.
Financial Position
44.       FOB's current financial position is sound and provides a good base
for expansion. Heavy borrowing for the project will strain the financial
position during the first three years of project implementation, but it will
improve thereafter. Debt service coverage will, however, remain adequate
and FOB has agreed to maintain its current assets to current liabilities
ratio at or above 1.3:1 at all times. Also, FOB has agreed to obtain the
concurrence of the Bank before:
1/   The Federal Government of Yugoslavia is required under Yugoslav Law to
obtain a guarantee from the Republic or Autonomous Province concerned,
in this case Serbia. The guarantee fee would, according to Yugoslav
regulations, accrue to the Socialist Republic of Serbia.



- 12 -
(a) undertaking new investments or incurring new debts in excess
of Din. 20 million, equivalent, a year until completion of
the project and Din. 75 million a year during the following
three years; and
(b) distributing its net income to its employees or allocating
it to the Collective Consumption Fund to the extent that the
net income is necessary for carrying out the project.
After completion of the project, FOB would consult the Bank prior to under-
taking new financial obligations or new investments in excess of Din. 75 mil-
lion, equivalent, a year. Under these conditions, FOB's temporary tight fi-
nancial position would be acceptable.
45.       FOB's estimated net income of Din. 32 million in 1973 is expected
to decline in 1974 and 1975, largely because of heavy interest payments on
new borrowing for the project which, according to Yugoslav regulations, are
charged to operating expenses. Thereafter, it is projected to increase from
about Din. S million in 1975 to Din. 115 million in 1978 -- about a fourteen-
fold increase in 3 years. Net sales are expected to increase by Din. 600
million (about US$38.7 million), or by about 180 percent between 1973 and 1978.
_arket
46.       Markets for FOB's products appear well assured.   In the past the
enterprise has sold about 85 percent of its production locally, largely to
otlher members of the UTMI group. FOB's expansion is directly linked to the
expansion of IMT, which would purchase about 21 percent of FOB's incremental
production, and the expected expansion of other Yugoslav industries such as
agricultural machinery, building construction, commercial vehicles and auto-
mobiles, rail wagons and shipbuilding. Their rapid growth is dependent on
the availability of castings which, if domestic output is not expanded, would
have to be imported under tight world supply conditions. Following the com-
pletion of the project FOB is expected to export almost 30 percent of its
production, with an increasing proportion sold to convertible currency areas.
Altlhough FOB's sales at present are predominantly domestic-oriented, exports
to the convertible currency area are expected to rise from the current level
of 5 percent to 22 percent of total sales by 1978. This seems reasonable in
view of FOB's international competitiveness in price and quality. Prices of
FOB's gray iron castings are comparable to those prevailing in Western Euro-
pean markets; prices for nodular castings are slightly and for patterns sig-
nificantly lower. Thus, FOB does not require the existing duty shelter of
25 percent except to be protected against the sale of foreign foundry prod-
ucts at or below marginal cost in Yugoslavia.    It has concluded export
agreements with Hungary and major motor vehicle manufacturers in Western
Europe, and is negotiating with other foreign and local firms for additional
supply contracts. Future demand for FOB's castings is expected to exceed
its capacity significantly.



- 13 -
47.       FOB and Kikinda, the other major foundry in Yugoslavia, have agreed
on the demarcation of their respective production. FOB will concentrate on the
manufacture of gray castings, while Kikinda will produce largely malleable and
nodular castings. FOB's nodular castings production will be sold primarily
within the UMI group while Kikinda's gray castings are used for its own machine
tool production.
Procurement
48.       The equipment and spares to be financed by the proposed loan would
be divided into 17 packages (15 packages for the foundry and 2 for the pattern
shop) and would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines. Equipment
packages costing over IJS$100,000, equivalent, would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding, while pack.ages costing less than US$100,000
(accounting for less than 3 percent of total foreign equipment costs) would
be obtained through a procedure under which the borrower may award contracts
after having received at least four comparable bids from qualified suppliers
in at least three eligible countries. Because of the need for the supplier
to be responsible for the overall performance of certain groups of equipment,
only foreign bids can be expected and, for the purpose of bid comparisons, it
is proposed that a preference margin of 15 percent 1/ be accorded to clearly
identified Yugoslav components incorporated in the foreign bids for four equip-
ment packages (cupola plant, sand preparation plant and the two molding lines,
estimated to cost about US$10 million, equivalent).' For the remaining 13 Bank
financed packages, no margin of preference would be accorded for Yugoslav
components.
Disbursements
49.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against the actual foreign exchange
cost (c.i.f. Yugoslav border or port of entry) of equipment and spare parts
(excluding the flaskless molding line); the ex-factory cost of locally manu-
factured items in foreign bids; and foreign consulting services for the proj-
ect. Disbursements would take place over three years from the beginning of
1974 to the end of 1976. A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in
the Loan and Project Summary (Annex III).
Audit
50.       FOB's accounts would be audited by the Social Accounting Service
(SAS), an autonomous governmental agency responsible for financial inspection
of Yugoslav economic enterprises, It audits several bank financed projects.
SAS started a training program in January 1974 under which its staff will
be trained by Coopers and Lybrand of the UK in auditing methods consistent
with internationally accepted requirements. It is likely to be some time
before it will be possible to fully realize the objective of the program.
Meanwhile, FOB has agreed to invite the SAS, in collaboration with Coopers
1/   Duties on equivalent components are more than 15 percent.



- 14 -
and Lybrand, to undertake the audit of its accounts as part of SAS's on-the-
job training of its staff.
Justification
51.       The incremental economic rate of return from the project would be
about 23 percent. The sensitivity analysis shows that even under foreseeable
adverse conditions the project would have a rate of return of more than 15
percent. The financial rate of return would be about 16 percent and under
foreseeable adverse conditions would not fall below 10 percent.
52.       Because of FOB's location close to the residential area of New
Belgrade, pollution control is essential. FOB has agreed to install and
maintain devices for dust and fume extraction in its existing and expanded
facilities at a cost of about Din. 30 million, representing some 14 percent
of the foundry equipment cost. The devices proposed would provide adequate
pollution control.
53.       At the end of 1973, there were 2,222 employees at the New Belgrade
foundry, including 170 temporary employees. The project is expected to double
labor productivity, but the number of permanent employees would be raised by
914 or 45 percent. In addition, it would create indirectly an estimated
2,000 jobs in the supplier industries and the transport sector.
54.       The project would help overcome a major constraint on long-term
economic growth in Yugoslavia, i.e. the shortage of convertible foreign ex-
change, by increasing exports and by providing a variety of industrial inputs
which otherwise would be imported. The net foreign exchange earnings and
savings of FOB would increase from about US$20 million, equivalent, in 1973
to about US$39 million in 1983.
55.       The project is of key significance for Yugoslavia's industrial de-
velopment. The further growth of the country's engineering industries, par-
ticularly those producing tractors and other agricultural machinery, motor
vehicles, snips and railways equipment is dependent on the expansion of iron
casting production. Some of the enterprises in these sub-sectors have already
started expansion programs in anticipation of the additional castings from
this project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between Fabrika Odlivaka Beograd and the
Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the normal
pattern for loans for industrial projects.



- 15 -
57.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECONMENDATION
58.       It has not been possible in these reports to take full account of
the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However, available
information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Loan 395 Railway Modernization Program: US$70.0 million Loan of December 11,
1964.
The loan was fully disbursed on October 31, 1972, after the Closing
Date had been postponed from December 31, 1969. However, completion of the
project has been delayed to 1975, due to financial planning and technical
difficulties. After 1966 the Yugoslav Railways suffered a continuous dete-
rioration of their financial position and liquidity for a number of related
reasons. Project cost estimates increased nearly threefold between 1963 and
1971 because of inflation, devaluation of the dinar, revaluation of some
European currencies and as a consequence of additional work following more
detailed feasibility studies. Payments for railway freight services were
lield back by the lack of liquidity in the whole economy. The five Railway
Transport Enterprises which, under the Yugoslav svstem, are expected to oper-
ate on a commercial basis, were restricted by Government regulations in their
ability to respond to changed market conditions. Furthermore, the responsi-
bility of the Federal Government to rmieet railway deficits has been transferred
to the Republican Governments, which only now are in a position to assume it.
In order to be able to make proposals for dealing not only with the
difficulties with the Bank project, but also with the difficulties facing the
Yugoslav railways as a whole, it was agreed with the Government in 1M71 that
the Bank would undertake a thorough review of the railways' problems.    Follow-
ing this review, which was carried out with the assistance of a consulting
team, the Bank discussed its findings with the Federal and Regional Governments
and the Railways. The response of the Governments and the Railways was very
favorable and they agreed to take concerted action to improve the railways'
situation. In view of this, the Bank agreed to consider making a further
loan in fiscal year 1973 or 1974 to assist completion of the 1964 modernization
program, provided that certain conditions could be met. These are the clari-
fication of government responsibility for the railways and an overall plan of
action hoth for the Yugoslav railways as a whole and for each Railway Enterprise
(including clear marketing and related operational and financial objectives),
a revised tariff policy, investment and disinvestment proposals, and proposals
for dealing with labor redundancy problems and for improvement in management.
The Governments and the railways have taken and are taking measures to meet
these conditions, and a mission visited Yugoslavia in November/December 1972
to assist in the preparation of new action plans. Revised investment and
financing plans required substantial re-appraisal of the project in May/June
1973 and a follow up mission in December 1973. The final size of the proposed
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

project is just now being determined, as Republics clarify the availability
of local resources and local agreements are being worked out to clarify the
respective responsibilities of the Governments and Railways, and a recommenda-
tion to the Executive Directors regarding a new Bank loan is expected to be
made later this spring.   This new financial assistance would be concentrated
on the completion of the 1964 modernization program of main lines.
Any further delay in carrying out a minimal modernization program
could further jeopardize the competitive position of the railways in relation
to road traffic and would extend the period in which the economy would not
benefit fully from the large investments in the Modernization Program made
with Bank assistance since 1964.
Loan 531 Belgrade-Bar Railway: US$50.0 million Loan of March 22, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Execution of this project was delayed by more than one year due to
geological difficulties and inefficiency of the contractor responsible for
the civil engineering work at the Kos Tunnel. The contract has now been placed
with another more efficient contractor already working for the project. The
delays have made it necessary to reschedule track-laying which is now expected
to be completed in 1975. The line is expected to become operative at the end
of 1975. The closing date has been postponed from December 31, 1973, to
December 31, 1975.
As a result of inflation and cost overruns, the total project cost
has increased from $225.5 million to $292.0 million. This has resulted in
additional financing being required; arrangements for this to be covered by
Yugoslav sources are under consideration.
Loan 608 Third Highway: US$30.0 million Loan of June 5, 1969;
Closing Date: August 31, 1974.
Construction works under the loan have been substantially completed,
except for the access road in Zagreb, which is expected to require several
additional months. The Closing Date of the Loan was postponed from December
31, 1972 to December 31, 1973. A second postponement to August 31, 1974, has
been agreed. In view of increases in costs, the disbursement percentage has
been reduced from the original 42 percent to 27 percent, in order to continue
disbursements until the completion of these works. Disbursements are proceed-
ing on schedule.
Loan 654 Industrial Projects - 1970: US$18.5 million Loan of January 1970;
Closing Date: July 31, 1974.
All three sub-projects under the loan are making satisfactory pro-
gress after experiencing delays of up to 18 months due to slow deliveries of
local and imported goods. The Closing Date was postponed from June 30 to
December 31, 1973, to allow payments of 10 percent retention money under
alreadv concluded contracts of Crvena Zastava and Sisak, and a second time
on December 28, 1973 by seven months to July 31, 1974, to allow disbursements
of final guarantee payments.

Loan 657  Telecommunications:   US$40.0 million Loan of February 20, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Delays in civil works have occurred which will delay completion of
the project until late 1975. With the exception of the earth satellite
station, only preliminary works have been completed. A cost overrun for
orders already placed amounting to US$5.1 million, is expected due to cur-
rency revaluations. Following a revision of the disbursement schedule, dis-
bursements are now in line with the revised projections.
Loan 678 Fourth Highway: US$40.0 million Loan of May 28, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
After an initial delay of about one year in starting work on the
Sarajevo-Zenica sections because of difficulties in acquiring the right-of-way,
work on all sections is proceeding satisfactorily. The completion of the proj-
ect, however, is likely to be delayed substantially beyond the present Closing
Date: the extent of this delay will be determined in the Spring of 1974.
Inflation and the delays in starting construction caused an increase
over the appraisal cost estimate of about 10 percent. The Federal Government
submitted a revised cost estimate of construction work in January 1973 and on
the basis of this estimate the disbursement percentage has been revised from
43 to 40 percent, effective March 1, 1973.   Disbursement is proceeding in line
with the revised projection. A supervision mission is scheduled for April 1974.
Loan 751 Fifth Highway: US$35.0-million Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: September 1, 1976.
After a delay of about eight months in fulfilling the conditions for
effectiveness of the loan, construction work is now making satisfactory prog-
ress on all sections. A 10 percent increase in the appraisal cost estimate is
expected, and the disbursement percentage will be revised when more accurate
revised cost estimates are available. Disbursement under the loan is about
one year behind the appraisal estimate. A supervision mission is scheduled
for April 1974.
Loan 752 Bernardin Tourism: US$10.0 million of Loan of June 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After the loss of more than one year owing to delays in making the
loan effective and in appointing consultants, the implementation of the proj-
ect experienced a further delay of one and a half months. As a result, dis-
bursements are behind schedule. Preliminary estimates indicate that the
project, if it were to be implemented as originally envisaged (2,500 beds)
would cost approximately US$34 million instead of US$24 million. This in-
crease is mainly due to rapid inflation, but also to realignment in exchange
rates. As only a small amount of additional financing appears to be forth-
coming, the project might have to be reduced to some 1,500 to 2,000 beds by
eliminating the most expensive structures with the lowest returns. Such
reduction will result in a less favorable economic rate of return. But it is
expected that the project would still be viable.

Loan 777  Ibar Ilultiourpose Water: US$45.0 million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1976.
The start of project work was delayed for one year. However, the
responsible agency, the Ibar-Lepenac Enterprise, is now well established and
good progress is being made in constructing the project. It should be pos-
sible to complete most of the project by the end of 1976 (i.e., one year
later than originally planned). Disbursements are proceeding in line with
the revised schedule.
Loan 782  Babin Kuk Tourism:  US$20.0 million Loan of July 21. 1971;
Closing Date: July 31, 1976.
There have been delays in the implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective and in mobilizing consultants. Because
of these, disbursements are behind schedule. Although these problems have
now been largely resolved, the project is almost two years behind schedule.
This period has been one of rapid inflation in Yugoslavia and project costs
are now estimated to have increased by 75 percent over the estimate at the
time of appraisal. Unless additional finance can be found the project will
have to be reduced in scale. This is most likely to affect the economic
rate of return adversely, but preliminary calculations indicate that a reduced
project would still be viable. The consultants are now performing fairly well
and construction of the project is due to start in the third quarter of 1974.
Loan 836 Power Transmission: US$75.0 million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
After some delays in preparing tender documents, bidding procedures
are now under way. Following the supervision mission in October, procurement
appears to be moving better. Although no disbursements have been made so far,
the Bank has agreed with proposals to award contracts, representing about 50
percent of the Loan amount.
Loan 894 Agricultural Industries (Macedonia):    US$31 million Loan of May 25, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
A supervision mission in September 1973 found that there was strong
credit demand, with most credit applications for major subprojects expected to
be received by early 1974. Stopanska Banka has already granted several sub-
loans and disbursements are expected to begin shortly on schedule. A super-
vision mission visited the project area in mid-January 1974.

bidding; those costing less than US$100,000, equivalent,
would be bought through a procedure under which the
borrower may award contracts after having received at
least four comparable bids from qualified suppliers in
at least three eligible countries. Because of the need
for the supplier to be responsible for the overall per-
formance of certain groups of equipment, only foreign
bids can be expected and, for the purpose of bid compa-
risons, it is proposed that a preference margin of 15 per-
cent 1/ be accorded to clearly identified Yugoslav compo-
nents incorporated in the foreign bids for four equipment
packages (cupola plant, sand preparation plant and the
two molding lines, estimated to cost about US$10 million,
equivalent).
