FOB IRON FOUNDRY EXPANSION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the expansion of Fabrika Odlivaka Beograd
(FOB), Belgrade, the second largest Yugoslav producer of iron castings.
Until last year, FOB operated two plants--one in New Belgrade and the
other in Rakovica, 5 km away--with a total annual capacity of 33,000 tons
of iron castings, including 28,000 tons of gray castings and 5,000 tons of
nodular castings. The Rakovica plant with a capacity of 8,000 tons per year
was separated at the end of 1973. The proposed project would increase the
annual capacity of the New Belgrade Foundry from 25,000 to about 90,000 tons
of which about 80,000 tons would be for gray iron castings and 10,000 tons
for nodular iron castings and the capacity of the pattern shop will be doubled.
The total financing required for the project, including interest during con-
struction and incremental working capital, is Din 1,071 million (equivalent
to US$69 million), of which the foreign exchange component would be about
Din 300 million (US$19.2 million) or approximately 30% of the total. The
proposed Bank loan would be US$15.0 million equivalent. Implementation of
the project has already started and is expected to be completed by the end
of 1976 with full capacity production to be attained by the end of the
following year.
ii.       During 1967-72, the Bank made three indirect loans to industry in
Yugoslavia through the Yugoslav Investment Bank, providing a total of US$45
million equivalent for the modernization and expansion of 19 industrial
projects. However, the Bank has decided recently (for reasons explained in
the Kikinda Iron Foundry Appraisal Report 218a-YU, of November 5, 1973) to
modify its lending strategy to include direct loans to Yugoslav industrial
projects of key economic importance which cannot obtain long-term loans on
reasonable terms from commercial and other sources. This approach is ex-
pected to lead to maximization of the impact of Bank lending to industry in
that country.
iii.      It is in this context that the Federal Government has asked the
Bank to help finance two iron foundries--Kikinda and FOB--which are given
high priority in the current Yugoslav Five-Year Plan (1971-75). A US$14.5
million loan to Kikinda was approved by the Bank's Executive Directors in
November, 1973. It represents the first direct industrial loan by the Bank
to Yugoslavia, and the proposed loan to FOB would be the second. The loan
of US$15 million to FOB would finance the c.i.f. foreign exchange cost of
competitively-bid equipment and spares as well as foreign consultant services
and would be for 14 years, including 4 years of grace, with an effective
interest rate of 9% per annum, including a guarantee fee of 1-3/4% to the
Republic of Serbia where the project is located. The loan would help meet
approximately 28% of the project cost, while 11% (Din 88 million) would be
financed from the Company's internal cash generation and the remaining 61%.



- ii -
(Din 493 million, including Din 7 million in foreign exchange) from outside
local sources, mostly from the Ba!grade ink; n addition, Din 258 million
(US$16.5 million) required for ilt6l-est  Zrif9 construction, including US$3.5
million in foreign exchange, would be met ftom ±iternally-generated funds.
iv.       The project is crucial fctr rhe anti.cipated expansion of priority
industries in Yugoslavia inciudita; agi~cultural machinery, commercial ve-
hicles, rail wagons and shipb,u ldiug. These industries are targeted to ex-
pand at an annual average rate of evrer 8.5% during the current Plan.  Their
rapid growth would not be poseible without the increased supply of iron cast-
ings, which would have tc be largely met from imports (at tight world market
situation for such products) but for the expansion of FOB. To meet the
strong demand for its products, FOB is presently producing significantly
above capacity with the risk of inadequate maintenance. The need for such
overcapacity production will only be overcome upon completion of the project,
when FOB will have become the largest producer of Iron castings in Yugoslavia.
v.        FOB is primarily domestico5iented.  In 1972, about 85% of its
production volume was sold locally, oL i!Aich more than four-fifths was pur-
chased within the seven-member UMI group of industries to which FOB belongs.
After the expansion, however, a substantial portion of FOB castings (28%)
would be exported and, at the same time, the share of exports to the con-
vertible currency countries is expected to rise from 5% to 22% reflecting
the Company's plans to boost sales to those countries to earn foreign ex-
change for repayment of its foreign obligations as required by Yugoslav
law.
vi.       Markets for FOB products appear well assured.  The Company is try-
ing to strengthen its export function by appointing representatives abroad
to develop direct contacts with customers instead of relying on agents as
was the case in the past. Furthermore, the Company's export plans are ex-
pected to be facilitated by the existing world shortage of iron castings
which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future because, in developed
countries, it is becoming more difficult to attract labor to work in the
foundry industry and wage costs in this relatively labor-intensive industry
are expected to pursue their upward climb. Finally, FOB is fully competi-
tive internationally. Even if international prices were to fall by 10% from
the levels assumed in the financial projections, FOB products would still be
able to compete profitably.
vii.      FOB has an efficient man-gement team headed by a capable General
Manager, who was elected in 1971 for a feur-year term by the Central Workers'
Council, the supreme management body of the enterprise. The General Manager
is supported by an Executive Board coisisting of 10 members from the Council.
In practice, the management makes all nacT decisions and has the full co-
operation of the Council.



- iisi -
viii.     The Company has a sound financial position which provides a good
base for expansion. The project, however, will require heavy borrowing which
will strain FOB's financial position during the first three years of project
implementation; the percentage of debt in the total of debt and equity would
rise sharply from 16% in 1973 to 77% in 1975, but would decline to 56% by 1978.
Since debt service coverage remains adequate throughout the forecast period
and, in the Yugoslav context, equity increases could only result from net in-
come appropriations and the Yugoslav banking system is obligated to support
enterprises during temporary stringencies, the high debt/equity ratio in 1975
and 19726 is acceptable.
ix.       T'he project has high financial and economic rates of return of
16% and 23% respectively, and even under foreseeable adverse conditions,
the probability is low that they would drop below 10%. The annual incre-
mental net foreign exchange earnings and savings to the economy once the
project's additional capacity is fully utilized in 1978 is expected to be
about US$27 million equivalent, thus offsetting in just one year more
than the entire foreign exchange cost of the project. The project would
provide direct permanent employment to over 900 persons. In addition, it
is expected to open up jobs to at least 2,000 persons in the supplier in-
dustries and the transport sector.
x.        Appraisal of the project and preparation of this report were completed
prior to the recent energy crisis.  The likely impact on the project was re-
viewed with FOB management in early January 1974 and is considered to be minimal.
The capital cost of the project is not expected to increase by so much as to
necessitate a higher provision for price escalation and, in any event, any
additional need for funds, whether caused by an increase in project cost and/
or a shortfall in internally-generated funds during project implementation,
would be covered by the Belgrade Bank. Furthermore, energy represents only
about 5% of FOB's direct operating costs and it can be assumed that any fuel-
related increase in the Company's manufacturing costs could be passed on in
the form of higher selling prices, both at home and abroad. Finally, Yugoslavia
enjoys a favorable position with respect to energy and fuel supply and prices
and it may, therefore, be expected that the foundries in other parts of Europe
against which FOB would compete will experience somewhat higher cost increases
than the Company.
xi.       Based on agreements reached during negotiations on necessary
assurances as summarized at the end of this report, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan equivalent to US$15.0 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
A.   General
1.01      This report appraises the proposed expansion project of Fabrika
Odlivaka Beograd (FOB), the second largest producer of iron castings in
Yugoslavia. The Company has been operating a 25,000-ton-per-year (TPY)
foundry and a pattern shop in New Belgrade and a 8,000 TPY plant at Rakovica,
5 km away (Maps, IBRD 10504R1, 10681), which was separated from FOB at the
end of 1973. The proposed project would increase the capacity of the New
Belgrade foundry from 25,000 to about 90,000 TPY and more than double the
capacity o. the pattern shop. Total financing required for the project,
including interest during construction and incremental working capital, is
Din 1,071 million (equivalent to US$69 million) of which Din 300 million
(US$19.2 million) would be in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of
US$15 million would cover almost the entire foreign exchange cost of equipment
and engineering.
1.02      This loan to FOB would be the second direct Bank loan to industry
in Yugoslavia. The first loan was approved by the Bank's Executive Directors
on November 20, 1973, for Livnica Zeljeza i Tempera-Kikinda, also an iron
foundry (Report No. 218a-YU, of October 19, 1973).
1.03      Following an industrial identification mission to Yugoslavia in
1971, the Federal Government in May, 1972, submitted eight industrial projects
to the Bgnk for financing, of which the expansion of FOB was one of the
projects selected and one on the Government's priority list for industrial
development. It is considered vital for the country's engineering industries,
especially those manufacturing tractors, motor vehicles and ships. Some of
the enterprises in these subsectors have already started expanding in anti-
cipation of additional castings from FOB. One notable example is the expan-
sion program of Industrija Masina i Traktora (IMT), located adjacent to FOB,
which is to increase its annual production from 15,000 tractors in 1972 to
35,000 tractors by 1976. IMT is another project for which a Bank loan is
being considered. 1/
1.04      The FOB project was appraised by a mission which visited Yugoslavia
in April/May and July/August 1973 and which consisted of Messrs. Nayar (Chief),
Glenday, Paschke and Shetty of the Industrial Projects Department and
*          Mr. Paschke (Consultant).  Foundry terms and production processes are briefly
described in Annex 1-1.
1.05      FOB meets all criteria for Bank lending.  First, the project is of
key national importance as it accounts for about half of the total Yugoslav
production of gray iron castings for engine-driven vehicles. Secondly, the
project does not require any foreign participation and, therefore, appears
unsuitable for IPC financing. Thirdly, the Company approached the Bank only
after failing to secure adequate long-term credits on reasonable terms from
other sources.

II. THE COMPANY
A.   Background
2.01      Until the end of 1973, FOB had been operating two production facilities
one in New Belgrade comprising a large-scale foundry (capacity: 25,000 TPY)
and a pattern shop; and the other in Rakovica consisting of two small and
rather obsolete gray iron foundries (capacities: 6,000 and 2,000 TPY respec-
tively).  The New Belgrade foundry was established during 1947/48 as a part
of Zavodi Masinske Industrije to produce cast iron pipes.  Three years later,
when IMT bought it, the production of castings for farm implements was added.
Later, in the early 1960's, the foundry discontinued the production of cast
iron pipes to concentrate on the manufacture of gray iron castings for farm
implements, wtor vehicles and ships.  Today the foundry produces both gray
and nodular iron castings, and its expansion has been particularly rapid during
the last five years, rising from 11,000 tons in 1968 to 25,000 tons at present.
2.02      The pattern shop in New Belgrade was started in 1948 and became
part of IMT five years later. It remained so until the end of 1970, when
together with the New Belgrade and Rakovica foundries, it was merged to form
FOB as a new member company of Udruzena Metalska Industrija (UMI), the 15th
largest industrial group in Yugoslavia formed at the end of 1969. The Rakovica
facility was separated from FOB at the end of 1973 to rejoin Industrija Motora
Rokovica (IMR) of which it was a part until the end of 1970.

- 3 -
2.04      The relation between UMI and its members is a complicated one because
of attempts to combine common interests with those of the individual enterprises.
Though UMI enterprises have a common development and marketing strategy which
sets out broad general objectives, each member company is a separate legal
entity and is independent in its detailed production and marketing programs.
All members have to contribute annually to a Joint Reserve Fund and a Joint
Development Fund established by UMI. The former is used to make interest-
free loans to member companies that incur losses and the latter to finance
research and development programs benefiting the entire group, and to advance
interest-free loans for investments of member enterprises. Moreover, UMI's
approval is necessary for annual investments exceeding Din 1 million by a
member company. During negotiations, FOB has agreed to provide evidence that
UMI has approved the project and that UNM will not request a higher increase
in FOB's annual contribution than assumed in the financial projections and
thus not adversely affect the availability of FOB's internally generated funds
to contribute to the project.
2.05      In 1972, UMI enterprises employed a total of about 20,000 persons,
equivalent to some 15% of total industrial employment in Belgrade or about
65% of the labor force in the metal-working industry of the capital city.
The total revenue of UMI companies that year was nearly Din 3.1 billion
(US$200 million), representing about 70% of total sales of the metal in-
dustry in Belgrade. The same year, FOB accounted for 13% of the total employ-
ment and 7.6% of the total sales of UMI. Over the past three years (1970-1972),
total sales of the UMI group increased by more than 70% (from Din 1.8 billion
to Din 3.1 billion), and net income during the same period rose more or less
in step, from Din 0.5 billion to Din 0.8 billion. UMI is, therefore, a rather
dynamic group of enterprises.
C.   Organizati n and Management
2.06      As a separate entity and as an autonomous part of the UIT group,
FOB is hardly three years old. It is operated under the workers' self-
management system of Yugoslavia explained in Annex 2-1 which also contains
an organization chart of the enterprise. The supreme management body of
the Company is the Workers' Council which currently consists of 30 members
elected by FOB workers for a period of two years. The Council formulates
the enterprise's general policy and investment and production programs within
the overall plans developed by UMI for the group as a whole. The Council's
approval is necessary on plant expansions, annual budgets and appropriations
of net income, and it elects the General Manager as the Company's chief
executive officer.
2.07      The present General Manager, Mr. Milan Rodic, 41, was elected along
with most key officials to the Company in June 1971, soon after the es-
tablishment of FOB as a separate unit; his term is for four years but he is
eligible for a second term. Mr. Rodic is capable and has had more than 20
years of experience with FOB and related organizations in various key posts



-4-
prior to his present position. He is assisted by an Executive Board which
consists of 10 members elected by the Workers' Council plus the General
Manager. The Board's main function is to propose measures to improve busi-
ness policy, appoint committees for the selection of key personnel, and in-
quire into specific issues. The General Manager is independent of the Board
in his functions and is responsible only to the Workers' Council.
2.08      The General Manager is supported by adequate administrative and
technical staff. This team which was developed during the short span of
three years of the Company's independent existence, is generally good but,
in view of the further rapid expansion now envisaged, needs strengthening
in certain areas, especially finance and accounting. Specific measures to
overcome these shortcomings are discussed in para. 7.14. On the whole, the
present arrangements are considered satisfactory. According to Yugoslav
law, no company can merge or consolidate without protecting the right of
third parties such as its lenders.
D.   Plant Facilities
2.09      The Company's existing facilities are described in detail in Annex
2-2. They consist of the normal production units such as pattern-making,
sand preparation, core-making, melting and molding as well as auxiliary
services. There are production bottlenecks in both locations. Problems fac-
ing the New Belgrade foundry are lack of in-plant space, limited cleaning
room capacity, and obsolete equipment, especially in the pattern shop. The
production at one of the Rakovica foundries, established about 27 years ago,
is hampered because of obsolete manually-operated equipment. Though the other
Rakovica foundry, 12 years old, is operating well, its general lay-out is
unsatisfactory resulting in deficient material handling. As mentioned
earlier, both these foundries were separated from FOB at the end of 1973.
They are expected to be closed by 1976 as the Rakovica city development
program envisages their removal from the present location. During negotiations,
agreement has been reached with the Company that it will not sell, lease, trans-
fer or dispose of its rights or assets without the prior consent of the Bank.
E.   Past Growth and Financial Results
2.10      The following table shows the trend of sales and net income of FOB
since 1971, the enterprise's first year of operation as a composite, separate
unit:

2.11      During 1971-72, the Company's sales revenue increased by about 37%,
while physical sales rose by only 12.5%.  This faster growth in sales pro-
ceeds has been mainly due to a rapid inflationary increase in casting prices.
During the same period, net income as a percentage of sales rose significant-
ly from 9.6% to 10.7%. FOB's performance in the first 9 months of 1973 is
generally in line with the 1973 projections. The Company's exports to the
convertible currency area increased more than threefold in 1972 though from
a rather low base in 1971. But exports to this area are still small, accoun-
ting for hardly 5.0% of total sales compared with 12% to clearing currency
countries. The Company plans to step up its exports to convertible currency
countries in the future through more intensive export promotion (para. 3.11
and 3.13).
2.12      FOB has been concentrating on the production of gray castings which
in 1972 accounted for about 87% of its total casting output in volume. It is
the largest producer of gray iron castings for engines and engine-driven
vehicles in Yugoslavia, meeting at present about 50% of the country's needs.
2.13      In 1972, over 70% of FOB's castings in volume were sold internally
to the UMI group, of which the most important customer was IMT accounting for
about 28% of total sales of castings to UMNI. FOB prices to UMI menbers are
comparable to those charged to outside domestic customers.

F.   Recent Financial Position
2.14      Historical balance sheets (1971 and 1972) are given in Annex 7-1
and the balance sheet as of December 31, 1972 is summarized below:
FOB Balance Sheet, as of December 31, 1972

/1   Equity includes the Business Fund, Collective Consumption Fund, Reserve
Fund, and Mutual Reserve Fund which are explained in Annex 7-4, pages
2-3.
2.15      The above table shows that at the end of 1972 the Company had a satis-
factory current ratio of approximately 2.5:1 add a low debt/equity ratio of
17:83. These ratios reflect FOB's sound financial position which provides
a viable base for the proposed expansion. However, the present book value
of net fixed assets is still low in spite of the 53% revaluation in 1971.
III. THE MARKET
A.   Suply and Demand of Castings
3.01      A detailed analysis of the market for foundry products (castings)
is provided in Annex 3-1.
3.02      There are some 250 foundries in Yugoslavia, of which about 12
account for some 50% of total output, thus showing the concentration of pro-
duction in a few large enterprises. In 1972, total production of castings,
including steel and non-ferrous castings which make up some 18% of the total,
was about 453,000 tons; total iron casting output - i.e., FOB's line of
production - was about 373,000 tons, of which 92% consisted of gray castings,
5% of malleable castings and 3% of nodular castings. Taking into account the
present expansion plans of various Yugoslav foundries, including those of FOB
and Kikinda, it is expected that the output of iron castings in the country
will increase to about 627,000 tons in 1978, or by an average annual rate of
9%.

3.03      The following table summarizes past and projected demand and supply
of iron castings in Yugoslavia through 1978, the year in which full production
is expected to be reached:
Yugoslavia-Demand/Supply Comparisons for Iron Castings
('000 tons)
Average Annual
1968   1972      1973   1978     Growth Rate (%)
--actual---      -forecast--    1968-72  1972-78
Production                 260.0  373.0    418.0  627.0          9.5      9
Imports                      4.0   14.0       15.0   28.0       37       12
Total Supply             264.0  387.0    433.0  655.0         10        9
Domestic Consumption       212.7  321.0    375.0  691.0         11       13.5
Exports                     51.3   66.0       72.5  108.5        6.5      8.5
Surplus (deficit)          0.0    0.0    (14.5)(144.5)
3.04      Domestic consumption of iron castings increased at an annual rate
of 11% during 1968-72, reaching 321,000 tons in 1972. Considering the plans
for accelerated industrial development in Yugoslavia and based on an industry
by industry assessment of their needs for castings, consumption in the future
is likely to grow at 13.5% per year, reaching 691,000 tons in 1978. The main
consumers of castings are producers of agricultural machinery, motor vehicles,
machine tools, electrical and non-electrical equipment, consumer durables,
and rail wagons, as well as the construction and shipbuilding industries.
3.05      Yugoslavia is a net exporter of iron castings.  Important export
markets have been the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania and the U.S.S.R. In 1972, exports reached
66,000 tons (about 18% of production) of which about 65% and 35% respectively
went to convertible and clearing currency countries.  Imports, on the other
hand, amounted to only 14,000 tons and consisted mainly of items which are not
produced in Yugoslavia. In the future, exports to convertible as well as
clearing currency countries are expected to grow at an annual rate of 8.5%,
while imports are projected to increase by 12% a year from the present low
base.
3.06      Based on these projections as shown in the above table, Yugoslavia
in 1978 is expected to have a shortage of some 36,000 tons of iron castings
to meet internal demand alone, or a gap of about 144,500 tons when the export
demand is taken into account. Some further expansion of capacity beyond
that already contemplated would, therefore, appear necessary if Yugoslavia
were to meet the expected domestic and export demand. Furthermore, the ex-
port potential might well be greater than assumed here. As pointed out in
the Kikinda Iron Foundry Project Appraisal Report (No. 218-YU), the existing
shortage of castings in the world is expected to continue at least in the
foreseeable future.



B.   FOB's Market Position and Sales Forecasts
3.07      FOB is one of Yugoslavia's largest producers of gray and nodular
iron castings. As a result of the project, the Company will significantly
increase its production of gray iron castings, advancing its market share
from 8% in 1972 to 14% in 1978, while maintaining its market share of about
one-third in nodular castings, as shown in the following table:
Production, Demand and FOB's Share by Type of Castings
('000 tons)
Country's   Domestic                FOB's         % Share

(Actual)------Forecast------   (Actual) (Forecast)
Gray                341.6 566.5   622.0   (55.5)    28.1    80.0        8    14
Nodular              11.0  30.0    34.5    (4.5)      4.2    10.0      38    33
Malleable            20.3  30.5    34.5    (4.0)        -       -       -      -
Total Castings   372.9 627.0   691.0   (64.0)    32.3    90.0
3.08      The table indicates that for each of the different types of castings
produced by FOB (as was the case for all the country's castings combined,
para. 3.06), domestic production is not expected to fill domestic demand in
1978; as a result, imports will have to continue, even if there were no exports
of castings from Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, largely to meet its foreign debt
repayment obligations, FOB plans to increase its foreign exchange earnings
by exporting about 35% of its incremental output of castings, with total
exports expected to increase from about 5,000 tons (15% of total sales in 1972)
to 25,000 tons (nearly 28% of total sales in 1978) of which some 20,000 tons
would be to convertible currency countries. Such a goal is considered
reasonable.
3.09      Also, while the Company's production in 1978 of gray and nodular
castings is anticipated to rise to about 14% of the country's total output
of these castings (compared to about 8% in 1972), due to its increased pro-
nortion for export, FOB's share in the domestic market for these products is
expected to increase only from about 9% in 1972 to 10% in 1978. As will be
described further below, the Company has long-term sales contracts with its
major domestic customers, and it is also seeking similar contracts for its
export sales as is usual in this type of industry.

C.   Sales Build-up and Destination of Sales
3.10      A year-by-year sales breakdown through 1983 is provided in Annexes
3-2 and 6-1, by product, volume and value. Below the sales volume together
with destination of sales are summarized for 1972 (actual) and for 1978:
Sales Build-up by Product and Area of Destination

/1    = Domestic; CO = Convertible currency countries;  CL = Clearing
currency countries; and T = Total.
3.11      As already noted, FOB sells most of its castings at home through
long-term contracts, in particular to the UMI members, IMT and IMR, and to
FAP-FAMOS, a Producer of trucks.  These three customers alone will account
for about 50% of the Company's total casting sales in 1978. FOB also has
export agreements with Ford and Opel of Germany for 1974.1/ and 1975, and they
are expected to be renewed. Furthermore, it has a long-term cooperation
agreement with Hungary for the supply of castings. Overall, on the basis
of projections of sales contraets already agreed for 1975, about 75,000 tons
or about 83% of the expanded production is expected to be covered by contracts.
The Company is negotiating with other foreign as well as local firms for
additional supply contracts and, on the basis of preliminary inquiries,
indications are that demand for FOB's castings will be in excess of what it
could supply in 1978.
3.12      FOB and the other major foundry in Yugoslavia, Kikinda, signed
an agreement in 1971, in which they reached a basic understanding on the
demarcation of their respective production. While Kikinda makes gray cast-
ings only for its own machine tool production, FOB manufactures them as its
major product line and in great variety. Kikinda, in turn, concentrates on
the production of nodular and malleable castings which for FOB are of lower
or no significance. Finally, FOB's nodular castings are sold primarily
within the UMI group of industries.
1/   Major auto producers in Western countries have cut back-production because
of the present energy shortage. As a result, the export of castings to
them by FOB may fall short of the projected level. However, even if auto
production does not come back to normal, little difficulty is foreseen in
diverting sales to other industries due to the continuing worldwide short-
age of castings.

D.   Marketing Organization
3.13      FOB has a new marketing organization which is supported by the
marketing research services of UMI's central staff.  Sales contracts within
the UMI group or outside are negotiated and entered into directly by FOB.
In the domestic market, castings are sold directly to customers. As to
export sales, FOB relied in the past on agents, but is now giving increased
attention to direct sales to foreign customers as well. Its commercial depart-
mtent has strengthened its direct contacts abroad to help promote export sales.
E.   Prices and Competitive Position
3.14      An international comparison of prices of castings is difficult
because of variations of castings in size, quality and intricacy. FOB's
prices for castings are internationally competitive on average; indeed, for
some particular items, there is a clear advantage. Approximate average 1973
domestic, ex-plant, price indices for selected items of FOB are compared
with those of German, Italian and French producers, also ex-plant, in the
following table (details are given in Annex 3-1):
Average 1973 Domestic Price Indices (Ex-Plant) /1
(FOB Price - 100)
Selected Castings                    FOB   German   French    Italian
Gray Casting  (f]ywheel)             100    117       126          _

Nodular Casting (transmission case) 100    123         _          108
/1   First quarter 1973.
3.15      FOB's sales prices vary among domestic, clearing and convertible
area markets (Annex 6-1). Prices for the clearing currency countries are
fixed according to agreements; they bear little relation to market conditions
in those countries, and are expected to remain higher than domestic prices.
In the case of gray iron castings, an established product line, FOB's average
domestic prices and export prices are approximately on the same level. In
the case of nodular castings, a new product line for which the domestic demand
is increasing sharply, the Company's export prices for the convertible area
are lower than its domestic prices for comparable products. This is partly
because of keen competition with foreign suppliers in establishing new mar-
kets. Domestic prices for castings are in general free of price controls,
except for temporary controls for reasons of containing inflation.



- 1 1 -
F.   Export Incentives
3.16      The Federal Government provides export incentives, the most im-
portant of which is the retention quota under which the exporting company is
allowed to retain 20% of its foreign exchange earnings for unrestricted use.
G.   Protection
3.17      As already noted, FOB's products are internationally competitive.
However, nominal protection through customs duties and taxes exists to the
extent of 25% for iron castings. This duty shelter is of interest to FOB
only as far as it helps prevent the sale of foreign products in Yugoslavia
at marginal cost.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives and Scope
4.01      The project is designed both to modernize and increase the produc-
tion of the New Belgrade foundry and pattern shop. The capacity of the foundry
will be increased from 25,000 to 90,000 TPY with that of gray iron castings
rising from 20,000 to 80,000 TPY and of nodular iron castings from 5,000 to
10,000 TPY; and the capacity of the pattern shop will be doubled.
4.02      The major facilities to be installed and alterations to the exist-
ing facilities to be made under the project comprise extension of the exist-
ing foundry building and pattern shop, two 20 tons/hr hot-blast cupolas, re-
vamping of the existing melting plant, three new molding lines including a
flaskless molding line, alterations to one of the existing molding lines, a
new sand preparation plant, a new core room, a new cleaning room, two 44-48
tons/day annealing furnaces, a new centralized storage and material handling
system, additional machines and some rearrangement of the existing machines
in the pattern shop, a new transformer station, a new gas vaporizing station,
a new air-compressor station, pollution control devices, and modifications
to the present infrastructure. A detailed description of the project is given
in Annex 4-1 and the plant layout is shown in Annex 4-2.
B.   Observations
4.03      The project is well-conceived.  The main objective of the Company
is to increase and consolidate its production of castings as well as patterns.
The proposed facilities and plant designs are primarily aimed at overcoming
problems encountered in the existing operations and also to improve quality
and productivity. The Company plans to limit its product lines by concentrating
on large and intricate castings, which otherwise would not be produced in
Yugoslavia, leaving simple castings to less sophisticated foundries in the
country. The Dlant design also provides flexibility to meet the changing
needs of customers and there is room for further expansion.



- 12 -
4.04      The project can be implemented without significantly interfering
with present Production. FOB will be able to produce heavier castings with
the addition of more sophisticated and specialized machines. The proposed
cleaning room facilities envisaged in the project will eliminate the current
operational bottlenecks and will improve product quality. By modifying the
present layout and material flow, replacing old and obsolete equipment, and
installing more accurate and productive machines, the capacity of the pattern
shop will be increased and its operations improved.
4.05      In order to extend FOB's existing foundry building, IMT's adjacent
implement assembly plant will have to be relocated. Therefore, during nego-
tiations, it was agreed that the Company will provide evidence that it has
obtained a commitment from IMT that this plant will be relocated by the end
of 1974 in line with a specific time schedule. Plans for changes and additions
to infrastructure installations - power, hot water for central heating, sewage
and road construction - have been prepared by the Company in conjunction with
IMT and are considered satisfactory. During negotiations, FOB has provided
evidence that it has obtained commitments from the respective authorities
for the timely development of these infrastructure facilities.
C.   Ecology
4.06      Due to FOB's proximity to the residential area of New Belgrade,
pollution abatement of this foundry is of utmost importance. Being aware
of the importance of pollution control, the Company has considered alterna-
tive locations before deciding to remain in its present location and expand.
The Company's decision in this regard is justified considering economic
implications and practical difficulties of moving the plant (Annex 4-3).
The present pollution control system is not satisfactory. The project, there-
fore, includes modern dust and fume collection systems for the existing and
expanded facilities to be reviewed in detail by the consultants hired by FOB
(para. 4.10). These systems are capable of meeting even more stringent
standards - comparable to West European requirements - than those set by a
recently passed Federal law for environmental and pollution control. The
law stipulates that all enterprises conform to certain minimum requirements
by the end of 1973 and to all the set standards by 1977. Under the project,
Din 30 million, equivalent to about 14% of the cost of the foundry equipment,
is allocated for pollution control, and this is considered sufficient. In
view of the particular importance of environmental considerations, it was
agreed during negotiations that the Company will strictly adhere to the
proposed plans and properly maintain such pollution control facilities to
the satisfaction of the Bank.



- 13 -
D.   Labor Force
4.07      At the end of 1973, there were 2,222 employees at the New Belgrade
foundry, including 170 temporary employees. Labor productivity continues to
be low and the Company requires about 90 manhours per ton of castings compared
with about 30 manhours in similar foundries in Western Europe. However, fol-
lowing consolidation of operations, modernization and expansion of the exist-
ing facilities, as provided for in the project, FOB productivity is expected
to rise sharply and the number of manhours per ton of castings produced is
expected to decline to about 45 by 1978, requiring at that time a total labor
force of nearly 3,000. This seems realistic. Details are given in Annex 4-4.
4.08      Although two-shift operation is common in the foundry business, as
this allows adequate time for maintenance, FOB is today operating on a three-
shift basis using temporary labor to meet the surge in demand for its cast-
ings. However, by the end of 1976, when the expansion work is scheduled
to be completed, the Company will have overcome the need to operate three
shifts. In addition to 170 temporary labor currently with FOB who will be
hired on a permanent basis, 744 new employees will be recruited from outside.
Thus, the total number of permanent jobs created directly by the project will
be 914.
E.   Project Execution
4.09      The main task of project execution will be carried out by the FOB
Development Division headed by Mr. Dragoslav Perovich, 37, a skilled foundry
planning expert with specialized training in PERT and other advanced manage-
ment tools. He has had more than 13 years of experience in important tech-
nical positions with FOB and related organizations. Mr. Perovich is assisted
by another foundry expert, Mr. Ranko Sotra, 46, who also serves as Adviser to
the General Manager. Although their caliber is high, the Development Divi-
sion's work is likely to be adversely affected by inadequate budget and
project control due to lack of qualified staff. Therefore, during negotia-
tions, it was agreed that the Company will strengthen its budget and project
control functions with well-trained and experienced personnel, and with the
help of outside consultants.
4.10      FOB will also require the assistance of a foreign consulting firm
to prepare specifications for international competitive bidding and to evaluate
tenders. The Company has appointed W.S. Atkins & Partners of the U.K. for
this purpose.  During negotiations, the Company has agreed to retain this
firm.
4.11      Civil construction and equipment erection for the project will be
undertaken by Yugoslav contractors, while FOB's own construction department
will be responsible for similar work in connection with modifications of the
existing facilities. Equipment suppliers will assist in erection and start-up
and also provide a performance guarantee for the equipment. These arrangements
are considered satisfactory, and follow FOB's previous practices.

F.   Project Timing
4.12      The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4-5.  En-
gineering and design work on the project is well advanced and prequalification
of suppliers as well as preparation of procurement documents have been com-
pleted with the assistance of the technical consultant (para. 4.10). It is
expected that orders for foreign equipment to be financed by the Bank will be
placed during the first quarter of 1974 and that the project will be mechani-
cally completed by the end of 1976 and reach full production capacity by the
end of the following year. The delivery and erection schedules based on
information provided by potential equipment suppliers are considered realistic.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN

will be charged to operations, in accordance with Yugoslav law.



- 15 -
5.02      Equipment and civil construction cost estimates are based on quota-
tions received by FOB in the first quarter of 1973. The prevailing import
duty and taxes on the c.i.f. value of imported equipment at the Yugoslav
border have been added. Considering the advanced stage of project prepara-
tion, physical contingencies of only 10% on the equipment and construction
costs of the project (i.e. exclusive of import duty and taxes) are included
and they seem adequate.  Pre-operating and start-up expenses as well as costs
of engineering services are based on FOB's previous experience.
5.03      In addition to the physical contingency, an allowance for price
escalation of 6% per annum has been applied to the cost of foreign equipment
as well as duty and taxes on them. In the case of domestic costs, the fol-
lowing rates on the cost of local equipment, construction and erection have
been applied to cover anticipated inflation in Yugoslavia: 1973, 10%; 1974,
8%; and 6% thereafter. The sliding rates are based on the assumption that
the measures being taken in Yugoslavia to curb inflation will succeed. Total
physical and price contingencies allowed for amount to about 16% of the total
project cost, which appear adequate to cover even the possible increases in
capital cost because of the recent spurt in fuel costs. The project cost
estimates, including these contingencies, are considered reasonable.
5.04      Of the total Din 1,071 million financing required for the project,
foreign exchange expenditures, including Din 57 million for interest during
construction, are estimated at Din 300 million or about 28% of total cost.
With the exception of the cost of the flaskless molding line, all other foreign
exchange cost (c.i.£. Yugoslav border) of equipment and spares and foreign
engineering services will be financed by the Bank. Since all equipment that
can be procured locally has been allocated to local currency expenditures,
Yugoslav manufactures are not expected to bid directly for Bank-financed
equipment. However, Yugoslav components in foreign bids are expected to be
about 15% of total foreign equipment cost (para. 5.10).
B.   Working Capital
5.05      The Company's 1972 working capital level, although low in cash,
was satisfactory. Its measures since then to reduce receivables and inven-
tories are proving successful.  During 1973-1978, incremental working capital
requirements due to the project are estimated at Din 118 million, of which
about Din 60 million (about 50% of the total) would have to be borrowed and
the rest met from internal cash generation.  Details of the Company's working
capital needs are given in Annex 5-2.
C.   Financing Plan
5.06      As noted previously, total financing required for the project is
Din 1,071 million (US$69 million equivalent) including Din 300 million (US$19.2
million) in foreign exchange. Internal cash generation will provide about
Din 345 million (32% of the total) and credits from the Belgrade Bank, Din 463
million (43%) and an IMT loan, Din 30 million (3%). The proposed Bank loan
would cover the remaining 22% of the financing requirements.



- 16 -
5.07      About 97% of the costs of foreign machinery and equipment plus the
entire cost of foreign engineering for the project would be financed from the
Bank loan of US$15.0 million (Din 232.5 million equivalent). The rest of the
foreign exchange cost of Din 67 million (US$4.2 million) would be met from the
Company's own foreign exchange sources (from its 20% retention quota on exports
to the convertible area, and 10% of depreciation which could be converted to
hard currency at the National Bank, supplemented by a foreign exchange loan
of Din 7.7 million equivalent from the Belgrade Bank). A simmary of sources
and applications of funds (Annex 7-2) during 1974-1978 follows:
Summarized Sources and Applications of Funds

i3   Fixed asset costs.  Excludes Din 4.0 million spent in 1973.
74   Surplus cash will be earmarked for future expansion.
5.08      The Bank loan would be for 14 years, including a grace period of
4 years, at an assumed interest rate of 7-1/4% plus a guarantee fee of 1-3/4%
payable to the Republic of Serbia, 1/ thus bringing the cost to the borrower
to 9%. The total credit required for the project from outside sources other
than the Bank - including the Belgrade Bank and IMT - is, as already noted,
about Din 493 million. Loans from the Belgrade Bank will be at 11% interest
annually for 14 years including 4-year grace and the IMT loan will be for
12 years, including 5-year grace, at an interest rate of 5-1/2% per annum.
Further details are given in Annex 5-3. During negotiations, assurances to
this effect have been received.
1/   The Federal Government is the guarantor of the Bank loan.  It, in turn,
is required by Yugoslav law to obtain a guarantee from the Republic or
Autonomous Province where the project is located--in this case, the
Republic of Serbia. Since Yugoslav law prevents the Federal Government
from accepting the guarantee fee, the Government would request the Repub-
lic of Serbia to receive the fee.



- 17 -
5.09      During project implementation (1974-77), FOB's internal cash genera-
tion, together with the proposed borrowings from the Bank, the Belgrade Bank
and IMT would be adequate to meet the financial needs of the project.  What-
ever additional resources, foreign as well as local, that might be needed to
complete the project and to bring it into full operation after start-up,
irrespective of whether the need for such additional funds is caused by a
cost overrun or a shortfall in cash generation, would be provided by the
Belgrade Bank on terms satisfactory to the Bank. Assurances to this effect
have been provided during negotiations.
D.   Procurement and Disbursement
5.10      Procurement of items to be financed from the Bank loan will be
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. A detailed list of these items
is given in Annex 5-4. They will be purchased under 17 contracts, 15 for
foundry and 2 for the pattern shop. Equipment packages costing over US$100,000
equivalent each would be procured by international competitive bidding, while
packages costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each (totalling less than 3%
of the total foreign equipment costs) would be obtained through a procedure
under which the borrower may award contracts after having received at least
four comparable bids from qualified suppliers in at least three eligible
countries. Because of the need for the supplier to be responsible for the
overall performance of certain groups of equipment, only foreign bids can be
expected and, for the purpose of bid comparisons, it is proposed that a
preference margin of 15% 1/ would be accorded to clearly identified Yugoslav
components incorporated in the foreign bids for 4 equipment packages (the
cupola plant, sand preparation plant and the two molding lines) which are
expected to cost about US$10 million (Annex 5-5). For the remaining 13 Bank-
financed equipment packages no margin of preference will be accorded for
Yugoslav components in foreign bids.
5.11      In the selection of the foreign engineering consultant (para. 4.10),
the Company has followed the Bank guidelines. As early appointment of this
consultant is crucial for meeting the project implementation schedule (para.
4.12), FOB has already appointed a consulting firm (para. 4.10).  The payments
to this firm, before the loan is considered by the Executive Directors, are
likely to total about US$150,000. It is recommended that the Bank reimburse
the Company this amount.
5.12      For the flaskless molding line, imported but not Bank financed, FOB
placed the order in October 1973, following normal Yugoslav regulations. As
to domestic equipment, quotations have already been received from various
Yugoslav suppliers in the majority of cases. However, FOB will place orders
for these items only after the consultant already appointed has had an oppor-
tunity to review the foreign equipment packages, which might necessitate some
changes. However, since these items are standard equipment for which delivery
times are relatively short, this procedure will not delay project implementation.
The Company plans to award civil construction contracts in the very near future
1/   Duties on equivalent components are more than 15%.



- 18 -
to two of the four Yugoslav contractors who have already submitted their bids
in accordance with Yugoslav law which requires competitive bidding for such
contracts. Finally, FOB also plans to contract out erection work to Yugoslav
contractors as mentioned previously. Both civil construction and erection
work will be carried out under the direction of FOB.
5.13      The Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost (c.i.f.
Yugoslav border or port of entry) of equipment and spares as well as the
ex-factory cost of locally-manufactured items in foreign bids, and 100% of the
foreign exchange cost of consultant services. The estimated disbursement
schedule for the Bank loan is shown in Annex 5-6, which is based on detailed
estimates of order placements, payment schedules and expected delivery times
for equipment in line with the project implementation schedule (para. 4.12).
VI.  REVENUES, RAW MATERIALS, AND PRODUCTION COST
A.   Sales Revenue
6.01      Sales revenue has been calculated in current value terms and it
excludes freight and handling charges. Details of selling price assumptions
for gray and nodular castings - the Company's main product lines - and expected
sales revenue assuming 75% capacity utilization on a three-shift operation
during 1973-1976 and on a two-shift operation for subsequent years, are given
in Annex 6-1 and Annex 3-2. This seemingly low utilization of capacity is
realistic as it is not only in line with FOB's past performance, but also only
somewhat below that of comparable foundries in other countries. As a result
of the expansion, FOB's sales revenue is forecast to increase by nearly 300%
(see table below), from Din 234 million (US$15.1 million) in 1972 to Din 934
million (US$60.3 million) in 1978, when the project would reach full produc-
tion i.e. 75% of nominal capacity.

- 19 -
6.02      Of the incremental total revenue of about Din 700 million (US$37.8
million) resulting from the project, nearly Din 165 million (US$10.6 million)
representing 24% of the total, will accrue from exports to the convertible
area, and Din 44 million (about 6%) from exports to the clearing area.
B.   Raw Materials
6.03      FOB seems to be well assured of the supply of its major raw materials
such as pig iron, steel scrap, ferroalloys, graphite, coke, anthracite, bento-
nite, sand, synthetic resins and refractories for which the Company's import
requirements are expected to be low, except for minor items such as graphite,
resins and ferromanganese (Annex 6-2). No problem is foreseen in meeting its
import needs because of import liberalization and the availability inforeign ex-
change of 20% of FOB's annual export earnings from the convertible area as
retention quota which can be used freely under Yugoslav law. Furthermore,
the supply of gas, water and power also appears assured. The annual electric
power needs of the Company are expected to rise sharply from about 16 million
KWH to 64.5 million KWH during 1973-78. There is a general agreement between
FOB and' Electro-Distribucija, Belgrade, for adequate power supply to the
project. However, during negotiations, evidence has been provided by the
Company that it has in fact obtained commitments for timely and adequate
supply of electric power.
C.   Production Costs
6.04      Production cost estimates (Annex 6-3), like those of sales, are based
on the assumption of 75% capacity utilization on a three-shift basis during
1973-76 and on a two-shift basis for subsequent years. Present (1972) and
projected (1978) production costs at constant (1972) as well as current prices
are given below:

passed on to the customer by way of selling price increases.



- 20 -
6.05      As a result of the project, the direct production cost (at 1972
constant prices) at the New Belgrade foundry for gray castings is expected
to decline by 9% and for nodular castings by 16% during 1972-1978. However,
at current prices, as used in the financial projections, the cost would show
an increase of 28% for gray castings and 22% for nodular castings (Annex 6-3).
The slower percentage rise with respect to the latter is mainly due to the
fact that the direct production cost per unit of nodular castings, a new
product line, is currently 55% higher than that of gray castings and that
with better experience of FOB in such production, it is expected to come down
in real terms more substantially than for gray castings.
6.06      For current price projections of direct production costs, it has
been assumed that during the forecast period (1973-1983), FOB's labor costs
would increase annually by about 12% (compared to the expected rate of 5% a
year in Kikinda) while raw material costs would rise at the annual rate of
about 6% (slightly more than the rate assumed for Kikinda mainly because of
the higher rates of increase of utility costs in New Belgrade). However, be-
cause of factors already mentioned (para. 6.05), the aggregate production cost
at current prices would rise at a slower pace of 3.5% compared to the annual
average general Yugoslav inflation Trate of over 6% expected during the same
period.
6.07      Data presented in the above table shows that the average direct
cost per ton of nodular and gray castings is significantly lower in FOB
than in Kikinda because gray castings, which are less expensive to produce,
represent about 90% of FOB's total production while Kikinda produces such
castings only in minor quantities (10% of total production). Furthermore,
FOB concentrates on the manufacture of large castings, while Kikinda
specializes in small but complex castings of higher value per unit of weight.
As the average yield in a foundry increases more with the size than it
decreases with the complexity of castings, the yield is higher in FOB than
in Kikinda. This factor is largely responsible for the lower direct produc-
tion cost per unit of casting weight in FOB.
6.08      However, one of the major problems facing FOB is the high outside
rejection rate of about 7% on its exports to the convertible area compared
with about 2% for Kikinda. The main reason for this is lack of proper quality
control resulting from over-capacity production and inadequate direct contact
with foreign customers. Therefore, during negotiations, the Company has
agreed to take necessary steps to improve its quality control functions.

VII. FUTURE PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION
A.   Profitability
7.01      Details of income statements and sources and application of funds
forecasts through 1983 are shown in Annex 7-1 and 7-2 respectively and sum-
marized below:

/1   Annual depreciation and net appropriation to the Business Fund.
/2   The drop is due to the separation of Rakovica plant.
7.02      In 1973, net income was projected to jump by about 34% over the pre-
ceding year level primarily because of a 39% increase in physical sales of
castings from 32,300 to 44,500 tons made possible by the introduction of an
additional (third) working shift that year. In 1974, in spite of the separa-
tion of Rakovica facility from FOB, net sales would virtually remain on the
1973 level because of the coming on stream of the Disamatic molding line in-
cluded in the project. Though during the project implementation period both
sales and operating income are expected to increase steadily with the com-
missioning of various equipment under the project, net income is staggered
during this period because of the charging to operations of interest during
construction on new borrowings as required by Yugoslav law. The net income
position begins to improve markedly in 1976 with the commissioning of most
equipment under the project and is expected to reach a peak of Din 115 mill-on
in 1978 - the first year of capacity production - reflecting nearly a five-
fold increase compared to the 1972 level. However, net income begins to de-
cline from 1978 onwards because of the higher inflation rate assumed for
operating costs than for selling prices. But the general level of profitability
would continue to be at a high level, reflecting the sound operation of the
Company.

Consumption Fund.

7.04      FOB's cash position was tight in the past, although the current
ratio in 1972 was at a satisfactory level of 2.5:1 because of low payables.
The Company's current ratio is projected to decline gradually from the cur-
rent high level of 2.5:1 to 1.4:1 in 1977, one year prior to full production,
because of the peaking of the short-term portion of long-term debt in that
year. However, the current ratio is expected to improve steadily thereafter.
In order to maintain a satisfactory liquidity position, agreements have been
reached during negotiations that the company will maintain at all times a
current ratio of at least 1.3:1 and that this obligation will appropriately
be backed up by the Belgrade Bank.
7.05      Because of heavy borrowing (to meet about 70X of total financing
required for the project), the long-term debt equity ratio is expected to
rise continuously up to 1975 from the 1973 low level of 16:84, reaching a
peak of 77:23 in 1975 and subsequently improving to 56:44 in 1978, restoring
the Company to a sound financial position. The strained financial position
during the first three-years of project implementation is acceptable in this
context because - as shown further below - the debt service coverage remains
adequate throughout the forecast period. Also, according to Yugoslav law,
equity increases could result only from appropriations from net income and
these are already foreseen as part of the financing plan. The alternative
would have been to reduce the scope of the project and thus reduce the need
for borrowings, but this does not appear to be a justifiable course, in view
of the short period during which the strained financial position is likely
to exist and the available financial backing of the Belgrade Bank to which
that bank is committed by law (Annex 7-4).



- 23 -
7.06      The allocation to the equity-like Business fund - the only internal
source available for the build-up of equity except depreciation - would, how-
ever, be affected if the Workers' Council were to decide to appropriate
excessive amounts to the Collective Consumption Fund or to distribute higher
wages and salaries than projected. Therefore, during negotiations, agree-
ments have been reached that the Company will not, during project implementa-
tion, without prior consent of the Bank: (a) distribute income to its employ-
ees, make allocation to Collective Consumption Fund and/or make other cash
outlays except to the extent that the Funds available to the Company exceed
the required expenditures for the project implementation and (b) undertake
capital investments or incur new debts in excess of Din 20 million equivalent
in any one year for other than the project. Prior to embarking on any new
investment or borrowing exceeding Din 75 million in any one year, the Company
has agreed to seek the approval of the Bank during first three years after
project completion and to consult the Bank thereafter. For comparison purposes,
the income statement and balance sheet projections, without the proposed ex-
pansion, are given in Annex 7-5 and 7-6 respectively.
C.   Financial Rate of Return
7.07      The project provides an incremental financial rate of return of
16.2% in real value terms. 1/ The assumptions used in this calculation
are contained in Annex 7-7.
7.08      To determine the effect of various events on the financial rate of
return, sensitivity tests have been made (Annex 7-7) and they show the fol-
lowing results:
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return
Case                      Description                         Rate of Return (%)
1   Base Case                                                       16.2
2   Sales revenue decrease 5%                                       11.2
3   Operating cost increase 10%                                     12.3
4   One year project delay plus 10%7 cost overrun                    9.7
5   Sales revenue decrease 5% and operating cost increase 10%    8.9
6   Operating cost increase 10% and project cost increase 110%   6.4
7.09      The project has a low financial risk since it provides an adequate
rate of return even under the foreseeable adverse conditions as assumed in
the above table.  If the revenue drops by 15% - which is equivalent to about
50% drop in the assumed exports to the clearing currency area or a 25% de-
cline in exports to the convertible currency area without any change in domes-
tic sales - without a corresponding reduction in operating costs, the return
would decrease to 11.2%. The investment is not capital intensive because the
return tends to be more sensitive to changes in operating costs than capital
1/   At current value terms, the financial rate of return is about 20%.



- 24 -
costs (Annex 7-7). If raw material costs were to increase by 15% or labor
cost by 30% - equivalent to about 10% increase in operating costs - the return
would drop to 12.3%. It is unlikely that, in real terms, the cost of produc-
tion would increase without corresponding increase in selling prices. One
year project delay plus 10% cost overrun would drop the return to about 10%.
However, in view of the advanced preparation of the project, the chances of
this occurring are low. Hence, even with such combinations of adverse condi-
tions, the likelihood of the return falling below 10% is rather low.
D.   Debt Service Coverage
7.10      Based on the projections and the proposed financing plan, FOB's
long-term debt service coverage would show the following trend:
Debt Service Coverage
1974   1975   1976   1977   1978/1 1979   1980
Times covered       2.5    1.7    2.5    2.5    1.7    1.6    1.6
/1   Repayment of the Bank loan begins that year.
7.11      The debt service coverage is considered sufficient to meet the
Company's financial obligations. However, in the Yugoslav context, the Company
has to generate enough foreign exchange funds (through retention and depre-
ciation quotas) to meet its foreign obligations including debt repayments.
As shown in Annex 7-8, the foreign exchange balance is very tight especially
in 1975, 1976 and 1978, and will only improve in the following years. During
negotiations, it has been agreed that the Belgrade Bank will make foreign
exchange funds available to the Company in case and to the extent such funds
generated by the Company are not adequate to meet its obligations to the Bank.
E.   Break-even Point
7.12      After completion of the pro1ect, the profit break-even point is
about 72% of effective capacity, equal to 66,000 TPY of castings. Differently
expressed, once the project is operating at full capacity, the price could
fall 12% before the Company would show a loss.  The cash break-even point,
at the peak debt service requirement in 1978, would be at about 69% of capa-
city. Further details of break-even levels are found in Annex 7-9.
F.   Major Risks
7.13      The project has essentially three major areas of potential risk of
which one - a strained financial position during project execution - was dis-
cussed in para. 7.05. The second risk could lie in future technological de-
velopments that might lead to a general shift from the use of gray iron to



- 25 -
aluminum alloys especially in the production of engine blocks, one of FOB's
products which is expected to account for nearly 25% of the Company's total
sales revenue in 1978. This risk has been lessened by the recent spurt in oil
prices making aluminum smelting relatively more expensive. However, FOB is
closely watching developments in this field to make necessary adjustments in
its future development program, and the project is designed to have flexibility
for such adjustments. The third risk may be due to the fact that the Company,
which is not yet well established in the convertible currency area because of
the strong domestic demand, could find expansion of exports in that area more
difficult than presently envisaged because of the temporary cutback in auto
production there due to fuel shortages. However, even if auto production were
not to come back to normal, little difficulty is foreseen in diverting sales
to other industries due to the continuing worldwide shortage of castings.
Further, even if exports to the convertible area were to fall short of pre-
dictions, the Company should have no problem in selling that portion of its
production to domestic consumers without adverse effect on its earnings.
G.   Accounting and Audit Requirements
7.14      The Company's present accounting methods follow the Yugoslav system
which is cumbersome and,leads to inconsistencies.  Moreover, it is difficult
and time-consuming to transform financial statements into a format whichi would
make them a more meaninAful management tool. The Company's financial control
is less than satisfactory. Lack of capable financial management is a weakness
of the Company. FOB is aware of these deficiencies and is taking steps to
improve the present situation. More specifically, as preconditions for loan
effectiveness, the Company has agreed during negotiations that it will:
(i) appoint well-qualified and experienced people to strengthen the financial
department; (ii) appoint a consultant to improve its accounting procedures
and financial control and also to provide training for its financial staff;
and (iii) establish separate accounts for the project in a form satisfactory
to the Bank.
7.15      Accounts of Yugoslav enterprises are not audited in the strict
sense of the term. The Social Accounting Service (SAS) annually conducts a
limited review of the statutory financial statements, for arithmetic ac-
curacy; its inspectors visit the enterprises only occasionally if errors
or incorrect reporting are suspected. The principal duty of SAS is to ensure
that financial transactions of the enterprises comply with Yugoslav laws; it
does not provide a report on the accounts. SAS has already started a program
under which its staff will be trained by an international accounting firm in
auditing methods consistent with Bank requirements. 1/ In the case of the
1/   Coopers & Lybrand of the U.K. was appointed in January 1974 to carry out
the training program.



- 26 -
Kikinda project, the Bank has received assurance that Kikinda will invite SAS
to undertake annual audits of its 1974 and 1975 accounts in collaboration with
the international firm of accountants as part of SAS's on-the-job training of
its inspectors. Moreover, in the event that SAS is not able to achieve a
consistent and satisfactory standard of auditing thereafter, Kikinda will re-
tain, at the request of the Bank, an experienced independent auditing firm
after consultation with the Bank. A similar agreement has been reached with
FOB.
VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   Available Alternatives
8.01      Though Yugoslavia produces at present over 340,000 tons of gray
iron castings, only a small portion (53,000 tons) is of a specialized variety
for use in the fast-growing sector of engines and engine-driven vehicles.
The demand for such specialized gray castings is expected to more than double
to 125,000 tons by 1978. FOB is Yugoslavia's largest producer of such gray
castings, currently accounting for over half of Yugoslav production. Apart
from FOB, there are eight foundries producing mainly gray castings for en-
gine-driven vehicles. All of them are small-scale units in none of which
the present annual capacity exceeds 8,000 tons. Taking their expansion plans
into account, the total production would rise to 82,000 tons by 1978, still
falling short of the estimated demand by a margin of 43,000 tons. The actual
gap would be higher as those firms are likely to export a portion of their pro-
duction to earn hard currency to meet their foreign exchange debt service
obligations.
8.02      In this context, the available alternatives are either to expand
FOB or to import gray castings to meet the widening gap between supply and
demand. The latter is an uneconomic alternative considering the fact that
Yugoslavia is a very competitive producer of castings in Europe and that
there is an acute shortage of castings in the world. Therefore, the viable
option to help alleviate the shortage of gray and also nodular castings in
Yugoslavia is to expand FOB, the experienced large-scale producer of such
products, and this is what the Company plans to do (para. 4.01). Nodular
castings are also primarily for use in engine-driven vehicles. The produc-
tion and use of nodular castings (as a substitute for malleable castings)
is of recent origin in Yugoslavia. FOB and the other Bank-assisted foundry,
Kikinda, are the two leading producers of such castings in the country.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
8.03      The incremental economic rate of return of the project is about
23% at constant 1973 prices. Prices used for this calculation are shown in
Annex 7-7 and the economic sensitivity analysis is given in Annex 8-1. Ex-
port prices (c.i.f., Yugoslav border) of FOB to the convertible currency



- 27 -
area have been, used as accounting prices to calculate sales revenues. All
material inputs, most of which are of domestic origin, have been valued at
international prices (c.i.f., Yugoslav border). Labor costs have been based
on market wage rates. The economic rate of return is generally sensitive
to changes in revenues and costs to the same extent as the financial return.
A decrease of 10% in revenue lowers the economic return to 14.2%, while a
10% increase in operating and capital costs would reduce the return to 17.5%
and 20.1% respectively. A combination of 10% higher capital costs and 10%
higher operating costs would lbwer the return to 15.1%. Thus the project
has a good return under foreseeable adverse circumstances.
C.   Competitiveness
8.04      FOB domestic prices in general are comparable to Western European
prices with respect to gray castings while they are slightly lower for nodular
castings, and significantly lower for patterns. FOB sales are predominantly
domestic-oriented. For example, in 1972 domestic sales of castings by volume
accounted for about 85% of total sales. But the share of exports by volume
to the converteible area is expected to rise sharply from the current low level
of 5% to 22% of total sales by 1978. However, even after expansion, FOB would
be primarily domestic-oriented. About 60% of its total sales are contracted
to the UMI group; about 12% would go to domestic customers outside UMI; and
the remaining 28% would be exported to the convertible and clearing areas.
Export prices to the clearing area would continue to be higher than those for
the covertible area. In the case of the convertible area, even if prices of
castings were to fall by 10% by 1978, the total sales revenue would fall hardly
2%.  FOB does not require the existing duty shelter of 257% from customs duties
and other taxes except to be protected against the sale of foreign foundry
products at or below marginal cost in Yugoslavia.
D.   Linkages and Employment
8.05      The project is crucial for the projected expansion of a number of
industries including those manufacturing tractors and other farm equipment,
commercial vehicles, railways and ships which are expected to expand at an
annual rate of over 8.5% in the foreseeable future. This rapid growth would
not be possible without the availability of adequate iron castings at reason-
able prices. Without the FOB expansion, Yugoslavia would have to depend on
large-scale casting imports at prices higher than those of locally-made
castings, straining the foreign exchange resources of the country.
8.06      The FOB foundry is located in the capital city of Belgrade, where
the heavy concentration of industry makes it imperative to develop adequate
foundry capacity there to meet industrial needs. The proposed project would
create directly 914 additional permanent jobs. In addition, it would open
up jobs to at least 2,000 persons in the supplier industries and the transport
sector (Annex 8-3). Furthermore, at least three of the major industries with



- 28 -
large-scale expansion plans (IMT, IMR, and 21 May) would have to trim their
expansion programs resulting in reduced employment creation but for the assured
supply of castings from the project. It is also probably fair to assume that
their expansions would have to be scaled down if these companies were to depend
largely on imported castings.
E.   Estimated Foreign Exchange Effects
8.07      The more important benefits from the project are foreign exchange
savings and earnings which are considered oi crucial importance to the Yugoslav
economy burdened by chronic balance of trade problems. As noted earlier, were
it not for the project, Yugoslavia would have no option but to import castings
on a large scale, thus aggravating its foreign exchange difficulties. In this
context, the net incremental revenue from the project, after deducting the net
increase in annual foreign exchange outflow due to it, could be considered as
the net foreign exchange savings and earnings from the project. These amount
to, at 1973 constant prices, Din 418 million (US$27 million) in 1978, the
first year of full production (Annex 8-2). Therefore, the foreign exchange
cost of the project, US$17 million equivalent (at 1973 prices), would be more
than offset by the net foreign exchange savings and earnings of one year alone
after project completion. During the 10-year (1974-83) forecast period,
total net foreign savings and earnings from the project would be about Din
3,350 million (US$216 million), or an annual average equivalent to approxi-
mately US$21.6 million.
IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations the following principal assurances and agreements
were reached with the Belgrade Bank and the Company:
A.   Agreements that the Belgrade Bank will:
(1)  Provide funds required for the project (para. 5.08);
(2)  Make project completion and cost overrun guarantees (para. 5.09);
and
(3)  Make.foreign exchange funds available to the Company, if the
latter's foreign exchange funds are not sufficient to cover
its obligations (para. 7.11).
B.   Agreements that the Company will:
(1)  Provide evidence that UMI has approved the project and that
UMI will not request an increase in FOB 's annual contribution
(para. 2.04);
(2)  Not sell, lease, transfer or dispose of its rights or assets
(para. 2.09);



- 29 -
(3) Strengthen certain departments (paras. 4.09, 6.08 and 7.14);
(4) Provide evidence that IMT will relocate its assembly plant
(para. 4.05);
(5) Implement and maintain strict pollution controls (para. 4.06);
(6) Retain the technical consultant appointed to assist in pro-
curement (para. 4.10);
(7) Provide evidence of IMT financing (para. 5.08);
(8) Observe certain financial covenants to maintain a sound
liquidity and financial position (paras. 7.04 and 7.06);
(9) Maintain separate accounts for the project (para. 7.14);
and
(10) Arrange for proper external auditing (para. 7.15).
9.02      Based on the foregoing agreements, the project provides a sound
basis for a Bank loan to FOB equivalent to US$15.0 million for 14 years, in-
cluding a 4-year grace period.

ANNEX 1-1
Page 1
YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF TERMS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES
1.        In a broad sense, the art of founding may be described as making a
cavity in the sand and filling it with fluid metal. In the cold state, the
metal retains the shape and contour of the cavity and becames a metal casting.
2.        The term "iron castings" covers a wide range of iron - carbon -
silicon alloys containing from 2% to 4% carbon and 0.25% or more of silicon
in combination with varying percentages of manganese, sulphur and phosphorous,
and sometimes one or more of special alloying elements, such as nickel, chro-
mium, molybdenum and vanadium.
3.        There are various kinds of iron castings; they are roughly grouped
as chilled-iron castings, gray-iron castings, alloyed-iron castings, malleable
castings and nodular-iron castings. In'general, castings are made by mixing
and melting together different grades of pig iron, foundry scrap, steel scrap
and ferro-alloys or other metals depending on the type of casting. Further
details may be found in "Cast Metals Handbook" published periodically by the
American Foundryman's Association.
A.   Types of Castings
Gray Iron Castings
4.        Gray iron castings are made of pig iron, of mixtures of pig iron
and steel, or of mixtures of pig iron, steel and other metals in smaller
amounts. They are frequently sold under trade names, such as Mechanite,
Gunite, Ermalite, Ferrosteel, Gun-iron, etc. Chemically, gray iron castings
include a large number of metals covering a wide range in composition, with
carbon varying from 2 to 4 percent, and silicon from 0.5 to 3 percent with
small amounts of other metal according to the type of product produced.
Nodular Iron Castings
5.        Nodular iron, also called ductile iron and sheroid graphite iron, is
a relatively new grade introduced around 1948 and is gaining in popularity
over malleable castings due to better economy in production.  It has been used
for castings having section from 1/8 inch up to 40 inches thick. It is produced
by treating molten iron that normally would produce gray castings with magnesium
alloys. The addition of these alloys results in castings which have the carbon
present in spheroid form. Castings so made have relatively high strength and
better ductility than ordinary gray iron. Several types of nodular castings
with varying structures can be developed by alloying or heat treating.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 2
Malleable Castings
6.        They are of two kinds, known as white heart, or European; and black
heart, or American; these terms indicate differences in the process and the
products and countries of origin. Malleable castings are comparatively soft
and can be bent without breaking. Malleable castings contain 2.25 to 3.0
percent carbon, 0.3 to 0.5 percent manganese, 0.6 to 1.15 percent silicon and
small amounts of sulphur and phosphorous; the exact composition, particularly
with respect to silicon, being varied according to the type of castings.
In the "green" state, these castings are relatively brittle and possess poor
mechanical properties; therefore, annealing of these castings is essential.
After annealing a metal similar to soft steel but of much coarser grain and
less ductile is obtained.
Alloyed Castings
7.        These are used most exclusively for applications where resistance
to wear, to heat (including elongation), and to corrosion; high strength of
castings, rigidity, damping of vibrations and amenability to heat treatment
are of prime importance. The alloying elements - silicon, nickel, chromium,
molybdenum, copper and titanium - are used in varying quantities depending
on the type of use. Many of these irons are patented compositions and are
sold under various trade names such as Ni-resist, Causal metal, Silal, Ni-
Crosilal. etc.
Chilled-Iron Castings
8.        These castings are extremely hard on the surface.  Cast iron with
some sections is purposely cooled so fast by chills that the carbon is re-
tained in combined form, while other sections are allowed to cool gradually,
so that the carbon is retained in the form found in gray iron. Such castings
are used for rolls and various other articles which require a hard, wear-
resisting surface.
B.   Processes of Production
9.        The products of a foundry vary in size, complexity, the metal used,
the type of castings, the number of castings produced, the techniques of
production employed, the precision of the castings and the extent to which
they are finished; these differences are most often inter related.
There are several important and quite unrelated stages in the
production of iron castings
-    Design and pattern making
-    Preparation of Sand
-    Core-Making



ANNEX 1-1
Page  3
Mold-Making
-    Melting
-    Pouring
-    Cleaning, finishing and inspecting.
Design and Pattern Making
10.       Design and construction of the pattern is perhaps the most important
single factor in the production of castings. Not only the patterns must be
dimensionally accurate, but full consideration must be given to making them
meet the requirements of the foundry equiptent and technique. To make the sand
mold, it is first necessary to make a pattern of the part to be cast, which
will leave its imprints in the sand. There are several types of patterns,
each fulfilling a specific need. Patterns may be made of wood or metal, as
required, and used in conjunction with hand-molding or machine molding
methods, depending upon the number of castings to be made and the degree of
precision required. When a large number of castings have to be produced, a
metal pattern is made in the pattern room by skilled patternmakers.
Preparation of Sand
11.       The quality and composition of the molding sand is very important.
It must contain clay as well as silica and be sufficiently loose to allow
gases to escape during casting. The particle size cf the sand is also impor-
tant as it has a bearing on the surface quality of the castings. Clay content
in the sand should be about 18-20% to achieve the necessary cohesion of the
mixture in the mold.
Core-Making
12.       A core is nothing more than a solid shape made of sand.  Sand is
rammed either by hand or machine or blown into a core box. When the core
box is filled with sand and the excess sand is removed with a straight edge,
it is turned over and the box lifted from the core thus formed. The ramming
operation sometimes includes placement of reinforcing rods, or wires, for
strengthening purposes. The cores thus prepared are baked to make them hard,
strong and smooth. There are various processes to make cores. The interior
surfaces of castings are generally formed by cores, which are inserted in
the mold after the pattern has been withdrawn. In some moldirg operations,
cores are used to form exterior surface of castings.
Mold-Making
13.       For making molds, the molder places a pattern on a flat plate and
then puts a molding box, or "flask", on this plate and fills it with prepared
sand. The sand is compacted by ramming and is finished by hand with special
tools. Next, this pattern (first part) is removed, the molder having made



ANNEX 1-1
Page 4
half a mold. Then he makes the second half the same way and, after removing
this pattern (second part), the two flasks are carefully put together to form
the complete mold. A channel, or "runner", is cut in the sand through which
the molten metal is poured and also other channels known as "risers" to allow
excess metal to escape. Sometimes, depending upon the type and shape of
castings, cores are placed upon the type provided for the purpose in the main
mold, before the two flakes are put together to form the complete mold.
Fundamentally, the machine-molding method differs little from the process
previously described for the manual or floor-molding operations, the main
difference being that the ramming and the removal of the patterns from the
sand are performed by machine. Also construction of gates and risers will
be performed by the machine. However, the placement of cores, patching and
finishing of the mold still remain as the chief function of the molder.
There are various methods of making molds. A relatively new molding method
known as "Disamatic molding process" - flaskless molding - lends itself to
the production of molds by machine methods without using flask.
Melting
14.       Generally, three types of furnaces are or have been employed by
foundries for melting iron. These are: (1) the cupola furnace; (2) the
pneumatic furnace; and (3) the electric furnace.
15.       The cheapest and the oldest type, and the most extensively used is
the cupola, which is, essentially, a vertical steel cylinder lined with refrac-
tory materials. Within the cupola are placed alternate layers of coke and
iron; air is forced through them and the iron is melted by contact with hot
gases. The molten metal drips down through the incandescent fuel to the
bottom of the furnace and, when the plug is removed, the iron runs into
ladles ready for pouring operations.
16.       The pneumatic furnace is used to produce certain high-grade cast
irons, because tests can be made during the melting process and because the
metal is more easy to control in it than in the cupola. The entire charge is
placed in the furnace at one time, melted down in one mass on hearth, and
tapped when the proper temperature and composition are reached.
17.       Because quality can be quite accurately controlled and higher temper-
atures secured, the electric furnace is sometimes used in melting cast iron.
The entire charge is placed in the furnace at one time. Since the cost is
ordinarily greater than in the cupola, the electric furnace is generally used
only when special quality control is required.
Pouring
18.       The molten metal withdrawn from the furnace is transferred to the
refractory ladle which is carried to the pouring bay where the metal is poured
into the molds. The casting temperature and the pouring time must be carefully
controlled to avoid casting defects. Once the castings have been cooled,
they are shaken out. The gates and risers are broken off and returned to
the furnace for remelting, while the sand is screened and either thrown away
or sent back for re-use.



ANNEX 1-1

Cleaning, Finishing and Inspecting
19.       Adhering sand is removed by brushing or tumbling in a revolving
barrel, or by the abrasive action of sand blasting. Rough places and fins in
castings are smoothed and settled by grinding and chipping. A quick inspection
is generally made when castings are delivered to the cleaning room so that no
further time may be wasted on defective work. After the cleaning, a thorough
inspection is made and satisfactory castings are selected for shipment.
20.       Certain types of castings - nodular iron and malleable castings, -
are heat treated to make castings stronger and more resistant to shock and
fatigue. The finished castings are placed in the annealing furnace, heated
in the furnace to the desired temperature and cooled gradually to the room
temperature. The temperature at which the castings are heated and the cooling
rate depend on the type of castings.

YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
WORKERS' SELF-MANAGEMENT
1.        Fabrica Odlivaka Beograd (FOB) is an autonomous associate enter-
prise of Udruzena Metalska Industrija (lI ), the 15th largest industrial
group in Yugoslavia consisting of seven enterprises. UMI has a Workers'
Council which serves as the managing body of the organization. It guides
and coordinates the activities of the member companies.
2.        The Council is composed of members selected by the staff of UMI's
head office, which consists of a secretariat, a planning branch, a develop-
rent branch and a financial analysis branch. Long-term, medium-term and
yearly plans for UMI members are prepared at the head office which has a
General Manager selected by a Competition Committee from candidates proposed
by the Workers' Councils of member companies. The General Manager is
assisted by an Executive Board. The Board drafts the development and work
programs of UMI and guides the use of UMI financial funds created with the
contribution of member companies. These funds include the Joint Reserve Fund
and the Joint Development Fund. Each member company contributed in 1969 and
1970 an amount equivalent to 0.3% of net income to the Joint.Reserve Fund
and 0.3% of its Business Fund (equity) to the Joint Development Fund. However,
these annual payments vary according to the rates specified in the annual
economic plans of UMI.
3.        The Joint Reserve Fund is used to help cover the losses of member
companies by way of interest-free loans. The main objectives of the Joint
Development Fund are to organize cooperative programs of research and devel-
opment, conduct market studies, and set up joint offices to deal with sales-
services for the UMI group. This Fund could also be used to provide
interest-free credit to member firms for expansion and development.
4.        Prior approval of UMI is required if a member plans to invest
more than one million Dinars in a year. This provision is primarily to
coordinate the expansion programs of its member companies.
FOB
5.        The FOB enterprise now has a foundry in New Belgrade and a pattern-
making shop near the New Belgrade foundry. As is common in Yugoslavia, the
enterprise is self-managed by workers. This system operates through direct
as well as indirect participation by workers in making decisions. The
organizational framework of self-management mainly consists of Work Units,
Work Units Council, the Workers' Assembly, the Workers' Council, the
Executive Board, and the General Manager.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
A.   Direct Participation
Work Units and Work Units Council
6.        Work Units are departmental and functional units within the enter-
prise. Chief of every Work Unit is a member of the Work Units Council which
pays particular attention to work incentives, better utilization of human
and capital resources and improved productivity. The Council has a president
and a vice-president elected by its members. In case of dispute among the
work units, an arbitration commission is appointed whose decision is
final.
Workers' Assembly
7.        The Work Units Council is responsible in its work to the Workers'
Assembly in which all the employees of FOB participate directly in making
decisions on key issues. The assembly could be convened any time at the
initiative of the General Manager or its own initiative. It could also be
convened when one-tenth of the workers demand it.
B.   Indirect Participation
8.        Since it is not possible for workers to make all cLecisions by them-
selves, some of their functions are delegated to management bodies such as
the Workers' Council and the Executive Board whose members are elected by the
workers.
Workers' Council
9.        The Workers' Council is the most important management body.  It
consists of 30 members elected for two years by FOB employees. Nobody can
be elected to the Council for two consecutive terms. Every year, half the
Council members are replaced by newly-elected members.
10.       The Council sets forth the policy of the enterprise.  Its approval
is necessary on major investments, annual investment plans, and appropriation
of company's net income. Its responsibilities also include: (a) coordination
of FOB development plans with those of the UMI group; (b) decision on business
loans to UMI members; (c) organization of referendums to decide key issues
such as integration and technical cooperation with other enterprises, change
of location, change of name, etc.; and (d) election and dismissal of members
of executive bodies, commissions to deal with specific issues, etc.
Executive Board
11.       The Executive Board, a body of the Workers' Council, consists of
11 members elected by the Workers' Council for two years. No member can be
elected for more than one term in a row. Hlalf the members are replaced every
year. The members elect among themselves the president and his deputy.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
12.       The Board's main functions are to:  (a) implement all decisions
of the Workers' Council; (b) propose measures to improve business policy,
organization, etc.; and (c) appoint a commission to select key personnel
of the Company.
General Manager
13.       The General Manager as well as his deputy are elected by the
Workers' Council on the basis of a publicly-announced open competition.
The Council sets up a committee to consider all applications and make rec-
ommendations. Based on those recommendations, the Council elects the can-
didates who best suit the prescribed qualifications.
14.       The term of the General Manager as well as his deputy is four
years, but they are eligible for re-election for a second term. In case
they do not enjoy the confidence of the Workers' Council and the Executive
Board, they could be relieved from their functions even before the expira-
tion of their term.
15.       The General Manager is independent in his day-to-day operation
and is responsible only to the Workers' Council. He may be a member of
the Executive Board if the Council decides. He can overrule the decision
of the Council only wghen it conflicts with Yugoslav law.
16.       The present General Manager of the FOB Foundry is Milan Rodic,
41, a graduate of mechanical engineering and foreign trade schools in
Belgrade. He has been with FOB (formerly part of the IMT Tractor Factory)
since 1952. He held various positions such as technician, chief technologist,
and chief of quality control before his election in June 1971 as General Man-
ager. He has had specialized training in foreign foundries, and is currently
President of the Managing Board of the Yugoslav Association of Foundries.

ANNEX 2 - 2
YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING FACILITIES
1.         The Fabrika Odlivaka Beograd (FOB) was established at the end of
1970 as a part of Udruzfna Metalska Industrija (UMI), an association of seven
major industries in Yugoslavia.Until the end of 1973,FOB operated two foundries:
one in New Belgrade with an annual capacity of 25,ooo tons and the other in
Rakovica with an annual capacity of 8,000 tons.
I. New Belgrade Foundry
2.         The New Belgrade foundry was built in 1947-48 as an integral part
of a firm called Zavodi. Masinske Industrije of New Belgrade for the produc-
tion of cast iron pipes. In 1951, when this foundry became part of Industrija
Masina i Traktora (IMT), it started producing castings for agricultural
implements and electrical equipment in addition to cast iron pipes. With
the increase in demand for agricultural implements, the foundry capacity was
increased to about 9,000 TPY by 1960. In the early 1960'ss, the production of
cast iron pipes was discontinued in order to concentrate on small castings
for the automotive and farm tool industries. Further expansion of the foundry
in the niid-1960's increased its capacity to about 11,000 TPY by 1968. Sub-
sequently, with the addition of a new melting shop with new cupola furnaces,
new machines in the core-making shop, new equipment in the fettling shop and
the mechanization of auxiliary departments, the capacity of the foundry was
increased to 25,000 TPY. This foundry at present consists of the following
departments: the melting shop, molding shop, sand preparation plant, core-
making shop, cleaning and other auxiliary plants and pattern shop.
A. Melting Shop
3.         There are three batteries of cupola furnaces.  A recently installed
battery consisting of two hot blast wiater-cooled cupola furnaces  ¢'STRICO")
is being utilized for the entire production. Each of the cupola furnaces has
a capacity of 10 tons/hr and a diameter of 10150 mm. These furnaces also
have automatic charging hoists with bucket loaders, equipment for slag removal,
and 7-ton oil fired receivers.
4.         Another battery consisting of two oold blast cupola furnaces (900
mm diameter) has a capacity of 4 tons/hr. This has semi-mechanized charging
equipment but no receiver. These cupolas will not be used in the future;
however, they will be maintained as a standby.
5.         The third battery, the oldest one, consisting of two cold blast
cupola furnaces (900 mm diameter) not presently in use will be used during project
implementation but would be dismantled subsequently. This consists of two furnaces
with a melting capacity of 4 tons/hr, semi-mechanized ghzrging equipment and a
receiver.
6.         There are three line frequency induction holding furnaces, each
with a 2.5-ton holding capacity. One of the vessels is without electric
connections since it is used as a reserve. There is an overhead monorail
system between the holding furnaces and the STRICO cupola furnaces.



ANNEX 2 - 2
Page 2
B. .Molding Shop
7.         The Molding Shop is divided into three independent molding lines:
Molding Line 1: This molding line is for small castings. It has
five pairs of cope and drag jolt squeeze, pin lift molding machines (one
pair as a standby). A mold plate cor.veyor (6-7 W/speed/min) with 70 plates
(800 x 1,200 mm) is used for transport of poured molds.  This line has a
capacity of 400 molds/hr and uses 400 x 300 x 120/120 mm flasks. The mold
conveyor has a cooling tunnel with a fume extraction system. It also has
an overhead pouring monorail, a suspended conveyor for the transport of
castings to the cleaning room, shake-out grates and sand hoppers. The mold-
ing line will be used even after expansion.
Molding Line II/1: This line consists of a high pressure semi-
automatic moI`igIstatio_n, pneumatic transport equipment, a monorail for
pouring, a vibrating shake-out grate, an overhead conveyor for the transport
of castings, a control panel and a cooling tunnel with exhaust facilities.
The capacity of this line is 25-30 molds/hr and the flask size used is 1,100
x 820 x 400/400 mm. This line will be used in the future withoat any alter-
ations.
Molding Line II/2: This line which has a capacity of 6 molds/hr
uses 1,400 ixT,000 x 500/50D mm flasks. It has a sand slinger machine for
molding and uses the same cooling tunnel as Line II/1. This line will be
dismantled during the implementation of the project.
Moldsg Line III: This line comprises 4 pairs of cope and drag
Jolt squeeze molding machines, a 101 m long conveyor (7 nVmin speed) with
70 plates, a cooling tunnel with exhausting, vibratory shake-out, and mono-
rails for pouring and transfer of castings to the cleaning room. This line
has a capacity of 120 molds/hr and uses 700 x 600 x 250/250 nm flasks. With
some alterations and modifications, this line will be used in the future.
C. Sand Preparation Plants
8.         Tis facility consists of 4 independent sand plants situated along
respective molding lines. The sand preparation plant serving Molding Line I
consists of sand mixers, storage bins, transport conveyors for new and used
sand, and local storage bins at the molding line. The capacity of this plant
is 30 m3/hr ana will continue to be used after expansion. The sand prepara-
tion plant for Molding Line II/1 (MPldmaster Line) comprises a mixer, two
storage bins, and a distribution system for sand. Capacity of this plant
is 20 m3/hr and will be used for the new Molding Line III after expansion.
Another sand preparation plant with a capacity of 15 m /hr is presently serv-
ing Molding Line II/2 (slinger line) and has similar equipment as the sand
preparation plant for Molding Line II/1. After expansion, this plant will
also be used for the new Molding Line III. The sand preparation plant serv-
ing the present Molding Line III has sand mixers, storage bins, and Belt
conveyors for new and used sand. The capacity of this plant is 30 m /hr and
it will be used for the new Molding Line IV (Molding Line III will become
Molding Line IV with some alterations and modifications after expansion).



ANNEX 2 - 2
Page 3~
D. Core-Making Shop
9.         There are two sand preparation plants for core sand: one is in-
stalled above the floor of the core blowers and is supplied with dry sand
from the sand dryer; and the other is on the core room floor for oil core
sand and C02 core sand and is supplied i4th sand from the stockyard of dry
sand. Each plant with a capacity of 5 m.'/hr has 3 mixers, pneumatic trans-
port, storage bins, feeders and necessary equipment.
10.        The core-making shop is located in the first bay of the foundry
and has the following equipment:  four Shalco-type (shell) core-blowing
machines, three Shalco-type (hot box) core blowers, one 80-litre oil sand
core blower, three 5-litre oil sand blowers, four 1-litre oil sand blowers,
two 25-litre oil sand blowers with rollover and stripping stations, 10
core-making machines, three 12-litre oil sand blowers, two 2.5-litre oil
sand blowers, 3 vertical core dryers (1.8 - 2.5 tons/hr capacity each) with
controlled heating, equipment for painting cores, one monorail conveyor for
coro transportation within core rooms and one monorail conveyor system for
transporting cores to molding lines. All these facilities will be used
even after expansion.
E. Cleaning Room
11. *This room is located at the end of the molding shop and has four
independent lines varying acoording to the weight of the castings. Special
attention is given to cleaning lines for cylinder blocks and cylinder heads.
The cleaning room has the following facilities: six shot-blasting machines,
three continuous monorail systems (4-ton/hr, 6-ton/hr and 5-ton/hr capacity
respectively), five swing grinders, seven stationary grinders, three universal
lathes, two radial drilling machines, one horizontal milling machine and
necessary jigs and fixtures. With the exception of the 6-ton/hr monorail,
all other facilities will continue to be used.
F. Heat Treatment Plant
12.        This plant located within the cleaning  room consists of two heat
treatment furnaces. The furnace wvih a capacity of 5 tons/12 hr is oil-
fired at a maximum temperature of 1,OO0°C and its chamber size is 2.5 x 3 x
2.3 m. The other furnace which is electrically heated (2 x 550 KW), has a
capacity of 11 tons/12 hr.
G. Testing Area
13.        Most of the testing equipment is  conventional.  It is equipped
forlwet analysis, physical tests and sand tests. All equipment in this
seciion will continue to be used. There are magnaflux and pressure test instru-
ments    available for casting inspection.
H. Utilities
14.N       Total installed electric power is about 5,000 KW and yearly con-
sumption on a two-shift basis is about 16 million KWH. Electric energ is



ANNEX 2 - 2
Page 4
supplied by Electrodistri-bucija of Belgrade from its central heating plant
at Toplana, about 2 kn from the Company, and from the transformer station
at Bezanija, about 1 km from the plant. A 35/10 KV transformer located
close to the foundry supplies all the required electric power and is connect-
ed to the plant by 1O-KVA underground cables. This transformer also supplies
power to IMT. In addition, there are 7 transformers (of two types: 10/.4
KV and 10/.55 KV) which are located in the foundry building. The present
electrical distribution system will be remodeled during project implementa-
tion.
15.        The present gas needs are met by a 30 kg/hr vaporizing station.
Propane and butane gases are used for the existing core blowers. The pre-
sent vaporizing station as well as the gas distribution system will be re-
placed by a much higher capacity system to meet the requirements of the
expansion program.
16.        The existing compressed air station with a capacity of 200 cu.
meters/min supplies compressed air to both FOB and IMT plants (IMT consumes
about 30 cu. meters/min). There are 7 piston-type compressors which will
continue to be used with minor modifications.
17.        Drinking water is supplied from the New Belgrade city water system.
Industrial water, primarily for cooling compressors and cupolas, is mostly
received from 5 wells (35-meter deep) which have a total capacity of 42 cu.
meteryhr while the total requirement is about 57 cu. meter§hr. The remain-
ing water is supplied from the city irater system.
18.        Heating of the plant and office building is done by saturated steam
generated by the Company's own boiler plant. This plant is very old and the
present system is less than satisfactory. The project includes major changes
in the present heating system. The present ventilation system will not be
able to meet the environmental control law passed in March 1973. Consider-
able improvements in this system are envisaged in the project.
I. Pattern Shop
19.        The pattern shop established in 1948 as part of IMT was moved to
its present location in 1953. It is located in a separate buildLig across
the road from the FOB-IMT complex.  In this pattern shop, wooden, plastic,
gray iron and aluminun patterns and core boxes, including all necessary tools
and gauges of excellent quality are manufactured. The pattern-making facility
consisting of a wood pattern shop, a metal pattern shop, a plastic pattern
shop and a small foundry, is well equipped. However, some machines which
are very old, unproductive and inaccurate need replacement. Expansion of
the pattern shop and relocation of some of the machines are envisaged under
the project.
Observations
20.        The layout of the foundry is very favorable for the material flow
and provides sufficient flexibility to expand without disturbing the present
production. However, the space available between certain machines and equip-



ANNEX 2 - 2
ment is rather limited and hence creates production difficulties.
Wlth the proposed expansion, these problems are expected to be overcome.
21.        The production equipment and machines are well maintained but
the general order both inside and outside the foundry building is very poor,
and the existing foundry building is not maintained properly. A major bottle-
neck for increasing production is the limited capacity of the cleaning room.
This bottleneck will be removed after completion of the project.
II. Rakovica Foundry
22.        This foundry is located in the suburbs of Belgrade, very close to
the Industrial Motora Rakovica (IMR), also a member of UMI. There are two
foundries - new and old - housed in different buildings separated by a creek.
The old foundry which uses manual molding was built in 1940 with an armuan
capacity of 200 tons of gray castings of various kinds.  Its capacity was
increased in 1946 when it started producing automotive castings. With sub-
sequent additions and alterations, the capacity of this foundry has increased
to 2,000 TPY on a two-shift basis. Since most of the equipment and machines
are obsolete and are operated manually, no effort has been made to describe
the facilities of this foundry.
23.        The other foundry in Rakovica was built in 1961 in cooperation
with Marco Conveyor Co. Ltd. of U.K. and has a capacity of 6,000 TPY in two
shift operation. This foundry supplies gray iron castings, primarily cylinder
blocks, cylinder heads, cam shafts and rLywheels, to IMR for the production
of motor engines.
24.        The Rakovica facility was a part of IMR until it was consolidated
with the New Belgrade foundry to form FOB at the end of 1970. lhis facility
was separated from FOB at the end of 1973 and is expected to rejoin IMR. Its
production would be stopped by 1975 when the land on which it is located would
be acquired by the city development authorities.
25.        The major production units of the Rakovica main foundry are the
melting shop, molcUng shop, sand preparation plant, core-making shop and
cleaning and other auxiliary plants. Patterns required for this foundry are
supplied by the pattern shop located in New Belgrade.
A. Melting Shop
26.        This consists of two hot blast water-cooled cupolas (900 mm in
diameter) with a capacity of 4-6 tons/hr, semi-mechanized charging system
with bucket loaders, and two line frequency induction receivers (2 tons),
including one spare. Transportation of liquid iron is done by overhead
monorail system.
B. Molding Line
27.        There is only one mold ing line and it is located adjacent to the melt-
ing shop. There are two jolt-squeeze molding machines, which have a capacity



ANNEX 2 - 2
Page 6
of 60 molds/hr.  The molding conveyor, which is 120 m long, has a speed of
1-7 m/min and uses 1,280 x 750 mm plates, and flasks of various sizes.
C. Sand Preparation Plant
28.        This plant comprises sand mixers (30 tons/hr), sand dryers (3
tons/hr), pneumatic transport systems for dry sand, belt conveyor systems
for used and prepared sand and bins for temporary storage at the molding
machines.
D.  Core-Making Mhopr
29.        There are two core sand mixers with 110 kg/charge capacity, six
core blowing machines for oil sand, and one Shalco hot box. For
drying cores, there are four chamber-type dryers. The hot box machine,
which was installed only recently, will be relocated at the New Belgrade
foundry during the latter part of project implementation.
D. Cleaning Room
30.        The cleaning room is located behind the melting shop charging
area in a separate building. As this arrangement is not well suited for
proper material flow, there are some material handling and storage problems.
This plant includes twO shot blast cleaning machines of which one is a con-
tinuous type with 2 tons/hr capacity and the other is drum type with 0.6
tons/hr capacity$ two swing frame grinders, and four pedestal grinders.
E. Heat Treatment Plant
31.        There is one electric annealing furnace for stress relieving and
for preheating for w-elding defective castings.
F. Testing andFinishing
32.        Castings are tested in jigs for dimensional accuracy and facilities
for water pressure tests are also available.  Most of the castings are paint-
ed before shipping. A monorail conveyor system is used for dipping castings
and some are spray painted.
Observations
33.        The general layout of this plant is not satisfactory and consequent-
ly there are quite a few problems in material handIing on the whole.  This
foundry is not maintained properly even though some of the operating units
are adequately maintained.

YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
MARKET FOR IRON CASTINGS
A.   Industrial Setting
1.        Yugoslavia has a dynamic industry sector which in 1971 contri-
buted over 30% to the Gross National Product estimated at approximately
US$15 billion. Industrial production has been expanding at a real annual
rate of about 10.5% during 1952-1971, and nearly one-fourth of total labor
force estimated at 8.3 million (1971) is engaged in the industrial sector.
2.        Unlike the case in many developing countries, industrial devel-
opment in Yugoslavia has been outward-oriented and, on the whole, competi-
tive. Industrial exports have grown at an average annual rate of 14% during
the decade 1961-1971, faster than the rate of growth in industrial produc-
tion. Industry, along with mining, accounts for over 85% of total exports
of US$2,810 million (1971).
3.        Since the widespread reforms of 1965, there has been a general
reduction in quantitative import restrictions and duties and a better align-
ment of domestic prices with world prices. By the end of 1971, only 20% of
equipment imports, 25% of raw material and semi-finished goods and 37% of
consumer goods imports fell under the restrictive commodity quota and direct
licensing schemes. Between 1965 and 1971, the average duty on all imports
was lowered from about 14% to about 12% and on equipment imports from 24%
to 18%, with further reductions in 1972 and 1973. Compared with most devel-
oping countries, these rates are quite moderate. They are increased, how-
ever, by customs and border taxes (together 3-4%) and, since 1971, by a
special surtax of 6%. The highest average duty protection applies to metal
products (25%) and electrical equipment (22%), two of the fast-growing
subsectors.
4.        The current Five-Year Plan (1971-75) target for the growth of
industry (including mining and quarrying) is 8% a year. Crude steel produc-
tion is expected to grow at an annual rate of 14%, reaching about 5 million
tons in 1975. The equipment and durable consumer goods industry, which
currently accounts for about 25% of the total industrial output, is expected
to grow at the rate of 8.5% a year.
Main Users of Castings
5.        The main users of castings are motor vehicles, agricultural machin-
ery, machine tools, the construction industry, rail wagons, shipbuilding, and

consumer durables. Past trends and future projections of production in some
of these industries are shown below:

B.   Structure of Foundry Industry
6.        There are about 250 foundries in Yugoslavia of which approximately
50 accounted for nearly 90% of the production of castings in 1972 totalling
about 453,000 tons. The following table shows the structure of the foundry
industry:

V.   Total Castings (III + IV) 453,287              100.0
7.        Only 12 foundries have an annual capacity of over 10,000 tons
each (see Tables 1 and 3). Majority of the foundries (162) produce less
than 500 tons a year. An international comparison (Table 4) shows that



ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
Yugoslav production of castings is low. Fol- example, in 1971, the produc-
tion of Yugoslavia was only 9% of the castings output of the Federal Republic
of Germany.
C.   Production of Castings
8.        In 1960, the total production of castings was nearly 231,670 tons.
During 1960-1972, it increased at an annual rate of 5.8%. The following
table shows the growth of production during this period and the projection
for 1978 (see also Table 2):

9.        Considering the expansion programs of various foundries, it
appears that during 1972-1978, total production of castings is likely to
grow at an average annual rate of about 9%, reaching about 770,750 tons
in 1978.



ANNEX 3-1

Iron Castings
10.       The production of iron castings accounted for 82% of the total
castings output in 1972. The percentage is expected to decline slightly
to 81% by 1978 because of the faster rate of expansion of steel and non-
ferrous foundries. Among iron castings, gray and nodular castings are
the most important followed by malleable castings and pipe fittings.
11.       Gray and Nodular Castings:  There are some 100 gray and nodular
iron foundries in Yugoslavia of which less than half accounted for nearly
90% of the total production estimated at 352,600 tons in 1972. Production
in the following six years is expected to increase by about 70% mainly
because of the expansion of the following five foundries: FOB, Kikinda,
Zrenjanin, Ilias and Store. During 1972-1978, FOB, a leading producer of
gray castings, plans to increase its production of gray and nodular cast-
ings from 34,000 tons to 90,000 tons; Kikinda's output of such products is
expected to jump from about 4,000 tons to about 17,500 tons; and the Zren-
janin foundry which produces mostly radiators for heating buildings, plans
to expand its production from 15,000 tons to 30,000 tons. FOB and Kikanda
are bound by a technical and production demarcation agreement signed in
1971. According to this agreement, FOB would concentrate on the production
of gray castings for the motor vehicle and tractor industries, while Kikanda
would confine its gray castings production to meet its internal requirements
to produce machine tools. In the case of nodular castings, Kikinda would
expand its production on a large scale (from 3,310 tons to 16,000 tons) dur-
ing 1972-1977 while FOB would undertake a smaller expansion from 4,150 tons
to 10,000 tons by 1978. Further, FOB would not produce malleable and pipe
fittings, while Kikinda would expand its production of such castings.
12.       Currently, the production of nodular castings in Yugoslavia is
low at 11,000 tons with FOB accounting for 38% and Kikinda for 30% of the
total. However, by 1978, the corresponding percentage for FOB would decline
to about 33% while that for Kikinda would rise to over 53%. Apart from
Kikinda and FOB, there are three small nodular casting producers: the Store
Steel Plant in Slovenia; Torpedo at Rijeka in Croatia; and Dalit at Daruvar,
also in Croatia. These three plants, which also produce gray castings, had
the following production capacity in 1972:
Production Capacity (1972)
Nodular       Gray
(in tons)
Store               2,500      12,500
Torpedo               500       3,500
Dalit                 400       3,100
Of the above three foundries, only Torpedo has plans to expand and double
its production of both gray and nodular castings.

D.   Growth of Castings Consumption
13.       The main consumers of iron castings are industries producing
agricultural machinery, motor vehicles, machine tools, ships, rail wagons,
household appliances, as well as the construction industry.
14.       The apparent consumption of all iron castings increased at an
average rate of 11% during the last four years, reaching 321,000 tons in
1972 as shown in the following table:

E.   Demand Forecast for Iron Castings by Subsectors
15.       According to past experience in Yugoslavia, the average require-
ments of castings to manufacture one unit of the following products are:
1 car, 110 kg; 1 truck, 890 kg; 1 bus, 720 kg; 1 wheeled tractor, 885 kg;
1 crawler tractor, 1,470 kg; one ton of machine tools, 830 kg; one ton of
electrical equipment, 100 kg; one ton of non-electrical equipment, 280 kg;
one ton of agricultural machinery (excluding tractors), 100 kg; and one
ton of construction machinery, 370 kg. These normative requirements are
used to forecast the need for castings in various subsectors.
MIotor Vehicles
16.       Car Production:  Zavodi Crvena Zastava (ZCZ) located at Kragujevac,
near Belgrade, is the only car producer in Yugoslavia. It produces five
basic models under a license from FIAT of Italy. It has an annual capacity



ANNEX 3-1
Page 6
to produce 110,000 cars. In 1972, ZCZ produced 90,000 cars, with the capa-
city utilization being 82%. Its production is expected to increase to
250,000 in 1978. Based on the normative of about 110 kg of castings per car,
the total requirements of ZCZ would be about 27,500 tons in 1978. The com-
pany relies mainly on the FOB, Kikinda and Minel foundries for the supply of
castings.
17.       Car Assembling:  There are three enterprises which assemble cars.
They include: Industrija Motornih Vozil (IMV), at Novo Mesto, operating in
collaboration with Renault of France; Tovarna Motornih Vozil (TOMOS) at
Koper which collaborates with Citroen of France; and Udruzena Metalna
Industrija (UNIS) at Sarajevo which has collaboration agreement with Volks-
wagen of Germany. Their total assembly production was 20,000 in 1972. It
is expected to remain constant at this level up to 1978. Therefore, the
demand for castings by car assemblers would continue to be at the 1972 level
of 2,200 tons.
18.       Truck and Bus Producers/Assemblers:  The main truck and bus pro-
ducers/assemblers are FAP-FAMOS (Priboj and Sarajevo), Ikarus (Zemun), TAM
(Maribor), Torpedo (Rijeka), and ZCZ. Their total production is expected
to increase as follows:
(Nos.)
1972      1978
(Actual)
Trucks and Vans              15,000    27,000
Buses                         4,000      61,000
19.       Assuming an average of 890 kg of casting per truck and 720 kg per
bus, the total castings requirements for their production/assembly would
increase from 13,770 tons in 1972 to 28,130 tons in 1978.
Tractors
20.       Wheeled Tractors:  The production of wheeled tractors is projected
to increase from 17,850 in 1972 to 40,000 in 1978. Assuming about 885 kg of
castings per tractor, the total requirement of castings for the production
of wheeled tractors would be 35,400 tons in 1978 compared to 15,800 tons in
1972.
21.       Caterpillar Tractors:  The output of caterpillar tractors is
projected to increase from 545 in 1972 to 1,150 in 1978. Assuming 1,470 kg
of castings per unit, the total requirement of castings for the production
of caterpillar tractors would be 1,700 tons in 1978.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 7
Agricultural Machinery (excluding tractors)
22. These items of machinery including harvesters, combines, etc. con-
sumed a total of about 5,500 tons of castings in 1972. Their production is
projected to increase to 78,000 tons in 1978. Assuming an average of 100 kg
of castings per ton of machinery of this type, the total requirement of
castings by this subsector would be about 7,800 tons in 1978.
MIachine Tools
23.       Machine tool production in 1972 was 13,125 tons when 10,160 tons
of castings were required. The production is expected to reach 18,500 tons
in 1978, when the total castings requirements, at the rate of 830 kg per
ton of machine tools, would be about 15,400 tons.
Electrical Machinery
24.       The production of electrical machinery in 1972 was about 24,500
tons when the total castings used in their manufacture was nearly 2,450
tons. This subsector is growing at the rate of about 9% a year and its pro-
duction is expected to reach 41,100 tons in 1978. Assuming 100 kg of cast-
ings per ton of electrical machinery, the total requirement of castings by
the electrical machinery subsector would be 4,110 tons in 1978.
Non-Electrical Machinery
25.       In 1972, about 24,000 tons of castings were used to produce about
85,700 tons of non-electrical machinery. The production of non-electrical
machinery, presently growing at the fast rate of about 10.5% a year, is
expected to reach about 156,000 tons in 1978. Assuming 280 kg per ton of
non-electrical machinery, the total requirement of castings by this subsec-
tor would be about 43,700 in 1978.
Construction Machinery
26.       The manufacture of construction machinery required over 16,100
tons of castings in 1972. Assuming 370 kg of castings per ton of construc-
tion machinery, the total requirement of castings by this subsector would
be about 33,600 tons in 1978 when the total production of construction
machinery is projected at 90,700 tons.
Consumer Durables
27.       The production of consumer durables required about 33,500 tons of
castings in 1972. This subsector is growing at the rate of 8.5%. Assuming
the same growth rate for the castings requirements of this subsector, the
total requirement of castings would reach about 54,700 in 1978.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 8
Other Users
28.       Other applications of castings comprise shipbuilding, railway
rolling stock, housing, etc. as well as the replacement market for various
motor vehicles and machinery. These uses required about 185,200 tons of
castings in 1972. Looking at the projections for the growth of these sub-
sectors, it seems realistic to assume that their casting requirements
would increase by at least 15% a year. Based on this assumption, their cast-
ing needs would be about 436,000 tons in 1978.
F.   Total Demand and Supply Comparison
29.       From the above estimates, it appears that the total demand for
castings in Yugoslavia would increase between 1972 and 1978 as follows:
Total Demand for Castings by Subsectors
(in '000 tons)
1972        1978
Car Production                                  11.8        29.7
Truck Production                                13.8        24.0
Bus Production                                   2.7         4.1
Tractor Production                              16.6        37.1
Agricultural Machinery (excluding
tractors)                                     5.5          7.8
Machine Tools                                   10.2         15.4
Electrical Equipment                             2.5         4.1
Non-Electrical Equipment                        24.0        43.7
Construction Machinery                          16.1        33.6
Consumer Durables                               33.5        54.7
Other Users                                    185.2       436.8
TOTAL                                    320.9        691.0
The above table shows that the total demand for iron castings would grow
from about 321,000 tons in 1972 to 691,000 tons in 1978, reflecting an
average annual growth rate of around 13.5%.
30.       Currently, the shares of gray, nodular and malleable castings in
total demand are around 91%, 3% and 6X respectively. This is borne out by the
experience of other countries as well, with minor variations. However, by
1978, the share of malleable castings is likely to go down to 5% and the
share of nodular castings would go up to 5%, with the share of gray cast-
ings declining slightly to 90%. This change in the proportional shares of



ANNEX 3-1
Page 9
the three types of castings would result mainly because nodular castings
are gradually replacing malleable castings. Assuming these shares, the
total demand in 1978 by type of castings would be as follows:
Total Domestic Demand in 1978 by Type of Castings
(in '000 tons)
Gray                                                 622.0
Nodular                                               34.5
M4alleable (including pipe fittings)                   34.5
TOTAL                                           691.0
Domestic Production and Demand Comparison for 1978
31.       As noted earlier, the total production of iron castings would
be 627,000 tons in 1978. However, the domestic demand would be higher than
the production by 64,000 tons as shown below:
Domestic Production and Demand for Iron Castings in 1978
(in '000 tons)
Domestic       Surplus
Production           Demand        (Deficit)
Gray                    566.5               622.0           (55.5)
Nodular                  30.0                34.5           ( 4.5)
Malleable                 30.5               34.5           ( 4.0)
TOTAL              627.0              691.0            (64.0)
The above table shows that the domestic production of all types of iron
castings would fall short of domestic demand.
Imports
32.       Yugoslavia imports certain types of iron castings (i.e., valve
bodies, large pipe fittings, etc.) which are either in short supply or not
made in the country. Imports were at the low level of 4,000 tons in 1968
but they rose sliarply by 37% a year, reaching 14,000 tons in 1972. In the
future, they are projected to rise at an annual rate of about 12%, reach-
ing 28,000 tons in 1978.
Exports and Total Domestic Supply
33.       Yugoslavia is a significant exporter of iron castings.  In 1972,
its exports reached 66,000 tons, five times the imports. The main export
markets are the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, France, Hungary,



ANNEX 3-1
Page 10
Romania, Bulgaria and the U.S.S.R.  Exports grew at the rate of 6.5% a year
during 1968-72. During the next six years (1972-78), they are projected
to grow at an annual rate of 8.5%, reaching 108,500 tons in 1978. It is
most likely that this export level would be reached. In that case, castings
available for internal consumption would be 518,500 tons. To this, if the
projected imports of 28,000 tons are added, the total domestic supply would
be 546,500 tons compared to the internal demand for about 691,000 tons.
This reflects that by 1978, the actual deficit between total demand and sup-
ply would reach 144,500 tons.  Therefore, foundries in Yugoslavia will have
to expand at a rapid pace to bridge the widening gap between demand and
supply.
G.   Market for FOB Castings and Patterns
34.       FOB is the largest producer of gray castings for cars, commercial
vehicles, tractors and other farm machinery in Yugoslavia. It is also
becoming an important producer of nodular castings for these user industries.
In addition, FOB is a major producer of casting patterns for its internal
use as well as for outside sales including exports.
35.       During 1972-78, FOB's production of gray castings would increase
from 28,134 tons to 80,000 tons. During the same period, the production
of nodular castings would rise from 4,150 tons to 10,000 tons. The follow-
ing table compares the share of FOB in the production of various castings in
Yugoslavia between 1972 and 1978:
Share of FOB in Yugoslavia Production of Castings b        es
FOB Production          Country's Production
Type of          (tons)                     (tons)           % Share of FOB
Castings    1972       1978          1972           1978     1972       1978
(proj.)              (proj.)
Gray       28,134   80,000          341,571        566,500     8.2       14.1
Nodular     4,150   10,000           11,000         30,000    37.7       33.3
The above table shows that during 1972 and 1978, the share of FOB in the
country's production of gray iron would increase substantially.  But in the
case of nodular castings, the Company's share would decline slightly.
Gray and Nodular Iron Castings
36.       The main customers for FOB castings are within the UMI group of
enterprises: the tractor manufacturer, IMT; the diesel engine factory, IMR;
the automobile engine manufacturer, 21 May; the motor vehicle factory, Ikarus;
and the agricultural machinery manufacturer, Zmaj. Other Yugoslav customers
include FAP-FAMOS, a joint venture with FIAT of Italy producing mainly cars,
and several component manufacturers. The main export customers are the



ANNEX 3-1
Page 11
motor vehicle manufacturers, Opel A.G., Ford, and Audi, all of the Federal
German Republic; Cepel of Hungary; and Ferromet in Czechoslovakia; and IFA
in the German Democratic Republic. Small deliveries are also made to OM-FIAT
of Italy; M4VG, Gyor, of Hungary; and Praga of Czechoslovakia. Further,
inquiries have been received for deliveries by automotive manufacturers
Vauxhall and Chrysler of the U.K., and Volkswagen and Motorenwerke-Mannheim
of the Federal Republic of Germany.
37.       FOB has long-term supply agreements with its major customers but
orders are placed on an annual basis. Members of the UMI group have priority
on the supply of castings. The supply to UMI members was 28,525 tons or 64%
of total sales in 1973, and by 1978 it is expected to increase to 52,400
tons or 59% of the total, showing a slight decrease in the share of UMI in
total sales. The most important domestic customer outside the UMI group is
FAP-FAMOS which would increase its purchase from FOB from 4,135 tons in
1973 to 8,200 tons in 1978 to meet the needs of its expansion program.
Total domestic sales are expected to jump from 36,070 tons in 1973 to 65,000
tons in 1978, but the share of domestic sales in the total would decline
from 81% to 72% during the same period owing to projected increases in
exports, especially to the convertible currency markets.
38.       The share of exports in the total FOB sales has increased sharply
since 1971, when the Company embarked on an export drive. The export share
increased from 11% in 1971 to 15% in 1972, 19% in 1973, and it is expected
to reach 28% in 1978, the first year of full production after expansion.
Of the total exports, sales to the convertible area would be 80% by volume
in 1978 compared to 33% in 1972 and 73% in 1973.
Nodular Iron Castings
39.       Nodular iron castings are a new product line of FOB.  The sale of
such castings is expected to increase from 5,380 tons in 1973 (about 12% of
the total FOB sales of castings) to 10,000 tons in 1978, accounting for
about 11% of the total sales that year. Of the total 8,430 tons of castings
agreed for export in 1973, only 880 tons were nodular castings, i.e., less
thlan 3% of FOB's total production. The share of exports is expected to
increase to 21% of nodular casting production or 2,400 tons by 1978. Domes-
tic deliveries of nodular castings are expected to increase from 4,500 tons
in 1973 to 7,600 tons in 1978, of which 6,900 tons is allocated to UMI
members.
Summary
40.       The following table shows the agreed deliveries to and projected
requirements of FOB's main customers for both gray and nodular castings:

for the supply of about 20,100 tons of castings.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 13
41.       The projected demand for 1978, including recent inquiries from
the U.K., Germany, the U.S. and Poland for deliveries, is substantially in
excess of FOB's production target of 90,000 tons. To meet this gap, FOB has
further plans to expand its production to 120,000 tons.  Moreover, FOB's
current sales policy is to establish long-term agreements with their best
customers by giving priority to them in deliveries, while making to others
only small deliveries which could be increased once expanded production
capacity becomes available.
Pattern Sets and Tools
42.       In addition to castings, FOB sells pattern sets and tools for
making casting moulds. The production of pattern sets and tools is primarily
for internal use by FOB, but outside sales are also undertaken to utilize
the capacity of the pattern shop fully. With the rapid development of the
domestic automotive industry, demand for FOB patterns has risen sharply,
especially because the Company can offer a wide assortment. Export demand
for the patterns is also increasing.
43.       FOB plans to expedite the development of its pattern shop facili-
ties in order to reach full capacity by 1976. Pattern shop sales increased
from nearly Din 4.3 million in 1972 to Din 7.4 million in 1973, an increase
of 72%. The following table shows the expected development of sales of pat-
tern sets and tools during 1973-78:

H.   Price Tariffs and Competitive Position in Export Markets
Castings Prices
44.       For castings (except pipe fittings), Yugoslav foundries are free
to set domestic prices taking into account the prevailing market conditions,
the international price level, the national development policy, and the
stage of development of enterprises. The Tderal Council for Prices has the
power to review the prices set by the enterprises. Export prices can also be
freely set, although in several cases, foundries enter into long-term supply
contracts with automotive manufacturers which specify the quantities required
and the minimum prices that can be expected. Table 5 shows for 1973 coitpara-
tive ex-factory prices for some typical castings. Direct price comparisons are
difficult as the casting piece weight, size and intricacy influence the price
structure of individual castings. The prices per ton of castings, therefore,
give only a very limited basis for comparison as the Product mix of one enter-
prise differs from another, and the price per ton reflects such differences.
This is particularly true of the Yugoslav foundries where relatively simple
castings have been chosen for price comparison with those of export markets.
However, the overall average price for the German gray and nodular castings
pertains to more intricate castings.
45.       As FOB has begun to develop its export sales only recently, it
has yet to establish a name for its products in the export markets. The
management is aware of the demands of international competition, especially
the requirement of uniformly good quality in order to command good prices,
and is now taking steps to improve its product quality and to establish
closer direct contacts with its major export customers.
Imports and Import Tariffs
46.       The official customs duty of 15% on the import of unfinished iron
castings plus 10% import taxes give an overall protection of 25%. Imports
of unfinished iron castings are not controlled; however, the total imports
to Yugoslavia of unfinished gray and nodular iron castings are low. Imports
of finished automotive castings by automotive assemblers are also not
directly controlled, but are allowed only on the basis of the foreign ex-
change retention quota earned by enterprises.
Exports and Export Incentives
47.       Exports of castings are encouraged by the Government especially
to convertible currency markets. The enterprise receives a direct incentive
to export through the foreign exchange retention quota system whereby 20%
of the foreign exchange earnings is available to the enterprise for free use.
48.       Cooperation agreements between foreign car manufacturers and
Yugoslav assemblers require that the Yugoslav assemblers export a certain
amount of automotive components before receiving an import permit for CKD
car parts. Castings are one of the important products available for such
exports and this is one of the reasons for the Italian, British and French
car manufacturers' interest in imparting caatings from Yugoslavia.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 15
Quality and Delivery Performance
49.       To ensure continuity and quality of supply, automotive manufac-
turers set strict standards. The major Western automotive manufacturers
give their supplying foundries quality ratings based on their adherence
to metallurgical quality specifications and delivery schedules. On this
basis, order sizes and prices are set. For instance, for foreign suppliers,
German car manufacturers allocate a maximum per foundry of between 20%
to 30% of their total requirements of specific types of castings. Prices
are set on the basis of competitive bids; and the quality ratings of a foun-
dry determines the price offered by the customer. Low-rated foundries are
unlikely to receive long-term orders; hence the need for a foundry to
establish good rating with its customers.
Domestic Prices
50.       FOB's average domestic price per ton for gray iron castings com-
pared to the average prices of its major export markets shows no significant
advantage (Table 5). However, for some selected items, FOB prices are about
35% lower than German prices and 40% lower than French prices. While, for
reasons discussed in para. 44, these prices are not strictly comparable, they
do indicate a sufficient price advantage for FOB to expand exports of some
gray iron castings.
51.       JOB's average domestic price for nodular iron castings has a
marginal price advantage when compared to the average price for a sample
of castings from Italy, but it is about 32% lower than the average price
in the- trman Federal Republic. Differences in the average piece weight
and intricacy make the comparison difficult, but, for some items, FOB shows
a clear price advantage.
Export Prices
52.       Table 6 shows that FOB's export prices per ton of both gray and
nodular castings are typically lower for sales to convertible markets than
for domestic sales. This is due in part to the need to compete with other
foreign suppliers.
I.   FOB's Marketing Organization
53.       On the domestic market, sales are made directly to customers.  In
addition to long-term contracts for supply to the UMI group, such agreements
are also entered into with the motor vehicle manufacturers, FAP-FAMOS and
ZCZ, and automotive component suppliers including Minel in Belgrade, Tvornica
Parnih Kotlova in Zagreb, and Ruen in Kocani.
54.       As for exports, FOB is taking steps to strengthen its direct sales
to customers by establishing regional offices in Western Europe instead of
depending entirely on export-import firms as in the past. However, such
firms are encouraged to bring in new orders and inquiries.

ANNEX 4-1
YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
PROPOSED FACILITIES
1.       The present expansion program is designed to increase the capacity
of the New Belgrade foundry and pattern shop. The capacity of the foundry
will be increased from 25,000 TPY to 90,000 TPY with the capacity of gray
iron castings rising from 20,000 TPY to 80,000 TPY and of nodular iron
castings from 5,000 TPY to 10,000 TPY. The capacity of the pattern shop
will be doubled. The existing foundry building will be extended to accom-
modate new equipment and machinery.
Major Objectives
2.       The main objective of the Company is to increase and consolidate
in one location its production of castings as well as patterns,    to improve
the quality of the products and to provide more space. The expansion project
is also designed to improve material handling and overall plant conditions,
including revamping of and alterations to some of the existing facilities.
3.       The project is designed to meet the changing needs of customers.
The Company plans to limit its product lines by concentrating on important
and ittricate castings which otherwise will not be produced in Yugoslavia.
Some simple castings, which are at present produced by the Company, will in
the future be produced in less sophisticated foundries in the country. The
plant design also provides flexibility for further expansion. The Company's
intention is to increase its New Belgrade foundry capacity ultimately to
120,000 TPY.
4.       Increase in capacity and improvement in pattern shop operations
aim at meeting all the pattern demnand in Yugoslavia, si"nce FOB s the only
specialized producer in the country. By changing the present layout and
material flow, replacing old and obsolete equipment, and installing more
accurate and productive machines, the capacity of the pattern shop will be
increased.
5.       In order to achieve these objectives, the following facilities will
be expanded under the expansion project:  the melting plant, molding shop,
sand preparation plant, core-making shop, cleaning shop, heat treatment shop,
stockyard and material handling facilities, pattern shop and utilities.
A. Melting Plants
6.       Plant 1:  In addition to the existing melting facilities, a new
battery of twTohot blast water-cooled cupolas (20 tons/hr each) will be
installed. A fully mechanized charge malce-up unit for this battery is also
planned. Cupola air blast will be preheated in a separate oil-fired air
preheater in order to reduce coke consumption and to reduce melting time. The
molten metal will be received in 20-ton oil-fired receivers (one for each
cupola) to homogenize the molten metal and to provide flexibility in molding
operations. This section also includes a water-recirculation system, a slag



ANNEX 4-1
Page 2
granulation system and measuring and regulating devices. Adequate provisions
will be included in the design of preheaters and receivers to change over
from oil firing to natural gas firing in the future. The cupolas will also
have provision for additional natural gas injection in the future.  This
plant will provide sufficient metal for the production of gray iron castings.
7.       Plant 2:  This existing "STRICO" melting plant with a melting
capacity of 10 tons/hr will be used for nodular iron as well as gray iron
productian in different shifts. The capacity of this plant will be increased
to 12 tons/hr by increasing the inner volume of the cupolas by reLining under
the expansion program. A new 25-ton channel-type induction holding receiver
will be installed for preheating and homogenizing nodular iron. The total
melting capacity of both melting plants would be about 52 tons/hr while the
average hourly liquid iron requirement is estimated at about 46 tons/hr.
8.       Molten M1tal Delivery System:  The molten iron delivery system will
consist of a combination of transfer cars and pouring ladles and transfer/
pouring ladles attached to different overhead monorail systems for each molding
line.
9.       For Molding Lines I and II, there will be one transfer ladle of 1 ton
capacity and two different monorail systems with three 200 kg pouring ladles
for each molding line. Molding Line II will also have a 2-ton electric holding
furnace with a semi-automatic pouring device. For Molding Line III, there
will be two 1-ton transfer/pouring ladles mounted on a closed circuit monorail
pouring system. For Molding Line IV, there will be two 500 kg transfer/pouring
ladles mounted on a closed circuit overhead monorail. For Molding Line V,
there will be two 1-ton transfer/pouring ladle mounted on a closed circuit
monorail. For Molding Line VI, there will be two 1-ton transfer/pouring ladles
mounted on a closed circuit monorail system.
B. Molding Shop
10.      After completion of the project, there will be siX separate molding
lines including the three existing ones. Description of each molding line
follows and a summary of their main characteristics is given in Appendix 1
of this annex.
11.      Molding Line I:  This is the existing Molding line I and no major
changes or modifiations are planned for this line. The capacity of this
line would be about 400 molds/hr.
12.      Molding line II:  This new Disamatic flaskless molding line for small
castings ill  aveacapacity of 300 molds/hr. Average weight of castings
will be 11.5 kg/mold and the flask size will be 500 x 400 x 300 mm.
13.      Mblding Line III:  This existing high pressure, moldmaster molding
line (Molding Line II/1) will be used for heavy nodular iron castings (79
kg/mold).  This line will have a capacity of 25 molds/hr, and its flask size
would be 1,100 x 820 x 400/400 mm.

14.      Mbldga    Line IV:  This is the existing Molding Line III. The
conveyor lime of this molding line will be modified and altered to suit
the expansion  of the existing building.  The line will produce nodular
iron as well as gray iron castings in different shifts. The capacity of
this line is 120 molds/hr with average casting weight of 47 kg/mold (gray
iron) and 19 kg/mold (nodular iron).  The flask size will be standardized
to 700 x 600 x 2/250 mm.
15.      Molding ine V: This new high-pressure line will be located in
the expand   aeote building and have two molding stations of 60-ton
pressing force, a conveyor line with 63 plates, a cooling tunnel and a
shake-out unmit. The molding capacity will be 250 molds/hr and the average
castings weight will be 28 kg/mold.
16.      Molding Line VI:  This new high-pressure/molding line will be
located in the expanded area of the building. It will consist of two
molding stations of 200-tons pressing force, a 140 m conveyor line with 66
plates, a cooling tunnel and a shake-out unit. The capacity of this line
will be 100 moldE/hr and will be used for very heavy castings (140 kg/nold).
17.      Castig Conveyor tEstem:  A system of 4 conveyor lines will be
utilized to transport castings from the shake-out areas of the molding lines
to the shot blasting and degating area in the second floor, 12 m above found-
dry floor. Ia general, small castings will be transported in buckets and
large castings on hooks. The two existing conveyor lines will be replaced
by two new lines (one for Molding Line V and one for Molding Line VI).
C. Sand Preparation Plant
18.      The three existing sand preparation plants serving the existing
Molding Line I, II and III will be used for the new MoldLng Line I-IV with
minor modifications and alterations.
3
19.      A new central sand preparation plant with a capacity of 400 m /hr
will be installed near the new melting plant. This plant will consist of
4 mixers (100 m3/hr each); automatic dosage devices for return sand, new
sand, bentonite and water; two sand cooling units (100 m3/hr each) for
cooling sand from 1200 to 500C; four polygonal sieves (100 m3/hr each) for
removing large particles from the sand; bins for storing return and new sand,
bentonite and coal dust; and belt conveyors for the transportation of new
and used sand. This plant will be automatically controlled.
D. Core-MakinL  Shop
20.      The existing core sand preparation plants and the core-making facili-
ties will be utilized even after expansion. A new core preparation plant
consisting of two  2.5-ton/hr mixers, storage bins, dosage devices for sand
and binders, and exhaust systems for both new and existing units will be
installed near the existing core sand preparation plants.
21.      A new core room will be installed in the area where the present
cleaning room is located. This will have hot box and shell core-making



ANNEX 4-1
Page 4
facilities.  After the expansion, the Company plans to produce 40% oil
cores, 20% C02 process cores, 20% hot box cores and 20% shell cores. This
core room will have 12 core blowers for shell cores, 17 core blowers for
hot box cores, overhead conveyors for core transport, automatic washing
equipment for cores, 2 horizontal core ovens for drying cores after washing,
and exhaust systeme for all core machines and washing stations.
22.      The existing conveyor line 'will be used for the old core room and
for Molding Iines I and II. With alterations and modifications, another
existing conveyor line will supply cores for Molding Line III and IV. Two
new conveyor systems will be installed for internal transport of cores in
the new core room and a new core supply conveyor for Molding Lines V and IV.
E. Cleaning Shop:
23.      The cleaning room will be relocated in the extension of the existing
building. In order for the present building to be extended, INT's implement
assembly plant will have to be relocated. Therefore, a delay in dismantling
the plant could delay FOB's project implementation, but this is considered
unlikely.
24.      The new cleaning room will have most of the existing cleaning machines
and the following additions: four oontinuous 5 tons/hr monorail shot blast
machines (two with maximum hook load of 300 kg and two with maximua hook load
of 200 kg), three 4 tons/hr drum-type shot blast machines, two 2 tons/hr table
shot blast machines, two automatic grinders (one with three wheels and the
other with one wheel) capable of handling 120 cylinder block castings/hr each,
four finishing lines (one for Zastava engines and the other three for large
and small castings respectively), 10 forklifts, 500 containers and necessary
jigs and fixtures. *Lth the installation of a new cleaning rooms the major
bottleneck of FOB will be removed.
F. Heat Treatment Plant
25.      In the new cleaning room area, in addition to the existing heat
treatment facilities, two new Duplex gas-fired annealing furnaces capable
of handling 44-48 tons/day at 950-10500C will be installed.
G. Stockyard and Material Handling Facilities
26.      These sections will be close to the melting shop.  In addition to
the existing four 8-ton bridge cranes (14 m range), for 5-ton bridge cranes
of 14 m range will be installed in the stockyard.  Bins for coke (40 m3) and
for limestone (10 m3), 6 silos for dry sand (10,000 m3) with a pneumatic
fitting installation, 3 silos for bentonite (100 m3) with a pneumatic trans-
portation eystem, and a covered stockyard for coal dust will be constructed.
Four forkli.fts will be added to cope with the increased volume of raw material
handling.

H. Pattern Shop
27.      For the time being the pattern shop will remain in its present
location and in the future it will be relocated near the foundry in the
FOB-IMT complex. There are four basic departments (wooden,plastic and
metal pattern departments, and an aluminum foundry) in this shop located
in two separate buildings. The facilities to be added to the above
departments are as follows:
28.      Woden Pattern Department:  This department prepares master wooden
patterns ror making final metal and plastic patterns and also for certain
type of castings made in small quantities. This department will be moved
from its present location to another building. The capacity of this
department will be increased by replacing some old machines, by relocating
other existing machines for better material flow, and by installing addi-
tional machines. The new machines to be added are one lathe., four planing
machines, four disc sanders, three bench saws and other necessary jigs,
fixtures and tools.
29.      Plastic Pattern Department:  This department makes plastic patterns
which are exact duplicates of master patterns for storage for use in the
future to make final patterns. It will remain in its present location, i.e.
in the same building as the wooden pattern department.  This department will
add the following machines: a synthetic resin preparation plant including
fume extraction systems, vibration tables, one grinding machine and supporting
facilities, No relocation of the existing machines is planned.
30.       _etal Pattern Department:  This department will completely occupy
the existing pa tern sthop arter expansion. A new layout, with some altera-
tions to this building, is planed to improve material flow as well as
working conditions. The following new maebines will be added: 10 copying
machines, 25 wmiversal milling machines, 4 band saws, 7 lathes, 5 precision
boring machines, 3 drilling machines, 4 planing machines, 1 precision drilling
machine, 3 grinding machines, 1 slotting macbine and supporting facilities.
31.      Aluninum Foundry: No alteration or addition is envisaged in the
project wih1   ecoThis foundry. This foundry will remain in its old
location next to the plastic pattern shop.
I. Utilities
32.      Electricity:  The existing transformer station, which is also used
by IMT, w-i=not have sufficient capacity to meet the both companies' increased
needs after project campletion. Therefore, it is necessary to install a new
transformer. The Company has reached an agreement with Electrodistribucija
of Belgrade for the supply of additional electricity as well as installation of
a main transformer station along with transmission lines. A new 110/10 KV
transformer in the FOB/IMP complex will be connected through a 3 km double-
circuit lO KV overhead transmission line to the New Belgrade city transformer.
Although the cost associated with this is expected to be shared equally between



ANNEX 4-1
Page 6
FOB, IMT; and the electric company, the cost estimates for the project
includes the entire cost of these items. This new transformer station will be
be used by both FOB and IMT. A 10 KV underground cable distribution
system will supply power to local transformers (10/0.4 KV) through a
closed circuit system. Major consuming areas in the foundry are the ventil-
ation system, dust collection system, induction furnace, compressors and
drives for molding and conveyor lines. Total annual consumption of electric
miergy after oompletion of the project would be about 64.5 million KWH, or
about 720 KWH per ton of castings.
33.      Gas:  The existing vaporizing station will be replaced by a new
vaporizing s*ation with a capacity of 900 kg/hr and a new distribution system
will also be installed. The total gas requirement after completion of the
project is estimated at 500 kg/hr. A major portion of the gas will be used
for core blowers and hot metal receivers   The Company plans to change in
the future from propane/butane gases to natural gas for heating these facili-
ties; this aspect will be taken into account in designing the vaporization
station.  This station will have three vaporizors (300 kg/hr), three 100 m3
storage tanks, gas inlet and outlet connections, necessary  regulators and
control and safety devices.  The NAFTAGAS Company, the natural gas supplier,
has agreed in principle to supply sufficient gas by 1976.
34.      Compressed Air:  A new air compressor station with a capacity of
680 cu meters/mIn will be erected near the foundry building. The existing
compressors (2,000 cu meters/min) will be relocated in the new station and
two new 240 cu meters/min compressors will be installed. Additional air
distribution lines as well as revamping of existing lines are planned under
the project. This compressor station will be used only for FOB's needs. A
water pumping station for re-circulation of *ater to cool compressors will
also be installed. As a result of the expansion, the total requirements of
compressed air will increase from 140 cu meters/min to 530 cu meters/min.
35.      Water: In addition to the existing wells, two new wells (each 18
cu meters7/h)will be established to increase the total industrial water supply
to 78 eu meters/hr. Total requirement of industrial water after completion
of the project would be about 770 cu meters/hr, of which about 85% would be
for cooling cupolas and air compressors. Considering a loss of 5%, the make-up
water requirement after expansion would be about 56 cu meters/hr. A deep
well pump will supply water to the water softening plant an4 from there it will
be pumped to the cooling towers. There will be seven 120 mW/hr forced-circu-
lation cooling towers. For drinking purposes, water from the New Belgrade
city water system will be used.
36.      Heating   The present system of heating will be changed by scrapping
the exist`all gIer plant and by using hot water from the central heating
plant, about 1 km from the foundcy. A pipeline system for circulating water
inside the plant through 40 air chambers, which will provide sufficient hot
air for heating production areas, will be installed. Heating of the office
buildings will be done by hot water from a central hot chamber unit.



ANNEX 4-.

37.      Dust Collection:  A new centralized dry dust collection system
vill be located near the foundry. This will be used for collecting dust
from the sand preparation plants, molding shop, core shop and cleaning
room. Another new dust collection system (wet type) primarily for cupolas
will also be installed.

YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
ECOLOGY
A. General Standards and Conditions in Yugoslavia
1.        According to the Yugoslav law on protection against air pollution,
it is obligatory for all manufacturing enterprises to obtain certification
from the provincial administrative body responsible for pollution control as
to whether the required conditions for protection against air pollution have
been met. According to the Company management, the Belgrade town authorities
are in full agreement with the current plant location and proposed facilities
dnder the expansion program.
2.        A new environment control law has recently been passed.  This law
stipulates that all new projects as well as the existing plants should conform
to certain minimum pollution standards by the end of 1973 and to all set
standards by 1977. A summary of the main conditions and standards, which
are still rather general, as set by the law is given below:
(a) Temperature:
Work Room           140C
Offices             20°C
(b) Permissible concentration of harmful matters:
Mineral dust with over 50% free SiO              175 particles/cm3
Dust over 70% free SiO               2             1 mg/m
Dust 10-70% free SiO 2                             2 mgim33
CO                   2                            50 cm3/m3 ppm
Co2                                            5,000 cm /   ppm
SO                                                 4 mg/m3
FeS 03                                       Max 15 mg/m
There is no clear classification of the nature of the work.
(c) Noise:
Permissible noise in production area            50-80 db
Permissible noise in office                     40-50 db
(d) Air Pollution - Plants are not permitted to release into the atmos-
phere air containing harmful matter above the following concentration:

The provincial administrative body in charge of health determines the
maximum permissible concentration depending on the type of industry,
location and climatic conditions.
B.   Pollution Control Devices in FOB New Belgrade Plant
3.        Pollution is an important issue in view of the location of FOB's
plant in New Belgrade. Although the existing facilities do not at present
meet the newly-passed Yugoslav pollution law, the Company is taking adequate
steps to improve them to satisfy the law. Originally, FOB had intended to
build a new plant on the outskirts of Belgrade. However, in the end it de-
cided against such move after carefully analyzing its economic implications
and practical difficulties. The relocation would have resulted in: (i) at
least a 50% increase in project cost; (ii) a delay in project implementation
due to the need for infrastructure development; (iii) an interruption of pro-
duction as a result of the transfer of the existing plant; (iv) a need for a
new boiler plant for heating purposes, which would have caused additional
pollution; and (v) higher casting transportation cost for IMT, FOB's most im-
portant customer. At the same time the Company realized that particular atten-
tion would have to be given to pollution control at the New Belgrade plant.
After studying the various factors involved, the Bank is satisfied with the
Company's decision to remain in its present location and expand. Furthermore,
the Company's plans for pollution control would be reviewed by the engineering
consulting firm (Atkins of London) hired by the Company.
4.        FOB's proposed project includes most modern pollution control equip-
ment, comparable to West European standards, for both the existing and expanded
facilities. Total cost of pollution and environmental control devices is es-
timated at Din 30 million, about 14% of the total cost of the new foundry
equipment and spares. Details of pollution control devices are as follows:
(i) Additional burning devices for effluent gases and dust collec-
tion systems (wet-type) will be installed for the existing cupolas. The new
cupolas will also have a dust collection system (wet-type) and a separate
burning system. Dust will be extracted from the exhaust from the existing as
well as the proposed cupolas by a centralized wet-type dust collection unit.
The estimated cost of these facilities is about Din 7 million;
(ii) A centralized dust collection system (dry-type) at an estimated
cost of Din 15 million will be installed adjacent to the main foundry building
to service the molding lines, sand preparation lines, core shop, cleaning room

and heat treatment plant. The central unit will be connected to the potential
fume and dust generating areas of these units through ducts. In addition to
the central dust collection unit, separate dust and fume collecting units will
be installed for the following facilities: sand preparation plant will have
an additional dust collection system; shot-blasting machines will have their
own local units; the heat treatment section will have a self-protecting device
within the chamber and a separate gas burning device and ventilation system
for gases coming out of these heaters; and the painting shop will have a sep-
arate ventilation system. Total cost of all these devices is estimated at
about Din 7 million; and
(iii) As no major pollution control device is required for the pat-
tern shop, the total cost of environmental control devices for the shop is
estimated to be at the low figure of about Din 1.0 million.
5.        Industrial water for cooling the cupolas and air compressors will
be supplied by tubewells and will be neutralized prior to circulation. Since
the water will not be discharged to the main sewage line, no water pollution
device is proposed under the project.
6.        The facilities proposed under the project are considered adequate
for proper environmental control of the existing as well as proposed facilities.

CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES
A.   Summary
1.        The capital cost estimates based on the technical studies under-
taken by the Company are summarized below:

2.        These estimates are based on the latest information available to
the Company as well as its past experience. These capital costs were
reviewed by the Bank on an item by item basis and are considered realistic.
Further details of these estimates are elaborated in the following sections.

4.        The cost per unit area (m2) for buildings varies depending upon
the type of building. For most of the plant buildings, unit cost is assumed
to be Din 2,000/m2, for the office building, Din 3,000/m2, and for secondary
buildings such as the garage, stores, etc., Din 1,500/m2. The average cost
per m2 for building construction would be about Din 2,000, compared with the
prevailing rate of about Din 1,500/m2 in Serbia. This is thought to provide
an adequate margin for the higher construction costs in the metropolitan
Belgrade area.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 3
5.        Three well-known Yugoslav firms have already submitted fixed
price quotations for construction work which are lower than the estimates.
However, in Yugoslavia fixed price contracts are not strictly adhered to,
because the contractor is able to increase his price if the Government allows
higher construction materials and labor costs. This being the case, the
cost estimates given in the above table are considered realistic.
C.   Equipment Cost (Item 2)
6.        For most of the equipment and machinery, FOB has received written
quotations from various suppliers in Denmark, Germany, Italy, the U.K. and
the U.S. Although the Company feels that under international competitive
bidding, the actual prices would be about 15% lower than those quoted, the
quoted prices have been used for cost estimates, since the equipment prices,
in dollar terms, have increased by about 20% in the last two years. The
Company has also received tenders from Yugoslav suppliers for items to be
procured locally. The following are the cost estimates for foreign as well
as local equipment (c.i.f., plant), including spare parts:

TOTAL                               118,348   181,343      299,691
7.        About 94% of the total equipment in value would be for the foundry
and the remaining 6% for the pattern shop.  Of the total Din 294 million
worth of equipment, about 38% will be procured locally.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 4
8.        Transportation cost estimates, which are based on the Company's
experience, are calculated separately for imported and local equipment. For
estimation purposes, it is assumed that the transportation cost from the
Yugoslav border to the plant would be about 2.1% of the equipment cost, includ-
ing 0.5% for insurance and 0.8% for handling and other charges. The same per-
centages have been used for domestic equipment transportation, insurance and
handling costs. Total transportation cost from the Yugoslav border to the
plant is estimated at about Din 3.81 million for foreign equipment and Din 2.27
million for domestic equipment. These estimates are considered realistic.
D.   Duty and Taxes (Item 3)
9.        Duty and taxes are based on the prevailing tariff rates, which
came into effect on February 26, 1973, for machines and equipment. The
present customs duty for foundry equipment varies from 15% to 19% of the
c.i.f. value (Yugoslav border) and for machine tools from 19-21%. In addi-
tion to customs duty, a total tax of 9% on the c.i.f. value (Yugoslav bor-
der) -- 3% import tax and 6% special tax - has to be paid for all imported
items. Total customs duty and other taxes for the project would be about
Din 59.1 million.
E.   Erection and Installation Costs (Item 4)
10.       Costs of erection and installation were separately estimated; the
erection cost estimates are based on the Company's previous experience -- about
10% of the total delivered equipment cost -- and is estimated to be about
Din 29.5 million. The installation cost estimates are as follows:
Din ('000)
Dust extraction and Other Equipment             13,492
Electric Motor Connections                       7,200
Overhead High Voltage Line                       1,950
10 KVX Underground Line                          6,000
1 KV Underground Line                            4,000
Total Installation Cost                    32,642
Total installation and erection costs, all of which are local currency
expenditures, add up to Din 62.1 million.
F.   Contingency (Item 5)
11.       To the total cost of equipment (including installation costs) and
civil construction, a 10% contingency for foreign as well as local costs has
been added to cover minor scope changes and possible omissions of equipment
and civil works. This contingency provision is considered adequate since the
preparation of the project is well advanced.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 5
G.   Price Escalation (Item 6)
12.       During the past two years, equipment (local as well as foreign)
and civil construction costs have been increasing at an annual rate of about
10%. In order to provide for future equipment and construction cost in-
creases, price escalation has been added to the project cost.  In view of
the steps being taken by the Federal Government of Yugoslavia, the domestic
inflation rate is expected to drop in the future. Assuming that the measures
taken to curb inflation will succeed, the following domestic inflation rates
have been assumed: 1973, 10%; 1974, 8%; and 6% per year thereafter. With
regard to foreign equipment, a 6% inflation rate per year has been assumed.
Based on these assumptions, total price escalation is estimated at Din 88.6
million (Din 58.5 million on domestic costs and Din 30.1 million on foreign
exchange costs) which is about 10% of total project cost.
H.   Flaskless Molding Line (Item 7)
13.       The Company plans to install this item as early as possible as it
is crucial to maintain the production level of the foundry, wghile some old
facilities are being dismantled. Therefore, the Company plans to place the
order in the fourth quarter of 1973 and it has requested the Belgrade Bank
to finance the foreign exchange as well as part of local costs required for
this facility.
14.       The costs associated with this molding line are as follows:
Local    Foreign    Total
-----(Din '000)------
1.  Civil Engineering                350        -         350
2.  Electric Power Deposit           400        -         400
3.  Equipment Cost                 4,446   7,114      11,560
4.  Transportation Cost              150       44         194
5.  Insurance                         55       35          90
6.  Duty and Taxes                 2,018        -       2,018
7.  Engineering                       -       370         370
8.  Erection and Installation    1,207        100       1,307
9.  Training                          -        60          60
10.  Contingencies                    151        -         151
Total                         8,777   7,723      16,500
15.       The entire foreign exchange required for these items is expected
to be financed by the Belgrade Bank and therefore, the proposed Bank loan
will cover the foreign exchange cost of all other equipment except this item.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 6
I.   Engineering (Item 8)
16.       The Company plans to appoint a technical consultant to assist the
Company in preparing tender specifications and evaluating international bids,
since it lacks experience in these fields. The estimated cost for this
service would be about Din 3.0 million in foreign exchange. The Company
also plans to appoint a local civil engineering firm to design all civil and
building construction required for the project. The cost for this engineer-
ing service is estimated to be about Din 6.0 million in local currency.
J.   Pre-operating and Start-up Expenses (Item 9)
17.       The estimate of this item is based on the Company's previous
experience. Of the total Din 15.8 million, about Din 4 million would be for
start-up expenses and this will be charged to operating expenses according
to Yugoslav law.

DETAIIS OF FINANCIAL PLAN
1. *The FOB financial plan given in this Annex shows individual
sources of local and foreign currency funds for fixed assets, current
assets, and interest during construction. This division of the project
cost into three categories is in keeping with the Yugoslav system of
earmarking funds separately for investn,ent in fixed and current assets.
Moreover, Yugoslav regulations require that start-up expenses and interest
during construction for a particular year be charged to the income state-
ment of that year.
2.            In addition to FOB's internal funds (net appropriation to
Business Fund plus depreciation) available for investment, IBRD, Belgrade
Bank and IMT are expected to provide six loans as shown below:

ANNEX 5-5
YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES
A. Introduction
The Bank loan of US$15 million is intended to finance the foreign
exchange cost (c.i.f., Yugoslav border) of equipment and spares (except flask-
less molding line) as well as the ex-factory cost of locally-manufactured
items in foreign bids, and 100% of foreign exchange cost of consultant services
acquired through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's guidelines. With respect to any equipment package costing more than
US$100,000, normal international bidding procedure will be followed, while
packages valued at less than US$100,000 would be procured after having obtained
at least four comparable bids from qualified suppliers in at least three Bank-
member countries (outside of Yugoslavia). For the purpose of bid comparisons,
a margin of preference of 15% or the actual customs duty on similar imported
components, whichever is less, will be given to Yugoslav  components in foreign
bids for four packages (the cupola plant, the sand preparation plant and two
molding lines) which are expected to cost about US$10 million. For the re-
maining Bank-financed equipment packages,no margin of preference will be accor-
ded to Yugoslav components in foreign bids.
B. Purpose
2.         Allocation of equipment into the Bank-financed and other packages
is done in such a way that all equipment and spares that could be procured
locally have been allocated to locally-procured packages, i.e. not Bank-finan-
ced. Moreover, the bidding and preference system adopted recognizes that
much of procurement for the project must necessarily comprise large packages
with single contractor responsibility -- i.e., the cupola plant, the sand
preparation plant and molding lines. Since no Yugoslav supplier could meet
prequalification criteria for such overall responsibility, Yugoslav manufac-
turers are not expected to bid directly for Bank-financed equipment. There-
fore, in order to optimize Yugoslav equipment supply capabilities in the
project, an incentive will be given to non-Yugoslav bidders by way of a 15%
margin of preference 1/ on the clearly identified Yugoslav component of
foreign bids for the four main packages mentioned above. For this purpose,
a component is defined as being of Yugoslav origin: (i) when supplied by a
company registered in Yugoslavia; and (ii) when the costs of local materials,
labor and services used in its manufacture are not less than 20% of the total
value of the component.  Should, despite expectations to the contrary, a
Yugoslav supplier be able to qualify for packages on the Bank list, he will
be accorded a 15% margin of preference 1/ on his bid when he can meet the
test under (ii) above.
C. Procurement :ocedure and Sapervision
3.         In order to enable the Bank and the Company to ensure proper
monitoring of procurement, bidders will be required to state the name of the
proposed equipment manufacturer and identify the source of components or sub-
assemblies along with the price of such items at the time of submitting the
tender. This is also in line with the requirements under Yugoslav procedures.
1/ Or the prevailing import duty in Yugoslavia, if lower than 15%.



ANNEX 5-5
Page 2
4.        In the case of the sub-suppliers, the bidder will submit with his
tender copies of each sub-supplier's proposal to provide components. These
proposals may be without price quotation if the sub-suuplier is in the same
country as the bidder, but will contain price quotations if the sub-supplier
and the bidder are from different countries. Sub-suppliers will be accepted
only from Bank member countries and Switzerland. The bidder will accept full
responsibility for the quality, performance and time of delivery of all com-
ponents, no matter whether they are of his own manufacture or of sub-suppliers'.
5.        Specifically when bids for the four main packages mentioned above
contain components or sub-assemblies that are proposed to be supplied in Yugo-
slavia, with the balance from foreign suppliers, each Yugoslav item will be
clearly identified and individually priced. The proportion of foreign to
Yugoslav supplies will depend on the type and characteristics of the equipment
and will vary from case to case. For purposes of bid evaluation and comparison;
the margin of preference will be applied to Yugoslav supplies only. In the
event of an order resulting from the bid, the proportion of foreign to Yugo-
slav supply will not differ substantially from the proportion shown in the
bid. To ensure that the bidder will maintain this proportion, the Company
will request the successful bidder to submit priced copies of its purchase
orders on Yugoslav or other sub-suppliers as the case may be, after the con-
tract is awarded but before it is put into effect. Moreover, in the Yugoslav
context, misuse of this provision of margin of preference is unlikely because
of difficulties in exchanging Dinars into other currencies without proper
docwfentation.

YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
RAW MATERIALS AND UTILITIES
1.        The production of castings requires a number of raw materials
including pig iron, steel scrap, ferrosilicon, ferromanganese, graphite,
coke, anthracite, bentonite, calcium carbide, silica sand,         resins,
refractories, etc. Most of the raw materials required by FOB are supplied
from local sources. However, the Company currently depends on imports
wholly for the supply of graphite, PVC resins and ferromanganese and partly
for the supply of pig iron and coke.
2.        Foundry pig iron is imported from the U.S.S.R. and coke from
Canada. However, by 1975, the pig iron and coke needs of all foundries in
Yugoslavia are expected to be met from domestic sources. To achieve self-
sufficiency in pig iron, three existing steel plants -- Zenica (Bosnia-
Herzegovina), Store (Slovenia) and Sisak (Croatia) -- are expanding their
production, while another existing steel plant -- Smodorevo (Serbia) --
plans to start producing foundry pig iron. As a result of these measures,
the annual foundry pig iron production is expected to increase from 180,000
tons to 300,000 tons.
3.        In the case of coke, the annual capacity of the only existing coke
plant (Lukavac) in Yugoslavia is expected to be raised to 1.4 million tons
by 1975-76. Besides, two new coke plants are expected to be set up within
the next three years: one would be at Baker, on the Adriatic Coast, with an
annual capacity of 800,000 tons; and the other at Zenica, in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, with an annual capacity of 1.4 million tons.
4.        With respect to graphite, PVC resins, and ferromanganese
FOB will continue to depend on imports. In the case of all other raw
materials, FOB's entire needs after expansion are expected to be met
locally. Moreover, no bottleneck is foreseen with regard to supply of
gas, water and electricity for project expansion.
5.        The following table compares the raw material and utility
requirements of FOB for 1973 and 1978, the first year of full production
after expansion, and specific main supply sources:

Note: Figures in parentheses indicate number of shifts.
2.        The Company plans to operate most of its existing facilities on a
three-shift basis up to the end of 1976 to meet its commitments. After the
completion of the project all the facilities will be operated on a two-shift
basis- The Company is fully aware of the operational difficulties, particu-
larly in plant maintenance, in operatina three shifts and is taking adequate
preventive maintenance to avoid such problems.
3.        The following types of castings will be produced by FOB:

4.        The Company plans to limit its product lines by concentrating on
important and complex castings and by discontinuing the production of simple
castings which can be produced by other foundries in the country. By limiting
the production to fewer products, thereby increasing the production runs and
decreasing set-up time and material losses, the Company will be better able to
standardize its operations. This, ccupled with the improvements in the opera-
tions that can reasonably be expected from the project,is expected to improve
the total yield (good castings as a percentage of metal charge) of the plant.
The total yields assumed for the projections, which are considered achievable,
are given below:
Total Yield (Good Castings as % of Metal Charge)

5.        Output figures as well as production costs have been calculated on
the basis that at full production, the foundries could operate at 75% of rated
capacity with the yields as shown above. These assumptions are in line with
the results achieved by FOB and the experience of similar plants elsewhere.
B. Principal Production Costs
6.        Major raw materials required for foundry operation are pig iron,
steel scrap, ferroalloys, coke, sand, limestone and resins. On the average,
the price of metallic materials is projected to increase annually by about
6% and that of coke by 4%. The price of raw materials, supplies and utilities
as a whole is projected to rise at an average annual rate of about 6%. The
consumption of major raw materials, based on the projected production volume,
would be as follows:

C. Comparisons of Direct Production Cost
10.       The following tab,le compares the direct production cost of
products of Kikinda and FOB :
Direct Production Cost of Gray & Nodular Iron
(Din/Ton)
1972         1973          1978
(Actual)
FOB            5,036        5,065         6,050
Kikinda        6,630        6,980         7,745
11.       The above table shows that direct cost per ton of nodular and gray
iron castings is about 30% lower in FOB than in Kikinda. This difference in
unit cost is primarily because gray iron, which is less expensive to produce,
represents about 90% of FOB's total production, whereas it represents only
about 10% of Kikinda's production. Moreover, FOB concentrates on the manu-
facture of large castings, while Kikinda specializes on the manufacture of
small castings of higher value per unit of weight. The average yield in a
foundry depends also on the size and complexity of castings produced. The
yield is higher in the case of large castings than in the case of small ones.
As a result, the direct production cost is lower per unit of casting weight
in FOB than in Kikinda.

V/ The accumulated amount of these values is included in the cash surplus at the end of each year.  The given cash surplus
is therefore higher than one would normally expect. This adjustment is based on the Yugoslav regulation that net
'working capital has entirely to be financed out of the accumulated appropriation to the Business Fund earmarked for
current assets and by credits equally earmarked.   The maximum possible appropriation to the Business Fund has been
made. Further details are given in Annex 7-4.

ANNEX 7-4

YUIGOSLAVIA: FOB FOTJNDRY PROJECT
RE'"ARKS ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.        Some important peculiarities of the Yugoslav accounting system
as well as relevant soecial regulations under which FOB has to invest and
onerate are exDlained here.
A. Income Statements
2.        The income statements as given in Annexes 7-1 and 7-5 show more
or less the accounts and presentation well-known to the Western analyst.
Several facts, however, must be known in order to understand these statements.
One important fact is that net income in the Western sense does not prevail in
Yugoslavia. Yugoslav enterprises have a distributable income which they call
"dobit" but the meaning of the distributable income is somewhat different from
the Wiestern interpretation, because Yugoslav enterprises have no share capital
holders; employees of the enterprise are themselves its owners.
3.        Under the workers' self-management svstem, personal incomes of
employees do not represent cost to the enterprise, but some sort of income
distribution, since the employees own the enterprise. Yugoslav enterprises
distinguish between gross and net personal income. Net nersonal income is
the monev paid out to the employee; gross personal income is net personal in-
come plus social welfare and insurance distribution, taxes, etc. which are
made by the enterprise on behalf of the employee.
4.        The net personal income is composed of a basic oeriodical payment,
some sort of advanced income distribution and, at the end of every fiscal
year, a so-called surplus or "visak" which the Workers' Council determines
within a certain limit and according to the financial results of the enter-
prise.
5.        Only after the Workers' Council determines this "surplus," net
income in the Western sense is determined to be distributed among three
accounts wlhich approximate ITequity" in the Western sense: the Reserve
Fund, the Business Fund, and the Collective Consumption Fund. However, prior
to anpronriations of this net income, some tax-like payments have to be made
out of it. 1/
1/ In the case of FOB, interest on these compulsory loans was not considered
under extraordinary income, because it is negligibly small. The repay-
ment of these loans has also been ignored but accumulated loans out of
the Business Fund are shon^  under long-term receivables, while loans out
of the Reserve Fund are accumulated in the account "Reserve Fund Assets"
together with cash.



ANNEX 7-4
Page 2
6.        Because the distribution of net income is of great importance for
project financing, Yugoslav regulations and FOB's general guidelines for dis-
tributions are described below.
7.        Annual approDriations to the Reserve Fund are obligatory and are
determined at about 2% of net sales less material cost and depreciation.
The distribution of the remaining part of "dobit' is to be determined by
the Workers' Council. It has to allocate a legally-prescribed minimum of
4% of 'gross personal income" to the Collective Consumption Fund.  In the case
of FOB, the Workers' Council agreed before approving the new expansion
project, to allocate out of "dobit," after deduction for the Reserve Fund
appropriation, 20% to the Collective Consumption Fund and 80% to the
Business Fund.
B. Balance Sheets
8.        In general, the Western analvst can understand the Yugoslav balance
sheet much easier than the income statement, but the former contains some
peculiar features. For example, the very first item under current assets,
Itcash and banks," shows one figure, but it represents three different kinds of
accolnts: (1) Dinars which can only be spent for current assets; (2) Dinars
whiclh can only be spent for fixed assets; and (3) Dinars which can be ex-
changed for convertible currency. Except for a very small cash amount which
enterprises keen as "petty cash" for current expenditures, the whole amount
under "cash and banks" is with the Social Accounting Service (SAS), a public
authority, which audits the annual financial statements of Yugoslav enterprises
by reviewing the arithmetic correctness of the statements, and serves as a
kind of clearing agency through which all periodical or extraordinary payments
of industrial enterprises have to be made.
9.        Loans and even the anpropriation to the Business Fund are earmarked
for "fixed assets" and "current assets." The earnings during one fiscal year
before distribution are only available for current asset financing. Business
Fund appropriations once earmarked for current assets, can be converted into
financing for fixed assets through the Yugoslav svstem of time deposits, some
sort of savings account, for at least one year. With this deposit, the enter-
prise earns the right of receiving after one year a credit at favorable condi-
tions for fixed asset financing. Terms and amotnt of such credits can be in-
fluenced by the enterprise's decision on how long the deposit will be left in
the savings account.
1(.       Further, three accounts are shown under a heading broadly meaning
equity and similar items. The Business Fund is the only liability account
which is strictly equity in the Western sense, since it consists of mainly
accumulated earnings. A certain portion of this Fund has to be lent on a
comDulsory basis to the Federal and other public authorities. No limitation
exists on the use of the rest of the Business Fund except that some portion



ANNEX 7-4
Page 3
of it is earmarked for fixed asset financing and some portion for current
asset financing of the enterprise concerned. The Reserve Fund under equity
has corresponding assets in the form of cash and compulsory loans to the pub-
lic authorities. In the past, Yugoslav enterprises were allowed to "borrow"
cash temporarilv from the Reserve Fund. In such cases, the values of Reserve
Fund assets and Reserve Fund liabilities were different. But now, the use of
this fund is restricted to the payment of obligations only when the enterprise
cannot otherwise pay because of illiquidity. Withdrawals from this fund which
is held and administered by SAS will be balanced subsequently with the first
payment SAS receives in favor of the enterprise.
12.       The Collective Consumption Fund with its corresponding account on
the asset side of the balance sheet can be a small balance sheet in itself.
The assets may be cash out of net income appropriation, out of loans the
enterprise receives in favor of this account, out of depreciation of fixed
assets like housing, vacation resorts, etc. for employees. The assets can
show receivables out of lending own or borrowed money to employees for
housing. In the past, social payments such as vacation and hot lunch subsidy
were paid out of this fund; now these benefits are included in the gross per-
sonal income.
13.       The projections assume that no further borrowing by FOB from the
Collective Consumption Fund will take place. However, before 1973, the enter-
prise was able to borrow cash temporarily from this fund. Now, however, the
only occasion when the enterprise can obtain access to the assets of this fund
is in the event of its own. liquidation. Thus the Reserve Fund and the Collec-
tive Consumption Fund cannot be called "equity" in an ordinary sense. However,
these funds along with the Business Fund are considered as equity in the
financial projections.
C. General Regulations for FOB Operation and Investment
14.       General regulations cover mainly the following:  (a) earning of
foreign currency; (b) financing of current assets; (c) investment deposit;
(d) electric power deposit; and (e) minimum share in project financing.
15.       Earning of Foreign Currency:. At present, clearing area currencies
can be obtained without limit from Banks against payment of Dinars. Converti-
ble currency funds, however, are to be earned by the enterprise particularly
for debt servicing and for import of equipment and sDares from Western coun-
tries. For the normal procurement of raw materials out of the convertible
currenev area, the enterprise is able to pay in Dinars while the Government
provides the equivalent in convertible currency.  The enterprise can earn hard
currency in two ways: (i) it can retain 20% of the export earnings from the
convertible area: and (ii) it has the right to exchange Dinars equivalent to
10% of its annual depreciation on fixed assets into convertible currency.

16.       Financing of Current Assets:  An increasing shortage of funds for
current asset financing and also very low cash accounts in enterprises have
led to Yugoslavia's new legislation on working capital introduced on January
1, 1973. The legislation requires the enterprise to finance at least 80% of
its inventory by 1975 and 100% from 1976 onwards through accumulated appro-
priations to the Business Fund (earmarked for current assets) or through med-
ium-term bank loans for at least five years. FOB's current asset financing
plan is shown in Annex 5-2.
17.       Electric Power Deposit:  The electric power deposit is a compulsory
long-term loan to the power supply authorities. With every disbursement for
fixed assets, 2% of the invoiced value is charged under this deposit on the
enterprise. The accumulated value of this deposit is shown under long-term
receivables in the balance sheet. During the mission to Yugoslavia, it was
confirmed that this power deposit is applicable for investments in Serbia
but not in Vojvodina, where the Kikinda foundry is located.
18.       Minimum Share in Project Financing:  To avoid excessive debt
burden, enterprises have to participate in the financing of fixed assets as
well as pre-operating, supervision and erection costs with their own funds
equal to at least 20% of proposed borrowing from local banks. (Details
of such participation by FOB are given in Annex 5-3).
19.       Wage Cost Increases:  In 1972, UMI/FOB entered into an agreement
with the Commune of Belgrade according to which wages of employees would
double between 1972 and 1978. In other words, the wages would increase at
an annual rate of 12.3% during this period. This rate of increase has
been assummed in the financial projections.
D. Basis for Calculating Working Capital Requirements
20.       The development of the net working capital between 1972 and 1978
shows that incremental net working capital amounts to about Din 60 million.
21.       The Yugoslav regulation on financing of inventory introduced in
January 1973 requires that 80% of the inventory value between 1973 and 1975
and 100% of this value from 1976 onwards be covered by only two sources:
accumulated appropriations to the Business Bund, earmarked for current
assets; and, whenever that is not sufficient, medium-term borrowing for at
least five years for current asset financing.
22.       In general, net working capital in Yugoslav is financed during
the fiscal year from net income for the year as well as accumulated net
appropriations to the Business Fund earmarked for current assets, and by
borrowings for the purpose. At the end of each fiscal year, however, net



ANNEX 7-4
Page 5
income for the year has to be distributed between the several funds under
"equity" and, therefore, at that time only the accumulated net appropriations
to the Business Fund as well as borrowings for current assets are available
to cover net working capital.
23.       Net working capital financing under this system requires higher
appropriations to the Business Fund than the regulation on inventory
financing. Additional borrowing of about Din 60 million would be required
for working capital between 1973 and 1977. During 1972-1978, the net
appropriations to the Business Fund will have to be increased by Din 58
million. Therefore, total financing required for working capital would be
Din 118 million.

1/  D = domestic;  CO = convertible area;  and CL = clearing area.
2/ As FOB produces a wide range of iron castings of different sizes and intricacies,
it is difficult to find strictly comparable products in other countries and hence
the determination of international prices is rather cumbersome.  Moreover, most
items of the type produced by FOB are not imported to Yugoslavia. Therefore, for
economic rate of return calculations, FOB's output has been valued at export
prices (c.i.f., Yugoslav border) of the Company as these prices are the best
approximations available to international prices.

YUGOSLAVIA: FOB FOUNDRY PROJECT
INDIRECT EMPLOY1'ENT GENERATION
1.        The FOB Iron Foundry supplies iron castings for about 20 major
enterorises, while using raw materials from over 15 companies. The proposed
expansion of FOB would have considerable impact on the production programs
of those 35 and odd Yugoslav enterprises, resulting in additional employment.
However, as this additional employment could also be created by using im-
ported castings instead of FOB castings, no attempt is made here to estimate
the downstream employment effect from the proposed project. However, it is
worth noting here that it is doubtful that the three most important FOB custo-
mers -  IMT, IMR and 3MB -- would be able to undertake expansion work on a
massive scale as currently envisaged without the proposed threefold expansion
of FOB. They would not be able to meet all their incremental casting needs
from imports at reasonable prices in the face of the continuing world shortage
of iron castings.
Upstream Employment Effect
2.        The latest data for incremental capital-output ratio (ICOR) and
incremental capital-labor ratio (ICLR) for industry in Yugoslavia are avail-
able only for the period 1962-1970, expressed at 1966 prices. Such data for
selected subsectors are given below:

3.        FOB uses a variety of raw materials and spares to produce iron
castings and patterns. However, the incremental production of the Company
is unlikely to stimulate the production expansion of all supplier industries.
But it is conceivable that firms producing items such as pig iron, steel
scrap, coke, anthracite, bentonite, refractories and quartz sand would expand
their production to meet the large-scale incremental needs of the project.
4.        It is estimated that the incremental requirement of FOB with
respect to the following main items would be:  pig iron, 6,090 tons; ferrous
scrap, 38,225 tons; coke, 13,135 tons; anthracite, 9,570 tons; bentonite,
11,075 tons; quartz sand, 103,725 tons; and refractories, 2,910 tons. It
is most likely that these requirements would be met entirely from domestic
sources considering the expansion program of various supplier industries.
Based on 1966 prices, the value of the above incremental raw material require-
ments for FOB expansion would be:

5.        Based on the employment coefficients for various subsectors given
in Table 1 and the incremental raw material needs as estimated in Table 2,
the incremental employment generation in the supplier industries because of
FOB expansion works out to 1,020 as shown in the following table:

Employment Effect on Transport Sector
6.        FOB expansion will also have some impact on employment in the
transport sector. It is estimated that the incremental traffic generated
directly by FOB expansion would be 55 million ton km, taking into account
the transportation of raw materials and spare parts, and finished products.
Assuming that one person is required for every 56,000 ton km of transporta-
tion, the incremental production by FOB would help create about 980 addi-
tional jobs in the transportation sector.
Total Job Creation
7.        Thus FOB expansion would result in about 2,000 jobs indirectly in
the supplier industries and transport sector alone, without taking into
account the jobs created in the user industries which are difficult to pin-
point. This estimate also excludes employment likely to be generated by
increased consumption of goods by those benefiting from the project.
Negative Effect
8.        Currently, a total of about 34,000 persons are employed in Yugoslav
iron foundries. Of them, less than 10% are engaged in the operation of 100
and odd small foundries with less than 500-ton annual capacity each. It is
conceivable that some small, inefficient foundries may be adversely affected
by FOB expansion. But it is difficult to foresee with any degree of cer-
tainty what effect this would have on the present employment in small foundries.
