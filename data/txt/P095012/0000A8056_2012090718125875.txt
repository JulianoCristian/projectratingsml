                         Project Development Objectives

                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objective of the Project is to assist the Tunisian Government in strengthening the key elements of sustainabilityof municipal solid waste management.
                         This objective will be achieved through the operationalization of a planning andimplementation system of solid waste management at the national and local levels and
                         through the rehabilitation of a number ofenvironmentally harmful dumpsites. These actions will enable the Tunisian Government to enter the emerging global market of
                         carboncredits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) introduced under the Kyoto Protocol.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         There has been significant progress in implementing the infrastructure component including the expansion of Greater Tunis landfillcapacity, the closure and/or rehabilitation of 5 major
                         open dumpsites, and the equipment of Greater Tunis and 5 regional landfillswith landfill gas recovery systems. As a result, the project contributed to steadily improve the safety and
                         environmentalperformance of the municipal solid waste (MSW) systems – specifically the disposal segment - across the country and benefiting morethan 50 percent of its urban
                         population.

                         The implementation of the institutional component showed slow progress, mainly due tosignificant delays in contracting consultancy services for the key institutional sub-component
                         (i.e. regional planning,inter-communality and cost optimization). The post revolution period of the project was characterized in addition by a totalabsence of high-level decision-making
                         which strongly impeded the implementation capacities of the implementation agency – ANGedtogether with the dissolution of the pre-revolution municipal and regional councils. Over
                         the course of 2011 and early 2012, theimplementing agency faced unprecedented social tensions combined with general staff strikes, and the impasse of the ANGedleadership have
                         all contributed to the significant slowdown in project implementation.

                         In a letter dated February 25, 2012, TheGovernment of Tunisia requested the Bank to extend the Loan’s closing date; revise the project components; update the resultsmonitoring
                         framework; revise the reallocations between disbursement categories; and modify the procurement thresholds. Overallthere are no major changes on project components that
                         substantiate a modification of the PDO, hence justifying a level 2restructuring. They would however require changes to the Loan agreement.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has been restructured in order to allow: (a) the project to complete the remaining infrastructure and institutional activities; (b) the adjustment of the institutional component
                         to take into consideration the post-revolution context at both a national and local level; and (c) to more accurately measure project progress and outcomes.
