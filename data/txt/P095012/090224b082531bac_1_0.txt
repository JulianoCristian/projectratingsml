                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objective of the Project is to assist the Tunisian Government in strengthening the key elements of sustainability of municipal solid waste management.
                         This objective will be achieved through the operationalization of a planning and implementation system of solid waste management at the national and local levels and
                         through the rehabilitation of a number of environmentally harmful dumpsites. These actions will enable the Tunisian Government to enter the emerging global market of
                         carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) introduced under the Kyoto Protocol.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Since the last supervision mission in November 2013, there was no major progress made in the implementation of the remaining project activities and the long procurement process
                         is still the main cause of delays.

                         Currently, the disbursements have reached Euro 15.09 million (89.8 % of the loan amount). Most of the infrastructure activities have been completed with the exception of

                         construction of LFG systems on Cells 4 and 5 at the Greater Tunis Landfill (Djebel Chekir) which are still under the procurement process. On the institutional component, the strategic
                         review of the sector/MSW programs and the preparation of a communications strategy are underway but are not expected to be completed during the life of the loan, i.e., by June 30,
                         2014. The reorganization of ANGed has been delayed due an unsuccessful procurement process. It will be rescheduled and fully funded through a counterpart budget. The final
                         design of the Geographic Information System has been completed and the system is now fully operational. Most activities identified to mitigate the social impacts of the project,
                         except the control of children's access to the Greater Tunis Landfill, have been implemented including a specific action plan to improve working conditions and the public health of
                         waste-pickers.

                         Overall, the project contributed to: (i) improving the safety and environmental performance of the municipal solid waste (MSW) systems â€“ specifically the disposal segment -
                         throughout the country and benefiting more than 60 percent of its urban population; and (ii) helping Tunisia access the international carbon market while improving its landfill carbon
                         footprint. However, the project and sector performances have been significantly impacted by the post-revolution political and social context, including the emerging not-in-my-
                         backyard syndrome and severe operational crises at several landfills.

                         In line with the above, the PDO and IP ratings have been downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since the last supervision mission in November 2013, there has been no major progress made in implementation of the remaining project activities. The slowness of decision-making
                         within the implementing agency and a long procurement process are still the main causes of delays. Given the approaching project closing date, complete implementation of
                         remaining activities during the course of the project is unlikely. The Government and Bank teams agreed to closing the project as scheduled on June 30, 2014, and to start exploring
                         opportunities for further partnership with a focus on MSW sector reform and institutional development. A specific action plan has been suggested to ensure proper project closing: (i)
                         accelerate the implementation of Cell 6 of Djebel Chekir Landfill and improve site operations in accordance with the Environmental Management and Landfill Operational Plans; (ii)
                         complete the strategic review of the MSW Program with the aim of producing by June 30 a policy note for decision-makers with a focus on recommendations for the reform and
                         institutional development of the sector in the short and medium terms; (iii) regularly monitor the implementation of agreed actions to continue improving the the social conditions of
                         waste pickers and prevent children from accessing the Greater Tunis Landfill; and (iv) finalize/close the expropriation case of the rehabilitated site of Ezzouhour Sousse.
