                         Project Development Objectives
                         Tunisia: Sustainable Municipal Solid Waste Management Project (P095012)
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
                         The development objective of the Project is to assist the Tunisian Government in strengthening the key elements of sustainability of municipal solid waste management.
                         This objective will be achieved through the operationalization of a planning and implementation system of solid waste management at the national and local levels and
                         through the rehabilitation of a number of environmentally harmful dumpsites. These actions will enable the Tunisian Government to enter the emerging global market of
                         carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) introduced under the Kyoto Protocol.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         Since the last supervision mission in April 2013, there was no major progress made in the implementation of the remaining project activities and the long procurement process is still
                         the main cause of delays .

                         Currently, the loan commitment and disbursement have reached reasonable level, respectively 96 % and 80%; thanks to progress made on the infrastructure component. Most of the

                         infrastructure activities have been completed with the exception of construction of LFG systems on Cell 4 and 5 at the Greater Tunis landfill (under preparation with possible
                         implementation with the project duration). On the institutional component, the signature of the consultancy services contract for the strategic review of the sector/MSW programs is
                         expected in Dec 2013. The procurement process for hiring consultants to support the reorganization of ANGed and the elaboration of a strategic communication plan are still
                         underway with possible signature of the related contracts in February 2014. The final design of the Geographic Information System has been completed and the system's operation
                         has been launched. And most of the activities identified to mitigate the social impacts of the projects have been implemented.

                         Overall, the project contributed to improve the safety and environmental performance of the municipal solid waste (MSW) systems â€“ specifically the disposal segment - across the
                         country and benefiting to more than 60 percent of its urban population.

                         In line with the above, the PDO and IP ratings are kept as Moderately Satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Since the last supervision mission in April 2013, there was no major progress made in the implementation of the remaining project activities and the long procurement process is still
                         the main cause of delays . Immediate actions are required to ensure implementation of the remaining activities during the course of the project: i) launch the review of the national
                         MSW program by end December 2013; ii) finalize the bidding document for the construction of LFG system in Cell no.4 and 4 at Greater Tunis landfill, and launch the related
                         procurement process without delays; and iii) regularly monitor the implementation of agreed actions to improve the social conditions of waste pickers and prevent access of children
                         at Greater Tunis landfill.
