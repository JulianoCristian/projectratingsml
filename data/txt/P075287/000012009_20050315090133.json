The Project aims\n            at ensuring that public resources are both available, and\n            effectively used to meet Lao PDR's development\n            outcomes. Three broad benefits can be identified: improved\n            public expenditure management performance; alignment of\n            public expenditures with pro-poor National Growth and\n            Poverty eradication Strategy (NGPES) goals; and, enhanced\n            environment for growth and revenue generation. While the\n            project also entails benefits such as policy prioritization\n            and donor coordination, predictability of funding and donor\n            support, and, budget support within macro stability, five\n            main risks could affect the impact of the proposed\n            operation: the authorities' uneven commitment to\n            reforms; a weak public financial management system leads to\n            a high fiduciary risk; provincial autonomy hinders\n            implementation of national Policies, and an equitable\n            distribution of resources; short-term fiscal\n            un-sustainability; and, severe capacity constraints in the\n            civil service. The project benefits outweigh its risks, and\n            furthermore, an explicit recognition by the Government of\n            weaknesses, will place Capacity Enhancement (CE) at the\n            center of the reform program. As a result, capacity is being\n            strengthened through reforms, and by the active engagement\n            of other donors."}, "docdt": "2005-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
