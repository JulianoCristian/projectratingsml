                   LAO PEOPLE'SDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
              POVERTY REDUCTIONSUPPORT OPERATIONI

                   CREDIT/GRANTAND PROGRAMSUMMARY

Borrower:    Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR)

Amount:      Credit of SDR3.O million (US$4.5 million equivalent) and Grant of SDR3.6
             million (US$ 5.5 million equivalent).

Terms:       For the Credit, standard IDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year grace
            period. For the Grant, standard IDA grant terms.

Description: Jointly prepared with the Government and in collaboration with other donors,
             the first Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSC-1) provides:

               1. an overarching framework for a programmatic three-year policy reform
                    program;
               2. performance indicators aligned with NGPES and CAS objectives.

            The series of PRSCs will assist Lao PDR to:

               a) make monitorable progress in realizing the objectives of the NGPES -
                    and reaching the MDGs - by strengthening management and impact of
                    public resources; and
               b) enhance the sustainability of its development efforts through the
                    promotion of economic growth.

Benefits:    PRSC-1 aims at ensuring that public resources are both available and
             effectively used to meet Lao PDR's development outcomes. Three broad
            benefits can be identified:


               0    First, improved PEM performance. PRSC-1 strengthens the Public
                    Expenditure Management (PEM) system that allocates, executes, and
                    monitors public expenditures, hence maximizing both efficiency and
                    transparency of existing public resources in pursuing the country's
                    development goals;


               0    Second, alignment of public expenditures with pro-poor NGPES goals.
                    PRSC-1 supports measures geared at redirecting the allocation of public
                    expenditures towards the provision of health, education, and basic
                    services that enable human development outcomes; and

                    Third, enhanced environment for growth and revenue generation.
                    PRSC-1 promotes sustainable growth, through an improved policy-
                    framework for private sector, trade, and natural resource management.

         The nature of the PRSC as Bank's financing instrument, entails three
         additional benefits:

               Fourth, policy prioritization and donor coordination. The proposed
               reform program will help Lao PDR and donors focus on measures with
               the greatest pay-offs in terms of poverty reduction;

           0   Fifth, Predictability of funding and donor support. The PRSCs will
               contribute to improvements in budget predictability, especially if other
               donors are to align their activities with the national budget cycle; and

           0   Sixth, budget support within macro stability. PRSC-1 underpins the
               Government's      objective    to  maintain a      sound macroeconomic
               environment and accelerate growth, while providing external resources
               for the execution of the 2005 budget.

Risks:   Five main risks could affect the impact of the proposedoperation:

           0   First, the authorities' uneven commitment to reforms in the past has
               resulted in poor policy implementation performance and unclear
               accountability between institutions and levels of administration. This
               risk is mitigated by: (i) the commitment to and growing momentum of a
               broad-based program of reforms in the past few years; (ii) the broad
               participation through which the NGPES was formulated, and the
               sustained involvement of the authorities in the design of the proposed
               operation; (iii) the policy dialogue fostered by the operation; and (iv)
               the commitment to world trade integration, with the joining of ASEAN
               and AFTA in 1998, the current implementation of the AFTA
               liberalization schedule, and the application for WTO accession;

           0   Second, a weak PFM system leads to a high fiduciary risk. The system
               i s characterized by poor coordination between planning and budgeting,
               lack of transparency, and weak central control during budget
               preparation and execution, all of which undermine efforts to enforce
               fiscal discipline and the policy alignment of spending. The inflow of
               revenues from the proposed Nam Theun 2 hydro project (NT2), which
               will lead to      increased resources for         poverty  reduction and
               environmental protection programs from 2009 onward, highlights the
               urgency of public expenditure management reform. This risk is
               mitigated by: (i) the commitment of the authorities to implement key
               recommendations of the PER and CFAA, and to carry out a public
               expenditure tracking survey and follow-up analytic work; (ii)
               satisfactory implementation of the measures supported by the Financial
               Management Adjustment Credit (MAC); (iii) the Government-
               prepared Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program
               (PEMSP - see Annex F.),and the Prime Minister's Office approval of
               two long-term technical assistance posts to support its implementation;
               and (iv) the commitment to develop a clear and transparent framework

                to ensure that NT2 revenues, in line with NGPES objectives, are
                allocated to poverty reduction and environmental programs that meet
                transparency standards;


              0 Third, provincial autonomy hinders imdementation of national Dolicies
                and an equitable distribution of resources. Provinces have authority
                over revenue collection and budget execution, and report sporadically to
                the central Government. Further, provincial treasuries often retain
                revenues intended for the central administration. As a result, provincial
                autonomy: (i)    exacerbates central-treasury cash constraints; and (ii)
                leads to wide variation between provinces in per capita expenditures on
                priority sectors. This risk is mitigated by: (i) the review of the
                decentralization process currently undertaken, with technical support
                from UNDP, by the Prime Minister's Office; and (ii) the Government's
                commitment to carry out the PFM reform program, which -
                underpinned by ongoing analytical work (see paragraph 87) - will
                mitigate present and future risks and foster dialogue on provincial PFM;


              0 Fourth, short-term fiscal unsustainability could result inthe diversion of
                PRSC funds (not earmarked) to cover losses from the budget, SCBs and
                SOEs. In particular, SCBs are still vulnerable to pressures to extend
                credits on a non-commercial basis. This risk is mitigated by: (i) the
                Government's explicit commitment to achieve budget sustainability in
                the ongoing Budget process; and (ii) the implementation of measures
                aiming at maintaining close oversight over Public Budget and SCBs'
                restructuring; and (iii) the finalization of the external audit of the state-
                ownedbanks' 2003 accounts; and


              0 Fifth, severe capacity constraints in the civil service, due to the lack of
                qualified personnel and low pay and incentives, leading to weak
                administrative ability. This risk is mitigated by: (i) an explicit
                recognition on the part of the Government of these weaknesses in the
                NGPES, by placing Capacity Enhancement (CE) at the center of its
                reform program. As a result, capacity i s being strengthened through
                reforms and by the active engagement of other donors; and (ii) the CAS
                will include an explicit focus on CE, and PRSC-1, in its Annex G.,
                highlights specific CE measures to strengthen implementation
                capabilities at the institutional level.

       MEMORANDUMAND RECOMMENDATIONOF THE PRESIDENT
            OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
                            TO THE EXECUTIVEDIRECTORS
                     ONA PROPOSEDCREDIT AND GRANT FORA
                FIRST POVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORT OPERATION
                 TO LAOPEOPLE'SDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC(PDR)


1.      Isubmit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed Credit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) inthe amount of SDR 3 million
(US$ 4.5 million equivalent) and a proposed Grant in the amount of SDR 3.6 million (US$5.5
million equivalent) to support a First Poverty Reduction Support operation. The proposed Credit
will be on standard IDA terms, for forty years including a ten- year graceperiod.

2.      It i s envisaged that the PRSC-1 would be part of a series of up to three successive annual
operations intended to support the implementation of the recently prepared National Growth and
Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES - the Borrower's designation for its Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper), which was approved by the Lao National Assembly in October 2003 and
discussed at the Board inNovember 2004.

3.      The NGPES was developed through extensive consultations at central as well as local
levels, with participation by civil society and the private sector. The NGPES builds on recent
reforms, establishes a framework for future, deeper developments, and makes Lao PDR's
development priorities explicit and transparent. These priorities take into account the multi-
dimensional nature of poverty alleviation, and are detailed inthe concrete actions proposed inthe
NGPES matrix.

4.      The proposed operation aims at sustaining the Public Financial Management reforms
supported under the Financial Management Adjustment Credit (FMAC), and further extends the
Association's assistance to (i)  social services that enable human development outcomes and (ii)
the promotion of sustainable economic growth. Subsequent operations in the series of PRSCs
would support measures to deepenthese reforms, in assistanceof NGPES implementation.

5.      The attached Program Document will be made available to the public after Board
approval of this credit and grant..

I.Introduction

1.      The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSC-1) for the Lao People's
Democratic Republic (PDR) for an aggregate of SDR6.6 million, consisting of a credit of
SDR3.0 million (equivalent to US$ 4.5 million), and a grant of SDR3.6 million (equivalent to
US$ 5.5 million) on standard International Development Association (IDA) terms, i s the first
of three single-tranche operations. PRSC-1 i s an integral part of the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), to support the implementation of the National Growth and
Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES - the Borrower's designation for its Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper), laid out by the Government - and approved by the National Assembly - in
2004.

2.      Jointly prepared with the Government and in collaboration with other donors, the
proposed Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSC-1) provides an overarching
framework for a three-year policy reform program, and establishes a series of performance
indicators aligned with NGPES and CAS objectives. The proposed series of PRSCs will

reaching the MDGs - by strengthening efficiency and transparency of the Public Financial
assist Lao PDR to make monitorable progress inrealizing the objectives of the NGPES - and

Management (PFM) systems, and enhancing the sustainability of its development efforts
through the promotion of economic growth.

3.      PRSC-1 underpins the Government's objective to maintain a sound macroeconomic
environment and accelerate growth, while providing external resources for the execution of
the 2005 budget. The policy reform program articulated in the PRSC focuses in a selective
fashion on three substantive areas of the NGPES (for details, see Section VII, page 15),
namely:

    a) deepening reforms in public expenditure management, financial sector, SOEs, and
        utilities (see the NGPES Chapter: "Mobilising and Allocating Resources -
        Reconciling Development Priorities with the Budgetary Resource Envelope");
    b) investing the social sectors to expand access and improve social sector outcomes (see
        the NGPES Chapter: "National Sector Plans to Promote Sustainable Growth and
        Poverty Eradication"); and
    c) fostering sustained growth through private sector and trade development, and
        resource management (see the NGPES Chapter: "Strengthening the Overall
        Environmentfor Sustainable Growth and Development").

11.Country Context

A. Socio-economicLandscape

4.      A landlockedcountry, Lao PDR extends over an area of 236,800 square km.In2004,
its population, considerably smaller than that of its neighbors, was estimated at 5.7 million,
with around 25 percent living in urban areas. Sharing borders with Thailand, Vietnam,
Southern China, Cambodia and Myanmar, Lao PDR lies in the center of the Mekong region.
Hence, the country could significantly benefit from the dynamism o f its sub-regional
economic context. In 2004, income per capita was about US$340, placing Lao PDR amongst
the poorest countries in the East Asia region. Nearly 77 percent of the population lives on
less than US$ 2 a day, and 33 percent i s estimated to live below the national poverty line of
US$1.5 a day. The performance of the country's social indicators i s among the worst in the
region, and close to the average for Sub-Saharan Africa.

5.      Agriculture, the largest sector of the economy, accounted for 48 percent of GDP in
2003 and employs over 80 percent of the labor force. Subsistence farming i s important, as 85
percent of the population relies on agriculture for their livelihoods. Rain-fed rice accounts for
75 percent of total crop production. Other crops include maize, coffee, sugarcane, tobacco
and peanuts. Industry (manufacturing, mining, utilities and construction) contributed 26
percent of the GDP in 2003. The dominant sectors include textiles and garment
manufacturing, food processing and low-technology assembling. Services contributed 26
percent of GDP in 2003. Wholesale and retail trade, the largest component of the services
sector, has been particularly buoyant over the past five years, as were hotel and restaurant
services. Traditionally benefiting from their proximity to the capital, Vientiane, the central
provinces are economically more dynamic than those in the south or the north, and have
attractedthe largest share of investment, including transport infrastructure.


B. Political Landscape

6.      Lao PDR i s a one-party state led by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP),
which i s headedby the Party's Central Committee. A restrictednumber of high-level officials
form the Politburo and are in charge of the decision-making process. Most Politburo
members are connected to the army (7 out of 10 are current or past military members). The
next Party Congress i s expected to be held in May 2006. In each province and district, party
committees support the local authorities in the implementation of the development plan at
each level, as defined inthe Constitution. Members of the National Assembly, responsible for
the legislative function, are chosen through direct elections. The regions operate semi-
autonomously with provincial governors having a high degree of autonomy over resources
and expenditures. Regions are also responsible for a wide range of government services and
center-local relations continue evolving.

7.      Civil society has a limited but slowly expanding role. International non-
Governmental organizations (NGOs) have been present in Lao PDR for some time. Several
international NGOs support knowledge sharing and networking with local civil society
groups and a few local independent associations have been formed recently, including
education support groups, economic and development support organizations and religious

                                               3


associations. Interest groups (Le.,    women, youth, labor, ethnic groups) are formally
representedby mass-based organizations (MBOs) linked to the Party. Social accountability i s
weak, but there i s potential for MBOs to represent constituents in bottom-up policy
formulation and decision-making. Although the local media i s owned fully by the state, there
i s open access to foreign media and the internet.


111.Progressinthe ReformProgram

8.      Although partial reforms were introduced during the late 1970s, the first phase of
reforms took place between 1986, the year in which the New Economic Mechanism (NEM)
was launched, and 1990. During this period, the Government initiated the transition from a
largely centrally planned economy to a market oriented system: central planning was
abandoned, prices and trade liberalized, exchange rates unified, Government trade monopoly
removed and the number of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) reducedby 75 percent.

9.      In 1991, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resultant loss of ODA created a
need for reforms and a re-orientation towards Asian and western markets to promote growth.
The Government continued structural reforms, including further pursuingbanking and SOE
reforms, but these were only partially implemented. Nevertheless, the reforms continued to
transform the structure of the Lao economy into one that i s primarily private-sector based,
where SOEs account for a relatively small share of the economy (1 percent of employment,
20 percent of manufacturing output, and 30 percent of bank credit, as of 2002), and where
exports and private investment account for a high share of the economic activity (17 percent
and 10 percent of GDP in 2003, respectively). The pace of structural reforms decelerated
during the 1997-2000 period, but picked up momentum during 2001-2004, as highlighted
below.


A. Snapshot of Main Structural Reforms: 2001-2004

10.      The authorities revived the implementation of structural reforms in 2001, to improve
public expenditure management (PEM) and the performance of SOEs, enhance transparency
and commercialization of state commercial banks (SCBs), revise tariffs and pricing policies,
implement financial and trade reforms and boost private sector development.

11.     Public Expenditure Policv and Management. Several actions have been taken, aiming
at improving PEM transparency, achieving a better balance between recurrent and capital
spending in the public procurement system. Key actions included: (i)   the regular publication
of the state budget in the Official Gazette by ministry,province, and service; (ii)
                                                                                 the adoption
of accounting regulations, primarily addressing commercial entities but also including
modest improvements in budget structure; (iii)     the establishment within the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) of the Procurement Monitoring Office (PRMO); (iv) the development and
application of a methodology to estimate recurrent costs for core construction projects in the
public investment program; and (v) the completion of a census of budget arrears as of the end
of September 2003, identifying type, level of Government, creditor and age of the arrear.

                                                4


12.     Reforms of State-owned Entemrises. In 2001, the Government revived the SOE
reform program initiated in the 1990s', with a view to: (a) improving transparency and
governance o f state enterprises, (b) restructuring those enterprises which have caused losses
to the state and banks, and (c) rationalizing the regulatory and pricing environment for
infrastructure SOEs through tariff reform. Good progress was made in late 2003 and early
2004 in preparing SOEs restructuring plans to return key loss-makers to commercial
viability, monitoring the performance of all SOEs, and identifying those for liquidationhale
or restructuring. Implementation of these restructuring plans needs now to be accelerated.

13.     Tariff & Pricing Policies for Infrastructure. Most of the infrastructure services inLao
PDR - electricity, water, telecommunications and aviation - are provided by SOEs, though
increasingly, private providers are entering into these services. The Government, cognizant of
the need to reduce budgetary subsidies to these services and to tap into the private financing
of investments, has moved to provide more appropriate tariffs and prices for such services. In
the last three years, key actions carried out by the authorities include: (i) changes in
                                                                                actual
tariffs and in tariff structures; and (ii)
                                        articulating guiding principles for setting of tariffs and
for changes in those tariffs. In particular, tariffs have been raised towards greater cost-
recovery and policies, and principles that would guide future tariffs and tariff changes (for
water, telecommunication and aviation) have been adopted.

14.     Financial Sector Reform. The restructuring of state banks, the improvement in
bankingregulation and supervision, and the opening up of the banking system were the main
aims of financial sector reforms initiated in 2001. State banks have consolidated further as
two smaller state commercial banks (SCBs) were merged. A framework to support better
governance in decision making, application of commercial principles in credit extension, and
private sector focus in strategies and operations by SCBs was agreed among concerned
parties. SCBs have been provided with temporary management support since the second
quarter of 2003, in the form of international banking advisors (IBAs) to assist in the
implementation of the restructuring program. Loan classification by SCBs has strengthened
as BOL increased its capacity to enforce the regulation. To improve access to financial
services, the Rural and Microfinance policy and action plan, was developed by BOL and
MOF, in consultations with key stakeholders, and approved by the PM Office.

15.     Trade Reform. The reform process accelerated after the country joined ASEAN and
AFTA in 1998 and started to implement the AFTA Common Effective Preferential Tariff
(CEPT). The liberalization schedule runs until 2008: Lao PDR expects to reduce its tariff on
imports from ASEAN countries to 0-20 percent by 2005 and 0-5 percent by 2008. The
highest current import tariff rate i s 40 percent (150 percent in 1995) and for most product
groups i s below 20 percent. Lao PDR signed a bilateral trade accord with the U S in 2003 and
the Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status was granted in November 2004. Lao PDR has
recently applied.for accession to the WTO and has been working on the preparatory stage.

16.     Private Sector Development. Today all agricultural production and most of
manufacturing production are in private hands. The 2005 World Bank Doing Business

' The importance of SOEs in terms of GDP and total employment share has constantly declined since the
early 1990s. However, around 10 large SOEs continue to generate a large share of the non-performing
loans (NPLs) in the state-owned banking system, which ultimately needs to be funded by Government
revenue.

                                                                         5


Review found that it takes 198 days and nine steps to set-up a business in Lao PDR. This i s
slow by both regional and global standards and a major concern: the proposed operation
devotes substantial attention to improving the business environment. Foreign investment
approvals (garments, wood processing, tourism, hydropower generation and more recently,
mining)increasedtenfoldbetween2001 (US $42 million) and 2003 (US $466 million).


B. Recent Economic Developments: 1998-2004

17.      Towards the end of the 1990s, Lao PDR suffered from an acute period of
macroeconomic instability. Although the Asian crisis was a contributing factor, the domestic
problems stemmed largely from a breakdown in fiscal management in 1997-98. The
Government, affected by a decline in exports and foreign investment, and anxious to protect
food security, launched a series of large investments in irrigation aimed at achieving rice self-
sufficiency. These investments, though well intentioned, were unplanned and pushed through
without judicious financing arrangements. The consequences were severe. Heavy borrowing
from the central bank resulted in a rapid expansion of liquidity that caused a collapse of the
kip, the local currency, and triple digit inflation(see Figure 1).

18.      The Government launched a successful stabilization program in late 1999 and 2000,
but significant structural weaknesses remained. Monetary and fiscal policies were tightened,
along the lines recommended by the IMF, and by 2001 the kip had stabilized and inflation

                                                   6


had been reduced to single digits. However, the fiscal position was fragile: budget revenues
were low and overly dependent on timber royalties, and recurrent spending, especially on
social programs and civil service wages, was highly compressed.

  19.    Between 2001 and 2004, real GDP growth averaged at a robust rate of 5.6 percent a
year. All sectors - agriculture, manufacturing, tourism as well as mining and hydropower -
grew during this period, with mining taking off for the first time. Export growth stagnated
during the 2000-2003 period, but jumped in 2004, driven mainly by garments, electricity,
mining and coffee,2 with most of it going to ASEAN countries and China. In the last three
years, the macroeconomic situation has improved. Headline inflation averaged 11percent a
year during the 2001-2004 period compared to an average of nearly 70 percent a year during
  1997-2000, although Lao PDR's track recordof maintaining single-digit inflation rates over a
long period remains weak. In 2002/03 when revenue from timber royalties and other non-tax
revenue fell by nearly 2 percent of GDP, overall fiscal deficit (after grants) increased (see
Figure 1). To counter, the Government implemented a successful fiscal adjustment (see
paragraph 21).


C.Macroeconomic Situation in 2004.

20.      Growth, inflation, and exchange rate. In 2004, real GDP grew at 6.0 percent, as a
result of higher private and public investment, a recovery in tourism (despite the outbreak of
bird flu and SARS), and robust export performance, fuelled by growth in China and
neighboring countries, faster world trade growth, and improved access to US markets. Private
- especially foreign - investment grew to nearly 10 percent of GDP While there was some
investment in tourism and garments, most of this increase came from foreign investment in
the mining sector, especially in copper and gold. The short-term macroeconomic situation i s
satisfactory, as end-of-period inflation rate reached single digits (8.6 percent) in December
2004.3In2004 the Kip fluctuated slightly against the U S Dollar and the Thai Baht but overall
remained stable.

21.      Fiscal stance. The preliminary fiscal outturn for 2003/04 indicates that the budget
deficit declined to 3.9 percent of GDP, almost 2 percentage points lower than in2002/03. The
latest data suggest that revenues performed relatively well: government efforts to mobilize
taxes - combined with full-year impact of petroleum taxes - increased tax revenue (excluding
timber royalties) from 8.1 percent of GDP in 2002/03 to 8.9 in 2003/04,4 highlighting a
significant additional tax-effort of 0.8 percent of GDP. This led to a marginal increase intotal
revenue of from 11.1 to 11.2 percent o f GDP, because of the simultaneous offsetting declines
in: (i) royalties collection; (ii)
        timber                              non-tax revenue; and (iii) tax revenue (due to
                                                                             import
AFTA tariff reductions). Expenditures fell by 1.8 percent of GDP, due mainly to lower
foreign financed capital expenditures, following the completion of a number of large projects.

~~




   In the same period imports grew, and consisted of machinery, equipment, and raw material for the
garment industry. Large discrepancies exist among estimates of exports and imports provided by different
agencies in Lao PDR. Discrepancies in Lao PDR export and import data were described in the World Bank
Economic Monitor (May 2004 issue).
   The Government's 2005 target i s single-digit inflation, but - if the Government were to resort to
borrowing from the domestic banking sector to finance the fiscal deficit - it might remain out of reach.
  IMF(2004), page9.

                                                  7


Domestic spending also contracted, as sharp cuts in the domestic capital budget, following
tight controls over new projects, more than offset higher current spending. The decline in
fiscal deficit helpedto keep its domestic financing low and contributed to lower inflation (see
paragraph 20). Pressure for increased spending will come from calls to increase the modest
salaries and benefits of public servants as well as non-wage recurrent expenditures.

22.     Structural constraints to sustainable revenue growth have begun to be addressed.
Although the revenue effort i s low relative to many of Lao PDR's neighbors, the difference
narrows markedly once revenue i s expressed as a share of non-agricultural GDP; then, Lao
PDR stands at 18 percent compared to Vietnam's 20 and Cambodia's 12. Nonetheless,
progress in achieving full revenue potential will be slow, due to inadequate technical capacity
of revenue administration and a highly decentralized revenue administration, in which
provinces have weak incentives to collect and remit revenue to the national budget. In early
2004, the Government took several corrective measures: re-establishing central control over
seven main international checkpoints, where revenue are deposited into central government
accounts; increasing control over major provincial large tax-payers units; modifying
regulations to provide greater central control over granting of tax exemptions to investors;
and frequent monitoring of provincial revenue collection and remittance to the national
budget. But more will need to be done.

23.     External Position. Lao PDR's external debt remains high. Public external debt has
continued to rise over the last couple of years, mainly as a result of concessional borrowing
from multilateral donors. Including Lao PDR's debt to Russia, the Net Present Value (NPV)
of public external debt stands at 220 percent of exportsU5The most recent debt sustainability
analysis (DSA), jointly carried out by IMF, WB, and ADB, finds Lao PDR's debt to be
manageable, provided there i s continued strong economic performance. Future borrowing
will need to be carefully managed to ensure that debt service flows remain manageable and
do not crowd out public service delivery, and that the burden of debt i s lowered over the
medium-term. Relatively brisk export growth combined with buoyant donor and foreign
direct investment inflows lifted external reserves to around $240 million by the end of 2004,
sufficient for reserve cover of around 4 months of imports.


IV. The Evolutionof PovertyinLaoPDR: 1993-2003

A. Poverty and Inequality

24.     Poverty levels. Lao PDR has the highest poverty in the region, with more than three
quarters of the population living on less than US$ 2-a-day. However, the evolution of the
incidence of poverty (headcount) between 1992/3 and 2002/3 shows a major decline in the
headcount ratio, from 46 to 33 percent. This i s an impressive achievement, which (if
continued) also means that Lao PDR could achieve the income-related MDG by 2015. The
decline in overall poverty i s attributable to substantial gains inrural areas. These findings are
corroborated by alternative methodologies implemented to assess poverty, such as the food


'The  NPV of public external debt is well in excess of the threshold for eligibility to debt relief under the
enhanced initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative), although the authorities have
emphasized that they do not intend to seek HIPC assistance.

                                                      8


share methods, and methods based on household asset scores.6 In spite of the progress,
poverty in Lao PDR remains among the highest in the region. Poverty in the uplands i s 43
percent, compared to only 28 percent in the lowlands. Poverty in the Government's
designated 47 priority districts i s twice as high as in the 70 non-priority districts. A vast
majority of the poor are ethnic minorities.

      Source: Lao PDR National Statistical Center

25.     Causes of poverty. The main causes of poverty include: (i)a legacy of physical
devastation during the Vietnam war, with unexploded ordnance still affecting half of the
country's territory; (ii)   weak public service delivery, especially in the health and education
sectors; (iii)  inadequate communication infrastructure; and (iv) shortcomings in the
management of public resources. Poor road access to markets, low productivity and
insufficient support services to farming especially in upland areas, lack of ownership of land
and livestock, limited access to credit and weak marketing chains are the main bottlenecks
facing the rural poor.

26.     Inequality. Compared to other Asian countries, inequality in Lao PDR traditionally
has been low. However, with economic growth disproportionately benefiting the non-poor,
the disparities widened during the 1990s. Between 1992/3 to 1997/8 the bottom 20 percent of
the population experienced a -0.3 growth rate inreal consumption, compared to a 4.2 percent
growth rate for the top quintile. By 1997/8, the bottom quintile of the population accounted
for 7.4 percent of total consumption, whereas the share of the top quintile amounted to 45.3
percent. The overall Gini coefficient over the same period increased from 0.31 to 0.35.
However, inequality trends have been reversed in recent years. Preliminary estimates from
the national household survey (2004) show that the Gini coefficient decreased by 0.2
percentage points between 1998 and 2003. This i s mainly attributable to rural consumption
rising faster than urban consumption.


B. Access to Basic Services

27.     Weak performance. Lao PDR i s the lowest ranking East Asian country on the UNDP
Human Development Scale (2003), where it places 131" out of a total of 148 countries. Despite
some improvements inthe last decade, most of Lao's social indicators fall well below the average
of low-income and East Asian countries. Most striking are the low life expectancy, low
percentage of children completing primary schooling, high child and maternal mortality rates, and


 Poverty varies across regions and provinces. The North i s the poorest region, with a poverty incidence of
53 percent; in the Southern and Central Regions the incidence of poverty i s 38 and 35 percent, respectively.
The depth and severity of poverty are also higher in the North.

                                                 9


very high rate of child malnutrition. The reasons behindthese poor social outcomes are multiple
and inter-related and cut across sectors. They include widespread poverty and high levels of
vulnerability, which render many basic services unaffordable to the poor; geographic isolation
and inadequate infrastructure which hinder physical access; language and cultural barriers; and
poor service quality due to low level of resources and low capacity of providers. Weaknesses in
the educational and health systems, and in basic service delivery systems, will continue to
hamper improvement in the social indicators, unless the main structural issues -low        and
inefficient use of resources; inadequate incentives for service delivery; low capacity of
service providers; and core issues of physical and financial access-   are addressed.

28.     Limited access. Unequal access to services remains a critical problem. While 85
percent of all villages report having a primary school, only 43 percent have a complete
primary school offering all five grades. Geographical coverage of health care i s also limited,
with about 38 percent of rural villages located at least 4 km from the nearest health center,
and, in the north, the average distance to the nearest hospital i s around 26 km. There are
fewer than 100 doctors per 100,000 people, one of the lowest ratios in East Asia. Access to
infrastructure i s limited, particularly in remote upland areas of the country. The climate and
terrain make transportation services costly to build and maintain over long distances that
connect relatively small numbers of people. Based on WDI data, the percentage of paved
roads in Lao PDR (15 percent) i s among the lowest in the region and i s considerably lower
than that of its neighbors Vietnam (25 percent) and Thailand (98 percent). But barriers are
not only physical and geographical: language and culture also represent an obstacle to access
for ethnic minority families, as very few teachers and health care workers speak minority
languages. And out-of-pocket costs for both schooling and health care can be significant for
poor households, rendering access to services unaffordable to many.

29.     Service sualitv i s poor. In education, inadequate textbooks and learning materials,
poor school maintenance, and limited teacher preparation contribute to low instruction
quality that in turn contributes to low completion rates. The quality of curative health care
remains low. District level hospitals are generally very small (5-30 beds), can only provide
basic treatment, and lack supplies and trained personnel.

30.     No recurrent spending, no impact. Public expenditures for service delivery are
inadequate and inappropriately allocated. Overall public expenditures on social services are
low by global and regional comparisons, while the cost of delivering services in the Lao
demographic and geographic context i s high. Public expenditure on education remains low at
11percent of the budget and 1.4 percent of GDP in 2001, and in real terms, expenditures
stand at only half their level in 1996. Public expenditure on health i s less than 1 percent of
GDP, and largely goes toward capital investment in facilities. Of particular concern i s the
allocation of public expenditures between fixed and recurrent costs. Wages for civil servants
responsible for delivering services remain low and subject to delayed payments.

V. Development and FinancialOutlooks

A. Medium-Term Outlook: 2005-2008

31.      Macroeconomic conditions are stable and Lao PDR has the potential to sustain robust
economic growth provided that progress i s made on structural reforms (for similar
considerations, see the IMFAssessment Letter - Annex E.; see also paragraph75).

32.      Growth Outlook. Economic growth i s projected to be strong, averaging 6.3 percent a
year over the next three years (see Table 2).7 Growth will be driven in large measure by
foreign investment inflows in the mining and hydropower sectors, as well as by growth in
mineral exports. Improvements in the macroeconomic situation and investment climate over
the last two years will also contribute to sustaining rates of domestic private investment and
growth in other exports. The latter i s likely to be supported by the projected strong regional
expansion and the newly-granted NTR by the United States, though garment exports will be
hurt by the expiry of the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) in 2005. Growth in agriculture is
critical to reducing poverty, as most poor households rely on subsistence agriculture (see
CEM, 2004).

33.      Investment and trade. The rising trend in private investment that Lao PDR has
experienced over the last two years i s expected to continue, reaching an average of around 12
percent of GDP, mainly due to higher foreign investments. During the next four years, the
dollar value of exports of good and services i s projected to rise by more than 50 percent,
driven by gold and copper exports, raising exports by two percentage points of GDP.
Implementation of AFTA and commitments under the United States Bilateral Trade
Agreement (USBTA) are expected to improve investor perceptions. Continued integration of
Lao PDR i s expected to drive further reforms, as, for example, ASEAN and GMS initiatives
(aimed at facilitating regional trade as well as trade of Lao PDR through neighbors'
seaports), and further liberalization of private business registration and investment
regulations. These reforms are needed by the private sector to exploit the new opportunities
for agricultural and manufactured exports resulting from increasing integration. Similarly,
infrastructure improvements, especially roads and rural electrification, as well as greater
openness to private investment in the telecommunications sector, will be instrumental in

 This i s in line with the medium-term IMF assessment as reported in its November 2004 Article IV
ConsultationReport.

                                                 11


sustaining regional exports and strong agricultural and manufacturing growth. Unless Lao
PDR ensures that implementation of other reforms and improvements in infrastructure
accompany increased integration with the region and the world, sustaining GDP growth rates
of 6-7 percent a year for the rest of the decade will be difficult.

34.     2004/05 Budget. Inflation in December 2004 was in single digits, but only continued
vigilance can maintain that over the medium-term. There are significant pressures for
increases in the civil service wages and given how low the wages are, these pressures are
legitimate. However, it i s essential to ensure that the annual increments in the total wage-bill
do not outpace the annual increments in revenue, so that fiscal sustainability i s assured. The
2004/05 budget, approved by the National Assembly in October 2004, sought larger increases
in salaries and allowances' than would be appropriate for fiscal sustainability; in the first
quarter of 2004/05, the revenue performance confirmed that the proposed increases in wage-
bill would have outpacedincreases inrevenue. The Government has thus revised the 2004/05
budget and i s committed to submitting the revisions to the National Assembly, at its next
session in late April 2005. These revisions limit the increases in wages to 20 percent and in
allowances to 30 percent with effect from July 1, 2005. The full-year impact of these
increases in 2005/06 are in line with likely increases in revenue. The overall fiscal deficit i s
expected to be contained at around 4 percent of GDP with domestic financing limited to a
very small amount.

35.     Revenue Collection. The Government has committed to continuing its efforts at
strengthening revenue collection and adopting new revenue-raising measures if necessary.
Recent efforts at improvingrevenue collection are expected to be enhanced by further actions
to centralize customs (including its formalization through a revised Customs Law) and tax
administration, greater focus on the large tax-payers as well as medium-sized ones, increased
attention to rationalizing and limiting exemptions for investors and timely preparations for
implementing the single-rate Value Added Tax (VAT) in2007.

36.     Risks.The base medium-term outlook i s not without downside risks. Thefirst relates
to risk of failure to sustain macroeconomic stability, and thus to maintain low inflation and
stable exchange rates. Economy-wide pressures for increases in the wage-bill, provincial
demands for expanding domestically-financed capital spending and the possibility of a
slowdown inrevenue reforms are key risks, which will have to be managedover the medium-
term. To mitigate these risks in the short-term, as mentioned above, the Government has:
adopted a five-year public expenditure management strengthening program (PEMSP - See
Annex F.), including a review of center-province fiscal relations; implemented initial actions
to centralize customs and tax administration; and revised the 2004/05 budget, reducing wage
increases to fiscally sustainable levels. The second risk arises from the absence of the IMF's
PRGF program and the resulting reduction in IMF monitoring and dialogue on
macroeconomic performance with the Government of Lao PDR. To mitigate this risk, the
World Bank will work closely with the IMF staff during this period. The third risk relates to
disruption in the planned inflow of mining and hydropower investments over the next 3-4
years. This risk i s probably low, given the strong commitment of high-level policymakers in
Lao PDR to these projects. The fourth risk relates to the slowdown in implementation of
other structural reforms and in improvements and investments in infrastructure, both critical

 Proposed increases in wages and allowances were to be effective inthe last quarter of this fiscal year (Le.,
July 2005) and thus has not yet been implemented.

                                                              12


for sustaining growth in agricultural and manufacturing sectors and their exports. Given the
history of reforms in Lao PDR, and the ambivalence that existed earlier in the top leadership
about the pace and content of reforms, this risk i s quite real. While such slowdown may not
affect the planned foreign investments, it would certainly weaken the broad-based nature of
the growth that Lao PDR has experienced in the past, and decelerate overall growth.


B. Millennium DevelopmentGoals

37.     Lao PDR also faces the challenge of meeting its MDGs by 2015. These include, for
example, halving the proportion of people living in poverty compared to 1990; achieving
universal primary education; promoting gender equality; reducing child mortality by two-
thirds compared to 1990; and ensuring environmental sustainability, including halving the
proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. Concerted efforts will be needed
ifLaoPDRistomakesignificantprogresstowardsrealizingits2020developmentvision.

38.     Achieving many of the MDGs by 2015 demands extraordinary efforts to reduce
poverty and improve the health and education status of the population. While there has been
improvement in some key social indicators since 1990,including under-5 mortality rates, life
expectancy, and literacy, other indicators have not improved. While Lao PDR might realize
the MDG for poverty, on current trends it will not achieve by 2015 the MDGs for universal
completion of primary school, maternal mortality, and child malnutrition (see Figure 2).

C.Budget and Financing Requirements

39.         Table 3 presents recent trends in the fiscal framework. Revenues, recurrent
expenditures and domestically financed capital expenditures stagnated during the period
FY2001 to FY2003, at levels significantly lower than those achieved in the mid-1990s in
nominal dollar terms. Preliminary outturns for FY2004 point to some improvement in
revenue performance, as well as increases in recurrent spending on personnel and goods and
services. This was accompanied by reductions in domestically financed capital expenditures,
as the Ministry of Finance shiftedresources to an under funded recurrent budget. The original
FY2005 budget sought to accelerate these trends, notably through substantial wage and
benefits increases in the second half of the year, to be financed in part through increases in
revenues and in part through further reductions in domestically financed capital expenditures.
Recently, GOL has revised the 2004/05 budget inline with the discussions with the Fundand
the Bank'; the mid-year budget update, to be finalized in April 2005, will entail more modest
adjustments in the structure of spending, notably through postponement of part of the
increase in wages and benefits. This will help ensure a sustainable fiscal framework for
FY2006, whilst providing scope for a continued shift in resources towards recurrent
spending, financed in large part by further improvements inrevenue performance.

Association the agreed revisions to the 2004/05 budget will be submitted to the next sessionof the National
Assembly. The letter also provides assurances that increases in the wage-bill will not outpace increases in
revenue over the medium-term, general revenue collection will be strengthened, and if necessary, new
revenue-raising measures will be adopted to ensure fiscal sustainability, macroeconomic stability and low
inflation.

40.      The proposed PRSC financing of US$10 million has been factored in to the
Government's FY2005 budget estimates, with similar levels of PRSC financing anticipated in
FY2006 and FY2007. Lao PDR benefits from modest budgetary support, amounting to
US$10 million in programmatic credits from ADB in FY2005 and further US$16 million
programmatic grant financing, from Japan's commodity assistance. The vast majority of Lao
PDR's external assistance is mobilized as project support. Recent years have seen a slight
reduction in external assistance, largely due to the completion of several large projects.
External financing i s expected to recover inFY2005 and FY2006, albeit at a slower pace than
the Government had originally anticipated. There i s growing recognition that a shift in
external financing towards budgetary support would be desirable, in view of the NGPES'
service delivery objectives and the current low levels of recurrent spending. External partners
are expected to follow progress in implementation of the first PRSC closely so as to assess
the feasibility of providing parallel financing to future operations.


VI. LaoPDRKey Development Challenges

41.      As analyzed in the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, 2004), Lao PDR's
development challenges include the following:

42.      ImprovedPFMperformance and alignment of resources with Dro-Door NGPES goals.
Only improved financial management and service delivery are likely to translate additional
growth and resources into adequate improvements in outcomes. Because growth alone i s not
enough to improve social outcomes, critical accountability relationships need to be
strengthened and supply-side improvements in key public services (education, health, and
infrastructure) are required.

43.      Enhanced growth and revenue generation. Poverty analyses in Lao highlight the
central role of agricultural growth in reducing poverty, and also identify off-farm
opportunities as a key determinant of higher rural household incomes. The analysis of social
outcomes points to the importance of household income as a driver of improved social
indicators. Since the overwhelming majority of lower income households remain engaged in
agriculture, the scope for increasing household incomes will therefore continue to depend
critically upon how the agricultural sector performs.

44.      Manufacturing and services will have to play a central role in generating the long-
term growth and employment required by Lao PDR. However, the huge preponderance of
tiny firms and absence of medium-sized firms suggest that there are significant constraints
preventing firms from growing, which will place limitson employment and export growth.

45.      Natural resources, Lao PDR's major potential, are not a "magic bullet". Their direct
contribution to long-termGDP growth i s limited, and their contribution to public revenues-
while substantial-is   not so overwhelmingly large as to preclude additional effort in revenue
and expenditure management. If these revenues are poorly managed, then the development
potential of these sectors will be foregone.

VII. Government Response to Development Challenges

46.      The aspiration o f the Lao PDR Govemment i s to be able to allocate increasing
amounts of public resources towards the improvement of social outcomes. The Government
of Lao PDR aims to achieve rapid economic growth in order to improve the living conditions
of its poor population . It i s committed to halving poverty by 2015 and graduating from its
status of least-developed country by 2020. The development strategy to achieve these goals
has been articulated in the National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2001-05 - NSEDP),
the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and the recently prepared NGPES.
The NGPES, which enjoys full Government ownership, was developed in a participatory
manner and based on an unprecedented level of consultation and participation at central as
well as local levels. The main steps in the elaboration of the NGPES are reviewedinBox 1.

Box 1.Main Steps inthe Elaborationof the PRSPfor Lao PDR

 I-PRSP. In April 2001, the Government of the Lao PDR submitted an Interim-Poverty Reduction
 Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) to the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF." In the I-PRSP, the country's
 poverty reduction strategy was integrated with the Government's overall national objectives and
 socioeconomic development plans. The paper set out the Government's approach to poverty reduction
 and was a first step towards developing a full PRSP.

 Buildingon I-PRSP: the NGPES. The Lao PRSP, called the NGPES - based on the five-year National
 Socio-Economic Development Plan - i s a single document developed through a participatory process and
 embodying full ownership of the Government. The process of preparing the NGPES was led by the
 Government. The NGPES Committee formed to oversee the process drew membership from key
 ministries and agencies, and representatives from several mass organizations. The Government
 implemented a Participation Action Plan supported by the UNDP and other donors during the NGPES
 process.The consultative process was broadened to increase participation by civil society and the private
 sector. In addition to consultations with official mass organizations, such as the Lao Women's Union,
 discussions were held with the private sector, academics, and provincial representatives.

 NPEP becomes NGPES. The first draft of the document - then called National Poverty Eradication Plan
 (NPEP), was officially presented to the international community in a Mini-Round Table Meeting (Mini
 RTM) in May 2003. InAugust 2003, the Government issued the final draft o f the document, which was
 officially presented to the international community in a Round Table Meeting on September 4-5. The
 NPEP was reviewed and upgraded to become the NGPES, and was approved by the National Assembly
 in February 2004. It was transmitted to the World Bank and IMFin September 2004. The World Bank
 together with other donors - UNDP, IMF,Japan, and Sweden - have provided support to help raise the
 quality of the NGPESPRSP, while ensuring that the Government remained inthe driver's seat with clear
 ownership. The NGPES, and related Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN), was discussed by the Board in
 December 2004.

 NGPESPRSP role. The NGPESPRSP process plays an important role in articulating the overall
 development framework for the Lao PDR and i s instrumental for the successful implementation of the
 PRSC program and NT2. The NGPESPRSP i s linked - incontent as well as timing - with aspects of key
 development assistance programs including the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF),
 the UN Development Assistance Framework, the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the
 recently completed Financial Management Adjustment Credit (FMAC), and follow-on Poverty
 ReductionSuuuort Credits (PRSCsI - all o f which are also linked to NT2.



loThe I-PRSP was approved by the Government on March 20, 2001 and discussed by the IMF and IDA
Boards on April 23 and 24, 2001, respectively.

                                                16



47.      Obiectives of the NGPES. The NGPES establishes a framework for future, deeper
reforms and makes Government development priorities more explicit and transparent. These
priorities are consistent with the multi-dimensional nature of poverty alleviation, and the
action matrix set out in the NGPES i s generally consistent with these pillars.This strategy, in
particular, seeks to:


    0    Maintain macroeconomic stability by increasing revenue and ensuring appropriate
         fiscal and monetary policy;
    0    Deepen structural reforms in the following areas: public expenditure management,
         financial sector, SOEs, private sector, trade, and development of the legal system;
    0    Invest in the social sectors to expand access and improve social sector outcomes;
    0    Invest in infrastructure such as roads, power, and water supply, and expand access to
         these services;
    0    Invest in rural development and natural resource management-including       support for
         agricultural, mining,forestry and hydropower development; and
    0    Strengthen capacity.

48.     Implementation of the NGPES. As of March 2005, the Government i s preparing the
local authorities for NGPES implementation. To begin the process, ten pilot districts have
been selected. Subsequently, the implementation will be extended to the 47 priority districts.
Also, the Government has allocated - from its investment budget - 25 billion Kips (US$ 2.5
million approximately) to NGPES activities, and i s now in the process of transferring these
resources to districts. The NGPES committee, the cross-institutional working-group that
coordinated the NGPES process, i s to evolve in a "NGPES implementation task force", co-
hosted by CPI and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).

49.     Along with the MOF, BOL, MOFA, and CPI, the NSC will be part of the
implementation, providing indicators at the district, provincial, and central level for
Monitoring and Evaluation. Village Development Funds are providing cash (500,000 million
Kip, approximately US $50,000) to community based revolving funds, for NGPES
realization. The Government i s working on preparing expenditure programs for the main
NGPES components. A CE Strategy - supported by the World Bank and UNDP - has been
approved by the Government in June 2004, and the first workshop (attended by
approximately 150 participants representing all provinces) was held on October 20-22, 2004.
The next Five Year Plan for 2006-2010, now inpreparation, will incorporate andbuildon the
policies outlined inthe NGPES.

VIII. Bank's Supportto the GovernmentStrategy

A. Rationalefor the Operation

50.      The programmatic PRSCs are designed to support, over several years, the
implementation of a broad-based program of reforms. The Government commitment has
been articulated in the ambitious NGPES agenda and has been demonstrated in recent years
by the introduction of phased reforms in several sectors of the economy (as detailed in
Section I11 above). The recent momentum in reforms, the decade and half long strong
performance in terms of growth and poverty reduction, the potential for more internal
coherence in addressing cross-sector issues and the scope for donor consensus and alignment
on such issues make the PRSC a good and useful lending instrument to support Lao PDR.

51.      Good recent performance. Lao PDR has made significant progress in achieving
growth and macroeconomic stability since the late 1990s (as described above in Paragraph
17), and reducing the incidence of poverty (by 13 percentage points in 11years, as observed
above in Paragraph 24). Few low-income countries have had such growth and poverty-
reduction performance for the last decade and half. The 2003 CPIA exercise identified
several cross-sectoral policy and institutional areas where Lao PDR was weak, including
environmental management, human resources, financial sector management, and public
financial management. The 2004 CPIA showed a slight improvement, but overall weaknesses
remain.

52.      Growing momentum and commitment. The satisfactory completion of prior actions
and all seventeen second-tranche actions under the Bank's FMAC operation, and the
adoption of PRSC-1 prior actions (see Paragraph 174) are evidence of rising momentum and
have contributed to reducing fiduciary risk, establishing a positive track record. Nevertheless,
implementation of these actions took longer than was originally envisaged, and the potential
for future slippages remain.

53.      Cross-sectoral policv dialogue. PRSCs provide a vehicle for dialogue and cross-
sectoral, programmatic support that addresses multiple reform fronts - including better public
expenditure management, service delivery, and mobilizing and aligning resources with
development goals. This i s precisely what i s needed,in Lao PDR. As articulated in the CEM
and other analytical work, such a cross-sectoral approach i s required in order for Lao PDR to
sustain its relatively strong, decade-long performance in growth and poverty reduction, and to
translate this progress into improved social indicators.

54.      Reforms essential to elude the "natural resource curse". Cross-sectoral policy reforms
are critical if Lao i s to avoid the "natural resource curse" and ensure that resources generated
by hydro, mining, and forestry projects, including the proposed NT2 project, ultimately
contribute to poverty reduction and human development goals.

55.      Help donor alignment. The PRSCs will provide a framework for coordination with
other development partners on policy priorities and help mobilize the support needed for
implementation of the Government's program. The donor community has recently
established an Economic Sector Working Group, which provided a forum for coordination.
The Government encouraged participation of interested donors - including Japan and the

                                                  18


European Union - in the preparation of the multi-year reform program to supported by the
PRSC.

56.      "Sequencinf    i s set in the trimers. Logically, policy implementation i s subsequent to:
(i)diagnostic of key knowledge gaps; and (ii)        consensus building with the Government and
development partners. Strengthening the management of public resources - the area where
most AAA has been carried out - i s at the core of Lao PRSCs. Over the long run, once
relevant analytical work has been completed and agreed upon (for details, see page 24), the
scope of the PRSCs will expand to the development of social sectors and to the fostering of
sustained growth. The initial series of PRSCs, triggered b y PRSC-1, starts that above
mentioned process (see Figure 3). The sequencing of the 3-year PRSC program i s clearly set
in its prior actions and triggers: PEM lies at the core of the operation; as it has been the
practice in other PRSCs, the scope of the operation gradually expands.

57.      A flexible approach. As triggers only constitute expected prior actions and are not
equivalent to legal conditions, the operation's design affords sufficient flexibility to evaluate
progress, and - if the need be - to adjust to developments on the ground. At the same time,
should progress fall short, the World Bank would be able to suspend subsequent PRSCs or
cut their amount, as appropriate.

58.      Capacity enhancement. Last but not least, as the Government's limited capacity i s of
concern, a strategy to build capacity over time accompanies PRSCs (see Annex F.).
Institutional, organizational, and individual capacities are major constraints to achieving
development outcomes in Lao PDR and efforts by the Bank and other donors to build
capacity have had limited impact due to the lack of a systematic approach. In Lao PDR,

                                                      19


 PRSCs will contribute to a broad-based approach to capacity enhancement, linking policy
 and institutionalreforms with project-based lendingand technical assistance.
                           Box 2. The Lao PRSC Operationalapproach
                                                      -
 A metaphor: leaking pipes hamper development objectives. The PRSCs story-line can be explained
 through a metaphor (see Figure 4). Public sector resources (more than 18 percent of GDP i s spent by the
 Government) leak through "holes in the pipes" due to poor public expenditure management, loss-making
 state-owned enterprises, bailed-out state-owned banks, and subsidized utilities tariffs. Such leakages
 impede efficient use of scarce public resources and debilitate Lao PDR's chances to graduate from its status
 of least-developed country by 2020.

 1. Public Resource Management(Fix the Pipes). The first PRSC component aims at ensuring eficient
 management ofpublic sector resources, or 'yxing thepipes". This objective will be achieved by continuing
 to strengthen public expenditure management, i.e.:, allocating, executing, and monitoring public
 expenditures, including at the provincial level; strengthen financial discipline and restructuring of state-
 owned banks and enterprises; reform utilities. Thus, the program of actions supported by the operations will
 maximize the effectiveness of available public resources in pursuing the country's development goals.

 2. Public Expenditure Policies (Re-direct the Pipes). The 2020 graduation objective cannot be achieved
 without an adequate focus on social development objectives. The next step is therefore "redirecting the
 pipes" towards increasing the poverty reduction impact of public spending. The second PRSC component
 supports measures geared at aligning the allocation of public expenditures with pro-poor NGPES goals, by
 redirecting public resources towards enhancing access and quality of basic education and health services,
 improving roads, water supply and sanitation services for the poor.

 3. SustainedGrowth (Increase Resource Flows). Third, an increase in available resources is necessaryto
 achieve NGPES objectives. The third PRSC component aims at promoting sustained growth through a
 stronger private sector; greater trade volume; and sustainable management of natural resources. This
 objective i s to be achieved by removing public sector obstacles and creating a competitive business
 environment for private sector development, by accelerating integration into a global and regional
 community, and improving the Government's capacity to effectively manage the revenues from natural
 resources.

B. Link to NGPES and CAS.

59.      The new CAS seeks to sustain the development progress that the Government has
made in recent years by selectively targeting key NGPES outcomes while using an approach
that maximizes the effectiveness of scarce Bank resources. Substantively, the first two
objectives of the CAS target key NGPES priorities: (i)  Sustain growth through linkingto and
capitalizing on regional opportunities and better natural resource management; (ii)  Improve
social outcomes through strengthening financial management and service delivery capacity.

60.      In targeting these substantive objectives, the Bank will use a refined approach that
builds on lessons learned to enhance effectiveness. The third and fourth CAS objectives
outline the approach and a key instrumentthat the Bank will use to support these substantive
priorities: (iii)Strengthen management capacities, partnerships, and monitoring for NGPES
implementation, and (iv) Implement the NT2 program as a model for supporting sustainable
growth, improving social outcomes, and buildingkey development capacities.

61.      The series of PRSCs are an integral and cross-cutting component of the Bank's
revised strategy to support the NGPES. Substantively, the PRSCs will support key policy and
institutional reforms targeting the NGPES outcomes.

62.      A primary focus of the PRSCs will be to support critical public sector reforms
targeted under CAS objective 2 - including reforms to "fix the pipes" (strengthen the
accountability and efficiency of public expenditure management, reforms in banking and
SOEs) and to "redirect the pipes" (improve the allocation of public resources toward pro-
poor development priorities). The PRSCs will also support key elements of CAS objective 1
- sustaining growth - by enhancing "resource generation" through a strengthened legal,
regulatory, and institutional framework for regional integration, private sector development,
and management of natural resources.

63.      The PRSCs are also a central instrument for implementing the Bank approach
articulated in CAS objectives 3 and 4. Indeed, PRSCs will be used to build agreement on
priority capacity constraints and policy and institutional interventions necessary to improve
the enabling environment for capacity building. They will also be a key means to implement
a revised Bank approach in Lao - to facilitate shared analytical work and sustained dialogue
around a cross-sectoral policy and institutional reform agenda and to build partnerships with
Government and other partners.


C.Links to Other Bank's Operations.

64.      Links to ongoing and future IDA operations. The proposed PRSC is envisaged to
play a strong role in complementing operations in other sectors, as envisaged in the CAS. B y
supporting increased budget allocations for health and education, better expenditure and
financial management, and more timely payment of salaries to social sector workers, the
PRSC assists the objectives of the Health Services Improvement and Second Education
Development projects. The PRSC supports the sustainable development of infrastructure and
forest management, thus complementing the existing investment operations. On the other
hand, implementation of NGPES and PRSC objectives are supported by technical assistance

                                                     21


through other ongoing projects, such as the Financial Management Capacity Building
operation.

65.      Relationship to NT2. By strengthening public expenditure management, PRSCs also
support effective use for poverty reduction and development of public resources from NT2
(see Box 3) and other natural resource projects.


Box 3. The proposed NamTheun 2 hydro project (NT2):a driver of change

The Project ...The   NT2 hydropower project i s a US$1.2 billion, 1070 megawatt, private-sector project in
which the Government of Lao PDR has a 25 percent shareholding. IDA i s supporting it through a Partial
RiskGuarantee of US$50 million and a US$20 million grant, the latter to support social and environmental
mitigation activities. MIGA will provide guarantees of up to US$200 million for a syndicated commercial
loan to and equity investment inNT2 Power Company. Other international agencies considering support to
the project include: the Asian Development Bank, the French Development Agency, the European
Investment Bank., and the Nordic Investment Bank. Hydropower, one of the few sources of short-term
growth in the country, would allow Lao PDR to export electrical energy to Thailand while also producing a
considerable amount of electricity for domestic use.
...by  enhancing policy reforms    ...The political leadership in Lao PDR i s strongly committed to NT2.
Bank participation in project preparation has opened the door to a constructive dialogue on the
development framework with various stakeholders, and helped build government capacity to deal with
complex development issues and make use of consultation as a valuable input to policy formulation. This
has had an impact on the preparation of a fully government-ownedNGPES and helped increase the degree
of convergence between the Bank and the Government of Lao PDR at the policy level. Cooperation
between Lao PDR and the Bank is helping to build the goodwill needed to broaden the dialogue on key
issues of governance, human development, and natural resource management, which are areas that the
Bank i s supporting in the CAS.
...can  yield long-term benefits. The revenues (through royalties, taxes and dividends) generated by the
project through 2034, if well targeted, would provide significant incremental resources to support poverty
reduction, human development, and environment goals. Such revenues, when accompanied by governance
improvements and human capital development, would help the country reduce poverty and boost economic
growth if successfully channeled. Such a large project could also encourage foreign investment inLao PDR
and enlarge the country's access to international financial markets. In short, through NT2 the Government
can strengthen its long-term commitment to sustainable development and to the conservation of its natural
resources.


66.      A World Bank decision on support to the proposed NT2 project will be based on a
decision framework with three key elements: (i)            Lao PDR establishing and implementing
viable development policies, characterized by concrete performance, and national programs
for poverty reduction and social and environmental protection; (ii)               the technical, financial,
economic and implementation aspects of the proposed project, as well as the design and
implementation of safeguards policies, being sound; and (iii)wider understanding and
broader support from the international donor community and global and local civil society for
Lao PDRs development framework and the proposed project. The Government's program for
improvements in the transparency and effectiveness in public expenditure management, laid
out in its Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP- See Annex F.),
i s an important component of the second pillar of the decision framework. The PRSCs
support key elements of the PEMSP, which in turn supports the implementation of specific
measures to ensure that NT2 revenues are allocated and applied transparently in support for

                                              22


poverty reduction and environmental protection programs. The links to NT2 entail a higher
degree of scrutiny of reform program, through annual consultations with NT2 partners, the
International Advisory Group and ultimately through dissemination of information amongst
the donor community.

67.      Financial Management Capacity Building Credit. The FMCBC was designed to
finance technical assistance inputs in support of the Financial Management Adjustment
credit. Disbursements under FMCBC have been slow: partly because GOL lacked an
adequate framework for capacity building and partly because GOL i s reluctant to borrow for
capacity building and technical assistance. With the successful conclusion of FMAC, the
Ministry o f Finance is reviewing the future direction of FMCBC with a view to restructuring
the project to meet capacity building and technical assistance requirements under the PRSCs.
It i s expected that FMCBC will be used to support the financing of independent audits of
SOEs and state-owned banks (SOBS). The Government has agreed to use FMCBC as core
funding for the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program, pending the
mobilization o f more grant financing.

68.      Implementation of PEMSP. At present, the major costs under PEMSP (see Annex F.)
include: two long-term advisors (a program advisor and a capacity buildingadvisor), as well
as short-term consultancies for technical specialists and the development and implementation
of training courses. Once grant financing has been mobilized, the FMCBC will be
restructured so as to cover equipment costs, such as information systems. Restructuring of
FMCBC to cover all or part of these expenditures would require significant changes to the
credit agreement. The work program and restructuring plan for FMCBC i s expected to be
prepared as part of the forthcoming supervision report (April 2005).


D.LessonsLearnedfrom PreviousPolicy-basedLending

69.      The track record of adjustment lending in Lao PDR to date has been uneven. The
outcome of the first three World Bank adjustment credits, SAC I(approved in 1989), SAC I1
(approved in 1991), and SAC I11(approved in 1996) was rated unsatisfactory by the World
Bank Operations Evaluation Department (OED). The first SACs supported the New
Economic Mechanism aimed at liberalizing trade and foreign investment, strengthening the
private sector, and improving macroeconomic management. According to OED's evaluation,
the SACs did not perform well mainly due to weak Government commitment to the reform
program and weak implementation capacity. Additionally, OED recommended, in
preparation of an operation in Lao PDR, to: (i) greater inter-ministerial coordination
                                                   foster
(ii) fullaccountofcapacitylimitations; and(iii)
     take                                              support the operation with adequate and
appropriate technical assistance (TA).

70.      In the preparation of PRSC-1, the issues of Government commitment and reform
sustainability have been seriously considered. The Bank's increased confidence in the
Government's commitment to the reform program i s based on the successful implementation
of the Financial Management Adjustment Credit (FMAC), approved in June 2002. FMAC
provided financial assistance to support the implementation of reforms in the areas of public
sector reform, SOEs, and financial sector reform articulated in the I-PRSP. The FMAC was
successfully implemented setting a track record of meeting all 17 conditions of the second

                                             23


tranche in 2004. Additionally, in preparing PRSC-1, the World Bank team, in cooperation
with the GOL counterpart team: (i)  pursueda process of getting all stakeholders on board and
ensured inter-ministerial coordination through the NGPES and PRSC Government teams; (ii)
elaborated a capacity enhancement plan in collaboration with GOL (see Annex G.);and (iii)
i s working on the restructuring of FMCBC, to support the operation with adequate and
appropriate TA (see paragraph 67).

71.      The proposed series of PRSCs builds on the achievements of the FMAC and other
sectoral projects. Due to its programmatic nature, PRSC i s better equipped to focus on
medium-term outcomes and impact of the reforms. PRSC-1 takes the FMAC-supported
actions to the next level by moving from: (i)restructuring plans to their actual
implementation; and (ii)the establishment of new institutions to making them fully
operational. Moreover, the PRSCs, by putting forward key actions at the sectoral level,
complement ongoing projects, thus fostering inter-ministerial policy dialogue. In the
forthcoming years, the agenda of PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 will be broadened.


E. Collaborationwith Other Donors

72.      Under the framework of the Government's Round Table Process, the Government
established in 2004 an Aid Coordination Mechanism, comprising more than ten major
donors, including the Bank. To lead this process, the Government set up the Department of
International Cooperation in the MOFA and - to ensure coordinated support to NGPES
priorities - eight sectoral working groups focusing on key national development priorities.
These groups consist of NGOrepresentatives, and bilateral and multilateral donors, including
the Bank. The proposed PRSCs build on these arrangements, and on others already in place
under the ongoing macroeconomic dialogue and sectoral programs.

73.      The policy reform programproposed in the PRSC series i s ambitious and will require
enhanced cooperation between the Bank and the rest of the donor community. Such
cooperation i s viable, as the NGPES framework provides a wealth of shared entry points. In
the area of public expenditure management, the Government has indicated its intention to
mobilize donor support around a single program, laid out in its Public Expenditure
Management Strengthening Program. The proposed PRSC-1 offers scope to maximize the
coordination of donor intervention, based on NGPES platforms for alignment, monitoring,
strengthening donors' voice and participation.

74.     Duringthe identificationmissions for the PRSC-1, the Policy Matrix was discussed
and - in broad terms - agreed-upon with four key major development partners (EC, JBIC,
JICA, ADB). Specifically, participants discussed ways of improving the predictability of aid,
streamlining conditionality and ensuring that aid be increasingly channeled through the
national budget. Under this modus operandi, both Government and external partners can hold
each other mutually accountable for results, and avoid creating systems that run parallel to
the national budget and the planning system. With respect to PRSCs co-financing in
particular, discussions have begun with several interested donors.

75.     Relationship with the IMFPRGF.The IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) was approved by the Fund's Board in April 2001 and completed three reviews

                                               24


successfully. The fourth review has not been completed, because `safeguard' actions for the
Bank of Lao PDR and key structural measures could not be accomplished within the
timeframe of the PRGF cycle, due to expire in April 2005. After that date, Lao PDR will be
under the Fund's Surveillance. The IMFhas providedan Assessment Letter (see Annex E.).

76.     The Assessment Letter - and, earlier, the November 2004 Article IV Consultation -
report that macroeconomic conditions are stable (with inflation in the single digits; 8 percent
in January 2005), and that Lao PDR has the potential to sustain robust medium-term
economic growth, provided that progress i s made on structural reforms. As a key short-term
risk, they highlight that: (i) the 2004/05 budget - approved by the National Assembly in
October 2004, included ambitious revenue targets and large, and unsustainable increases in
the wage-bill. To mitigate this risk, GOL has revised the 2004/05 budget in line with the
discussions with the Fund and the Bank: budget implementation will continue to be prudent
and wage increases will be consistent with revenue collection and acceptable fiscal deficit
targets (for details, see paragraph 39); and (ii) accelerating structural reforms remains a
challenge, particularly in the fiscal area and in the operational reform of the state banks. To
mitigate these risks, the proposed series of PRSCs will strengthen Revenue and Public
Expenditure Management, and increase the transparency and the commercialization of the
Banking System; IMFstaff have also encouraged the authorities to maintain tight quantitative
limits on the net domestic assets of state banks. Until the Government requests a successor
PRGF, IMF staff will undertake two missions to the country each year (one of which for
Article IV Consultations), and will provide assessment letters to the World Bank after these
missions, Fundand Bank staff will continue their close collaboration duringthese missions.


F.Analytical Underpinnings

77.     The Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) cycle will inform present and future
PRSCs actions, through a three-step process: (i)diagnosis through in-depth analysis of key
knowledge gaps, (ii)   consensus building with Government and development partners, and
(iii)implementation through policy dialogue. Such a programmatic approach to AAA
engages the client and donors to build capacity and ownership with a special emphasis on
design and dissemination.

78.     Diagnostic sumortina PRSC-1. The proposed shift to programmatic lending i s
underpinned by the Bank's core AAA carried out to date, including a Country Procurement
Assessment Review (2002), a Poverty Study (2002), Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA, 2002), Public Expenditure Review (PER, 2002), Poverty-Environment
Nexus Study (2002), and Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, 2004). Several of these
studies have been completed inclose collaboration with the IMF,ADB and EU.

79.     PSIA. The Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) i s being conducted as part of
the Lao PDR AAA work. For example, the 2002 PER has started the analysis of poverty
impact of social sector spending, that will be deepened in the subsequent PER, scheduled for
2006 (see paragraph 87); similarly, the 2004 CEM has analyzed the potential impact of
public expenditures and PEMon poverty and social outcomes.

                                               25


80.     Current analvtical work to underpin PRSC-2. Ongoing studies include a new Poverty
Assessment,    Education and Health Assessments, Integrated Framework on Trade
Diagnostics, an Investment Climate Assessment, and a Note on Capacity Enhancement for
the CAS.

81.     Poverty Assessment. The Poverty Assessment i s a 16-month collaboration between
the National Statistical Center (NSC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA) and the World Bank. It aims to better understand
the dimensions that characterize poverty in Lao PDR and the ways in which the Government,
supported by donors, can help work to reach the poverty reduction objectives of the NGPES.

82.     Education and Health. Several studies are planned to: (i) student learning and
                                                                    assess
training; (ii) understand service delivery in the education sector; (iii) capacity
              better                                                           support
buildinginHIV/AIDS; and (iv) analyze health financing mechanismsfor the poor.

83.     DTZS. The Diagnostics Trade Integration Study (DTIS) develops an integrated
strategy and action plan to enhance the global integration of Lao PDR. The main objective i s
to assist the Government in formulating a pro-poor, pro-growth trade strategy that allows Lao
PDR to build its comparative advantage and expand its exports. For that, the DTIS will
identify priority actions in specific areas including trade policy, trade facilitation, market
access, export financing, and institutional framework.

84.     ZCA. The Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), being carried out in collaboration
with the ADB entails a survey of 200 firms, to ascertain their current constraints and
performance. The EU i s financing a Review of Provincial Regulatory Environment for the
private sector, which will complement the ICA; its field work include a sample of 6
provinces.


program of core AAA - including a public expenditure review, investment climate
85.     Planned AAA for PRSC-3 and future PRSCs. In the upcoming CAS, a strong

assessment, poverty assessment, and CEM- will support continuous Bank dialogue on broad
NGPES challenges and underpin future PRSCs actions. These will also be informed by
focused AAA on selected sectoral challenges.

86.     PETS. The Government i s currently preparing a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey
(PETS) in primary health and primary education. The objectives are to: (i)understand and
analyze current public expenditure management practice, in order to advise Lao PDR how to
improve service delivery and successfully meet the goals of the NGPES; and (ii)      serve as an
independent monitoring tool to assist government in improving accountability by
disseminating information and engaging service delivery beneficiaries. Pilot testing of the
survey i s planned for May 2005, and the fully-fledged survey for October 2005.

87.     PER. PETS' findings will feed into a Public Expenditure Review (PER) of the
NGPES sectors, scheduled for FY2006. This will include an explicit examination of
decentralization. The decentralization policy implemented since 2000 i s now seen as
constraint on effective implementation of national policies and resulting in an ineffective and
inequitable distribution of resources. Decentralization i s expected to be one of the key policy
issues addressed at the 2006 Party Congress. While no policy decision i s likely to be taken
before the Congress, preparatory work i s already underway. UNDP i s taking the lead in

                                             26


preparing options for decentralization policies within the context of the Government's
broader Governance and Public Administration Reform program. The World Bank i s
undertaking a supporting study, focusing on expenditure management and related capacity
buildingissues at the sub-national level. Some adjustment inprogram design may be needed
once decentralization policy has been formulated.

88.     Link to NT2. Implementation of the NT2 revenue management arrangements will
entail a particular focus on public expenditure management. The Government has agreed to
the implementation of a rolling program of expenditure reviews, public expenditure tracking
surveys and analytical work geared to monitoring progress in implementation of the
Government's Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program and assessing the
compliance environment and the impact of public spending in key sectors. This program of
analytical work will be implemented by the World Bank and other NT2 partners (including
ADB, AFD and EIB) as well the broader donor community, following a collaborative
approach.

IX. The ProposedFirstPoverty Reduction Support Credit

89.      The proposed PRSCs will assist the Government to make monitorable progress in
realizing the objectives laid out in the NGPES, and to enhance the sustainability of its
development efforts through the promotion of economic growth. The policy reform program
articulated inthe PRSCs focuses in a selective fashion on key areas of the NGPES.

90.      The reform program supported by the PRSC series draws heavily on the conclusions
and recommendations of core diagnostic Economic and Sector Work (ESWs) realized in
recent years b y the Bank in cooperation with the Lao PDR authorities and other donors. The
measures envisaged under each component of the proposed credits are analyzed in detail
below, and are illustrated schematically in the attached Policy Matrix. Prior actions for
PRSC-1and triggers for PRSC-2and PRSC-3 are listedin Section X below.


Component 1:Public Resource Management

                   1.1StrengtheningPublicExpenditureManagement(PEM)

91.      Key Issues. Expenditure planning and budgeting. Current practice in expenditure
planning and budgeting does not provide a sound basis for aligning resources with NGPES
policies. The budget process i s fragmented." Budgeting i s incremental: there i s little forward
planning of expenditure aggregates or recurrent spending, making it difficult to accommodate
phased adjustments in the structure of expenditure. Since provincial authorities enjoy broad
discretion in the allocation of their budgets, there are significant per capita variations in the
level of resource allocations for priority sectors between provinces. Although the budget
process starts four months before the beginning of the fiscal year, the National Assembly
approves only broad expenditure allocations, which provide little indication of the sectoral
allocation of resources. Detailed budget books are finally published about half way through
the year, too late to effectively guide agency spending. The budget provides aggregate
allocations at ministerial level with exhaustively detailed line item classifications. As such,
the budget provides little information on the purpose of spending. Coverage i s limited, with
substantial off-budget items, including statutory funds and agency-retained revenues, and
limited information on externally financed expenditures.

92.      Budget execution and financial reuortine. Budget execution and reporting is
characterized by weak treasury control, delays in reporting and inadequate disclosure.
Effective treasury operations and cash management are hampered by the multiplication of
accounts, unauthorized revenue retention at agency and provincial levels, lack of systematic
commitment controls and weak cash planning mechanisms. While there appears to be
effective budgetary control at agency level, this i s achieved by cash rationing. This has
contributed to the growth in arrears to suppliers and delays in the payment of salaries.
Provincial treasuries and other sub-treasuries are not under the direct authority of the central
treasury and often retain revenues intended for the central government, exacerbating cash



l1The Committee for Planning and Investment (CPI) prepares the investment program, integrating external
assistance; the Ministry of Finance prepares the budget, incorporating capital expenditures aggregates and
details of recurrent expenditures at the central and provincial levels.

                                               29


constraints. Reporting by agencies and particularly provinces i s sometimes delayed,
incomplete and difficult to reconcile. Progress has been made in computerization of
payments processing and accounting for four central agencies. The computerized system i s
now being rolled out across central and provincial government. However, computerization
has not been accompanied by changes in management practices. The Government does not
publishconsolidatedin-year budget execution reports. While estimates of budget outtums are
presented in the budget papers for the following year, there i s no end-of-year financial
statement. The State Audit Organization undertakes limited compliance audits of a few line
agencies. Audit reports are not published.

93.     GovernmentResDonseand Medium-termVision.The Government recognizes that
significant improvements in public expenditure management performance and shifts in
resource allocations will be needed if it i s to realize the ambitious goals laid out in the
NGPES. The Ministry of Finance has prepared a Public Expenditure Management
Strengthening Program (PEMSP - See Annex F.), which will provide a framework for its
reforms and capacity buildingefforts through end-FY2009. This program includes plans to:

        Develop a consolidated, medium-term expenditure framework to gradually shift
        resources in line with its policy goals - towards recurrent spending, the NGPES
        sectors and pay reform - and provide a more predictable basis for expenditure
        planning at the agency level.
        Improve gradually the timeliness, coverage and presentation of the state budget,
        including the phased introduction of a revised budget nomenclature, improved
        administrative classification and provisionfor functional and program classifications.
        Consolidate treasury functions and bring sub-treasuries under the authority of the
        central treasury. Key issues to be addressed will be the direct subordination of
        provincial treasuries to the central treasury, the streamlining of the budget execution
        process and clarification of responsibilities for accounting and financial reporting.
        Define new accounting standards, with a view to providing policy relevant
        information and meeting basic international standards. Framework legislation will be
        prepared providing for the phased introduction of key financial statements reflecting
        international standards, including a shift towards modified cash and ultimately - well
        beyond the program- accrual accounting.
        Put in place basic systems for cash management, to improve predictability,
        efficiency and transparency in budget execution. This will entail the establishment of
        a cross-departmental cash management committee, preparation of cash plans and the
        regular updating of treasury account balances and registers of accounts payable.
        Discuss the way forward on decentralization policy, in the forthcoming Party
        Congress in 2006. Given the policy and resource allocation distortions caused by the
        current arrangements, and the close links to other program milestones in the areas of
        budgeting and treasury, this i s regarded as a critical component of the plan.

        Table 4 assesses the impact of the proposed reform program in relation to the HIPC
public expenditure management indicators and benchmarks. Lao PDR performs poorly against
these measures indicators, which place considerable emphasis on public disclosure of financial
information and accountability to the legislature. If the PEMSP program i s implemented as
scheduled, Lao PDR would meet all but two of the benchmarks by FY2009. During the
period covered by PRSC-1-3, progress i s expected to be strongest in the areas of budget

                                               30


presentation, reporting and accounting. It i s expected that the Lao PDR will meet five HIPC
benchmarks by the end of FY2007:

            Reliability of budget as a guide to budget outturns (Indicator 3) through the
            consolidation of cash holdings and development of cash planning systems,
            supported by improvements in the timeliness and coverage of reports of financial
            balances and accounts payable, as well as regular reports on budget execution in
            priority sectors
            Classification of budget expenditures (Indicator 5) with the approval and
            application of a revised chart of accounts and budget nomenclature, compatible
            with    the  Government    Finance     Statistics  (GFS)   standards, and    their
            implementation in the FY2007-08 budget.
            Identification  of poverty    related expenditures      (Indicator 6)  with   the
            implementation of the revised budget nomenclature and chart of accounts,
            together with the identification of priority poverty reduction programs in the
            MTEFandbudget documentation.
            Use of expenditure tracking surveys (Indicator 10) with the implementation of
            expenditure tracking surveys in2005 and a follow-up already scheduled in2007.
            Timeliness of internal reporting (Indicator 12) with improvements in the financial
            reporting by agencies and provinces, supported by the computerization of
            agencies and provincial offices and the discipline of publication of budget
            execution reports for key NGPES sectors.

95.    The Government's reform schedule i s feasible: for instance, changes in the chart of
accounts will only be implemented in the second year of the program; and consolidated
financial statements are scheduled for preparation in FY2009 with a lead time of four years.
Other low-income countries have made comparable progress over a similar period:
Mozambique, for instance between 1997 and 2002. However, program implementation will
require significant technical support and a broad-based training program. In this context, the
Prime Minister's Office has agreed to the appointment of two long-term advisors, one
covering technical aspects of PEMSP implementation, and the other capacity building, to be
financed from the Financial Management Capacity Building Credit (FMCBC). A capacity
buildingbaseline assessment, fundedby the European Union, is currently underway. Training
and short-term technical assistance inputs will covered by the FMCBC, initially, though the
Government has requested the Bank's assistance in mobilizing grant financing for the
program.

96.       PRSC Suwort to NGPES.The reform program supported by the PRSC1-3 in the
PEMarea is presentedinthe Policy Matrix (Component 1.1,Sections A., B. and C.). PRSC-1
makes modest steps towards the achievement of the following programmatic outcomes: (i)
improved alignment of expenditure allocations with NGPES; (ii)                        improved budget coverage
and structure; (iii)         consolidation of treasury functions; (iv) improved predictability in budget
execution and improved timeliness and coverage of financial reporting; (v) efficient and
transparent national procurement system; and (vi) increased coherence between provincial
expenditure allocations and NGPES priorities.

97.       Expenditure planning and budgeting. In the area of budget elaboration, prior actions
for PRSC-1 include the approval of the PEMSP, together with annual work plan for FY2004-
05, and the launch of the process for mobilization of the technical assistance needed to
support program implementation12. PRSC-2 and 3 measures will monitor progress in
implementation of the PEMSP through the approval of annual work and training plans.
PRSC-1 supports actions to update the MTEF, as an integral part of the budget elaboration
process. The MTEF and sector expenditure programs will be updated annually prior to the
approval of subsequent PRSCs. Also as a prior action, the MOF has provided a revised
budget framework for FY2004-05 in a letter submitted by the Borrower to the Association
(see footnote 9, page 13). This framework indicates the adjustments in budget structure to
ensure a sustainable deficit, including the revised limits for personnel expenditures in
FY2004-05. The framework will be submitted to the Parliament in late April 2005. The



l2Placement of long-term technical assistance to support program implementation i s seen as critical given
the complexity of the task, the limited experience of the Government team in implementing broad based
PEMreforms and the need for significant capacity building inputs.

publication of the budget books will be brought forward under subsequent PRSCs in order to
more effectively guide public spending decision-making.

98.     Budget execution and financial reporting. Under budget execution, the MOF i s
expected to undertake the initial steps in strengthening its cash management and transparency
in budget management. Prior actions for PRSC-1 included the updating of registers of
accounts payable and Government bank accounts as of the end of FY2003-04 - as these are
the necessary first steps in putting together routine cash plans. On the procurement front, the
MOF approved the charter of the Procurement Monitoring Office and developed the draft
procurement manual. PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 will broaden the agenda of budget execution and
control, by focusing in particular on financial reporting, as well as on provincial revenue and
expenditure mechanisms and inter-governmental fiscal transfers.

                             1.2 Strengtheningthe BankingSector

99.     Kev Issues. The Lao PDR has a small banking system with system-wide assets of
less than US$500 million, equivalent to around 20 percent of GDP. The system i s dominated
by state-owned commercial banks (SCBs) which hold over 50 percent and 70 percent of the
banking system's total assets and deposits, respectively. Private domestic banks are weak and
foreign banks have a small market share, due in part to existing barriers to entry and
expansion by non-state financial institutions. Banque pour le Commerce ExtCrieur Lao
(BCEL) has a dominant position, accounting for approximately half of total deposits and
loans in the system. The Lao Development Bank (LDB), resulting from the merger of two
smaller SCBs - Lao May Bank and Lane Xang Bank - i s smaller. Both BCEL and LDB are
insolvent, having high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) and weak profitability. There i s
also a state-owned policy bank, the Agricultural Promotion Bank (APB) that lends mainly to
rural areas, loss-making and burdened with NPLs.

100.     State-Owned Banks. State-owned banks (SOBS) suffer from several deficiencies
including: (i)low capacity o f staff to evaluate business opportunitiles and risks (e.g. project,
market and foreign currency, and credit risks); (ii)    directed lending on a non-commercial
basis; (iii)weak legal framework, resulting in difficulties to enforce contracts and take legal
action against borrowers (iv) limited credit culture; and (iv) inadequate supervisory capacity
inthe Bank of Lao PDR (BOL).

101.    As a result significant risks remain inthe system. The potential for new NPLs i s high
and pressures to make further loans on a non-commercial basis are considerable. The annual
international standard audits of these banks help to monitor performance and identify
problems on a regular basis. Regular on-site inspections and overall credit growth limits also
provide timely information to regulators. The presence of International Banking Advisors in
LDB and BCELhelps to improve credit-risk assessments and credit decisions. Nevertheless,
the potential for future NPLs i s a threat to the banking system and to fiscal stability.

102.    Government Response and Medium-termVision. The Government of Lao PDR
re-iterated their commitment to a modern, sound, and efficient banking system in the
NGPES. The authorities are determined to continue the restructuring of SCBs with gradual
recapitalization, conditional on improved governance and performance, and increased
transparency. This i s to be underpinnedb y strengthened supervision and regulation, enhanced
capacity of staff in SCBs and BOL, as well as potential competition from non-state foreign

                                                     33


and domestic private banks. The state owned policy bank, APB, i s to be transformed to a
more commercially-oriented bank.

103.      The current round of banking reform program begun in late 2000, supported by the
World Bank, the ADB and the IMF, as well as a few bilateral donors; it involves continued
restructuring o f state-owned banks, strengthened supervision and regulation of the banking
system, and an increasing role for non-state-owned banks (see related actions under
"Component 3: Sustained Growth", page 44).                     The concerned parties agreed on a
restructuring framework to: (i)       resolve NPLs; (ii)    reorient Banks towards more commercial
lending; (iii)improve governance; and (iv) increase transparency. However, progress on
implementation has been slower than originally envisaged. In 2003, the framework was
formalized through signed `Governance Agreements'. Each SCB i s now assisted by two
long-term international bank advisers (IBAs), whose role i s to assist in strengthening SCB's
operations, especially in the credit review process, developing internal policies and
procedures, and providing necessary policy implementation assistance. Some progress has
been made in improving the quality of new lending13, adopting operational policies and
procedures, and completing the independent IAS audits for the period 2001-2003 (see Box
4). However weaknesses remain as the asset quality of SCBs continues to deteriorate (albeit
at a slower rate), NPL resolution i s slow, the newly approved operational policies and
procedures, especially in the credit underwriting process, are not well adhered to, and
pressures for non-commercial lending continues. There have been several non-compliances
with the Governance Agreement too, especially in respect of the adherence to the IBA
certification for large credit decisions. The Governance Agreements are being reviewed and
are likely to be revised. Restructuringof APB i s progressing slowly.

Box 4. Implementationof BankRestructuringin2004
Revised regulation. In May 2004, the BOL issued the revised regulation on loan classification and
provisioning requirement. The full implementation of the revised regulation i s expected in 2005. The
revision aims to ensure that banks consistently review and grade loans, properly account for unpaid interest
in the profit and loss statement, adequately set aside provision expenses, and properly classify restructured
loans.
New credit policy. Since April 2004, SCBs, with assistance from the IBAs, introduced their permanent
credit risk policies, which enforce the credit risk management process. Various training has been provided
to staff to enhance skills and change the credit culture of credit officers and the management. However,
several non-compliances with the credit policies were reported.
Enhanced transparency. In October 2004, the 2003 independent IAS audits for BCEL and LDB, in
respect of their financial statements, loan portfolios, and compliance with the Governance Agreements
and BOL regulations were completed. The audit results allow relevant authorities to monitor the financial
situation of two SCBs and the progress of the bank restructuring program. The independent IAS audit for
APB's 2002 and 2003 financial statements, and portfolio review has also started and is expected to be
completed in a few months.

104.      PRSCSuwort to NGPES.The reform program supported by PRSC1-3 in the state-
owned bank sector i s presented in the Policy Matrix (Component 1.2, Section A,). In line
with the NGPES, the PRSCs support the Government reform agenda in the banking sector,
focusing essentially on enhancing transparency and commercialization of state-owned banks.



l3 The 2003 audits of the SCBs portfolio reported 4.9 percent of NPLs and 11.7 percent of overdue loans
from new lending, totaling 194 billion kip in 2003.

                                                34


105.    State-Owned Banks. The independent IAS audits for the year 2003 for BCEL and
LDB have been completed and reportedto the MOF (see Box 4). Under PRSC-2 and PRSC-
3, BOL will submit to the MOF the independent IAS audits for BCEL, LDB, and APB for the
year 2004 and 2005 within 6 months and 5 months of the end-of-year, respectively. Timely
completion and dissemination of annual IAS audit results are critical to keep concerned
parties well informed on the financial position and performance of each SCB, and for the
SCBs to take actions to address emerging issues. This information would allow for prompt
adjustments to the programif necessary.

106.    Under PRSC-2, material compliance by concerned parties with the Governance
Agreements and guidelines will be reinforced particularly in the area of SCBs' autonomy,
new risk activities, reduction and resolution of existing NPLs, and decrease in excessive
concentration risk. PRSC-3 will strengthen further the compliance by concerned parties with
the Governance Agreements and guidelines. SCBs' achievement of the operational and
governance improvement targets will be rewarded by phased recapitalization, while failures
in compliance will trigger sanctions as outlined in the Governance Agreements. The
recapitalization plan for SCBs will be reviewed and agreed by MOF, BOL, and each SCB
within the PRSC-2 timetable and the conditional recapitalization of each SCB will take place
subsequently. B y enhancing their commercialization and transparency, SCBs should be able
to attract strategic investors in the future. Restructuring of state-owned banks will be
accompanied by changing the legal and regulatory environment to allow competition by non-
state financial institutions (see actions in component 3.1 Strengthening Private Sector
Development, page 44).

107.    PRSC measures will be implemented in coordination with other international
financial organizations, including IMF, ADB, and EU. Strengthening BOL's prudential
regulations and its supervisory capacity, to ensure compliance with regulations by
commercial banks, will continue to be carried out under the IMF'senhanced surveillance and
with World Bank support. Restructuring of two SCBs and strengthening the legal
environment and judicial capacity for contract enforcement are being supported under the
ADB's Banking Sector Reform Program Loan (BSRPL). Strengthening the management
information system and the information technology for SCBs and the central bank, as well as
capacity building for bankers, will be supported by the EU. Restructuring of APB i s not
included in the PRSCs, with the understanding that ADB's proposed program will move
forward. The program aims at ensuring the progressive phasing out of policy lending from
APB, starting from separating on its accounts the commercial activity from socially
mandated activities. APB will be assured of full autonomy in its operation and management
will be accountable for its performance. Operational improvements will be rewarded by
conditional recapitalization.


                 1.3 Improving the Performance of State-Owned Enterprises.

108.    Kev Issues. Though the SOE sector now accounts for a small share of national output
and empl~yment'~,improving the performance of the large SOEs remains important for



l4The SOE sector employs about 15,600 workers, which represents only a small percentage of Lao's total
workforce. O f the 147 SOEs reporting employment numbers, 26 have over 100employees and account for

                                                35


  overall public resource management. In fact, several large SOEs contribute most to the
  losses and the accumulation of debt; they are also responsible for a significant share of the
  non-performing loans (NPLs) in the SCBs. The restructuring program that was initially
  supported under the FMAC addressed mainly the financial weaknesses of the most indebted
  SOEs. The focus was on operational restructuring of nine large enterprises in two stages,
  including sale of non-core assets, and the gradual move to cost-recovery tariffs.

  109.    Enterprise Restructuring. Under that program the Government made progress. Initial
 restructuring took place with the issuance of Decree No. 54 inJanuary 2002; since, SOEs are
 required to set-up Boards of Directors. However, many SOEs do not yet have functioning
 Boards in place, largely due to the limited pool of suitable candidates to draw from.
 Directors, frequently civil servants who have full-time functions within line ministries, have
 insufficient time or capacity to exercise their fiduciary responsibility. Typically the Boards'
 understanding of accounting, business management or financial management i s weak. Few
  SOEs have regular annual audits. This combination of factors limits the state's ability to
 manage risk and execute SOE reform policy. The priority for action i s to move the SOE
 reform programbeyondplans into actions on the ground.

  110.    Government Response and Medium-term Vision. Over the last few years, the
  Government has made progress in exposing all SOEs to greater competition from imports
  and from private sector, by increasingly opening up trade and investment, and restructuring
 the large SOEs. The restructuring program was explicitly supported by the FMAC. This
 involved the financial and operational restructuring of Electricite' du Laos (EDL); by 2004,
 EDLimprovedits operational result. Inaddition, for 4 large SOEs, following an initial round
 of restructuring, detailed time-bound restructuring plans were developed during 2003, with
 the support of FMAC; implementation of those plans begun in middle of 2004; for recent
 restructuring actions, see Box 5. For another 5 large SOEs, memorandum of understanding
 were signed for developing detailed restructuring plans with the help of external consultants,
  and actions were taken towards that end. Progress in SOEs restructuring took longer than was
 originally expected.

  111.    Since 2002, the Government increased the transparency of information on the
 performance of the SOE sector as a whole, and in particular for the 9 large SOEs. Prior to the
 introduction of Decree 54 (and its Implementing Regulations, No. 2736/2002), the lack of
reliable financial and operational information on SOEs posed a major challenge to GOL in
 the execution of its SOE reform program. Decree No. 54 outlined the contents and frequency
 of the SOEs reporting requirements. As a result, over the last two years systematic
 information on performance of the SOE sector has become available, capacity to monitor
 SOE sector has increased in the State Asset Management Bureau (MOF), and performance
 assessments and remedial actions are being identified.             Also, for the 4 SOEs being
restructured, annual audits are being carried out, including international standard audits.

 Box 5. Implementationof RestructuringPlansfor 4 Large SOEs

 Between May 2004 and March 2005, the Business Promotion Office (BPO - Prime Minister's office) has
 been coordinating the implementation of detailed time-bound SOE restructuring plans, developed with the
 assistance of external consultants and supported by the FMAC. Despite a slower pace of than originally
~



,planned, implementation has been satisfactory, as illustrated below.

 Bolisat Pattana Khet Phoudoi (BPKP). BPKP's core businesses (wood processing and construction) have
 potential for commercial viability. The restructuring plan seeks financial restructuring (through debt
 rescheduling and asset revaluation), and sale or transfer of non-core businesses and their assets.
 Implementation started in May 2004; since, the branch offices have been closed and assets kept to support
 core businesses; a non-core and viable business (Le., a tourism centre) has been separated; numerous non-
 core and non-viable activities have been sold or transferred to provinces (Le.:, three hotels and two
 guesthouses) and to the Ministry of Defence (Le., a saw mill and a shoe factory). BPKP management also
 re-valued its remaining assets, now estimated at around U S $32 million, with liabilities still largely
 exceeding assets. Procurement for international standard audits for 2004 has also been initiated.

 Lao Airlines. Lao Airline's lossesjumped in 2003, with the lease of an Airbus 320. The restructuring plan
 recommended the termination of the Airbus lease and the conversion of Lao Airlines into a joint-venture
 with a foreign airline, with GOL holding less than majority shares to encourage foreign partners. Measures
 to stem the losses have been taken: the Airbus was grounded in November 2004 and the lease was
 terminated in February 2005; five loss-making domestic routes have been stopped; frequency of two other
 low-load routes lowered; and staff-strength was reduced. Monthly operating losses were reduced in
 November and fell further in February. The joint venture negotiation with Vietnam Airlines has been
 ongoing since October 2004, but there appear to be significant differences in the positions of the two sides.
 The MCTPC and BPO have indicated that by the middle of 2005 they will hire a technical advisor and
 expand search for a joint venture partner. Procurement for international standard audits for 2004 has also
 been initiated.

 NamPapa Lao (renamed Nam Papa Nakhoneluang Vientiane), the water supply company for Vientiane,
 having accumulated losses until 2002, i s generating profits since 2003. Its losses were due to high operating
 costs (resulting from inefficient procurement of raw materials, large water losses, and interest cost on rising
 debt) and low tariffs (tariffs were lower in the city than in rural areas). In 2004, debt-equity conversions
 and increases in tariffs reduced operational costs. Further reductions are expected in 2005, through water-
 loss reduction and the improvement o f receivable collection by disconnecting delinquents. Procurement for
 an international standard audit performance in2004 has been initiated.

 Pharmaceutical Factory No. 3. Through new machinery and cost-cutting, losses have been reduced to less
 than 10 percent of sales. The Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association i s providing technical
 assistance to improve production-management, as well as equipment. Procurement for international
 standard audits for 2004 has also been initiated.

 112.     PRSC Sumortto NGPES.The reform program supported by PRSC1-3 in the SOE
 sector i s presented in the Policy Matrix (Component 1.3, Section A.). Key objectives are
 greater transparency, enhanced commercial viability of the large SOEs, and improved
 performance of the SOE sector as a whole.

 113.     Enterprise Restructuring. Prior actions for PRSC-1 include the completion of 2003
 state audits for 3 of the 4 large SOEs, initiation of procurement of international standard
 audits (IAS) for 2004, the implementation of key restructuring steps (including sale of non-
 core assets) as identified in the detailed plans for the 4 large SOEs, and approval of SAMD
 performance monitoring and assessment for all SOEs for FY03. Actions before PRSC-2 and
 PRSC-3 will include continued implementation of restructuring measures for the 4 large

                                                 37


SOEs, initiation of implementation of restructuring of another 5 SOEs, and increases in
transparency of information on SOE performance.

                             1.4 Financial Sustainabilitv of Utilities

114.     Kev Issues. Most of the infrastructure services in Lao PDR - electricity, water,
telecommunications and aviation - are provided by SOEs, though increasingly, more private
providers are entering into these services. B y and large, tariffs are low, remain below cost
recovery and in some cases fail to keep up with inflation. Pricing strategies are a complex
mix of cross-subsidies designed to maximize revenues while limiting the price impact of
commercial autonomy on the majority of the population.

115.     Tariffs. While the objective of ensuring affordable service to lower income segments
of the population i s well-intentioned, directing the subsidy through the SOEs: (i)       limits the
ability to target the subsidy to the most needy; (ii)causes the government to subsidize
enterprise losses and causes NPLs; and, (iii)     limits the accountability of the enterprise for
both efficiency and profitability. Because the tariffs are low, the scope for new investment in
the sector i s limited, severely restricting potential competition, which could serve to establish
low prices while increasing service quality delivery. Among utility SOEs, the policy of
commercial autonomy has not been supported by mechanisms, such as sector regulatory
capacity and targeted and transparent subsidies, to allow competition and full price
liberalization.

116.     Government ResDonse and Medium-Term Vision. The Government i s aware of
the need to reduce budgetary subsidies to public utilities' services and to tap into the private
financing of investments. It has progressively moved to more appropriate tariffs and prices
for such services. There has been a good deal of Government action in this respect over the
last three years. These actions relate to: 1) actual changes in tariffs and in tariff structures and
2) articulating guiding principles for setting of tariffs and for changes in those tariffs. In
particular, tariffs have been raised towards greater cost-recovery and policies and principles
that would guide future tariffs and tariff changes have been adopted in respect of water,
telecommunications and aviation, through Prime Minister's Notices approving the proposals
made by MCTPC.

117.     Electricity. Measures have been introduced to commercialize the state-owned
national power utility, ElectricitC du Laos (EDL) and improve its financial situation;
however, in recent years the government's inability to adjust tariffs at the pace of inflation
has resulted in an acute financial crisis of the power sector. During May 2002 to June 2004,
as part of the company's financial recovery plan which was agreed with the Bank under the
FMAC, EDLcarried out a tariff increase of 2.3% per month for all categories of users, except
for embassies and international organizations whose tariffs are fixed in US dollars. While the
tariff increase took place over only 26 months rather than the envisaged 36 months - in the
light of the burden of higher oil prices on consumers and producers of Lao PDR, the actual
increase (together with a favorable exchange rate) enabled EDL in 2003 to comply with
financial performance criteria as defined by the Bank and ADB. Notwithstanding, EDL's
medium to long-term performance i s threatened by a highly distorted tariff structure, which
implies huge cross-subsidies to residential consumers. As a consequence, EDL and the Bank
have agreed on a specific plan for: (i)    restructuring of consumer categories and (ii)    average
annual increase of 2.7% in real terms over the period 2005 to 2011.At the end of the period,

                                                38


EDL'soperation will be commercially viable with a 5% return on revalued assets, similar to
Bank requirements for public utilities in other parts of the world. The restructuring of
consumer categories and the annual increase for 2005 i s expected to become effective in
May-June 2005 after full government endorsement.

118.     Water. Tariffs have increased from 195 Kip/m3 in 2000 to 650 Kip/m3 in July 2002,
but further reforms are envisaged as tariffs still remain well below cost recovery and do not
take into consideration new capital investment costs. In July 2004, GOL raised water tariffs
for Vientiane Capital for the second time in the year. Between July and December, tariffs for
households and government officials increased by an average of 23%, and tariffs for the
commercial/industrial users increased as well, while tariffs for embassies and foreign
residences have been kept unchanged. In a context of developing regulatory instruments for
the sector, Water and Sanitation Authority (WASA) has agreed to review the water tariff
principles and elaborate a comprehensive water tariff policy in consultation with key
stakeholders of the sector.

119.     Telecommunications. This sector remains relatively open with private entry and
private operation. The tariffs remain unchanged since the last increase in early 2004, but they
are at levels that are profitable for private sector operation and expansion as well as for state-
owned entities to not require a subsidy from the Government. Foreign investment i s also
coming into this sector for the provision of various services. The number of phone lines,
especially cellular, continues to grow.

120.     Transport. The tariffs for Lao Airlines remain grossly below cost-recovery levels for
many routes and many services, despite several revisions in the past. However, while Lao
Airlines actively seeks ajoint-venture partner, no changes in tariffs have taken place.

121.     PRSC Surmort to NGPES. The reform program supported by PRSC1-3 in the tariff
areas i s presented in the Policy Matrix (Component 1.4, Section A.). Implementation of the
program will lead to the increasedefficiency and sustainability of the utilities sector.

122.     Tariffs. Prior actions for PRSC-1 include further increases - towards cost recovery -
in the water tariff levels for household users. A "Tariff Action Plan" has been presented by
EDL and MIH to the Prime Minister's Office. This plan, along with an action plan for
financial sustainability of the power sector, to ensure continued financial viability of
Electricit6 du Laos, will be adopted and implemented before PRSC-2. Before PRSC-3 the
Government will implement succeeding phases of a general tariff restructuring plan cutting
across all public utilities.


Component 2: Public Expenditure Policies

                   2.1 AligningSpending with Pro-poor NGPES Priorities

123.     Key Crosscutting Issues. Social Sector Allocations. In Lao PDR, public spending
inreal per capita terms for service delivery inhealth and education still fall short of the levels
seen in the mid-l990's, and remains below sub-regional standards. In 2004, health and
education expenditures were in the order of 1 percent and 1.4 percent of GDP respectively.

                                                   39


At the same time, the cost of delivering services is high due to the particular demographic
(scattered population) and geo-climatic (rainy seasons' impediments) characteristics of the
country. The share of total spending allocated to the education and health sectors increased
from 11 percent in FY2001 to 16 percent in the FY2004 budget (from 13 percent to 18
percent when debt service i s excluded). However, this increase was largely due to increases
in the share of externally financed capital expenditures: allocations to education and health
have remained at around 14percent of domestically financed expenditures.

124.     Recurrent Expenditures. The 2002 PER points to a consistent pattern of inadequate
spending for wages, maintenance and other recurrent items. Since FY2001, capital
expenditures have accounted for over 60 percent of total expenditures (excluding debt
service), as compared with around 36 percent in Thailand and 29 percent in Vietnam. This
i s largely due to the high levels of externally financed capital expenditures reflected in the
budget. There has been a clear shift to recurrent spending in the allocation of domestically
financed expenditures (excluding debt service), with recurrent expenditures' share increasing
from 53 percent in FY2001 to 66 percent in the FY2004 budget, largely due to increases in
personnel expenditures. However, further increases are needed, particularly in the health,
education, and transport sectors, to fund wages, maintenance and other recurrent items (e.g.:,
textbooks and medical supplies).

125.     Public Sector Pav. Public sector wages have fallen by half and have remained that
way for almost four years. Teachers and hospital workers are paid far less than regional
averages and rarely paid on time. As a consequence, many are leaving their jobs. Civil
service pay reform i s critical to improving the motivation of the civil service. However, there
i s limited information on the number and grade of personnel on which to base such a policy,
and since provincial authorities recruit and place staff, it has proved difficult to control
staffing increases.

126.     Kev Sectoral Issues. Health. Despite progress in recent years (notably in the
reduction of infant and child mortality rates), mortality and morbidity remain very high,
especially among the rural population." Health care utilization i s very low with less than 30
percent of people in need of medical services turning to the health system for help. Barriers to
utilization reflect a combination of demand and supply factors, including: monetary poverty
combined with the high cost of receiving care16; limited physical coverage of the system;
language and cultural barriers; and the low quality of services offered. For those who do seek
treatment, the quality of curative services i s extremely poor: treatment guidelines are outdated
and often not followed; skilled human resources are scarce and often lack basic skills (low
salaries and difficult working conditions discourage the recruitment of trained personnel);
and facilities are often in poor condition and lack basic equipment. Financial resources are
scarce and inequitably distributed. Capacity of health sector workers, administrators and
managersis very low.


l5  Factors contributing to the high mortality rates include high fertility, incomplete immunization,
malnutrition, malaria, limited knowledge about proper health practices, low education and literacy levels
among women, and weak and poor quality health services.
l6 Cost recovery schemes have mushroomed in recent times. Costs are recovered for drugs (often as part of
a revolving fund), medical consumables, diagnostic tests, and treatment. However, this "formal" cost
recovery scheme did not fully replace the "under-the-counter" scheme that i s largely implemented all over
Lao PDR. Cost recovery rates are high, compared with those in other LDCs, and constitute a financial
barrier to access by the poor.

                                                     40



127.     Education. Gains made in access to education in the early 1990s were partially
reversed as a result of the 1998 financial crisis. While the trends are now positive, the
education system has not yet fully recovered. According to the Laos Expenditure and
Consumption Survey for 2003, the primary net enrollment rate i s 62 percent. While Ministry
of Education data show a higher net enrollment rate (81 percent), these data are based on
start-of-year enrollments and not on effective attendance. Differentials in accessing education
b y socio-economic group/district (ranked by wealth) are substantial. Net enrollment for the
poorest quintile i s only 45 percent, and repetition, dropout and primary completion rates are
much worse for poor districts than they are for rich ones.17 On the supply side, the main
causes of disparities in education outcomes include insufficient and inequitably distributed
infrastructure, a shortage of trained teachers, insufficient didactic material, and low
motivation due to low pay and salary arrears. On the demand side, the cost of education i s
highfor the poor. A Social Assessment carried out in2003 concluded that the cost of primary
education i s at least equivalent to the household cash income inthe poorest districts.

128.     Infrastructure. As discussed in the CEM, making further inroads in reducing poverty
in Lao PDR crucially depends on providing adequate infrastructure, notably in rural areas.
The percentage of paved roads inLao PDR (15 percent) i s among the lowest in the region, as
maintenance i s neglected. Improving rural roads in particular i s a high priority as fewer than
2 percent of rural roads are paved, most are impassable in the rainy season, and alternative
transport options are limited. This situation hampers the growth of the rural farm and non-
farm economies. Water and sanitation and electrification are equally important to improve
living standards. Currently, less that one-third of the population has access to safe drinking
water in rural areas, while many poor villages do not have access to energy. Simulations
conducted in the CEM, indicate that providing piped water and electricity to all villages
would lower poverty among the newly covered families by 8 percent.

129.     GovernmentResponse and Medium-TermVision.The authorities are fully aware
that achieving the ambitious social targets set in the NGPES and the 2020 Vision will require
significant increases in budget allocations to health and education. In addition, realizing the
aspirations of the people of Lao PDR will also entail increasing recurrent spending in social
sectors, reorienting sectoral budgets towards sub-sectors that offer the greatest pay-offs in
terms of poverty reduction, and paying particular attention to directing resources towards the
poorest districts.

130.     Health. The Government has made the improvement of healthoutcomes a critical priority
through the NGPES. The main policies of the GOL health strategy are to: (i)                   strengthen the
ability of health care providers; (ii)      improve community-based health promotion and disease
prevention; (iii)improve and expand hospitals at all levels; (iv) ensure quality, safety, and
rational use of drugs; (v) guaranteeeffective health administration; and (vi) provide self-sufficient
health financing. Program specific strategies have been developed also for malaria, tuberculosis
(TB), reproductive healthand HIV/AIDS.




l7For instance, in the 47 poorest districts in the country, less than 50 percent of children complete primary
schools, compared with an average of 70 percent in better-off districts. Repetition rates and dropouts are
also higher inpoorer than richer districts.

                                                   41


131.     Education. The Ministry of Education (MOE) Strategic Vision up to 2020, was laid
out in the Five-Year Development Plan (2000-2005), and, more recently, refined and
presented in the NGPES. The Government priorities in education are based on action geared
at: (i)reaching universal primary enrolment; (ii)eliminating illiteracy; (iii)expanding
vocational and higher education; (iv) strengthening science and technology, gradually raising
standards to international levels, and (v) improving the management of the education sector.
Cross-cutting issues (and strategies) include equitable access (infrastructure, private sector
development, programs targeting disadvantaged groups), quality and relevance (learning
materials, teacher training, curricula, linkages with private sector for vocational and technical
education) and decentralization (training).

132.     Infrastructure. The NGPES emphasizes the importance of breaking physical isolation,
according particular focus to establishing all-season access to poor districts. In the NGPES,
the improvement and development of rural infrastructure i s included as a cross cutting target
with a common objective to alleviate poverty, notably in rural areas and in the poorest
districts. The Government has made a strong start towards achieving sustainable maintenance
of the road system, as shown by the establishment of the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) in
2001and the successful implementation of three years of maintenance programs with support
from the Bank and other donors. WASA i s currently evaluating plans to provide small towns
with in water and sanitation services. The Ministry of Industry i s committed to expand access
to rural electrification through the "Off-Grid" Fund.

133.     Pay Reform. The Government i s committed to increasing public sector pay, eroded
by high levels of inflation during the Asian financial crisis. However, it has not prepared to
date a medium-term strategy to address this issue. Pay reforms have been announced as a
series of one-off measures, which do not take into account resource availability and have not
always been implemented.

134.     PRSCSupport to NGPES.The reform program supported by PRSCl-3 inthe effort
of aligning spending with NGPES priorities (health, education, infrastructure, and pay
reform) i s presented in the Policy Matrix (Component 2.1, Section A., B., C., and D.).The
expected results of the PRSC support in these areas are (i)           improved health and education
intermediate indicators; (ii)     expanded access to basic health and education services; (iii)
expanded access to basic infrastructure, in particular in small towns and rural areas; and (iv)
increased remuneration of civil servants, to achieve higher motivation and performance.

Box 6. Support strategy to the social sectors

The Association support to the social sectors follows a three-prong strategy: (a) addressing system-wide
structural problems (limited coverage; poor physical and human infrastructure; low quality of services; and
weak administrative and managerial capacity) via sector-specific investment loans (Health Services
Improvement Project US$14.87 million, under preparation; Second Education Development Project,
US$13 million, recently approved); (b) strengthening the public expenditure and financial management
framework for the social sectors, as well as delineating the role for the public sector in financing and
provision of services, through the PRSC; and (c) filling in key knowledge and capacity gaps through a
range of advisory and technical assistance activities (including AAA on public expenditure tracking,
student learning assessment training, education sectodservice delivery study, IDF support for capacity
building inHIV/AIDS, and analysis of health financing mechanisms for the poor).

                                                42


135.     Health and Education. Activities under PRSCl-3 build upon and consolidate
Government commitments inthe area of public expenditure, that is: increasing the proportion
of the national budget going to health and education sectors, from 5.5 and 11 percent under
PRSC-1(respectively), to 7.5 and 13 percent (respectively) by the time PRSC-3 is approved.
For health, measures are also geared at rationalizing the existing cost-recovery and fee
exemption system to ensure equitable access to health care for the poor. In health, PRSC-2
and PRSC-3 will also support the introduction of measures to strengthen staff incentives,
particularly for service in difficult areas. In the health and education sector, a key aim i s to
ensure that teachers and health care workers are paid on time. As a prior action for PRSC-1,
80 percent of teachers and health care workers are now being paid within 2 months of the due
payment date. This interval will be reduced to zero by the time PRSC-3 i s approved. Lastly,
PRSC-2and 3 will support the piloting and evaluation of community school grant program to
lower the cost of education for poor communities.

136.     Infrastructure. Inthe power field, actions to be carried out before PRSC-2 include the
endorsement of the Off-Grid Fund Decree - through which the current off-grid purchasers
repayment account will be transformed into an independently managed fund, to support
off-grid operations - as well as the release of funds and the outsourcing of the Fund
management. Before PRSC-3, this fund should be transformed into a more versatile, totally
independently run and self sustained Rural Electrification Fund able to attract and manage
other donors' funds and private investments.

137.     Prior to PRSC-2, MCTPC will prepare a plan to develop small town water supply, in
line with the Government's policy No.37/PM on development of the water supply sector, and
a comprehensive policy and plan for the sanitation sector. These will be submitted to the
National Assembly before PRSC-3. PRSCs also support an annual increase to the fuel levy
for the Road Maintenance Fund by no less than 50 KipsAiter, which will provide the much
needed financial resources for annual preservation and sustainable management of the road
assets. Additionally, a legislation on rural transport services should be drafted and submitted
to the National Assembly before PRSC-3.

138.     Pav reform. Actions to be carried out before PRSC-2 approval include the
formulation of a policy paper and ensuring that adequate provision for pay reform i s made in
forward expenditure estimates. Implementation of a civil service census i s tentatively
scheduled for 2006, though the scope and implementation arrangements for such a census
have yet to be determined.

         2.2 Monitoring the Alignment of Spending to Pro-poor NGPES Priorities

139.     Kev issues. The statistical system inLao PDR involves several agencies, and i s based
on a `vertical' structure that relies on the province-district-village reporting system. Within
this largely decentralized structure, the National Statistical Center (NSC) has a coordinating
mandate and is responsible for the compilation and dissemination of national accounts,
production, wholesale and retail trade, and price statistics, as well as socio-demographic
statistics. The NSC i s still in the process of putting into effect the procedures required to
institutionalize a modern statistical system for generating adequate statistics that meet
analytical and policy needs, and has not been given sufficient staffing and budgetary
resources to undertake a number of routine statistical activities, including business and

                                                 43


household surveys. Although some progress has been made in improving the quality of
poverty monitoring, current data dissemination practice does not yet provide for the timely
availability o f poverty data, as well as its access to the broader public.

140.    On the production side, new data needs cannot be satisfied solely through the
administrative reporting system and require using more advanced survey methodologies,
such as Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS). Information on actual budgetary
spending of the center, provinces and districts in Lao PDR on health and education i s
currently scarce, while budget allocations are a poor proxy for services actually reaching the
intended beneficiaries. Data collection and quality are further complicated by budget
decentralization. PETS are able to track the flow of resources through the various
administrative layers in order to determine how much of the originally allocated resources
reach each level. By revealing whether budget allocations reach the intended facilities, it
sheds light on issues related to governance and accountability.

141.    Government ResponseandMedium-TermVision.PETS. On April 21,2004, GOL
approved PETS. The objectives of the Lao-PETS are to: (a) understand and analyze current
public expenditure management practice in order to advise GOL on how to improve service
delivery and successfully meet the goals of the NGPES; and (b) serve as an independent
monitoring tool to assist government in improving accountability by disseminating
information and engaging service delivery beneficiaries. On October 6, 2004, a Steering
Committee, a Working Group and a Secretariat were set up to support PETS.

142.    "Poverty Data". Socio-demographic statistics (population, health, education, poverty,
and labor market statistics) are areas of priority concern for the monitoring of the NGPES
and measuring progress towards the MDGs.Lao PDR follows international recommendations
inconducting a population and housingcensus every ten years, with the past two takingplace
in 1985 and 1995, and the next one scheduled for April 2005. The system of regular (every
five years) Lao Expenditure and Income Surveys are of good quality and the surveys are
conducted with a high enough periodicity so as to provide adequate measurement of poverty
and correlates of poverty on which to base poverty reduction policies.

143.    In July 2004, the National Statistical Center (NSC), the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and the World Bank agreed
on a 15-month collaboration for the Lao PDR Poverty Assessment Project 2004/5 (LAOPA).
LAOPA i s analytical support for the poverty reduction strategy of the (NGPES). It aims to
better understand the dimensions that characterize poverty in Lao PDR and the ways in which
the Government, supported by donors, can help work to reduce them. As part of this project,
the 2002/3 household survey data was released to the respective parties. The new "Village
Book" system of household and poverty measurement that i s being introduced could provide
household and poverty data inconsiderable detail.

144.    PRSC Support to the NGPES. The monitoring of the effort of aligning spending
with NGPES priorities (health, education, and infrastructure) i s presented in the Policy
Matrix (Component 2.2, Sections A. and B.). The expected results of the reform program
supported by the PRSC in these areas include better informed policymaking about the
effectiveness of social sector spending; and enhanced data transparency and accountability.

                                               44


145.     PETS. The Ministries of Finance, Education, Health, Department of Public
Administration and National Statistical Center have launched Public Expenditure Tracking
Survey (PETS) in health and education before approval of PRSC-1. This exercise will be
institutionalized duringPRSC-2 and PRSC-3.

146.     "Poverty Data". The NSC and other ministries are making an effort to increase the
dissemination of socio-demographic data. Government plans the adoption of statistical
legislation to ensure the use of international standards in producing and disseminating data.
The finalization of a feasibility study i s envisaged under PRSC-2, while the drafting of the
FirstStatistical Law is expectedbefore PRSC-3 approval.


Component 3: Sustained Growth

                        3.1 Strengthening Private Sector Development

147.     Key Issues. Business Environment. The comparative cost of doing business in Lao
PDR i s high. While Lao PDR has cheaper labor costs, it has higher average electricity,
telecommunication, and rental costs compared to other East Asian countries. Medium and
large enterprises find it difficult to operate their business due to the following constraints:
cumbersome and time-consuming regulatory procedures and out-dated legislative framework,
limited provincial authority capacity and over-bearing inspections regime; limited domestic
markets; poor infrastructure especially the poor quality roads and bridges incapable of
supporting container trucks for export to regional markets; limited market information; and
low levels of entrepreneur capacity. The recent "Doing Business" database of the World
Bank shows that while the number of procedures involved i s roughly comparable to other
countries, the number o f days involved in starting up a business in Lao PDR i s almost four
times the regional average. Farmers have difficulty in getting their produce to market or
transporting it across the border.

148.     Financial Sector. Financial services available for businesses and general population
are limited. The insurance market i s underdeveloped. Microfinance i s important for a country
such as Lao PDR, especially in rural areas where the majority of the population and the poor
live. However, this industry i s at its infant stage: only one quarter of potential micro
borrowers and savers has access to micro-finance services.

149.     Government Response and Medium-term Vision. The Government has been
reducing restrictions on the private sector for some time, especially for manufacturing,
mining and hydro-power projects. The NGPES recognizes the critical role of the private
sector and highlights its importance in current and future growth and poverty-reduction in the
country. Specific measures sought in the NGPES to promote private sector development
include better information and consultation; legal, regulatory, and administrative streamlining
(e.g., business registration and licensing, import and export approvals); macroeconomic
reforms; and better coordination and management capacity (e.g., enforcement of bankruptcy,
debt recovery, tax and other laws).

150.     Business Environment. As outlined in the NGPES, the Government in the medium-
term plans to: (i)improve the business environment by creating a predictable, transparent and

                                               45


favorable policy environment and level playing field; (ii)remove remaining biases in
administrative procedures and regulations that favor SOEs over domestic or foreign private
firms; and (iii)strengthen market institutions, including dispute resolution and contract
enforcement. This i s important not only for promoting growth in the manufacturing sector,
but also in agriculture.

151.     Inrecent months, the authorities have taken a number of measures to promote both
domestic and foreign private investments and improve the environment for doing business in
the country. Domestic and Foreign Investment Laws have been recently revised and adopted.
The new investment laws provide equal tax incentives and a level playing field for both local
and foreign investors. The new domestic investment law gives local investors a better and
fairer deal compared to the old one while ensuring that they will receive the same incentives
and other treatment as foreign investors. Measures have been also taken to attract FDI,
through the creation of a one-stop service.

152.     Financial Sector. In addition to restructuring banks and improving regulation and
supervision of banks (see Component 1.2 Strengthening the Banking Sector), in Lao PDR it
i s also important to promote competition in the financial sector and to encourage privately-
owned financial institutions, including banks. This applies to banks and to insurance
companies but also to the micro-finance sector. The GOL envisages a diverse, sustainable,
competitive non-state owned microfinance institutions (MFI) sector, for which a legal
framework i s beingdeveloped.

153.     PRSC Support to NGPES. The reform program supported by PRSC1-3 in the
strengthening of private sector development i s presented in the Policy Matrix (Component
3.1, Section A,, B.). The objectives of the PRSCsin these areas are to: (i)  foster a competitive
environment for private sector development; (ii)    instill greater confidence amongst private
sector operators; and (iii)increase diversity and competition of non-state financial
institutions.

154.     Under Business Environment, the Government has revised the Domestic and Foreign
Investment Laws in October 2004 and moved from annual to semi-annual dialogue between
the Government and the private sector before PRSC-1. The revisions to the investment laws
have extended the investment term for foreign investors to 50 (from 15) years, required a more
rapid screening of investment applications in terms of specific number of days, decentralized
investment approvals to the provinces for smaller size investment applications, and made more
explicit and clear the guidelines on land rights and uses. Nevertheless, these revised Laws fall
short of their comparators: approval i s still very discretionary; even if discretion will be
exercised quickly, decisions do not follow a negative list of sectors and there are not adequate
dispute resolution processes. Also, the availability of incentives for investors i s not
sufficiently circumscribed by a central control, to ensure that the tax base i s not eroded.

155.     Before PRSC-2 and PRSC-3, the Government plans to make further improvements to
the investment environment. The Ministry of Commerce has identified several business laws
that need to be revised. The Committee on Planning and Investment plans to do further work
on the implementing regulations for the revised investment law, including rationalization of
incentives, as well as other changes that would further improve the investment climate. The
agreement between Government and the private sector on more frequent consultations will be
reflected in increased frequency of consultations in the periodbefore PRSC-2 and PRSC-3.

                                                46



156.      Inthe Financial Sector, before PRSC-1, the Decree of the President on Commercial
Banks has been submitted by the PM Office to the Standing Committee of the National
Assembly for discussion and approval. The proposed amendments intendto ensure a level of
playing field, reduced barriers to entry, and competition for non-state commercial banks. In
addition, the BOL has disseminated in three provinces the Rural and Microfinance policy and
action plan that was developed under the F M A C and approved by the Prime Minister's
Office. By PRSC-2, an appropriate legal instrument (BOL's instruction or Prime Minister's
Decree) will be issued to establish a legal framework for effective implementation of the
Rural and Microfinance policy and action plan. The implementation regulation aims to allow
a diversity of microfinance institutions (MFI)both in form and ownership to be establishedin
Lao PDR, and a full autonomy in their operations, especially MFIs being able to charge
commercial interest rates. The BOL and MOF are also initiating work that would lead to the
development of a medium-term Financial Sector Strategy and Action Plan, that would be
subject to consultation with relevant stakeholders before it i s submitted to the PM Office.
Finally, the amendments to remaining legal and regulatory impediments to competition by
non-state financial institutions, will developed by BOL and MOF in consultation with key
stakeholders and submitted by BOL to the PM office by PRSC-2. Before approval of PRSC-
3, the authorities should disseminate and begin the implementation of the financial sector
strategy.

                       3.2 Accelerating Regional and Global Integration

157.      Kev Issues. Trade. Going forward, it will be important for Lao PDR to improve trade
facilitation and make progress on its commitments under the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) to improve its regional linkages. Lao PDR's preferences and commitments to AFTA
are likely to be critical. Its further integration into the global economy will depend on its
success in strengtheningbilateral and multilateral trade relations and accession to the WTO.

158.      AFTA membership cames obligations to liberalize trade with other members on set
schedules and according to potential imports classified on four lists, including (i) Inclusion
                                                                                   an
L i s t (IL) of goods immediately eligible for preferential treatment under certain conditions;
and (ii)a Temporary Exclusion List (TEL) of goods which must be moved to the IL
according to a set schedule. Each member specifies a Common Effective Preferential Tariff
(CEPT) for each ILand TEL item, and ILitems can be imported at this rate-exempt from all
non-tariff barriers-under three conditions.

159.      The four new ASEAN (ASEAN-4) members are committed to moving all TEL items
to the IL and setting all IL rates to 0-5 percent by 2008. By May 2001, the ASEAN-6 had
included 98 percent of all tariff lines in CEPT arrangements and 93 percent of these had tariff
rates in the 0-5 percent range. This creates a large incentive for Lao PDR to move items onto
the IL with rates of 20 percent or less to take advantage of the preferential rates from the
ASEAN-6.

160.      Government Response and Medium-term Vision. Trade. Lao PDR has been
integrating gradually into the world economy since 1989. The reform process accelerated
after Lao PDR's accession to ASEAN and the joining of AFTA in July 1997. The country
started to implement the AFTA Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme in
January 1998, and will complete the liberalization schedule by 2008, reducing its tariff on

                                                    47


imports from ASEAN countries to 0-5 percent by 2008. Lao PDR signed a bilateral trade
agreement with U.S.A. in 2003, which require the Government to open up services over time.
At the same time, Lao PDR was granted Normal Trade Relations by the US Congress in
November 2004. The Government has recently applied for WTO accession, and the first
working party meeting was heldrecently.

161.     PRSC Support to the NGPES.The reform programsupportedby PRSC1-3 includes
accelerating regional and global integration, and i s presented in the Policy Matrix
(Component 3.2, Section A+).The main aim i s to liberalize the trade regime to foster
economic growth, and to gain greater access to export markets and technology.

162.     Trade. Before approval of PRSC-1, the PM Decree on Trade Competition became
effective, removing all restrictions on the movement of goods across provinces. In addition,
the Government moved 435 items from Lao PDR Temporary Exclusion List into Inclusion
List (IL),raising the coverage to 84 percent of ILtariff lines, and reducing tariffs for imports
from AFTA countries to 0-5 percent for 87 percent of the IL tariff lines. In PRSC-2, all
remaining items will be moved to the Inclusion List and further reduction in tariffs will take
place. Actions supported by PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 concern the WTO accession process.

                               3.3 Improving ResourceManagement

163.     Key Issues.Revenue management. Rural and natural resources management remains
a concern for the government and its revenue contribution remains crucial to the budget.
Growth and poverty reduction prospects for the Lao PDR are heavily dependent on its natural
resources. Deforestation and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and
degradation of agricultural lands are serious environmental challenges that are directly
related to the livelihood security of the predominantly poor rural population. There i s an
urgent priority to undertake measures to protect the fragile watershed environment associated
with developed and potential hydroelectric projects.

164.     Forest Management. Lao PDR i s well endowed with forest biodiversity and i s
recognized as the host of unique and globally endangered species of plants and animals.
Forestry, however, does not contribute adequately to national development or to poverty
reduction. Incentives facing resource users do not reflect the real scarcity of forest resources,
leading to excessive demands and overexploitation."

165.     A source of structural weakness originates in the country's management of its
forestry sector, in the face o f overwhelming capacity constraints and limitations through
public agencies. This has led to adverse impacts on the budget, the SOEs working in this
sector, and ultimately on the banking sector. Redirecting the role and performance of the
public forestry agencies from efforts at direct management to a supporting and facilitating
approach will require considerable effort and discipline in controlling and managing
entrenched interests and privileged elites, which benefit from the rents generated under
existing policies and institutional arrangements.


  Forestry royalties, as a share of government revenue, have increased from 20 percent inthe mid-1990s to
6 percent of tax revenues and 5 percent of all revenues in2001. Collectionrates are low, around 50 percent,
and royalty revenues have been declining since the mid-1990s. Over the last five years, the Treasury has
realized only about one third of the estimated market value of the timber harvested.

                                               48



166.    An additional key concern in the forestry sector i s the management and protection of
the country's biodiversity resources. A large proportion of the forest resource has been
allocated to a system of National Biodiversity Conservation Areas (NBCAs) that presently
totals nearly three million hectares. The regulatory framework for NBCA management i s
currently weak and i s inconsistent with international standards and nomenclature. This leaves
the protection of NBCAs uncertain and puts at risk associated investments ininfrastructure.

167.    Government Response and Medium-Term Vision. Revenue Management.
Revenue collection in Lao P.D.R. i s below its potential, but i s not unusually low by regional
standards. Weak technical capacity and highly fragmented revenue administration are the
main structural weaknesses affecting revenue performance. An increase in the revenue ratio
i s possible with the implementation of comprehensive reforms centered around the
introduction o f the VAT.

168.    Forest Management. The government recognizes the full range of environmental,
economic and social benefits that a well-managed forestry sector will provide. It has
tightened its approach to forest law enforcement and control, but i s severely handicapped by
capacity constraints, confused institutional responsibilities, and lack of local participation in
all aspects of forest law enforcement. The government's top priorities under the period of the
F M A C program focused on bringing order and discipline to the exploitation of the country's
production forest resources. Untilthen these areas were not adequately mapped, inventoried,
or their harvest properly planned and organized.

169.    Looking beyond the W A C program, the government i s committed to build on the
results achieved to date and continue to develop forestry as a sustainable source of growth
and public revenue and a means for poverty reduction. To support this, Lao PDR should
continue its efforts to introduce more market-oriented timber sales methods, develop policies
to reduce excess capacity in the wood-processing sector, and complete the regulatory
framework for forestry envisioned under the Forestry Law with well formulated
ImplementingRegulations covering all forest types and management systems under the law.

170.    Investments need to continue in reforestation, plantation development and watershed
management. These efforts are vital to the development of alternative sources of raw
material, and to the protection of existing and planned downstream infrastructure. As with the
management of natural production forests and conservation areas, the government should
employ participatory methods and will consult with a range of stakeholders to ensure broad-
based support for sustainable development. In the future, the authorities are called upon to
improve the quality of management of these areas by, among other things, employing
participatory approaches that combine conservation with tangible contributions to the
livelihoods of local people.

171.    PRSC Support to the NGPES. The reform program supported by PRSC1-3 in
improving resource management i s presented in the Policy Matrix (Component 3.3, Sections
A. and B.). The main objectives are: (i)    strengthen the Government's fiscal policy and tax
collection; and (ii) achieve a sustainable, participatory forest management.

172.    Revenue Management. Actions under PRSC-2 include Government regulations
aimed at centralizing revenue and custom administration. Actions under PRSC-3 support a
revision of tax regulation and the introduction of a Value Added Tax (VAT).

173.    Forest Management. Before PRSC-1, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
(MAF) channeled revenues from timber sales to communities under valid participatory
forestry arrangement, completing the requirements for the independent certification of
sustainable forest management in pilot village forests in Khammouane and Savannakhet
provinces. Before approval of PRSC-2, the Forest Sector Monitoring system should be fully
operational with at least one report issued for public review and comment. B y PRSC-3, the
Government should finalize and implement the policy and action plan for timber marketing
and revenue sharing.

                                              51



B. Participation and Implementation

176.    Following the example of NGPES consultations, the PRSC design was discussed in a
series of workshops and retreats, held both in and outside the capital city. The Government
set up a PRSC counterpart group, headed by the Director General of the Budget Department
of the Ministry of Finance. Dialogue with the Bank team was intense and focused on
relevance, feasibility, and timing of each policy action. The workshops included participants
from the Government, and were opened to representatives of development partners (EC,
ADB, JBIC, and JICA).

C.Monitoring and Evaluation

177.    The overall objective of a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system for the PRSC i s
to ensure easy and timely access to relevant data in order to monitor progress, evaluate the
impact of the poverty reduction strategy and help defining new orientations or make changes
based on analysis of current data. M&E activities will be coordinated by the PRSC
counterpart team headed by the Ministry o f Finance and the National Statistical Center
(NSC), hosted at CPI. A M&Eplan covering the PRSC series, including a table detailing key
outcomes envisagedby the end of the PRSC series i s under preparation (see Table 5).

178.    More in general, in 2004, NSC, ADB, Swedish SIDA, and the World Bank agreed on
LAOPA 200415 (see paragraph 143). LAOPA will provide analytical support for monitoring
implementation of the NGPES and producing the NGPES Progress Report, which will also
allow the Bank and Government to assess progress on the PRSC front.

D. Capacity Enhancement

179.    Recognizing the strong NGPES emphasis on capacity, the Bank has identified Lao
PDR as apilot country for a special focus on Capacity Enhancement (CE).

180.    As per the CAS CE strategy, the PRSCs are to provide a platform to build capacity
for better prioritization and sequencing of policy and institutional reforms, while project-
based technical assistance will focus on strengthening selected organizational (systems and
processes) and individual capacities. Going forward, CE assessment and monitoring will be
conducted in partnership with local learning and training entities. In order to clarify the CAS
CE strategy, Annex G. clarifies the institutional capacity issues to be addressed by the
PRSCs, as well as how other interventions will support improvements in organizational
systems and individual skills.

181.    The CAS CE strategy i s to reinforce a shift from the traditional focus on
improvement of skills at the individual level to a stronger focus on buildingthe competencies
of organizations and creating institutional incentives that enable organizations and
individuals to achieve and sustain development results. PRSCs will play their CE role at the
level of institutional incentives. The main focus will be on service delivery, and capacity
enhancement will address needs at that level, rather than simply in the central administration.

E. Fiduciary Aspects

182.     Country Financial Accountability Assessment. The 2002 Public Expenditure Review
and Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) Report on the Lao PDR,prepared
jointly with the IMF and ADB, concluded that the basic financial management systems are
weak and that overall fiduciary risk in Lao PDR i s high. The Government accepted the
CFAA recommendations and started implementing the recommended actions under FMAC
and FMCB and with support from other donors (notably, ADB). Progress in implementing
recommended actions i s contributing to reducing the risk, which however remains high.
Major recommendations of the CFAA aimed at improving the public financial management
systems, including the efficiency and transparency of use of public resources, are reflected in
the PEMSP (see Annex F.) supported by the PRSC. The challenge will be in effectively
implementing the recommendations and active monitoring of the strengthening program
initiatives by the Government i s critical. Enhancing and strengthening the public financial
management systems i s a medium to long-term process, which will extend beyond the period
of the envisaged PRSCs. In view of the high fiduciary risks, dedicated accounts for the both
foreign and local currency proceeds of the credit of the Borrower will be necessary, together
with additional reportingrequirements and, if considered necessary, special audits.

 183.    IMFSafeguard Assessment. The IMFSafeguardAssessment of the Central Bank has
classified the risk as being medium-high in all five categories on which the assessment was
based: external audit mechanism, legal structure and independence, financial reporting
framework, internal audit mechanism and internal control system. With the fiduciary risk
assessed as high, additional measures in relation to audit requirements have been
incorporated into the fiduciary requirements of the PRSC.

 184.    Disbursement, Reporting; and Auditing Arrangements. The Borrower i s Lao PDR.
The proceeds of the Credit and of the Grant will be disbursed upon Effectiveness of the
Development Financing Agreement. The Borrower will open and maintain a dedicated
Deposit Account in U S dollars at the Central Bank, as part of the general foreign currency
reserves of the government, and the proceeds of the Credit and of the Grant will be deposited
by the Association into that dedicated Deposit Account. An equivalent amount will be
converted into local currency and credited to a dedicated GOL Central Treasury account that
i s used to finance budget expenditures.

 185.    Through the Ministry of Finance, the GOL will (i) to IDA the amount received
                                                           report
into the Deposit Account at the Central Bank; (ii)      provide confirmation of the amounts
withdrawn from the Deposit Account and the equivalent amounts credited in local currency
to the Central Treasury Account available to finance budgeted expenditures, including the
date and namehumber of the government's bank account into which the local currency
amounts have been deposited; (iii)  ensure that the proceeds of the Credit and of the Grant are
used for budgeted public expenditures except for purposes or items on IDA'S`negative list'
as agreed duringnegotiations and specified in the Development Financing Agreement. If any
part of the proceeds of the Credit or of the Grant are used for ineligible purposes, as defined
inthe Development Financing Agreement, the Bank will require the GOL to either return the
amount to the Deposit Account or the Central Treasury Account to be used for eligible
purposes, or refund the amount directly to IDA. The dedicated accounts and related fund

                                              53


flows to and from these accounts will be independently audited upon request by IDA in
accordance with terms of reference to be agreed with IDA.

186.    The processes and controls described above are intended to mitigate the risks that
IDA funds do not arrive at their intended destination, are not used for their intended
purposes, and are not subject to the Borrower's rules and regulations.

F. Environmental, Forests, and other Natural ResourceAspects

187.    The proposed PRSC supports a number of actions aimed at institutional and policy
reform in environment and natural resources management especially forest management.
Recognizing the weak government policy framework and institutional capacity to manage
and monitor impacts from such actions, comprehensive support i s provided from ongoing
projects (Sustainable Forestry and Rural Development Project and the Second Phase of the
Road Maintenance Program) as well as projects under preparation (NT2, NTSEP, and Lao
Environment and Social Project, LENS). The second phase of the SIDA support to strengthen
environmental management capability of the Science Technology and Environment Agency
(STEA) i s being considered. Although, environmental impacts of some proposed actions
such as trade liberalization, increased water and electricity tariffs and fuel levy, and
liquidationhale of non-performing SOE, in particular BPKP, are not expected to be
significant. Inlight of the aforementioned, the proposed PRSC i s unlikely to cause significant
effects on the country's environment and natural resources. However, it i s important that
relevant agencies or third party organizations carry out regular monitoring of applicable
indicators. Information regarding environmental regulation, policies, and institutional
changes has been documented in the analytical works associated with ongoing projects such
as NT2, Sustainable Forestry and Rural Development, e.g. the first issue of the Lao
EnvironmentMonitor 2005.

G. Benefits and Risks

188.    Jointly prepared with the Government and incollaboration with other donors, the first
Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSC-1) provides: (i) overarching framework for a
                                                              an
programmatic three-year policy reform program; and (ii)   performance indicators aligned with
NGPES and CAS objectives. The series of PRSCs will assist Lao PDR to: (a) make
monitorable progress in realizing the objectives o f the NGPES - and reaching the MDGs - by
strengthening management and impact of public resources; and (b) enhance the sustainability
of its development efforts through the promotion of economic growth.

189.    Benefits. PRSC-1 aims at ensuring that public resources are both available and
effectively used to meet Lao PDR's development outcomes. Three broad benefits can be
identified: First, improved PEM performance. PRSC-1 strengthens the Public Expenditure
Management (PEM) system that allocates, executes, and monitors public expenditures,
maximizing this way both efficiency and transparency of existing public resources in
pursuing the country's development goals; Second, alignment of public expenditures with
pro-poor NGPES goals. PRSC-1 supports measures geared at redirecting the allocation of
public expenditures towards the provision of health, education, and basic services that enable
human development outcomes; and Third, enhanced environment for growth and revenue

                                                54


generation. PRSC-1promotes sustainable growth, through an improved policy-framework for
private sector, trade, and natural resource management.

190.     The nature of the PRSC as Bank's financing instrument, entails three additional
benefits: Fourth, policy prioritization and donor coordination. The proposed reform program
will help Lao PDR and donors focus on measures with the greatest pay-offs in terms of
poverty reduction. Fifth, predictability of funding and donor support. The PRSCs will
contribute to improvements in budget predictability, especially if other donors are to align
their activities with the national budget cycle; and Sixth, budget support within macro
stability. PRSC-1 underpins the Government's objective to maintain a sound macroeconomic
environment and accelerate growth, while providing external resources for the execution of
the 2005 budget.

191.     Risks. Five main risks could affect the impact of the proposed operation: First, the
authorities' commitment to reforms in the past has been uneven, resulting in poor policy
implementation performance and unclear accountability between institutions and levels of
administration. This risk is mitigated by: (i) the growing momentum - and commitment - to a
broad-based program of reforms in the past few years; (ii) the wide participation through
which the NGPES was formulated, and the sustained involvement of the authorities in the
design of the proposed operation; (iii) the policy dialogue fostered by the operation; and (iv)
the commitment to world trade integration, with the joining of ASEAN and AFTA in 1998,
the current implementation of the AFTA liberalization schedule, and the application for
WTO accession.

192.     Second, a weak PFM system leads to a high fiduciary risk. The system i s
characterized by poor coordination between planning and budgeting, lack of transparency,
and weak central control during budget preparation and execution, all of which undermine
efforts to enforce fiscal discipline and the policy alignment of spending. The inflow of
revenues from the proposed Nam Theun 2 hydro project (NT2), which will lead to increased
resources for poverty reduction and environmental protection programs from 2009 onward,
highlights the urgency of public expenditure management reform. This risk is mitigated by:
(i) the commitment on the part of the authorities to implement key recommendations of the
PER and CFAA, and to carry out a public expenditure tracking survey and follow-up analytic
work; (ii) the satisfactory implementation of the measures supported by the FMAC operation;
(iii) the Government-prepared Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program
(PEMSP - see Annex F.), and the Prime Minister's Office approval of two long-term
technical assistance posts to support its implementation; and (iv) the commitment to develop
a clear and transparent framework to ensure that NT2 revenues, in line with NGPES
objectives, are allocated to poverty reduction and environmental programs that meet
transparency standards.

193.     Third, provincial autonomy hinders implementation of national policies and an
equitable distribution of resources. Provinces have authority over revenue collection and
budget execution, and report sporadically to the central Government. Furthermore, provincial
treasuries often retain revenues intended for the central administration. As a result, provincial
autonomy: (i)  exacerbates central-treasury cash constraints; and (ii) to wide variation in
                                                                      leads
per capita expenditures on priority sectors between provinces. This risk is mitigated by: (i)
the review of the decentralization process currently undertaken, with technical support from
UNDP, by the Prime Minister's Office; and (ii) the Government's commitment to carry out

                                               55


the PFM reform program, which - underpinned by ongoing analytical work (see paragraph
87) - will mitigate present and future risks and foster dialogue on provincial PFM.

194.    Fourth, short-term fiscal unsustainability could result in the diversion of PRSC funds
(not earmarked) to cover losses from the budget, SCBs and SOEs. In particular, SCBs are
still vulnerable to pressures to extend credits on a non-commercial basis. This risk is
mitigated by: (i) the Government's explicit commitment to achieve budget sustainability in
the ongoing Budget process; and (ii) the implementation of measures aiming at maintaining
close oversight over Public Budget and SCBs' restructuring; and (iii) the finalization of the
external audit of the state-ownedbanks' 2003 accounts.

195.    Fifth, severe capacity constraints in the civil service, due to the lack of qualified
personnel and low pay and incentives, leading to weak administrative ability. This risk is
mitigated by: (i) an explicit recognition on the part of the Government of these weaknesses in
the NGPES, by placing Capacity Enhancement (CE) at the center of its reform program. As a
result, capacity i s being strengthened through reforms and by the active engagement of other
donors; and (ii) the CAS will include an explicit focus on CE, and PRSC-1, in its Annex G.,
highlights concrete CE measures to strengthen implementation capabilities at the institutional
level.

                              LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY


       Mr.James D.Wolfensohn
       President
       The World Bank
       Washington, D.C.




       Dear Mr.Wolfensohn:




       1. On behalf of the Government o f Lao PDR, Iam writing to let you know that our
       aspiration is to be able to allocate increasing amounts of public resources towards the
       improvement o f social outcomes. We want to achieve rapid economic growth in order to
       improve the living conditions o f the Lao poor population. W e are committed to halving
       poverty by 2015 and graduating from the status of least-developed country by 2020. The
       development strategy to achieve these goals has been articulated in the five-year (2001-05)
       National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP),            the Interim Poverty Reduction
       Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and the recentIy prepared National Growth and Poverty Eradication
       Strategy (KGPES, the Lao PRSP).

       2. Our continued commitment to reforms i s articulated inthe NGPE.S.The NGPES commits
       the Government to continued reforms in the areas o f macroeconomic management, public
       expenditure management, state-enterprises, financial sector, private sector development,
       international and regional integration as well as delivery o f public social services and
       targeted poverty reduction.

       3. The NGPES - based on the NSEDP           -is a document prepared by the Government and
       developed through extensive consultations at central as well as locaI levels, with financial
       support from the UNDP, the World Bank, and other donors. The consultative process was
       broadened to increase participation by civil society and the private sector. In addition to
       consultations with mass organizations, such as the Lao Women's Union, discussions were
       held with the private sector, academics, and the provinces. Consultatioiis with donor partners
       were carried out in the context o f the 8'' Roundtable meetings. To ensure the success and to
       oversee the process, the NGPES Committee was formed, and drew membership from key
      ministries, agencies, and representatives from several mass organizations. The document was
       submitted to the National Assembly in October 2003, which approved it after a four-day
      workshop.

4. Objectives o f the NGPES. NGPES establishes a framework for future, reforms and                '


makes our development priorities more explicit and transparent. These priorities take into
account the multi-dimensional nature o f poverty alleviation, and are detailed in the concrete
actions proposed inthe NGPES matrix. This strategy, inparticular, seeks to:

        Maintain macroeconomic stability by increasing revenue and ensuring appropriate
        fiscal and monetary policy;
        Deepen structural reforms in the following areas: public expenditure management,
        financial sector, SOEs, private sector, trade, public administration, and development
        ofthe legal system;
        Invest in the social sectors to expand access to basic education and health services
        and improve Lao's social sector outcomes;
        Invest in infrastructure such as roads, power, and water supply, and expand access to
        these services;
        Invest inrural development and natural resource management-including        support for
        agricultural, mining, forestry and hydropower development; and
        Strengthen capacity.

5. NGPES implementation will be selectivelv supported bv the PRSCs. The proposed series
of PRSCs wilI assist us to make monitorable progress in realizing the objectives laid out in
the NGPES, and to enhance the sustainability o f         OUT development efforts through the
promotiono f economic growth. The policy reform program articulated inthe PRSCs focuses
in a selective fashion on key areas of the NGPES, by drawing on the conclusions and
recommendations of core diagnostic Economic and Sector Work (ESWs) realized in recent
years by the Bank incooperationwith us and other donors.

6. The prouosed PRSCs: rationale and benefits. The proposed series o f single-tranche
operations, the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), was prepared jointly with the
World Bank team and in collaboration with other donors, and is in support o f the ongoing
reforms as highlighted in the NGPES. The PRSCs will assist us to: (i)make monitorable
progress in realizing the objectives of the NGPES           - and reaching the MDGs - by
strengthening the management of public sector resources; and (ii)enhance the sustainability
o f our development efforts through the promotion of economic growth. The proposed
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC-I), the first o f a series o f single-tranche operations,
provides: a) an overarching framework for a three-year policy reform program; and b)
performance indicators aligned withNGPES objectives.

7. In line with our objectives and in coordination with NGPES implementation, PRSC-1
aims at ensuring that public resources are both available and effectively used to meet Lao
PDRs development outcomes. We identify four broad benefits:

8. First, PRSC-1 strengthens the Public Financial Management (PFM) systems that
allocate, execute, and monitor public expenditures, maximizing this way both efficiency and
transparency of existing public resources in pursuing the country's development goals;
Indeed, we believe PF'M policy reforms are essential to ensure that the proposed NT2project
ultimately contributes to poverty reduction and human deveIopment goals.

9. Second, PRSC-1 supports measures geared at aligning resources with pro-poor NGPES
goals by: a) redirecting the allocation ofpublic expenditures towards the provision o f health,

                                               2

education, and basic services that enable human development outcomes; and b) providing a
neededvehicle for cross-sectoral policy consultation by means o f addressing multiple reform
fionts (i.e.:, better public expenditure management and service delivery).

10. Third, the proposed reform program will help us in policy prioritization, capacity
building, and donor coordination, by: a) focusing on measures with the greatest pay-offs in
term o f poverty reduction; b) contributing to a broad-based approach to capacity
enhancement, linking policy and institutional reforms with project-based lending and
technical assistance; c) helping donor alignment around our policy and institutional reform
agenda and, therefore, enhancing budgetpredictability, especially if other donors are to align
their activities withthe national budgetcycle.

11. Fourth, the reform program is geared at macro stability and growth: a) PRSC-1
underpins our objective to maintain a sound macroeconomic environment and accelerate
growth, whiIe providing external resources for the execution of our 2005 budget; and b) the
PRSCs aim at increasing available resources by enhancing the environment for resource
generation, and promoting sustainable growth via a stronger private sector, greater trade
volume, and greater capacity to manage natural resources.

                    Action Planfor Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector

1.      Objectives

The objectives of the Action Plan are to achieve: (a) financial sustainability of EdL's operations through
efficiency improvements and gradual reduction of subsidies while also delivering affordable electricity to as
many Lao consumers as possible; and (b) a tariff structure providing correct incentives for efficient usage of
energy.

2.      Principles

EdL should be financially viable in its own right without having to rely on revenues from its export
earnings.

The provision of electricity services entails obligations of both suppliers and consumers. Suppliers
should provide an adequate service, and consumers should pay for it.

Capital subsidies from Government for rural electrification and other socially oriented projects could
be justified, though not for generation and transmission. Operating subsidies should be avoided if at all
practicable.

Financial covenants have been previously agreed with IDA and ADB and it is important that EdLmeet
these covenants as indicators of satisfactory financial performance.

The price of electricity is a signal to consumers about its value. Cost-based electricity prices contribute
towards economic allocation of resources on the supply and demand sides.           When the price is set below
the cost of supply (when it is subsidized), consumers respond to this signal by over-consuming.


    0   Since EdL exports to, or imports from, EGAT in all of its grids, a subsidy to residential consumers
        results in reduced export earnings and increased import costs thus deteriorating EdL's financial
        position.
    0   Moreover, existing cross subsidies (from non-residential to residential) force non-residential
        consumers to pay more than their share of the cost of electricity making their products more expensive
        and less competitive.

With current gross distortions in tariff structure, it i s recognized that adjustments need to extend over
several years so that the Planis socially feasible.

At the endof the adjustment period tariff levels should remainaffordable to poorer consumers.

Since EdL's costs are largely in foreign currency, tariffs need to be periodically adjusted to maintain their
value inforeign currency terms.

A Restructuring Plan of EdL to reduce supply costs and strengthening of the Lao Holdings State
Enterprise will accompany the tariff structure adjustments. Sources of cost reductions and additional
measuresto be addressedare:

    0   Reducing arrears of public consumers.
    0   Reduce supply side losses. EdL system losses are currently about 20%. With an aggressive loss
        reductionprogram, it should be possible to cut these to about 12%.
    0   Competitive procurement of new generation. Procuring new generation on a directly negotiated
        turnkey basis increasescosts above what could be achieved with competitive bidding.
    0   Demand side management programs are also capable of reducing costs to consumers; program
        components targeted at subsidized consumers will also improve EdL financial viability.
    0   There i s room for efficiency improvements in EdL, e.g. extension of computerized billing systems;
        improvements infinancial managementinformation systems.

3.      Process

The Government will prepare the Action Plan for Financial Sustainability of the Power Sector, inconsultation
with the World Bank, with view to adopt it by May 2005, with the existing Draft Tariff Action Plan being used
as a key input.Work will start inMarchwith the support of EdL and appropriate analytical tools. The adopted
Action Plan will be reflected also inthe Contract Planto be signed between the Government and EdL.

                                Lao People'sDemocratic Republic


On November 29, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Lao People's Democratic Republic.2

Background

Since the last Article IV, Lao P.D.R.'s macroeconomic performance has been relatively encouraging.
After a brief hiatus in2002, macroeconomic stability has been restored and growth has been relatively
robust. The latest data also show that poverty has continued to decline. However, while progress has been
made in strengthening macroeconomic policies, advancing the agenda of structural reform has proved
more challenging, especially with regard to mobilizing revenues and strengthening expenditure
management, two key reform priorities under the PRGF arrangement.
The economy has performedrelatively well in2004, rebounding well from a number of shocks, including
a drought and the regional impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the previous year.
Although economic growth dipped in 2003 to 5% percent, half a percentage point lower than in 2002,
activity has rebounded in 2004, and growth i s projected to rise to 6 percent, supported by a recovery in
agriculture and hydroelectricity output, and a rebound in tourism. Inflation which had surged into double
digits in2002, has been on a downward trend since mid 2003. With the kip remaining stable over the last
18 months, inflation has fallen to 7% percent in September. The external position has also improved, with
brisk export growth and continued donor assistance, leading to a further rise in external reserves.
However, public external debt remains high.


 Under Article I V of the IMF'sArticles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary i s transmitted to the country's authorities.
This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the November 29, 2004 Executive Board
discussion basedon the staff report.

The improvement in macroeconomic performance has been underpinned by steady implementation of
macroeconomic policies for much of the past year. Monetary policy has been restrained over the past
year, with the Bank of the Lao P.D.R. keeping its net domestic assets broadly stable. Preliminary data
suggests that the budget performance also improved in 2003/04. Revenues rose from 11.1to 11.3 percent
of GDP, partly reversing the significant decline inrevenues in2002/03, and expenditures fell due to lower
donor-financed capital expenditures. With the government keeping tight control over domestic spending,
the overall deficit declined to 3.9 percent of GDP.

The priority over the past year has been to advance key structural reforms, especially with regard to
strengthening the revenue base. To this end, the authorities have announced their intention to introduce a
VAT inJanuary 2007 and have started to reform the turnover tax-reducing         the number of its rates from
three to two-a    key preparatory step. However progress in addressing the key administrative reforms,
related to centralizing control over the tax and customs administration, has proved difficult as they touch
directly on the issue of center-provincial relations. The authorities have also continued to make headway
inreforming the state banks and state-ownedenterprises, although muchremains to be done inboth areas
to limit contingent liabilities to the budget.

Provided that sound macroeconomic policy implementation i s sustained, macroeconomic performance i s
expected to remain favorable in 2005. Growth i s projected to rise to 7 percent, driven by an expansion in
miningexports, inflation should remain in single digits, and strong export growth would help Lao P.D.R.
improve its external reserve position. However, two potential risks have emerged to this positive outlook:
(i) 2004/05budgetplan,approvedbytheNationalAssemblyinOctober,proposesalargeincreasein
   the
the wage bill which may prove unsustainable, unless phased over a longer-time period; and (ii) bank
                                                                                                  state
credit has expanded rapidly over the last quarter, potentially undermining a key element of recent
monetary discipline.

The government's National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy sets out a medium-term strategy to
achieve rapid growth in order to improve the living conditions of the poor. If strong progress i s made in
structural reform, Lao P.D.R. has the potential to achieve the government's medium-term objectives of
raising growth to 6-6% percent-and       sharply reducing poverty-as   a number of major projects, such as
the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric dam, are in the pipeline. Achievement of this outlook i s predicated on
further reform with regard to revenue mobilization, and banking and state-owned enterprise reforms,
needed to address potential risks to fiscal sustainability, stemming from Lao P.D.R.'s high debt burden.
Strengthening expenditure management will also be critical to maintaining progress in ensuring sustained
improvements in social indicators consistent with the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.

The present PRGF arrangement for SDR 31.7 million, was approved in April 2001, and was extended by
an additional year, through April 24, 2005, in September 2003. The third review was completed on
September 12, 2003. Discussions of the fourth review, which have been ongoing since December 2003
will resume after the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV consultation.


Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended Lao P.D.R.'s progress toward macroeconomic stability, with inflation
declining and the external position strengthening, and welcomed the robust economic growth and
reduction in poverty. While improved economic management has been central to this performance,

Directors stressed that significant challenges remain. In particular, faster progress i s needed in
strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and public expenditure management, completing the
restructuring of state-owned banks and enterprises, and promoting private sector activity and investment.
In this context, Directors welcomed the completion of the National Growth and Poverty Eradication
Strategy (NGPES), and called on the authorities to translate its objectives into concrete actions embedded
in a robust policy framework. Given the country's limited capacity, these efforts will require continued
support from the international community.

While Lao P.D.R's near-term outlook remains favorable, Directors expressed concern about the 2004/05
budget plan, approved by the National Assembly in October. They noted, in particular, that the revenue
targets may not be achievable in the absence of additional revenue measures, and that the large increase in
the wage bill will likely need to be phased in over a longer period o f time. Directors also encouraged the
authorities to ensure that increases in world oil prices are passed on to consumers, as the budget cannot
afford a loss of revenue from reductions inpetroleum taxes at thisjuncture.

Directors welcomed the authorities' intention to continue to gear monetary policy toward reducing
inflation. Tight control over the Bank of the LaoP.D.R.'s net domestic assets, underpinned by a
government commitment to avoid bank financing of the budget, should continue to be the principal
anchor of monetary policy. This will need to be complemented by firm restraint of credit by the state
banks, and, in this regard, Directors expressed concern about the recent expansion of credit to finance a
government-sponsored project. Directors considered Lao P.D.R's flexible exchange rate system, with
interventions limited to smoothing operations, to be appropriate. They welcomed the ongoing review of
the exchange system, and encouraged the authorities to expedite the process of accepting the obligations
under Article VIII.

Directors underscored that improving revenue mobilization will be critical to ensuring fiscal
sustainability, given Lao P.D.R.'s substantial expenditure needs and high public debt. Key priorities in
the period ahead are the strengthening of revenue administration, which will importantly depend on
reforms to re-centralize authority over tax and customs administration, and the introduction of a value
added tax in early 2007. Directors also encouraged the authorities to ensure that tax incentives provided
under the new investment laws do not undermine efforts to broaden the tax base, and to reduce tax
incentives over time.

Directors stressed the need to accelerate reforms of public expenditure management inorder to strengthen
the accountability and monitoring of public spending. They urged the authorities to develop a
comprehensive treasury reform strategy that will bring treasury operations in the provinces under central
government control. These reforms will require pressing ahead with the ongoing review of the
decentralization framework, to clarify the assignment of revenue and expenditure responsibilities between
the center and provinces and develop a robust mechanism for inter-governmental transfers.

Directors urged the authorities to pursue vigorously the restructuring of state banks, whose financial
position remains precarious, and to maintain close oversight over the banks' operations until the
restructuring process i s complete. Some Directors considered that private investor participation would
facilitate the reform of state banks and improve their management and financial operations. Directors also
encouraged the authorities to move ahead with measures to improve the overall banking environment,
notably through legislation to strengthen competition in the banking sector.

Directors welcomed the recent progress on state-owned enterprise reforms and the ongoing utility price
adjustments. They urged the authorities to proceed with the sale of noncore assets of the large and most
indebted enterprises, and to finalize a comprehensive strategy to address the losses of Lao Airlines. To
complement the reforms to the state sector, the overall climate for private sector activity and investment
should also be improved, includingby reforming the legal system.

Directors stressed that lowering Lao P.D.R.'s high external debt to a more sustainable level will require
strong action on several fronts. In addition to efforts to mobilize domestic revenue and reduce borrowing
relative to GDP, the authorities will need to maximize grant financing and maintain a high level of
concessionality on new borrowing. Some Directors also called for limits on concessional borrowing.
Directors also urged the authorities to improve the monitoring and reporting of public external debt, and
to centralize control over the contracting of new debt. Directors noted that, despite Lao P.D.R.'s
eligibility, the authorities have indicated that they do not intend to avail themselves of debt relief under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

Directors regretted that the joint audit of the central bank's 2003 accounts by the state auditor and an
international audit firm has not yet been undertaken. They urged the authorities to fully implement this
key recommendation of the safeguards assessment as soon as possible. Most Directors supported the view
that, in the interim, the authorities should ensure that, at minimum, adequate safeguards are put in place
with respect to the reporting of the central bank's net international reserves and net domestic assets.

While efforts have been made to improve Lao P.D.R's statistics, Directors urged the authorities to
continue to work, with IMF technical assistance, to address remaining weaknesses and to improve data
dissemination.

    Lao P.D.R.: Assessment Letter for the Asian Development Bank and World Bank
                                        March 10,2005

Contact person: Mr.Ben Bingham(bbingham@imf.org, (202) 623-4258)

1.      This note provides an update of the assessmentof Lao P.D.R.'smacroeconomic
conditions and outlook presented at the time of the 2004 Article IV Con~ultation.~

Economic Conditions and Outlook

2.      Macroeconomic conditions have remained stable. The kip has strengthened to
around KN 10,300 per dollar and inflation has settled into single digits (8 percent in
January). External reserves have also remained at relatively comfortable levels (3% months
of imports). Staff still estimate growth at 6 percent in 2004, based upon a recovery in
agriculture and hydroelectricity output and a rebound intourism.

3.      Provided that sound macroeconomicpolicies are sustained, the short-term
macroeconomicoutlook remains favorable. Growth i s projected to rise to 7 percent driven
by a sharp increase in miningoutput, inflation should remain in single digits, and buoyant
export growth and donor inflows should facilitate a further build-up in external reserves
in2005. This positive outlook is contingent uponthe implementationof steps discussed
below to strengthen the 2004/05 budgetand contain credit expansion at the state banks.

4.      The staff's medium-term outlook is broadly unchanged from that reported at
the time of the 2004 Article IV Consultation. With a number of major'foreign projects in
the pipeline, Lao P.D.R.has the potential to sustain robust economic growth and achieve
significant reductions in poverty, provided that progress i s made on structural reform. In this
regard, further advances in revenue mobilization, and banking and state-owned enterprise
reforms, will be particularly important, given the risks to fiscal sustainability stemming from
Lao P.D.R.'s highpublic debt burden.

Recent Policy Developments

5.      The staff have encouraged the authorities to revise the 2004/05 budget plan
approved by the National Assembly last October. The staff's principal concerns were that
the revenue target (12.2 percent of GDP)was overambitious, especially inview of anumber
of adverse development^,^ and given the revenue prospects the large increases in wages and


 The 2004 Article Consultation was concluded on November 29, 2004. The staff report and
accompanying papers are available on the IMF's public web site.

 These include a delay in approval of key revenue measures, such as the restoration of a
two-rate turnover tax, a decision to suspend the excise on diesel (since partially reversed),
and slower than expected progress inreforms to strengthen tax and customs administration.

allowances proposed inthe budget plan were not sustainable. To address these risks, staff
have proposedthat the 2004/05 budget be based upon a more achievable revenue target
(11.4 percent of GDP) and that the increase in wages and allowances be limited(to 20 and
30 percent, respectively) to contain the growth inwage expenses to sustainable levels. [The
authorities have indicated that they intendto submit a revised budget to the National
Assembly in April 2005 that i s broadly in line with the staff`s recommendations and seek
approval at that time of a package of tax measures that will include the reform of the
turnover tax.]

6.      Staff have proposeda monetary framework for 2005 that aims to consolidate the
recent decline in inflation. Underthe framework, the central bank's net domestic assets
would decline gradually over the year to accommodate a build-up in international reserves to
around 4 months of imports. In addition to fiscal discipline, monetary stability in 2005 hinges
on tight control over credit growth at the state banks. While credit expansion moderated
somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2004, these banks remain vulnerable to pressures to extend
credits on a noncommercial basis. The staff have consequently encouraged the authorities to
strengthen the regulatory regime governing the extension of credits, particularly with regard
to single borrower exposures. [Staff understand that these regulations are close to being
finalized.]

7.      Accelerating structural reforms, particularly inthe fiscal area, remains a
challenge.

0   Only limitedprogress has been made in recent months in advancing revenue reforms.
    A recent government instruction assigning responsibility for tax andcustoms operations
    to the provinces has been a setback, although the regulations clarify that the center will
    retain a supervisory role.

    The customs department has made progress in strengthening its oversight of the largest
    customs posts and [the authorities have indicated that they plan to submit a new customs
    law-broadly    consistent with advice provided by the Fund-to    the April 2005 session of
    the National Assembly]. Reforms at the tax department are proceeding slowly, although
    some steps have been taken, assisted by SIDA, to prepare a plan for the implementation
    of the VAT.

0   The new investment laws passedby the National Assembly last October are broadly
    consistent with understandings reached with staff. However, initial drafts of these laws'
    implementing regulations lack a number of key provisions, including with respect to
    strengthening the Ministry of Finance's control over the administration of tax incentives.
    and the protecting the future VAT from tax exemptions.

0   Some progress i s being made in the operational reform of the state banks, but the process
    of recapitalizing the state banks and implementing their governance agreements,
    especially with regardto sound credit management, has been more problematic5 [Draft

  Inparticular, there have been anumber of cases where the banks' internal procedures were
overriden, resulting in loans being extended inbreach of sound lendingprinciples.

   amendments to the banking law to strengthen competition inthe banking system have
   been finalized and forwarded to the National Assembly for its approval.]

0  The outstanding issues regarding the Fund's safeguards policy remain unresolved. The
   authorities have indicated that they are not in a position to accept the staff's compromise
   proposal to commission a targeted review of the central bank's external reserves and
   reserve money, by an international audit firm.

Statusof FundRelations

0 Lao P.D.R.'s PRGF arrangement with the Fundi s due to expire on April 24,2005. No
   further disbursements are expected before that date (the thirdreview was completed in
   September 2003).

0 The Fundexpects to remain engaged ina close policy dialogue with the authorities after
   the arrangement expires. [To this end the authorities have agreedthat Fundstaff will
   undertake two missions to the Lao P.D.R.each year, one of which will coincide with the
   annual Article IV Consultation. Fundstaff have agreed to provide assessment letters to
   the World Bank, and other donor partners, after each of these missions.]

                                      ANNEX F. PEMPS


                                          Overview of
           Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program(PEMPS)

Background

1. The Government's "Policy Paper on Governance", presented at the March 2003
Roundtable6, identifies Sound Financial Management as one of four priority areas. The
overarching goal inthis priority area is: "to achieve macro-economic stability and sustainable
growth with equity, by establishing sound, accountable and transparent financial
management practices". To reach this overarching goal, the Government has identified a
number of strategic objectives, including: development of transparent, accountable practices
for expenditure planning and management; modernization of the accounting system; and
strengthening o f the capacities in audit and inspection bodies.

2. The National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy, builds on these policies, noting
that improvements in expenditure planning and budgeting are needed to align resources with
the Government's development priorities, and that "sound, accountable and transparent
financial management i s an integral part of the Government efforts to increase efficiency of
public management and resource allocation"     '. The NGPES further emphasizes the need for
capacity buildingin public expenditure management at all levels of administration.

Program Strategic Objective

3. The strategic objective of PEMSPi s to improvepolicy consistency, efficiency,
transparency and accountability in public expendituremanagement by strengthening
institutional systems and capacity and makingprogress towards appropriate international
financial managementstandards.

4. The Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) provides a
framework for implementing Government policies and strategies laid out in the "Policy
Paper on Governance" and the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy. PEMSP
prioritizes and sequences the Government's initiatives, taking into account NGPES
implementation requirements and institutional capacity.



  "Priority Areasfor GovernanceReform: A Policy Paper of the Govemment of Lao PDR on
GovemanceIssues" A Policy Paper of the Government of Lao PDR on Governance Issues,

'"National  Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy", Vientiane, June 2004, page 6 and 7,
see Annexe 2.4 for the "Action Planfor Improving Public Expenditure Management". See
also, Lao PDR, National Round Table Process Steering Committee, "Note on Progress
TowardsImplementation of the NGPES", October 2004.

5. The PEMSP i s the product of a priority initiative identified inthe Policy Paper on
Governance, which states that the Government will "work inclose cooperation with
international partners to formulate a step-by-step approach to reforming the public
expenditure management process". PEMSPdesign builds on a substantial body of analytic
work, including ajoint World Bank, IMFand ADB Public Expenditure Review, and on-
going support from these partners. PEMSP will provide a framework for mobilizing and
coordinating external assistancein support of the Government's public expenditure
management initiatives. Inthis context, PEMSP constitutes a comprehensive, Government-
ledprogram that ensures consistency of technical approach, determines appropriate
sequencing and avoids duplication of efforts.

Program Structure, Management and Support

6. PEMSP i s a five-year program, covering Government initiatives to end of FY2009. The
program focuses on the strengthening the management systems and capacity of the Ministry
of Finance and Provincial Finance Departments, supported by pilot interventions at the
provincial and sector levels. The program has five components:

     A.    Fiscal Planning and Budget Preparation
     B.    Budget Execution, Accounting and Financial Reporting
     C.    Local Government Financial Management
     D. FinancialLegislation andRegulatory Framework
     E. Capacity Building

7. Components objectives, the problems to be addressed and priority measures and outputs
under PEMSP are identified in the relevant sections below. Detailed descriptions of these
components and sub-components have been prepared. The detailed program components
provide a basis for determining appropriate sequencing of measures in line with
implementation capacity at the departmental level.

8. In order to facilitate program management and cross-departmental coordination, the
Ministry of Finance will establish an internal "Program Steering Committee", comprising
representatives of the relevant Ministry of Finance departments and chaired by the Vice-
Minister.   The Program Steering Committee will review and approve departments' annual
work plans, which lay out the steps to be taken to implement program components, and
department's progress reports. A "Program Coordination Committee" chaired by the
Ministry of Finance with participation of contributing partners will meet twice-yearly to:
review and update the program in line with progress inprogram implementation and the
Government's policy directives; and program external support, including training and
technical assistance inputs, required for program implementation. A Program Coordinator
will be appointed to support the "Program Steering Committee" and "Program Coordination
Committee", consolidate work plans and progress reports and deal with the day to day
administration of the program.

9. The Ministry of Finance will prepare progress reports on the implementation of the
PEMSP every six months, indicating the status of scheduled activities and adjustments in the

implementation schedule. The end of year report will also monitor progress against
component performance indicators. Progress reports will serve as the basis of semi-annual
reviews undertaken together with PEMSP partners. A mid-term review o f PEMSPi s
scheduled for FY2007. This will provide an opportunity for the Ministry of Finance and
program partners to take stock of progress and update program design and implementation
schedules. Program reporting and reviews will be complemented by Public Expenditure
Reviews (PER) and Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS), scheduled for FY2006
andFY2008. These studies will help assess progress in program implementation and its
impact at the sector and field level. The results of PERs and PETS will inform program
design and scheduling.

10.External partners will support PEMSP implementation by financing: technical
assistance; staff training, both in country and abroad; training of trainers; upgrading of
financial management information systems and facilities, including facilities of Ministry of
Finance training institutions. Technical assistance and training will assist the Ministry of
Finance modernize its expenditure management systems, taking into account appropriate
international best practice and international standards. Two advisors will assist the Ministry
of Finance coordinate PEMSP implementation, one advisor covering technical aspects of the
program and another supporting capacity building activities. The advisors will assist the
Ministry coordinate and oversee short-term consultancies. External financing i s estimated as
US$1.5 to 2 million a year, including grant funds and credits already programmed, such as
the World Bank financed Financial Management Capacity BuildingCredit and ADB support
to accounting and audit.

ComponentA: FiscalplanningandBudgeting

11.Componentobiective: Toensurethat expenditureplanning and budgeting systems
effectively allocate public resources according to the Government's development and
poverty reduction policy objectives.

12.Problemsto be addressed: Current practice inexpenditure planning andbudgetingdoes
not provide a sound basis for aligning resources with NGPES policies. The budget process i s
fragmented, with poor articulation between capital and recurrent expenditures and between
national policies and provincial budgeting, leading to inadequate provision for recurrent
expenditures and significant variations inthe overall level of spending and allocations to
priority sectors between provinces. Budgeting i s essentially incremental: there i s no
effective forward planning of recurrent spending, making it difficult to accommodate phased
adjustments in the structure of expenditure. The National Assembly approves only broad
expenditure allocations, which provide little indication of the fiscal constraints and policy
rationale of the Government's budget proposals or the policy consistency of proposed
resource allocations. Detailed budget books are publishedabout half way through the year,
too late to effectively guide agency spending. The budget provides aggregate allocations at
ministerial level with exhaustively detailed line item classifications. However, the budget
provides little information on the purpose of spending. Coverage i s limited, with substantial
off-budget items, including statutory funds and agency retainedrevenues.

13. Program measures and outputs: Development of a consolidated, medium-term
expenditureframework, covering recurrent and capital expenditures, will helpthe
Government gradually shift resources in line with its policy goals - towards recurrent
spending, the NGPES sectors and civil service remuneration- and provide a more
predictable basis for expenditure planning at the agency and provincial level. Phased
implementation i s anticipated, with the preparation of a first MTEFestimates to support
preparation of the Five Year Social-Economic Plan and the FY2006 budget process. The
MTEFwould then be usedto support the definition of budgetlimits for NGPES sectors in
the FY2007 budget. As part of this process, indicative allocations for the NGPES sectors at
the provincial level would be included in the budget circular, thereby promoting closer
alignment with national development policies. Implementation of Public Expenditure
Reviews (PER) and Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) inFY2006 and FY2008,
covering core systems and the NGPES sectors, will support the development of expenditure
policy by focusing attention on the impact of public spending.

14.The timeliness, coverage andpresentation of the state budget will be improved gradually.
This process will be guided by an implementationstrategy prepared during FY2005,
providing for the phased introduction of a revised budget nomenclature corresponding to the
chart of accounts and international standards, starting in the FY2007 budget. This will help
strengthen linkages between the budget and NGPES priorities. Gradually, the coverage of the
budget will be improved, including summary information on statutory funds (such as the
Pension Fund, the Road Fund,the Lao Development Fund),state owned enterprises and
agencies' retainedrevenues. The budget process will gradually be broad forward, with a
view to publishingbudget books at the start of the fiscal year b y the end of the program.

Component B: Budget Execution, Accounting and Financial Reporting

15. Component Ohiective: To ensure thatpublic resources are applied efficiently,
transparently and accountably in support of the Government's development and poverty
reduction policy objectives.

16. Problems to be addressed: Effective treasury operations and cash management are
hampered by the dispersal of public funds, poor coordination in cash planning and lack of
systematic commitment controls. Provincial treasuries and other sub-treasuries retain
revenues intended for the central government, exacerbating cash constraints at the central
level and in the poorer, deficit provinces. Budgetary control at an aggregate level i s achieved
by cash rationing, leadingto arrears to suppliers and delays inthe payment of salaries and
divergence between the intended and actual allocation of scarce resources. The chart of
accounts does not provide the information needed to assess the policy consistency of
spending, fully reconcile planned and actual expenditures and falls short of international
standards. Financial reporting by agencies and particularly provinces i s delayed, incomplete
and difficult to reconcile. Estimates of budget outturns are presented inthe budget papers for
the following year. However, the Government does not yet prepare end-of-year financial
statements that would provide a comprehensive overview of the Government's financial
position. The Government does not yet publishconsolidated in-year budget execution
reports. Progress has been made in computerization of payments processing and accounting

for four central agencies. The program i s now being rolled out across central and provincial
government. Although the Ministry of Finance undertakes inspections, agency follow-up on
reports i s often unsatisfactory. The State Audit Authority undertakes audits o f a few line
agencies, but has limited capacity and coverage.

17. Programmeasuresandoutputs:Treasury functions will gradually be consolidated
under a national treasury system so as to enable efficient and effective application of the
Government's financial resources. This will entail consolidation of Government bank
accounts at all levels of administration and improved linkage and reporting between central
and sub-treasury accounts, ultimately leading to the creation of a single network of treasury
accounts by end of FY2008. In order to improve predictability, efficiency and transparency
inbudget execution, cash management instrumentswill be put inplace. This will entail the
establishment of a cross-departmental cash management committee, preparation of cash
plans and timely updating of treasury account balances and registers of accounts payable. A
strategy for the streamlining of budget execution process and clarification of responsibilities
for accounting and financial reporting will be prepared inFY2005. This will be followed by
the phased reintroduction of commitment controls, as foreseen in the Budget Law No.5/94,
starting with pilot programs.

18. The quality and timeliness offinancial reporting by sub-treasuries will also need to be
improved. Inorder to improve transparency, the Ministry of Finance will begin publication
of quarterly budget execution reports duringFY2007, starting with NGPES priority sectors
and programs. These initiatives will be supported by the computerization of financial
management information systems to Ministries and Provinces, with spot improvements in
system configuration to support new financial management initiatives. Information system
requirements to support further management initiatives will be reviewed in FY2006. It i s
expected that this will lead to a strategy for implementation of an IntegratedFinancial
Management Information System, which may be introduced before the end of the program.

19. New accounting standards will be defined, with a view to providing policy relevant
information and meeting basic international standards. Framework legislation will be
prepared providing for the phased introduction of key financial statements and international
standards, including the introduction of modified cash accounting. Under the program, key
outputs will be phased introduction of a chart of accounts compatible with international
standards and providing for a more programmatic approach from FY2007 and a methodology
for the preparation of the Government's consolidatedfinancial statements, with a view to the
preparation and publication of financial statements for FY2008. Following the phased
implementation approach, these accounting instruments may be applied first inpilot
programs in priority sectors.

20. The Ministry of Finance will continue its efforts to strengthen internal audit, to
supporting and enforcing application of public expenditure management regulations through
an annual programs selective internal audits. Inorder to communicate the results of these
internal audits to financial management personnel across the administration, the Ministry will
initiate publication of a summary report on the results of internal audits of pilot programs by
FY2008.

Component C: Local Government FinancialManagement

21.Component obiective: To ensure thatprovincial and districtadministrationsallocate
and applypublic resources efficiently, transparently and accountably in support of the
Government's developmentandpoverty reductionpolicy objectives and in addressing
locally identified developmentneeds.

22. Problems to be addressed: Decentralization initiatives have ledprovincial and district
administrations to assume a critical role in the management of public finances. However,
decentralization has proceeded at a faster pace than capacity development and has not been
accompanied b y adjustments inthe regulatory framework for public expenditure
management. There are significant variations in the allocation of resources to the
Government's priority, NGPES sectors between provinces, undermining efforts to implement
national policies. There are delays in financial reporting by provincial and district
administrations, compounded by incomplete information and failure to apply standardized
formats. Furthermore, delays in the transfer of revenues b y surplus provinces prevent
effective cash management at a national level and result in delays in transfers to the poorest
provinces.

23. Program measures and outputs: Improvements in budgeting and budget execution,
accounting and financial reporting foreseen under Components A and B will impact on
provincial and district administrations. The specific requirements of provincial and district
administrations will need to be addressed in budget and financial reporting formats, and
through the rolling out of the computerized financial management information system.
Provincial administrations will be the target of much of the training supported by the
program. At the same time, the program will provide targeted assistance to Provincial
Finance Departments in collaboration with provincial projects such as the Governance and
Public Administration Reform Program, under the Prime Minister's Office. Resource
allocation issues will be addressed through the phased introduction of indicative allocations
within provincial budget ceilings, aimed at shifting resources to NGPES sectors in line with
national policies and ensuring greater equity funding of these sectors at a national level.

Component D: Financial Legislation and Regulatory Framework

24. Component ob-iective: Toput in place a coherent regulatoryframework that supports
policy consistency, efficiency, transparencyand accountability inpublic expenditure
management andprogressive adoption of appropriate international standards.

25. Problems to be addressed: A substantial body of legislation, regulations and
instructions i s already inplace, including framework legislation such as the Budget Law and
Audit Law. These regulations are not yet applied systematically. There is a need to ensure
consistency between regulatory instruments, particularly in light of recent initiatives to
decentralize some expenditure management functions. Some adjustment in framework
legislation will be required to support implementation of the public expenditure management

strengthening initiatives, as well as broader reforms in public administration. Furthermore,
regulations are not always readily available to or understood by the relevant staff.

26. Programmeasuresandoutputs: The regulatory framework will be revised,
consolidated and expanded to support the phased implementation of public expenditure
management initiatives. Development of regulatory instrumentswill be phased, in line with
implementation of public expenditure management initiatives. The need for new treasury
and accounting regulations has already been identified. Revision of the Budget Law may
also be required to accommodate improvements in timeliness, coverage and presentation.
Considerable emphasis will be placed on appropriate technical consultations with
Government institutions duringthe design of regulatory instruments. Similarly, the Ministry
of Finance will ensure that staff are briefed and trained in the application of any new
regulations. Ultimately, the regulatory framework will be consolidated and widely
disseminated to ensure transparency and effective implementation.

ComponentE: CapacityBuilding

27. Componentob-iective:To ensure that key staff have the technical skills needed to
fulfill their assigned expenditure managementfunctions through targeted training and
gradually develop a cadre of accreditedfinancial management personnel.

28. Problemsto be addressed: There i s an acute shortage of staff with adequate training
and experience in accounting or finance throughout the public administration, with some
agency staff having little or no formal training. The shortage of trained personnel i s
particularly acute at provincial and district level. Training i s currently provided through the
three Ministry of Finance Training Schools. These schools poorly equipped, lack
standardized curriculum and examination content, have few teaching resources or
opportunities for staff development: there i s little exchange between teaching staff and staff
inother departments. Thereare a significant number of on-the-job training activities, both
in-country and abroad, mostly financed b y external partners, which are not coordinated as
part of a systematic training program at the organizational or staff level. Similarly, there is
little coordination between the other public institutions offering general accounting and
finance training supervised by the Ministry of Education or the and specialized training
institutions operated by the Ministry of Finance and the State Audit Organization. The
Ministry of Finance has preparedjob descriptions for some departments, based on existing
functions. Further work i s needed to clarify the institutional responsibilities and develop job
descriptions and competency statements, linkingthese to training plans at the departmental
and staff levels.

29. Programmeasuresandoutputs: Capacity buildinginitiatives under the program will
bebased on needs assessments. These assessments will take stock of the available skills and
capabilities at an organizational level and identify a skills gap inrelation to the system
requirements, taking into account the skills needed to apply instruments developedunder the
PEMSP and appropriate international standards. A first needs assessment i s scheduled for
FY2005. Departmental capacity building plans will be prepared on the basis of these needs
assessments, providing for a range of training activities: short-term training events, both in

country and abroad, to support the design and implementation of specific PEMSPmeasures;
and modular courses, aimed at buildinga broader understanding of key functions such as
expenditure planning, budgeting, accounting, financial reporting, and auditing. Distance
learning opportunities will be explored. Development of these capacity buildingplans will
be coordinatedby a Capacity BuildingCommittee, comprising the Ministry of Finance's
Department of Organization and Personnel and key functional departments.

30. The program will promote the development of national training institutions so that these
can support the implementation of departmental capacity buildingplans, whilst at the same
time puttinga core curriculum of modular foundation courses for public sector employees.
Curriculum development will take into account the requirements for implementing
international standards (IPSAS, IAS, IIA, ISA), with a view to eventually achieving course
accreditation. Curriculum development will be coordinated by a Public Financial
Management Education Committee, ledbetween the MoF and comprising representatives of
the National University and other training institutions. The Ministry of Finance training
schools will be upgraded by providing support to curriculum development, training of
trainers, provision of training materials and investments in facilities. The current eighteen-
month course for government employees i s expected to be replaced with a modular program
of short, on-the-job training courses.

                          ANNEX G.CAPACITY ENHANCEMENT

The Bank has selected Lao PDR as a pilot country for the Bank's new focus on capacity
development (CD). The country's National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES)
highlights the importance of strengthening capacity in order to achieve Lao PDR's development
goals: "Capacity building i s an essential element of the NGPES.. .the Government emphasizes
capacity building as a major requirement for improved public administration, strengthenedlegal
and regulatory frameworks, and good governance in general." The NGPES presents the need for
a more strategic, integrated, and consistent approachto addressingcapacity issues.

In recognition of this emphasis, the World Bank's new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
articulates a revised, more systematic approach to capacity development (CD) that will be
applied to four key strategic areas. Key elements of this revised approach include:

(a)     Utilizing a 3-level conceptualframework for capacity development that addresses and
        notes the interplay between institutional and organizational dimensions of capacity and
        individual skills. The three levels include: (i)institutional capacity - norms, incentives,
        rules; (ii)organizational capacity - business processes and systems; and (iii)   individual
        skills.


(b)     Supporting the government and donors to increasefocus on capacity constraints
        and better mainstream capacity development interventions - at all 3 levels - in
        national development and sector strategies. In its support for the NGPES and sector
        strategies, the Bank will encourage emphasis on identifying key capacity constraints
        that limit achievement of desired development goals, defining priority capacity
        results, and sequencing capacity interventions so that policy reforms designed to
        improve institutional incentives and rules are integrated with initiatives to strengthen
        related organizational and individual capacities.


(c)     Integrating Bank operations, including policy support, project-based lending and
        technical assistance around measurable capacity results that contribute to broader
        NGPES outcomes. Greater discipline i s needed across all sectors and instruments to
        ensure that capacity interventions - whether through policy and institutional reforms,
        TA or training - are measured by outcomes rather than by the traditional focus on
        outputs. The new CAS articulates measurable capacity results and indicators, linked
        to desired national development outcomes from the NGPES/MDGs. In the Bank's
        associated assistance program, PRSC-supported policy and institutional reforms will
        be reinforced by and linked to capacity building initiatives supported by project-
        based lending and technical assistance. At the project level, the Bank will design new
        projects, and where possible retrofit existing projects, to set capacity goals and
        indicators, and include them inproject M&E systems.

As outlined inthe CAS, the Bank will apply a special emphasis on capacity development in:
(i)Public expenditure management and alignment with NGPES priorities; (ii) (iii)        trade,
transport; and (iv) education. In these areas, the Bank will more systematically >assess
capacity constraints through AAA, emphasize mainstreaming of capacity needs within sector

strategiedaction plans, and integrate Bank support for policy and institutional reforms with
project-based lending, technical assistance aimed at AAA that address the three dimensions
of key capacities in a systematic way.

The PRSCs will be an integral instrument in achieving these capacity outcomes. PRSC-
supported reforms will help to change incentives, rules and systems that in turn will provide
a more favorable enabling environment for individual capacities developed through project-
based lending and technical assistance. Technical assistance will also be targeted to build
capacities needed to ensure the effective implementation of specific PRSC actions. The
attached matrix depicts the linkages between selected PRSC actions, desired capacity
outcomes, and other interventions (project-based technical assistance and lending, AAA)
designed to achieve them.

1. Public expenditure management aligned with NGPES priorities. The PRSCs support
    the approval and implementation of a capacity building plan as part of the Government's
    Public Expenditure Management Strategic Plan (PEMSP). These include initiatives to
    strengthen the curriculum and teacher training skills of the key institutions that will train
    civil servants to implement public expenditure reforms. PRSC supported policy and
    institutional reforms in expenditure planning, budget execution and financial reporting
    will also be supported by Bank technical assistance through the FMCBP and AAA that
    are designed to strengthen organizational and individual capacities. The attached matrix
    also identifies C D interventions that address key capacity constraints that potentially
    restrict implementation of the related policy actions and that can build skills and
    awareness of key government officials responsible for implementing specific PFM
    reforms. The Bank will also support workshops, study tours, twinning arrangements and
    exchanges that provide specialized training and practice in key PEMareas.

2. Improve trade regime. In support of PRSC actions to improve the trade regime and
    lower import tariffs, the attached matrix outlines C D interventions to build awareness of
    the benefits of these measures through exchange and information sharing between Lao
    PDR officials and counterparts in other countries, particularly inthe region. The attached
    matrix also outlines tentative steps toward strengthening the institutions responsible for
    training civil servants and other stakeholders charged with implementing the revised
    regimes.

3. Strengthen road maintenance. The attached matrix depicts C D interventions to build
    awareness of and dialogue around institutional reforms needed to strengthen road
    maintenance, identification of key capacity gaps in improving the management of road
    maintenance, development of an action plan to strengthen key organizational and
    individual capacities needed to improve the road maintenance system.

4. Improve financial management and monitoring capacities in education.                      The
    attached matrix highlights entry points for capacity development in the areas of financial
    management, public expenditure tracking for service delivery and education sector
    outcomes. Capacity interventions at the organizational and individual levels include
    AAA and training to strengthen key processes and skills needed to implement new

financial management and monitoring systems. At the institutional level, experience
sharing and peer learning events are foreseen to enhance familiarity of national decision
makers with the implications of re-allocating budget in favour of the social sectors, and
the relative benefits of alternate spending policies within sectors.
