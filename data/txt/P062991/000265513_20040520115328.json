Request for Inspection for the\n            Special Structural Adjustment Loan in Argentina examines\n            statements by the Requesters that claim that budget cuts to\n            the Pro Huerta program have harmed and will harm the\n            intended beneficiaries who are the absolute poor. The Pro\n            Huerta program provides food and nutrition assistance to the\n            absolute poor. The Requesters feel that, in conformity with\n            the Bank's policy on poverty reduction, Pro Huerta was\n            specifically included in the Loan Agreement as one of the\n            programs the Bank considers must be protected under the\n            social and economic program supported by the SSAL. If the\n            Bank allowed the program to terminate, they would be\n            violating their own rules and regulations. The Requesters\n            list several violations by the Bank against social programs\n            that were originally funded through the Special Structural\n            Adjustment Loan."}, "docdt": "1999-12-16T00:00:00Z"}
