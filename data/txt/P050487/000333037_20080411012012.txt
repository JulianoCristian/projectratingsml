F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The development objectives of the Russia Development of the State Statistical System Project
(STASYS) were to support an improvement in macroeconomic management by providing a
required information base and to improve the availability of data need for a market economy.
This was to be achieved by focusing on (i) eliminating data gaps in the macroeconomic

framework used for economic policy and management; (ii) capturing new and dynamic economic
and social activities; (iii) meeting the needs of analysis of policy makers and the business
community; (iv) introducing       international standards and methodologies; (v) increasing the
efficiency and productivity of statistical production through improved organization, data
collection and processing methods and equipment; and (vi) improving the quality of analysis and
the monitoring of economic development along with the modernization of decision-making
methods for economic policy.

I. Disbursement Profile

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

This Development of the State Statistical System Project (STASYS) was prepared during a time
when the Russian Federation (RF) was undergoing both political and economic turmoil following
the profound collapse of the economy at the start of transition. Nevertheless, a reformist and
technocratic government had taken office in the spring of 1998 and it was widely accepted that
there was a need for accelerating structural reforms as the basis for renewed economic growth.
The financial crisis of mid-late 1998 further confirmed that a comprehensive and accelerated
program of economic reforms would be required.

The authorities clearly recognized the need to improve the quality of statistical information as a
key to strengthening macroeconomic management. The transition to a market economy posed
major challenges to the statistical system related, inter alia, to the emergence of a private sector,
expansion of economic activities especially in services, and the changing role of the state in
economic management.        These changes would eventually require fundamental changes in the
approaches to data collection and compilation issues. In addition, Goskomstat ­ the State
Statistical Committee ­ had suffered from a dramatic decrease in the funding for statistical
services both in relative and real terms. Year after year the funds earmarked for statistical
programs were not disbursed as planned with capital expenditure being the most affected. The
share of Goskomstat (including its training institutions) in the total Federal budget had fallen by
about 30 percent between 1995 and1997.

Nevertheless, by the time of appraisal however, the RF had met some of the challenges
systematically and successfully, with significant assistance from development partners. In the
area of macroeconomic statistics, the statistical agency had begun its preparation of new
macroeconomic indicators, in compliance with the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA),
started collecting data on prices and introduced into statistical practice the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) and other price indexes. The Bank was already supporting: (i) strengthening the estimation
of national accounts, input-output analysis and household and labor force surveys by Goskomstat
under the Bureau of Economic Analysis Project; and (ii) surveys to develop a set of poverty
indicators under the Social Protection Investment Loan. In addition, the compilation of Balance
of Payments (BoP), money and banking, government finance statistics and new types of social
statistics had been introduced and data were being collected and compiled.

Key problems remained including the fact that balance sheets of all business entities and financial
institutions were still done using Soviet-type accounting standards and many new enterprises did
not compile data according to statistical reporting requirements. As such, the supply of good
quality data and standards for macroeconomic compilations and analysis was limited. Certain
economic activities carried out by the shadow economy either failed to be captured or were
covered only partially by official statistical reports.      This placed additional challenges on
statisticians to make ad hoc adjustments to primary information.

In 1997, the authorities approved a Federal Earmarked Program for the Development of the
Statistical System of the Russian Federation for 1997-2000. The World Bank responded by
supporting the refinement of the development strategy. It was soon recognized that, for the
Goskomstat to keep apace with data needs for sound macroeconomic management and to
facilitate private investment, a radical overhaul of the system of data collection and processing, as
well as the introduction of modern estimation and analytical techniques would be needed. Key


                                                  1

modifications to the authorities' plans included: (i) broadening the scope of reform of the wider
statistical system, i.e. including other government agencies, besides Goskomstat, involved in the
production of statistics and emphasizing the need to improve coordination among them; (ii) a
focus on building management capacity for the statistical system; (iii) addressing the legal
framework; (iv) a more comprehensive and deeper reform of data collection and processing
methods that was originally envisaged; and (v) added emphasis on improving dissemination and
building relationships with end-users.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The development objectives of STASYS were to support an improvement in macroeconomic
management by providing a required information base and to improve the availability of data
needed for a market economy.

This was to be achieved by focusing on: (i) eliminating data gaps in the macroeconomic
framework used for economic policy and management; (ii) capturing new and dynamic economic
and social activities; (iii) meeting the needs of analysis of policy makers and the business
community; (iv) introducing international standards and methodologies; (v) increasing the
efficiency and productivity of statistical production through improved organization, data
collection and processing methods and equipment; and (vi) improving the quality of analysis and
monitoring of economic development along with the modernization of decision-making methods
for economic policy.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

The development objectives were not revised during implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries as identified by the PAD were (i) government agencies and the Central
Bank involved in economic policy making; (ii) domestic and foreign investors, producers and
traders which needed good statistical information for informing business decisions, and (iii)
international organizations, foreign governments and multi-national corporations which require
standardized economic and social data on the Russian Federation for comparative purposes. The
project would also have benefited respondents, both domestic and resident foreign individuals
and entities, by reducing the burden and cost of statistical reporting and surveys.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project included ten original components divided into three main areas: (A) institutional
strengthening of Goskomstat; (B) institutional strengthening and technical assistance for data
collection in other agencies; and (C) project management.

The first area was to support strengthening the management, technical skills, infrastructure and
data collection, processing and dissemination processes at the State Statistical Bureau. The first
Component aimed to improve the organization and management of Goskomstat itself including
its legal arrangements, inter-agency coordination, dissemination and relationship with users; and
the management of what was expected to be a long-term reform process. The second Component
supported a large training program to help the Goskomstat staff update their knowledge of



                                                 2

modern statistical concepts and methodologies and to acquire new technical competencies in
areas specific to the production of good quality statistics for the Russian Federation. It also
sought to strengthen the management, design and facilities for Goskomstat's ongoing training
programs. The third Component focused on upgrading statistical infrastructure, mainly focusing
on survey design and classifications systems, as well as managerial and planning facilities, and
reforming the framework for stakeholder relationships.        The fourth and largest Component
supported a large program to reorganize and modernize data collection, processing and
dissemination through the preparation of a large scale program to replace economic/business
censuses with sample surveys and the acquisition of new hardware and software system for
survey processing, data analysis and dissemination of statistics.

The second area of the project targeted other data collection agencies with a variety of program to
improve specific statistical products. Support was to be provided to: (i) the Ministry of Finance
and Ministry of Economy for improving government financial statistics and compilation of the
general government sector in the national accounts (Component 5); (ii) the Central Bank for the
expanding the coverage of financial statistics to non-bank intermediaries and auxiliaries;
(Component 6) and together with Customs Committee for improving the quality and coverage of
balance of payments statistics (Component 7); the Ministry of Economy again to strengthen its
capacity to provide short and medium term economic forecasts (Component 8); and to the
Registry Department to acquire computer facilities and software for inputting the initial data as a
basis for Goskomstat to begin electronic processing of vital statistics (Component 9.)

The final area of the project (Component 10) supported the establishment of a directorate to
manage the project and the development of the state statistical system.

1.6 Revised Components


During implementation, a number of changes were made to the components. First, the Bank and
the Government agreed to subsume some activities for strengthening government financial
statistics originally planned under the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) project, under
Component 5 of this project.

Second, Component 6 ­ Introduction and Compilation of Financial Statistics was dropped
because of lack of interest on the part of the Banking Supervision Department at the Central Bank
of Russia (CBR) and Component 9 ­ Improvement of Vital Statistics - was substantially reduced
also in part due to lack of engagement by the Registry Department. The latter was replaced by
technical assistance for the implementation of the All-Russia Population Census in 2003.

Key activities and performance indicators under components 3 and 4 were reorganized to
consolidate activity on upgrading survey methodologies and facilities under subcomponent 4.1 on
economic statistics which focused mainly on replacing censuses with sample surveys and under
subcomponent 4.2 on the household sample survey system. As a result, at the mid-term review,
Component 3 was substantially scaled back to comprise only the development of regulatory and
legal documents and the introduction of new methodological approaches for compilation.
Managerial and planning facilities were to some extent covered by Component 1.                 The
development of a classifications unit was eliminated and the development of an all-Russia
product classifier by economic activities was included under Component 8.

A new Component (11) was added to separate the work on the Federal Customs Service database
from the rest of the work on the Balance of Payments statistics. No amendments to the loan
agreement were required by these changes since they fit within the general description of project



                                                 3

objectives as included in the legal documentation. These actions were also consistent with the
applicable Bank policies and practices at the time.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

The key changes during implementation include the restructuring of a number of components
(discussed above) and a significant increase in counterpart financing from the Government to
permit additional activities within the original project objectives. The latter resulted in an
increase in total project size from $39 million to $55 million. This was administratively
implemented by a significant reduction in the share of Bank financing for specific disbursement
categories in the loan agreement.         Notably, this was the first Bank project in Russia to
accommodate a new co-financing scheme that maintained both financial and technical
involvement of the Bank in an important reform area, despite increases in government's own
resources. These changes also required a second extension of the closing date by some 12
months to allow for full implementation of the scaled up technical solutions.

The loan agreement was amended in October 2002 to allow project proceeds to finance local
transportation and insurance of goods within the Russian Federation, and to change some of the
procurement thresholds1.     The closing date for the project was first extended from June 30, 2004
to April 30, 2005 to allow for completion of original project activities including the agricultural
census methodology, the new classification of products by economic activity and inputs into the
new chart of accounts in public administration. In December 2004, the Government requested the
Bank to extend project activities and proposed additional counterpart financing by reducing the
Bank's co-financing share from 80 percent to 20 percent.             These extensions and additions
included further replication of technical solutions utilized in the information system to a few
additional regions, and the development of statistical indicators for the RF's ongoing effort to
institute performance-based budgeting. The loan agreement was then amended to allow for
increasing the Russian share of financing to 80 percent, to extend the closing date by some 12
months to December 2006 and to include four new performance indicators (see Annex 2). At the
end, Government counterpart financing had been increased by some US$24 million over the
original estimates (see Annex 1).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The project was based on very sound background analysis and preparation. Preparation and
quality at entry benefited from a thoroughly prepared, with Bank assistance, development strategy
that was backed up by a Federal Targeted Program of financing for strengthening the state
statistical system. Work on the development strategy was also supported by a PHRD grant for
preparation financed by the Japanese government. The preconditions of strong government
ownership were also demonstrated by ongoing efforts to improve key statistical products, and



1These changes included increasing the limits on International Shopping to $40K and National Shopping to
$50K (overall $600k) the aggregate limit on SBQS to $702K.



                                                    4

were supplemented by Bank experience under two ongoing projects. The ultimate design of the
project, while clearly addressing key activities and outcomes, was also flexible enough to allow
for the Government and the Bank to take advantage of opportunities that arose during
implementation, including the population and agricultural censuses, and the poverty assessment
work, to extend the outcomes to other areas of data production and statistical analysis. However,
there were a number of key issues in project preparation and design that ultimately affected
implementation.

The development objectives to "support an improvement in macroeconomic management..." and
while appropriate for what was understood to be a long-term statistical reforming process, may
have been a bit too broad for an individual operation. STASYS project focused on mainly
strengthening the system for producing good quality statistics along very specific lines ­
management capacity, statistical infrastructure, staff knowledge and systems modernization ­ and
improving the quality of selected statistical products. However, the overly broad focus ultimately
did not materially affect project outcomes. The objectives were, and still remain, relevant to the
overall development priorities for the Russian Federation.

The choice to use an external project implementation unit (PIU), the BEA, was extensively
debated within Government. While this debate and the final choice did cause delays at the outset,
because of the need to legally restructure the BEA, which was rather effective in keeping the
administrative side of project implementation running smoothly.           It is not clear whether
Goskomstat, itself being subject to organizational restructuring, would have been able to maintain
continuity in these administrative matters while engaging in the planning and implementation of
project activities and absorbing its own share of technical assistance. The BEA was able from the
very beginning to, rather flexibly, strengthen its own staff capacity with the help of PHRD grant
resources, to improve financial and implementation reporting, and to oversee the complex
procurement processes that emerged. However, a by-product of this arrangement was that the
BEA as an external body may not have had sufficient influence to support improved coordination
on project issues among the various data collecting agencies, when the Inter-Agency
Coordination Council performed this function less efficient as expected.

The implementation period of four years was too short for, basically, a greenfield project of this
breadth. First, despite using the BEA which had experience in implementing World Bank
projects, there were significant delays in achieving effectiveness, which eventually took almost
one year.   Second, the required administrative procedures of the RF government, for example,
have proven to be a common barrier to the timely preparation and start-up of Bank projects. This
was no less the case for the STASYS project. Third, it is not clear that the full complexity of the
systems modernization planned under Component 4 was understood at the time of appraisal.

Finally, the level of ownership among the various agencies involved in the project was uneven,
resulting in a number of components being dropped or reduced. However, it is not clear whether
additional consultations during preparation would have revealed these problems, upfront. The
project design ultimately permitted the flexibility to add support for improving other data
products when the opportunities did emerge. This lesson has been fully internalized in the follow
on project ­ STASYS 2, which was approved by the Board on June 28, 2007.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Aside from the restructuring described above in Sections 1.6 and 1.7, a number of systemic
developments in the Russian public sector during the project life did significantly affect progress
on project implementation. The first were the serious fiscal constraints which followed the
Russian financial crisis for some years and led to significant delays in receiving counterpart
financing during the early years of implementation.

The second systemic issue was a long wave of state-wide public administrative reform (PAR) in
the RF. While it did benefit the State Statistical Committee in critical ways, it may also have
reduced the commitment to, and possibly the Committee's flexibility to act on, the internal
organizational restructuring which was an essential part of the project's development strategy. At
the start of the project, Goskomstat was downgraded by the Government of Russia, then restored
to the level of "Committee". In addition, the state-wide PAR program also mandated a series of
internal organizational changes to the Committee over the life of the project, in part leading to a
slowdown on decisions and activities by RosStat itself on the same issue. Even after, RosStat
officials have suggested that they were awaiting further instructions from the broader PAR effort
as an input into organizational restructuring. Towards the end of the project, the PAR reform also
shifted the focus of development of the overall statistical system away from strengthening the
quality of essential macro-aggregates toward development of local indicators for decentralization
and program budgeting.

A third systemic issue involved RF procurement restrictions with respect to the use of
international consultants which severely limited the pool for the needed, high quality technical
assistance and also caused a number of delays in implementing key project activities.

Finally, there was a near-suspension of the Bank's portfolio in the RF for almost one year in late
2003 through 2004 as the authorities undertook a review of implementation arrangements, which
impacted the pace of project implementation during that time.

A number of project-specific problems also affected implementation. These included a long
learning curve (already discussed in Section 2.1), insufficient coordination leading to the limited
participation by some of the other data collection agencies, and the delays in the passage of the
new Law on Statistics.

The Law on Statistics was submitted to Parliament in September 2007 after project closing.
These delays contributed to RosStat's reluctance to assume full leadership and convening power
across the numerous agencies in the statistical system, but may be resolved now with the
imminent passage. It is not clear how much buy-in from these other agencies there was during
preparation. And during implementation, the project's Inter-Agency Coordination Committee
(ICC) was not strong enough to effectively resolve the numerous coordination issues, which
resulted in a few of the smaller components falling by the wayside. That said, there was enough
flexibility in the structure of the project and the responses of the Bank and government teams to
grasp some opportunities for "filling data gaps and expanding coverage of economic activities"
where they emerged. Several key examples are the addition of the support to the Customs
Department, pilot testing of the Agricultural Census, and support to the Population Census.

Relatedly, analysis of the procurement plan reveals that there was an important amount of refocus
and reallocation away from activities geared toward system-wide institutional development and



                                                  6

organizational restructuring toward IT and methodological issues. Some of this may also have
been in response to a long wave of state-wide public administrative reform in the RF to which the
Goskomstat/RosStat was subject, in effect superseding their own efforts. Even so, the overall set
of financed activities comprise a coherent program that has achieved the majority of the original
Component objectives, as well as supporting additional development in some needed areas, as
they arose.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

While the STASYS project preceded the current effort in the Bank to rely on quantifiable project
outcome indicators, the current Results Framework methodology was part of project design. A
large number of, mainly, process-oriented, performance indicators were specified in the Project
Appraisal Document which made earlier reporting on the "results" somewhat cumbersome and
subsequently, quite limited in its effect on project implementation.2 Starting with the mid 2005
supervision report, the team did refocus the indicators on a few substantive issues that had
emerged as some of the key priorities during implementation. These were the improvement of
the data collection and processing systems, upgrading of staff skills, methodological
improvements to the national accounts data, integration of statistical and administrative data, and
passage of the Law on Statistics.

A more focused results framework in the new PAD for STASYS2 would be useful to more
effectively shepherd project outcomes. That said, over-specification of what is a very complex
development agenda, and in the face of strong ownership, would not be appropriate. The mission
understands that RosStat has developed a set of modern performance indicators for the FTP,
which should be appropriately mined for this purpose. Also the IMF will begin to publish SDDS
report cards from next year, which might be useful as one monitoring indicator.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project did not involve any environmental nor other safeguard issues, and was rated
accordingly. Of the 23 audit and financial reports received during the life of the project, four
were received late, and six had issues which were raised upon review and resolved. In the initial
years there were some minor delays with the submission of financial reports, but these were soon
resolved. The PIU successfully implemented project/financial monitoring report-based
disbursements during the life of the project as originally intended. No major procurement
compliance issues were raised during implementation, notwithstanding the various amendments
which were needed to resolve market related issues for consulting services, discussed below.

A few fiduciary issues required resolution during the project. The first and most major involved
the hiring of government agencies for local consulting contracts. The main rationale, discussed at
length between the Bank and the Government, was the retention of a good number of RF's
technically skilled personnel in the field of statistics in state-owned agencies, mainly educational
institutions. After a few competitions for local consulting services among the private sector
failed to yield appropriately qualified firms, it was decided to allow government bodies to
participate in the bids on a limited basis, to be reviewed in each instance. The second related to
the prohibition from using loan proceeds to finance local transportation of goods which became




2The Loan Agreement did include a more limited set, although still process-oriented, indicators.


                                                   7

problematic with the procurement of large quantities of computer hardware primarily intended for
Goskomstat's local offices in the Russian hinterland.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

A follow-on project which will continue the modernization process ­ STASYS 2 ­ was approved
by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors on June 28, 2007. This project will support the
implementation of the third Federally Targeted Program for the development of state statistics in
Russia and aims directly at increasing the availability of data for the Russian Federation, in
particular macro-aggregates and Millennium Development Goal indicators conforming to
international standards. It will also support the rollout of the technological solutions developed
under the first project to the national system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Despite numerous changes to the structure of components, mainly to iron out overlaps in some of
the components and to channel the flexibility/breadth of the project design onto specific
improvements, the project remained focused on its key objectives of (i) improving the coverage,
quality and availability of statistical products for the market economy; and (ii) increasing the
efficiency of the production of statistics in the Russian Federation. These objectives remain
relevant even today, because of the long term nature of statistical development in a transition
economy. The implementation arrangements of having an external PIU and a multi-agency
Coordination Committee although it did not yield the intended efficiency (in terms of start up)
early on, were largely supportive of the project's achievements.         The external PIU allowed
RosStat some breathing room to formulate its methodological and training needs, to elaborate on
the terms of references as well as providing a flexible avenue to engage the relevant technical
skills needed to support the complex IT systems, while RosStat and other agencies were subject
to the constraints of the state-wide administrative and civil service reform programs. As evidence
of its relevance, this implementation arrangement will be continued under the follow-on project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

STASYS had two primary development objectives: (i) to provide a required information base for
an improvement in macroeconomic management; and (ii) to improve the availability of data
needed for a market economy. Both these objectives were substantially achieved with a range of
new and improved statistical data products, internationally comparability of data, better
dissemination and the strengthening of economic modeling and forecasting activities using the
new data.

These objectives were to be achieved by efforts to:

(i) Eliminate data gaps in the macroeconomic framework used for economic policy and
management.

Notwithstanding this very ambitious objective, the project did address some key data needs in the
macroeconomic framework mainly through improvements in methodology. The main statistics of
national accounts, government financial data, balance of payments and, notably, inflation were all



                                                  8

being measured in the Russian Federation at the time of project preparation. However, concerns
about the quality of various issues led to the duplication of estimation between RosStat and
various administrative departments in the Government, with the result that there were often
duplicate and different publications of core statistical data. This situation made it difficult for
policy makers, private businesses, independent think tanks, media and academics to engage in
both robust planning and meaningful dialogue about macroeconomic issues. In addition, key
estimates, in particular, for capturing new forms of economic activity as well as the informal and
underground economy, were missing from these accounts.

As seen from sections (ii) and (iii) below, the STASYS project supported substantial
improvements in the methodological approaches in all of the areas mentioned above, and added a
large number of new statistical products, mainly relating to labor market. As a result, there has
been a marked reduction of duplicate publications of data coming from the public sector.
Towards the end, the project also supported the government's efforts to institute performance
budgeting by preparing a concept for the compilation of administrative date for this purpose.

Only in one planned area, that of debt statistics did the project fail to contribute to a measurable
improvement. There were no activities implemented under the project for this subcomponent.
According to MOF, there remain outstanding legal issues regarding the measurement and
presentation of debt related to whether it is measured by currency (MOF) or residency (BoP) and
an outstanding activity on rationalizing institutional arrangements.

(ii) Capture new and dynamic economic and social activities.

The project was instrumental in providing a variety of opportunities for RosStat to address new
data needs as they emerged along with the development of the market economy. A number of
these were products of the effort to transit from an all-census data collection framework to an
integrated census-sample survey framework described below.                   Through extensive technical
assistance to the All Russia Population Census in 2002, All Russia Agricultural Census in 2006,
and preparations for the All Russia Economic Census in 2008, the project helped to refine and
expand various statistics on:

     · the labor force, including the compilation of data on economic activities by type of
         household and analysis of the occupation/qualification structure of the labor force;
     · individual entrepreneurs, a segment of the economy hitherto largely unmeasured and
         resulting in gross underestimation of a large component of informal economic activity;
         and
     · agricultural production.

Through efforts to upgrade the balance of payments statistics, the project helped produce new
statistical output on the trade in goods, international trade in some services and informal trade
through various surveys undertaken to refine the Balance of Payments; and the computerization
and expansion of the Customs Service systems for data compilation, analysis and dissemination.3




3 However, a primary user ­ CBR, which is officially responsible for compiling BoP statistics ­ has more
limited functionality than other users, because it is not a `budget-financed" institution and is therefore
considered to be outside of government.




                                                       9

Others resulted from the (flexibility to make) opportunistic use of project resources to satisfy
government demand for data to inform current economic policy questions and reflects the
ongoing need to balance implementation of the "master plan" for development of the statistical
system with the needs of its (primary) users. Some of the new statistical products and expanded
coverage that were developed with project support include:

     · an aggregate index of economic development at sub-regional level directed at the
         Russia's ongoing efforts to address regional disparities and related efforts to extend
         reform of intergovernmental finances to lower levels of local government;
     · an information and statistical database for the assessment of national economic potential
         for innovation, including types of innovative activities, sources of funding for innovation,
         and methods use to protect intellectual property. Statistical enhancements included
         amendments to data collection forms and compilation methods;
     · a related system of indicators for measuring competitiveness of the Russian economy;
         and
     · a concept for the organization of performance monitoring indicators for budgetary
         planning units to support the ongoing performance budgeting and public administrative
         reforms in Russia.

(iii) Meeting the needs of analysis of policy makers and the business community.

The project was instrumental in improving the quality of macroeconomic, microeconomic and
social data for use by policy makers and the business community, as illustrated by the
enhancement to data products used by these groups. However, there were very few activities
under the project aimed at reaching out to non-governmental stakeholders, other than expert users
­ researchers and academics ­ in a systematic fashion other than the upgrading of the website,
open access to microdata from the household budget surveys used for the World Bank's program
of poverty analysis, and acquisition of a new GIS-based data presentation tools.              This is
evidenced by the RosStat's very ad hoc and rudimentary implementation of a user survey
basically only to governmental users of its output (see Annex 5).

Recognition is growing within RosStat on the need to strengthen interaction with non-government
and non-expert users of its products, but it is does not appear yet to be a priority. Regarding
expert users, there is a Methodology Commission with external representatives from universities
and research centers. There are also some individual efforts to reach out to users in the design of
new surveys and during the development of some of the new analytical tools. A few officials
noted that the Law is also needed to regulate the relationship with users, but it is not yet clear
whether the proposed new Law will achieve this adequately. There is no documentation that
gives clear government policy regarding dissemination and access of official data produced
within the State Statistical Service. RosStat and statistics units in line ministries and regional
statistics offices generally supply data to users on request within some explicit procedural
framework, but none of them has developed a data access policy.

From the user perspective, participants from the private sector, academia and media in a
workshop organized for this report (see Annex 5) reported that, despite the persistent legacy of
distrust in Russian officialdom, confidence in RosStat outputs by users is increasing. The
relationship with users at the regional level in St. Petersburg is quite strong, as evidenced by the
regular and deep interaction between PetroStat, local academia and local public administration
(also see Annex 5 for more details). However, there remains a need for RosStat to strengthen



                                                 10

presentation of sources and publication of metadata, to publicize new analytical capabilities, to
focus on public education on statistics in order to reinforce and accelerate this growing
confidence, and to routinely investigate major anomalies with other data sources, particularly at
the local level.

That said, RosStat is already disseminating a large number of reports in hard copies and is placing
data on its website. Workshop participants admitted that there has been substantial improvement
in the quantity of data disseminated by RosStat, especially on its website.           In fact, the
international Internet-ranking firm Rambler rates this site among the top four administrative sites
in Russia. Data dissemination efforts have further been strengthened by RosStat's subscription to
the IMF's Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) although there are a few outstanding
issues. This is a remarkable improvement. Notwithstanding the progress achieved, RosStat
needs to make further improvements to overcome existing limitations in its current dissemination
practices. Further upgrades to the RosStat website are needed, in particular to create more
dynamic links to data and capacities for downloading in forms accessible to analytical software.

A second group of stakeholders, only tangentially considered under the project, are survey
respondents.     RosStat senior management is keenly aware of this issue and its impact on
response rates and quality of information reported on surveys, with one commenting, "Ministries
and agencies force us to torture respondents."      However, as yet there is no measurement of
respondent burden, and no particular policy for dealing with respondents. The general impression
of RosStat staff are that enterprises are becoming more resistant to providing data, resulting in
both lower response rates and increasing concerns about the quality of data provided. Assuming
gradually broader application of the integrated data collection system, it should be possible to
measure response rates more systematically as an efficiency and accuracy indicator. For example,
the pilot survey of individual entrepreneurs indicated that face-to-face interview was a much
more effective way of collecting data than the self-completed mail-out, mail-back questionnaire
or telephone interview. Likewise, measurements of respondent burden should be designed and
implemented, at least for economic surveys.

(iv) Introducing international standards and methodologies.

This objective was addressed primarily through two major inter-related efforts under Components
2, 3, 5 and 7 encompassing (a) enhancement of key statistical products ­ Russia's system of
national accounts (SNA), government financial statistics (GFS) and balance of payments (BoP),
and a wide range of other products; (b) introduction of an internationally-compatible
classification system; and (c) a massive effort to upgrade staffing skills.

National accounts. Under the STASYS, RosStat has completed a number of activities related to
the implementing the international guidelines as prescribed by the United Nations' System of
National Accounts agreed in 1993 (SNA93).           A major review of the sources and methods
compiling national accounts in Russia was undertaken with technical assistance from the project
and the International Monetary Fund. Data collection and compilation methods were revised, re-
examining existing and new data sources. Following this review, RosStat has utilized project
financing to make a number of key enhancements, including:

    · the introduction of commodity-flow methods for compiling detailed flows of goods and
        services;,
    · improvement of computational techniques for obtaining GDP estimates based on the
        supply and use tables compiled through the commodity-flow method;
    · classification of flows and stocks;


                                                 11

     · development of a method of recording investment in non-financial assets considered
          appropriate for use in Russia's system of national accounts;
     · development of a method for compiling tourism statistics based on the recommendation
          of the World Tourism Organizations;
     · development of experimental estimates using labor input approach and data from the
          labor force survey4;
     · development of a methodology for concentration of production; and
     · compilation of balances of food resources.

The next steps should be to: (i) implement the existing program of surveys and data collection
that have been identified, and move towards the implementation of the full sequence of accounts
and balance sheets in the 1993 SNA; and (ii) develop appropriate indicators for the imputation
and updating of various components of the national accounts aggregates.

Government financial statistics. In 2005, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)5 completed a major
review that involved building a new budgetary classification and moving to an accrual method of
accounting at regional and federal levels. Beginning January 2006, the government finance
statistics produced by MOF have been based on the methodology and guidelines given by the
IMF's Government Finance Statistics 2001 (GFS 2001) manual and the UN's Classification of
Functions of Government (COFOG). The statistics will be published on quarterly and annual
basis. The new public finance accounting system has also been introduced at the regional and
federal levels.     Although there are some outstanding issues that need to be resolved regarding
the use of MOF's data in RosStat's compilation of the general government sector into the national
accounts , this represents a major accomplishment toward increasing the international
            6

comparability of the Russian government finance and national accounts data.

Balance of payments. The project was also instrumental in improved the compilation of BoP
statistics by supporting (i) the implementation of better data collection on key traded/international
services; (ii) introduction of better methods of adjusting foreign trade volume; and (iii) expanding
the data collection for computing adjustments to be made for informal trade.

Other products. The project also helped to improve the methodologies and techniques for the
implementation and analysis of the All Russia Population Census and Agricultural Census in line
with international practices and to upgrade the measurement of tourism statistics in line with
WTO recommendations and the measurement of unemployment and other labor force statistics in
line with ILO recommendations, among others.




4LFS sample size is not large enough for a reliable breakdown of production by industry and estimates are
unstable over time. The results are not consistent with other production methods, but this is not entirely
surprising. If results were identical the labor input method would be no more effective than the current
methods.
5The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is responsible for the compilation and analysis of government finance
statistics and provides RosStat with GFS data for preparation and presentation national accounts.
6These include typical coordination issues on disaggregation of current and capital expenditures, reporting
on pseudo-government entities, revenues by function and economic activity for market activities of budget-
financed entities and state-owned enterprises, disaggregation of transfers and subsidies, all of which affect
the compilation of the National Accounts, and valuation and depreciation issues related to fixed assets
including government buildings and certain immaterial assets such as mineral exploration.

All-Russia Products Classifier by Types of Economic Activities. The development and adoption
of a new internationally-comparable product classification (by economic activity) the All-Russia
is a major achievement of this project. It is correlated with the earlier All-Russia Classifier of
Types of Economic activities, EU statistical classification of production by economic activities
and the PRODKOM list. It will allow for the unequivocal identification of goods and services in
the market economy, and ensure comparability of production, sales, exports and imports of
products internally and internationally, as implementation gradually proceeds. Over time, the
impact of this new classifier will spread across a wide range of statistical products.

Training. The STASYS project was positively crucial in upgrading the technical capacities of
RosStat staff in a broad range of international methodologies and standards. Over 5,500 staff
received training, a large number in overseas institutions and from international experts, neither
of which was permitted under Russian government rules using RosStat's own budget. The
project has also helped to sustain this effort through the development of an ongoing training plan,
as well as the creation of computerized and distance learning training facilities at the central and
some regional offices of RosStat. Good quality documentation and training materials have been
developed and continue to be in use. On the basis of this example, RosStat's own funded training
has received a significant boost in resources. Although retention of trained staff has been an issue
in Moscow and a few other major cities, in regional offices where the labor market is thin this is
less of a problem. Meanwhile, the attrition of urban RosStat staff located in big cities to the
private sector, research institutions and academia can be viewed as an indirect means of
increasing the capacity of users in the RosStat's products.


(v) Increase the efficiency and productivity of statistical production through improved
organization, data collection and processing methods and equipment.

This objective was addressed primarily through two major inter-related efforts. The first was to
begin conversion from the Soviet all-census data collection framework to an integrated census-
sample survey framework which is more efficient and suitable for a market economy. The
second was to complement this effort with the first stage of a modernization program for data
collection, organization, processing and dissemination systems in RosStat. The progress on the
former was commendable though less than anticipated at project appraisal, whereas on the latter
the achievements were substantial and highly satisfactory.

A very thorough report was prepared looking at the potential impact of sampling for all regions
and sectors for all surveys and sparked an important debate on the appropriate level of statistical-
geographical disaggregation for Russian public policy. This report fed into the development of a
systemic plan with timetable for replacing regular economic/business censuses with surveys.
The value of using sample surveys to produce reliable national statistics is well-recognized, and
their use is gradually being promoted within RosStat. Indeed the agency already uses the results
of a number of sample surveys to improve quality of data and better presentation of statistics in
publications such as quarterly reports of the labor force statistics, National Accounts, and the
Balance of Payments. However, very few additional surveys were actually converted under the
project. The new FTP specifies that a percentage of sample surveys will increase 20-30 percent
over 2005 levels during the period of the plan, i.e. by 2009 and that surveys will be run to monitor
all sectors of the economy.

This lack of conversion is not for lack of methodological skills or resources, but more due to the
continuing demand for rayon level data. It should be noted that even in well-developed national
statistical offices in Europe and elsewhere which do not collect such detailed data, there is a



                                                  13

constant demand for small area data that statisticians are trying to meet (largely unsuccessfully)
through modeling. Additional demand in Russia comes from the legacy of Soviet-era economic
planning. Nonetheless, the collection and dissemination of such detailed data should be justified
from a cost-benefit perspective. There is clearly scope for more conversions in Russia, but this
will require careful management of stakeholder expectations.

In preparation, however, key survey infrastructure was established by the project. These include:

    · plan and testing of forms for a benchmark Economic Census (which has not yet been
         completed);

    · completion of a Population Census in 2002 and an Agricultural Census in 2006 both with
         methodological technical assistance (although differing levels) from the project;

    · pilot testing including methods for automatic control and editing of data for censuses and
         sample surveys of individual entrepreneurs and of small enterprises;

    · methodological improvements and development of system for automatic editing of raw
         data for household surveys;

    · development of various sampling techniques and frames for various sectors of the
         economy; and

    · substantial training of staff (mentioned above).

The project did make a substantial contribution to modernizing computer facilities of RosStat for
survey processing. An Integrated Processing System with 17 subcomponents was developed and
successfully tested in 15 pilot regions. Before the project, RosStat was maintaining an ICT
infrastructure base that was obsolete. The data processing capability at all levels of RosStat
system was poor. The stock of older generation mainframe and mini computers was difficult and
expensive to maintain and often unable to run more modern software. Planning of IT investments
had not reached the point where the organization was able to execute a system or project
requiring special management. Furthermore, the technology architecture did not allow RosStat to
take advantage of state-of-the-market, web-enabled technology.

As a result of the project, an information infrastructure foundation (including communications,
hardware, application, database, file, mail servers, limited forms management, and software) now
exists for implementing a large-scale unified statistical data collection, processing, warehousing
and delivery system throughout RosStat. In addition, the project

    (i)      developed an overall plan and detailed technical design for the development of the
             entire ICT infrastructure;

    (ii)     created specialized information software, and subsequently tested and accepted 17
             subsystems covering RosStat's key operations and processes to pilot sites;

    (iii)    established up-to-date server rooms at the Central Office, the Main Interregional
             Computer Center, the Research and Design Institute, and in 14 Territorial State
             Statistics Authorities (TSSAs);

    (iv)     procured and equipped 6,730 workplaces with modern computers including all
             workplaces of Central Office employees;

    (v)      established a high-speed fiber optic communication channel between the Central
             Office and the Computer Center (Moscow), and Internet and Intranet channels for the
             pilot facilities;




                                                14

    (vi)     established training centers with distant learning tools at the Central Office, the
             Computer Center, and in 6 TSSAs to provide training of RosStat specialists; and

    (vii)    left in place several hardware and software maintenance contracts essential to keep
             these products up to date with the latest upgrades, patches, and telephone support to
             resolve problems.

In addition, technology for efficient warehousing and processing of microdata and aggregated
statistical data was developed. Some 300 RosStat specialists were trained in 1-2 week courses on
use of new software systems, not including separate training on equipment and e-mail/e-
document systems.

Additional impact has been gained from (a) an improved staff morale among RosStat because of
their being equipped with improved computing tools; (b) a stronger basis for collective work
irrespective of geographic location, and (c) a new level of openness engendered by upgrades to
RosStat's website. A key achievement is that subsystems are based on solutions that allow for
increased functionality and application at different organizational levels of statistical observation,
as well as utilization by mid-level specialists.

(vi) Improve the quality of analysis and monitoring of economic development along with the
modernization of decision-making methods for economic policy.

This project supported the development of a new macroeconomic forecasting model tailored to
the Russian economy at the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT), which has
helped to improve forecasting economic activity and impact of policy reforms. Overseas training
was provided to around 40 MEDT staff on forecasting methods and the knowledge gained was
used by staff to build the model. After encouraging test results, the model has been used, inter
alia, to measure the impact of tax exemptions in government revenue, and the impact of
international oil trade on Russian oil prices. Some limitations of the model are that it does not
cover production functions and only computes GDP from the demand side because data on
production (and investment by enterprises and households) is very weak.             Also the model
currently uses industrial classifications only, but the MOEDT plans to include functional
classifications shortly. However, in building the model, MOEDT has made efforts to harmonize
international industrial classifications with EU classifications. The project also supported the
identification of a set of indicators to be derived from the SNA93 framework for monitoring of
Russian economic activities in the short, medium and long term. Other future activities include
the delivery of training to other uses, especially those in the planning units of other line
ministries.

3.3 Efficiency

The efficiency of the project itself was affected by a number of government wide factors
mentioned above in Section 2.2.          A number of these resulted in implementation delays,
eventually an "over-aged" project and an increase in supervision resources associated with the
multiple extensions of the closing date. However, in turn the patience on the part of the Bank to
stick with the project as it continued on a slow but steady implementation path eventually paid off.
As with other projects in the Russian portfolio that spanned a similar time period, the Bank's
steady partnership has culminated in a renewed interest in its technical support and solid
commitment on the part of the authorities to complement this expertise with significant financial
resources. The finalization of the Statistical Master Plan, new Federally Targeted Program and
STASYS 2 are evidence of this. The new model of lending with smaller financial resources from



                                                 15

Bank leveraging and helping to guide a much larger Russian-financed program is likely to be
much more efficient in terms of development outcomes for the World Bank.

In terms of the efficiency of the statistical system, it is hard to measure the impact of the
methodological improvements and increase in staff capacity provided through the project. The
efficiencies to be derived from improved information technology in data collection, greater
reliability of data, and improved quality of services provided by RosStat are difficult to quantify
at this stage, in particular because the modernization effort is not yet complete. However,
anecdotal evidence suggests that in the pilot sites more efficient research tools are (a) allowing
reductions in the time required to introduce changes into All-Russian Classifiers, (b) significantly
reducing the time required to obtain output tables, (c) providing increased information analysis
capabilities, and (d) reducing the time and costs of statistical publications. The same is evident in
the scope and timeliness of trade statistics produced by the Customs Service.

In the future, RosStat has proposed some of it is own performance measures in the context of
Russia's program budgeting reforms. The new project will encourage the further development,
and regular monitoring and analysis of these and other measures of productivity and efficiency at
RosStat and in the statistical system as a whole. These should include the usual measures such as
data produced per resources invested, but also systematized performance measurement of various
information processing systems that are being acquired7.

In terms of efficiency gains, there is one area of concern relating to the RosStat's adjustment of
human resources in response to its improved technological capabilities. There will be a need to
reconfigure staffing both geographically and functionally in order to fully benefit from
productivity gains of the IT modernization. Despite technical assistance provided to strengthen
RosStat's managerial (and technical) capacity in the area of human resource management, its not
clear whether active plans are being made to make these adjustments.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

Weighing (a) the continued relevance of the project goals to Russia's development; (b) the
substantial achievements of the project both in planned and unplanned improvements to the state
statistical system; (c) the successful transition to what looks to be a more efficient intervention by
the Bank in this area in Russia; and (d) against the inefficiency of an over-aged project, the
overall outcome is rated as Satisfactory.




7Some advanced statistical agencies use "Earned Value Management" tools that integrate the investment
scope of the IT work with schedule and cost elements for optimum investment planning and control, and
risk adjusted life-cycle cost estimations of the overall estimated cost for a particular IT investment,
including direct and indirect internal costs plus any period or continuing costs of operation and
maintenance. Initial cost estimates for the CIS activities were shown to be correct. Where there were cost
savings from certain lots, they were used for additional purchase of IT goods of the same category.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The program did not have any direct impact on poverty, gender inequities and imbalances, and
social development. However, the project helped strengthen the survey base to monitor poverty
and social changes, and the dissemination of survey results to allow independent research on
poverty and social issues and policies.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

In addition to the goals and outcomes discussed in Section 3.1, the project aimed to significantly
improve the institutional capacity of the state statistical system, in part, through the passage of the
Law on Statistics and strengthening of RosStat as an institution to lead and coordinate the overall
system. During preparation and effectiveness, the PHRD grant was instrumental in raising the
capacity of the BEA and RosStat in preparing some of the more complex components, including
on sampling, computerization and organizational restructuring.

Despite a long period of preparation since 2000, the Law on Statistics and subsequent regulations
which are expected to, inter alia, reinforce RosStat's leadership of, and coordination across, the
numerous agencies in the statistical system, was only enacted in late 2007 a year after project
closure. While this has not had any material impact on the improvement in technical capacity
within RosStat, it has continued to limit the agency's ability to strengthen coordination within the
statistical system and to build relationships and improve coordination with other data collecting
agencies. The Law will also help to regularize the relationship between RosStats, its respondents
and data users, strengthen its access to administrative data from other government agencies, and
eliminate duplications and inconsistencies in data products from across the system and raise user
confidence. A key delay involved a long period during which the process for preparation,
approval and submission of legislation in the Russian Federation was under review. A later delay
resulted from the intervening passage of the Law on Information which required changes to the
already developed draft Statistics Law. It is clear now that there has been no powerful champion
for the law. Meanwhile laws relating to population and agricultural censuses were passed quickly
with support from relevant ministries in order to facilitate those exercises. The Law has now
been adopted by Parliament in November 2007.

With respect to RosStat, itself, the project did support a number of medium and long term
strategic plans which fed into the development of a Statistical Master Plan, the Third Federal
Target Program Earmarked Plan 2007-09, STASYS 2 and the computerization project. These
marked improved capacity by RosStat to undertake its own strategic planning in a number of
areas. On the other hand, little organizational restructuring of the state statistical system or
RosStat itself has occurred as planned under the project, except as consequence of the state-wide
administrative reform. To date, RosStat's organizational structure appears to have been
reorganized only by external fiat of the Government's public administrative reform effort.         No
Statistical Commission or other advisory body to provide overall guidance to the system of
agencies was established. Several inter-agency working groups were established for coordination
of project activities, but have not yet been elevated to a formal coordination body for the
statistical system. Continued coordination problems with a number of administrative agencies,
including for example, the tax authority are evidence that this area has not been strengthened
sufficiently. It has been explicitly stated that internal restructuring is not a goal of the new Third
Federal Targeted Program.


                                                  17

However, although the project did not succeed in the restructuring of Goskomstat nor go beyond
the preparation of the draft Law on Statistics (submitted to Parliament later in October 2007 and
adopted in November 2007), it has had a substantial impact on strengthening the technical
capacity of the Russian Federation state statistical system through introduction of new
methodologies, data collection, processing, analysis and dissemination systems and processes and
building capacity and knowledge of the staff in Goskomstat through extensive training on
statistical methods, IT and managerial competencies such as HR. The project has also helped to
strengthen data collection, etc in the Custom Committee and the Central Bank, Ministry of
Finance, and Ministry of Economy, Development and Trade. The introduction of surveys and the
related computerization program will have significant impact on the efficiency of data production
in the Russian Federation. Trust and confidence in the state statistical information is growing and
the demand has been generated for continued improvement.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)

Given the comprehensive nature of the project, almost all of the outcomes and impacts were
intended.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A stakeholder workshop was conducted in February 2006 along with a mission to PetroStat,
RosStat's regional office in St. Petersburg, to meet with local users (as well as Petrostat).
Workshop participants reported that, despite the persistent legacy of distrust in Russian
officialdom, confidence in RosStat by users is increasing. However, there remains a need for
RosStat to strengthen presentation of sources and publication of metadata, to publicize new
analytical capabilities, to focus on public education on statistics in order to reinforce and
accelerate this growing confidence, and to routinely investigate major anomalies with other data
sources, particularly at the local level. The relationship with users at the regional level in St.
Petersburg is quite strong, as evidenced by the regular and deep interaction between PetroStat,
local academia and local public administration.

A small rudimentary beneficiary survey was conducted among 36 institutional users of Rosstat's
statistical products in late 2006. Since there was no earlier baseline from project preparation, the
results (presented in Annex 4) cannot form a basis for evaluating project impact, but only current
levels of satisfaction. Overall, the assessment of RosStat as a provider of official statistics is
positive with around 85 percent of respondents indicating trust/confidence in RosStat products.
Areas noted for improvement include the scope and comprehensiveness of information provided
and the ease of data retrieval for analysis.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

The sustainability of current achievements under STASYS appears highly likely. The outputs are
strongly owned by RosStat and other ministries and agencies (GFS, Customs data). The approval
and implementation of the Statistical Master Plan, the third Federal Earmarked Program and
STASYS 2 are signs of strong government commitment to the continued development of the
statistical system.   However, long term sustainability of these efforts still depends on (i)
strengthening coordination and management of the whole statistical system including the passage
of the Law on Statistics that finally was adopted by State Duma in November 2007, (ii) growing
public confidence in RosStat and official statistics in general, as well as (iii) the planned,


                                                18

continued modernization of RosStat's technology and methodologies; and (iv) improvement in
the monitoring and evaluation of investments in the system. Upcoming issues such as further
development of fiscal federalism, Russia's need to address growing inequality and ensure
development/diversification of the non-oil economy will put additional demands on the statistical
system, but also raise awareness among the policy makers of the need for good information.
Some risks may come from the outcomes of Russia's administrative reform efforts.

Sustainability of IT investments depends on adequate operation and maintenance (O&M) of
hardware systems and software, and availability of funds to expand beyond the pilot project. It
should initially be noted that, at whatever its level of funding in the past decade, RosStat has
skillfully and efficiently maintained its technical infrastructure, as evidenced by the fact that
equipment has lasted to the end of its depreciation cycle and far beyond. Sustainability of the IT
investments has been promoted by keeping down projected operation and maintenance costs
through long-term warranty contracts and ensuring funding to roll-out the national system.
Detailed design and procurement specifications took into account future O&M costs (5 years for
servers and 3 years for workstations, with most equipment still under warranty, but software will
require renewal of licenses). As for public funding of the national roll-out, in the follow-on
STASYS 2 project, the Ministry of Finance has decided that the Government would finance the
equipment related to the roll-out of the CIS and that Bank involvement was not required in this
case. The key risk is that RosStat, like other ministries and agencies, is in dire need of personnel,
especially highly qualified IT personnel. Staff retention became an issue following training on the
use of new information technologies at some pilot sites. This will need to be carefully managed.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance in preparation is deemed satisfactory. The Bank responded promptly to
help the government strengthen its first Federal Earmarked Program by preparing a review paper,
holding a seminar with broad stakeholder participation, and formulating a development strategy.
The team correctly identified the long term nature of reforming of a statistical system, in
particular one of this size and inheritance, and recognized the need for careful prioritization and
sequencing. Key adjustments to the authorities' plans included: (i) broadening the scope to the
wider statistical system, i.e. including other government agencies, besides Goskomstat (now
RosStat), involved in the production of statistics and emphasizing the need to improve
coordination among them; (ii) a focus on building management capacity for the statistical system;
(iii) addressing the legal framework; (iv) a more comprehensive reform of data collection and
processing methods; and (v) added emphasis on improving dissemination and building
relationships with end-users. Moreover, the project was an important innovation in the Bank and
provided a launching pad for the development of the Statistical Capacity Building (StatCap)
program which has gone on to provide support to a number of countries, worldwide.

A few shortcomings of the preparation process are worth noting for the record even though they
have not materially affected outcomes. First, the decision to forego a formal Decision Review




                                                 19

meeting8 was not in line with standard practice for an initial project of this size. The second
shortcoming was the rather late acquisition of a PHRD grant due to a protracted approval process
on the GOR side and the subsequent need for an extraordinary extension of the grant beyond the
project's effectiveness date. Third, as noted above, it is not clear whether the full complexity of
the modernization program was understood.                For this and other reasons the project
implementation period should have been longer than the approved four years. Finally, the Bank
misinterpreted the commitment of some of the other implementing agencies to various initiatives
included on their behalf.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance in supervision is deemed very, but not highly, satisfactory.           Close
supervision at the onset of the project helped to resolve some of the early teething pains. A
Quality of Supervision Assessment in 2001 under an assessment of Risky Projects rated project
supervision as Satisfactory. Regular biannual supervision missions were complemented later by
close field-based supervision. The Bank worked closely with the authorities to resolve a number
of implementation problems already described in Section 2.2. As with other projects in the
Russia program over this same period, the Bank demonstrated appropriate patience in resolving
the portfolio-wide issues leading to a renewed interest and new modus operandi for Bank projects
in the Russian Federation. STASYS was the first project in the Russia portfolio to propose and
implement the new co-financing scheme. The mid-term review was effectively used as an
opportunity to formally make adjustments in project structure which have facilitated this
completion review. Financial management and procurement reviews have been undertaken with
appropriate regularity.     Field-based supervision, including of financial management and
procurement processes were important factors that helped to ensure the progress toward
developmental outcomes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Government's performance, that is the performance of the Federal Government as a whole, is
rated as satisfactory. Inefficiencies in project preparation and implementation and of the delay in
achieving the passage of the Law on Statistics must be judged against the very positive
achievements in terms of the renewed commitment to, and increased financing for, the
development of state statistical system evidenced in recent years. During preparation, there were
critical delays in the approval of a PHRD grant by the GOR and in making payments under the
Federal Center for Project Financing (FCPF) grant that consumed initial Bank supervision efforts.
Early complications at the start-up including legal issues with the implementing agency, delays
(now understood to be a sine qua non in Russia) in preparation and effectiveness due to
government bureaucratic procedures, shortages of counterpart financing, and finally, the setbacks
to project implementation owing to periodic government-wide proceedings all contributed to the
eventual result of an over-aged project. Nevertheless, the project achievements remain unique




8The project was declared fully appraised by the Country Director in an official memo.


                                                   20

among the more problematic Russian portfolio of Bank projects, in being almost fully disbursed
and followed up by another operation to continue the development of the statistical system.

(b) Implementing Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

On the other hand, the performance of the implementing agencies is rated fully satisfactory in
light of the project achievements, sustained commitment and effective use of project resources.

Implementing Agency                                                                         Performance
Federal State Statistical Service (RosStat)
RosStat's performance is also deemed satisfactory on account of its effective
use of project resources to strengthen staff capacity, statistical methodologies
and information technology. However, its own inability to undertake its own
organizational restructuring, to push for greater leadership and coordination                Satisfactory

within the statistical system are a notable, but not excessively so, shortcoming
of this performance.9

Bureau of Economic Analysis
The BEA provided project implementation management services for
STASYS, mainly essential administrative support ­ financial management,
procurement coordination, reporting processes, secretariat for the Inter-
Agency Coordinating Committee and Component working groups.                         The
Bureau did not provide substantive oversight and planning. Instead, key
substantive choices regarding the project activities were adequately guided by
the technical working groups, staff in RosStat and ICC.

Notwithstanding the critical start-up delays in particular with adequate and
appropriately skilled staffing even though the Bureau had prior experience                   Satisfactory

with Bank projects, the overall performance of the Bureau was very
satisfactory, and its performance in the area of IT procurement was highly
satisfactory.    In the latter regard, BEA provided critical and substantial value
to the government during the procurement of both equipment and software.
BEA contributed in particular to development of detailed design and bidding
documents through qualified IT specialists. It ensured bidding documents
were of high quality and understandable to third parties. This in turn led to
increased predictability of RFPs and bid proposals.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory




9For example, RosStat has not taken any lead in the resolution of the Central Bank's limited access to the
new functionality available in the electronic interface with the Customs data, and at the time of the ICR

preparation of a memorandum of understanding on electronic access to the GFS.

6. Lessons Learned

Statistical systems, like information systems, are complex entities for which development
requires strong coordination of progress on many inter-related constituent parts.          STASYS
was essentially a greenfield effort in which there were a myriad of areas to improve statistical
methodologies. As such, the sometimes opportunistic approach to using project resources for
upgrading statistical methods remained effective. However, as we move into STASYS 2, the
coordination of various efforts to improve different parts of the system of national accounts will
become increasingly important. For example, delays in implementing the new Classification of
Products will affect the pace of strengthening the compilation of National Accounts.

The conversion from census-only to sample surveys in transition country statistical systems is
not just technical issue ­ there are quasi-political considerations. The move from census to
sample data will essentially affect statistics users at a fine level of disaggregation. While it is
inherently more efficient for a market economy, even developed country statistical systems face
continued demand for this type of data, which they try to satisfy by modeling. As such the
conversion from an all-census to integrated census-sampling framework in transition countries
requires close attention to dealing with concerns of local users or federal users interested in local
area disaggregation to make the case of system-wide efficiency as an equally relevant goal.

Attention to respondent burden is also critical in the transition from census-only to sample
surveys. There is the general impression among RosStat staff that enterprises in the RF are
becoming more resistant to providing data. Large and medium enterprises have good response
rates, but there are continuing concerns about the quality of data provided. By law, small
enterprises receive shortened questionnaires. Their response rates are reportedly on the order of
75 percent. In order to raise response rates and quality of data, statistical systems in transition
must develop a systematic way of measuring and containing respondent burden if they are to
assure the quality of the sample surveys. Pilot survey of individual entrepreneurs have indicated
that face-to-face interviews are a much more effective way of collecting data than self completed
mail-out mail-back interviews or telephone interviews.

The passage of a framework law governing official statistics is not only crucial for legal
reasons but to empower leadership and coordination in the statistical system. The statistical
system is as dependent on administrative data as it is on its own primary data collection methods.
The absence of an identified body to lead/coordinate the system and certify the quality of a
variety of official statistical data creates a vacuum in which distrust and lack of confidence in
official statistics could grow. One lesson from this project is that in transition countries, legal
basis is not only a critical form of empowerment for the national statistical agency, but its
absence can also delay implementation of reforms, including those related to user and respondent
relations.

Time allowances should be provided for unforeseeable delays and project risks related to the
untimely fulfillment of interrelated operations should be considered during project preparation.
An important lesson learned in the project pertains to the complex phasing and timing of IT
modernization processes. First, the coordinating of the multiple facets of IT modernization, e.g.
equipment delivery, software testing, network installation, and civil works for computing centers,
especially in the diverse all Russia regional frameworks (as RosStat has) is complex, requires
closer monitoring and allowances for unforeseen delays. In one case, various delays in the
delivery of equipment, installation of networks, approvals for the remodeling of the server room
resulted in an 18-month lag between when the statistical applications were developed and when
they could be piloted. Relatedly, software contracts require more realistic contractual periods. In


                                                 22

general, time allowances should be provided for unforeseeable delays and project risks related to
the untimely fulfillment of interrelated operations should be considered during project preparation.

A second and positive lesson from the IT experience under STASYS was the prudence of both a
systems-design, and a participatory and step-by-step approach taken by RosStat. At the outset,
RosStat approved a comprehensive framework of the "Technical Project for Computerized
Network Infrastructure," approved by RosStat through a consensus. The scope of this framework
included computer equipment, data storage, printers and office equipment, operational systems,
software and licenses, telecommunications equipment and lease of communication channels,
installation work, testing, and training. All investments in IT are considered within this
framework and RosStat seeks to reach a balance between increasing computing resources and
improving data availability. The participatory approach helped to ensuring the choices made
matched the real requirements of the end user and co-opted them into the implementation early on.
Finally, in going step-by-step both conformed with international standards and technical solutions
and allowed for learning along the way.

Finally, the use of an external agency as the PIU can still be an appropriate model provided the
main beneficiary is fully committed and engaged in project activities. The standard caution
against using PIU remains the foregone opportunity to build internal project management
capacity. However in projects like STASYS and STASYS 2, in which several of the components
or subcomponents are mini-projects (computer modernization, transition to surveys), the
management of these inside the beneficiary institution can substitute more effectively as a
learning experience, while leaving the host of administrative details to an external agency. This
is clearly not a model for all, but could still remain an option for some project.

Annex 4. Beneficiary Survey Results

In late 2006, RosStat conducted a small beneficiary study (for this report) to gauge the current
levels of satisfaction with its published statistical outputs. The questionnaire below was sent to a
broad range of institutional users of statistics 10 including government bodies and research
institutes.   Table 1 (below) present the results. Since there was no baseline against which to
compare these results, they cannot form a basis for evaluating project impact, but only current
levels of satisfaction. The rudimentary nature of this survey is an indication that RosStat still has
a far way to go in terms of internalizing the need for better relations with the whole spectrum of
users as a means of improving the use of its products.

The overall assessment of RosStat as a data provider, among survey respondents, is positive, with
around 85 percent of respondents indicating trust/confidence in the official statistical information.
However, it terms of dissemination, very few respondents were satisfied with the scope (15
percent only) and comprehensiveness (5 percent) of the statistical information provided on the
website. A majority were also dissatisfied with the ease of information retrieval for analysis.

Annex 5. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

(a) Seminar for Users of Statistical Information, in Moscow (February 2006)

                                       Institutions represented:
          RBC-Soft
          University Information System, State Moscow University Research Center
          Institute for Statistical Research &Economy of Knowledge, High School of
          Economy
          Institute for Forecasting of the Russian Academy of Sciences
          Vedomosti
          Center for Fiscal Policy
          Bureau of Economic Analysis Foundation (researchers)
          Independent Newspaper
          Institute for Economy in Transition
          Troika Dialog
          Gazeta
          RosStat RF
          Interfax

Workshop participants reported that, despite the persistent legacy of distrust in Russian
officialdom, confidence in RosStat by users is increasing. However, they pointed to the need for
RosStat to strengthen presentation of sources and publication of metadata, to publicize new
analytical capabilities developed under the project to expert users and researchers; to focus on
public education on statistics in order to reinforce and accelerate this growing confidence, and to
routinely investigate and publicly resolve major anomalies with other data sources, particularly at
the local level. In terms of presentation, participants complained that statistical data presented by
RosStat have considerable deficiencies in the way the information is presented, the statistical
tables are formatted. Several participants also voiced concerns regarding the lack of wider
consultations and involvement of their representatives in the process of identifying the type of
information to be included in statistical publications and to be placed on the website. They
further noted that departmental data are not well coordinated and their outputs are not integrated
in a single system.

Considerable time was taken up by the discussion of two key issues in Russian statistical system
at the time. The first was regarding an ongoing public controversy about the official inflation
statistics, a key indicator used by the general public as well as policy makers and the business
community. Participants listened to RosStat's defense of its methodologies but were concerned
that there was a publicly demonstrated reluctance to "reveal the kitchen" to the public and other
users, even if it meant resolving the controversy. The second issue related to an ongoing official
debate on the need for robust, disaggregated data at the local level to facilitate fiscal
decentralization efforts. It was clear from the discussion that a number of non-governmental
expert users were already deeply engaged in the resolution of this dilemma but also that the issue
of system-wide efficiency versus local demand in terms of sample surveys would not be easily
resolved.

(b) Field Visit to St. Petersburg: Meeting with Users on PetroStat/RosStat (February 2006)

Users of official statistics in St. Petersburg have noted a significant improvement in the quality
and presentation of data produced by RosStat and the regional level statistics offices. They also
acknowledged that these statistics are made available on a timely and regular basis. They have
also noticed substantial improvement in data compiled by PetroStat, which has the overall
responsibility of collection and compilation of official statistics in St. Petersburg. They have
generally good relations with staff and management of PetroStat. Through this good working
relationship, they managed to develop consumer price indices (CPI) for measuring inflation in St.
Petersburg.

However, they are concerned that the statistics produced by ROSTAT are only helpful to policy
and decision makers at the federal level. Policy makers in the regions and local authorities find
RosStat statistics not helpful for use in their region. They would like to receive statistics that are
tailored to their regional and sub-regional needs. According to them, PetroStat is a branch of the
RosStat and its priority is to collect and compile data that are needed by RosStat and the federal
government. For this reason, the report that PetroStat gives low priority to data needed by
policymakers at St. Petersburg. They would like to see improvement in the collection and
publication of gender statistics.

PetroStat has collaborative arrangements with the University of St. Petersburg. PetroStat staff
members are officially teaching applied statistics at the university, and the head of PetroStat is
also on the Board of this University. The two agencies worked closely in the collection and
analysis of recent population census work in Russia. Students from this university are allowed to
participate in PetroStat's survey activities.

On its part, PetroStat informed the ICR mission they would like to improve on the type of
statistics that they produce, but they are constrained by the current federal government
law/regulations on relating to regional statistics offices. Currently, staff in the regional statistics
offices receive operational budget (including staff wages) from the federal government, through
RosStat.    Therefore, PetroStat's annual work program is approved by RosStat.              Although
PetroStat can be hired by regional or municipal governments to carry out specific statistical
surveys, the law requires that funds earned from such contracts be remitted to federal government
(RosStat). This type of arrangements does not give incentives to PetroStat to be innovative
enough to be able to assist regional governments in producing statistics that are specific to their
needs.

In order to meet its specific statistical needs, the municipal government at St. Petersburg wanted
to establish its own statistics units, but it was discouraged by the fact that statistics produced by
such a unit would not be recognized as official, since only PetroStat's statistics are officially
recognized by the federal government.

           with the purpose of Program management to support the development of the state
           statistical system.

Changes in the Project Structure and Financing Arrangements:

The changes in the situation occurred due to a time gap of over one year between the Project
preparation completion date and the project startup date necessitated Project components
adjustment to better meet the Borrower's needs. The adjustments are the following: some initially
planned activities under Component 3 (Strengthening of Statistical Infrastructure) have been
moved to Components 1 and 4; Component 6 (Introduction and Compilation of Financial
Statistics) has been removed; subcomponent Improvement of Collection and Dissemination of
Customs Statistics has been moved from Component 7 to form a new Component 10. Project
Subcomponents have been rationalized and streamlined. Some of the initial vaguely defined
subcomponents have been further elaborated. However, the above changes have not affected the
initial Project objectives.

The World Bank and the Borrower have agreed to the following changes (Amendments to
the Loan Agreement 4468-RU as of April 7, 2002; April 10, 2004; December 23, 2004; and
June 7, 2006):


     The initial project completion date (December 31, 2003) has been extended twice (April 30,
     2005 and December 31, 2006);

     Amendments have been made to Annex 4 of the Loan Agreement (Procurement and
     Consulting Services), namely, to contract value to allow for the application of some or other
     procurement procedures;

     Changes made by the Government of the Russian Federation in financing arrangements for
     IFI-supported projects have necessitated modification of the Project funding ratio: starting
     December 25, 2004, the contribution of the Russian Federation raised to 80% with IBRD
     share reduced to 20%;

Part  of the Project

1. Component: Improvement of Organization, Management Strategy and Perspective
    Planning

Under the Component the Interagency Steering Committee has been set up to ensure Project
implementation management and general supervision. The Board has been strengthened through
the setting up of the relevant working groups for the key areas of the Project implementation.

The Component also covered a number of targets for the development of computer-based
information system (CBIS) of the Goscomstat of Russia: specifically, the formulation of the CBIS
development concept for all federal and regional offices of the Goscomstat of Russia (including
89 regional statistical committees); the design of the technical CBIS development project and
testing of certain hardware/software solutions to improve the efficiency of collection,
transmission, processing, and storage of statistical data.

         The following are the main outcomes of the first stage of the Goscomstat CBIS
Development Project implementation:

         Establishing of integrated information systems; development of network and computer-
         based infrastructure with modern server units in the central office of the Goscomstat, the
         Hydro-Meteorological Center, the Research and Technical Design Institute for Statistical
         Information System (of the Goscomstat of Russia), and in 14 regional offices of the
         Goscomstat of Russia;

         Furnishing of 11,073 working stations for the specialists of the Goscomstat of Russia
         with modern computer equipment (covering 42.7% of the total number of working
         stations);

         Piloting of the Goscomstat CBIS support subsystems with the view of subsequent scaling
         up to cover all regional state statistics offices;

         Establishing of HS fiber communication channel within the central office of the Hydro-
         Meteorological Center to enable information sharing and remote database operation for
         the central office staff;

         Establishing of electronic mail and electronic documentation management systems in all
         regional state statistics offices given the licenses available at every client place;

         Setting up of training facilities within the central office of the Goscomstat of Russia, the
         Hydro-Meteorological Center, and within six regional state statistics offices located in the
         central cities of federal districts;

         Designing of a new web-site for the Goscomstat of Russia and a model site for its
         regional offices; development and implementation of GIS technologies for statistical data
         distribution;

         Commissioning of a unified system for collecting, processing, storage, and presentation
         of statistical data.

In accordance with the Procurement Plan the Component has examined the Long-Term State
Statistics Development Program; has made recommendations to prepare a program for further
development of the state statistics, and has built capacity to manage HR processes within the
Goscomstat of Russia.

The profound reform and development of statistics required establishing an HR information
management system within the Goscomstat. To this end, training was provided for HR
management staff of the Goscomstat of Russia to handle new equipment and software.


                                                    47

A new specialized web-based micro-data dissemination system with user interface has been set
up to help analysts make additional analysis of household survey findings independently.

2. Component: Fostering Knowledge of Standards and Methodology

The Component involved out-of-country training for the Goscomstat staff in internationally
accepted methodologies for official statistical surveys; training in Moscow and in other regions of
Russia in statistical subjects and software handling, as well as training in information technology
application (both in Moscow and other regions of Russia, and abroad). In addition, the Project
Component established computer-based training facilities within the central and regional
offices of the Goscomstat of Russia.

The trainings under the project were provided for over 3,000 staff of the state statistics of which:
370 specialists were trained abroad in international methodologies applied for official statistical
surveys; 2,496 specialists were covered by in-country trainings in statistical subjects and in
software handling (including distant learning); 477 specialists were trained in IT adopted to meet
the needs of Russian statistics. The out-of-country trainings were supported by seven national
statistical agencies. The in-country trainings were organized both in Moscow and in seven
regional training facilities.

3. Component: Strengthening Statistical Infrastructure

The following are the outcomes of the Component implementation:

a) The federal draft law On Official Statistical Accounts and State Statistics in the Russian
    Federation was developed and has now been submitted by the Government to Parliament and
    has had its first reading.

b) Improvement of the calculation methodology for SNA indicators through adopting
    internationally harmonized standard classifications (All-Russian Classifier of Economic
    Activities, Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose, etc.).

The project performed a number of scientific research and technological design activities
allowing for significant improvement of SNA indicator calculation methodologies and practices.

Based on the general government sector data compilation methodology developed under the
project, the 2005 nationwide statistics for general government sector revenue generation, and
revenue use accounts were prepared for production. The indicators were integrated in the 2005
GDP, with subsequent regular revision of those made in January, 2007.

Currently, the above mentioned methodology is being used by regional statistical offices for
general government sector indicators within gross regional product (see publication of statistics,
March, 2007).

In August 2007, all 2005 general government sector accounts data will be published.

The pilot 2002-2004 calculations were made for Household End Consumption Expenditures
indicator based on the Classifier of Individual Household Consumption by purpose.

The methodology adoption will be initiated after finalizing of the 2005 input-output tables.

As part of the activities to improve the compilation of input-output tables through developing
standard classifications, a new methodology have been elaborated for the compilation of input-
output tables using new OKVED-based data along with the conversion table for commodity
groups integrated in the Foreign Economic Activity Commodity Classification (Russia) and All-
Russian Classifier of Types of Economic Activity (OKVED). This enabled compilation of the
2004 imports/exports data by commodity group and tabulation of the data on resources and



                                                 48

consumption of goods and services based on All-Russian Classifier of Types of Economic
Activity for the first time in Russia.

The 2004 pilot tables for resources and consumption of goods and services in Russia will be
published in August, 2007.

The commodity classification developed by consultants as part of the activities to adopt
commodity flow method in Russian statistics is applied for compilation of production accounts
data on the federal and regional levels. The new methodological approaches developed under the
project are applied for the compilation of tables on resources and goods and services consumption
as well as for reconciliation of data on produced and consumed GDP. The approaches can be
fully implemented following the adoption of new All-Russian Products Classifier.

The methodology proposed as part of the activities to improve the calculation techniques for GDP
variables based on the tables of resources and consumption of goods and services allowed for
improving calculation techniques for annual GDP data and its components.

During the first implementation stage for the two-level integrated data preparation system used
for the compilation of national accounts the consultants developed a software to generate (on the
federal level) interactive information resources on non-financial economic sector setup, which
facilitates compilation of production and revenue generation data. The 2006 software tests helped
analyze information resources used for GDP computation and revealed substantial weaknesses in
terms of baseline information quality. Currently, a number of activities are under preparation to
integrate this software in statistics practice and to improve the quality of baseline information
used for macroeconomic calculations and thus enhance the reliability of GDP measures.

The consultative services provided under the Project were aimed to further strengthen SNA in
compliance with the SNA­93 requirements and to develop measurement methodology for current
market value and fixed capital use based on running inventory method, to develop
methodological approaches for measurement of individual non-financial economic assets as part
of the national wealth as well as to shape methodology for construction output data compilation
based on integrated work items, which eventually resulted in substantial improvement of
methodological framework for regular statistical survey of fixed assets, fixed investments, and
construction.

c) New methodologies for different statistical areas of focus were integrated in the current
statistical practices.

Tourism statistics: consultative services were provided for methodological and information
support to compile tourism satellite accounts in Russia and for methodological approaches to

Part  of the Project

12.      Component: Project Management ­ Bureau of Economic Analysis

The comprehensive nature of the Project requiring multi-agency involvement necessitated setting
up the Project Implementation Unit for which the Bureau of Economic Analysis has been
appointed on competitive basis.

The PIU performance has been evaluated as satisfactory throughout the project implementation.
The Project has been successfully completed. The auditors have produced positive audit reports
(covering seven audits conducted throughout the Project implementation) without any substantial
reservations/qualifications.

The successful implementation of the objectives set for all project areas and components is the
result of efficient PIU operations.

             C. Key Impacts on the Project Implementation and Project Outcomes

In the late 1990s there was an urgent need in reforming of the Russian state statistics, namely:
restructuring of data collection, processing, and dissemination framework to reflect market-based
socio-economic development of Russia and to better meet the needs of statistical data users. The
implementation of the STASYS Project has become a key trigger for the most significant
institutional and conceptual reforms occurred in the Russian statistics over last years.

It should be noted that the Project was implemented at a time when economic and administrative
reforms in the Russian Federation were underway. The changes in the country's current situation
necessitated prompt adjustment of the initially designed components and subcomponents of the
Project and setting up of coordination arrangements for the Project implementation and
procurement.

Among the major issues faced during the Project implementation the following should be
specified:

Issues related to organizational arrangements. Involvement of five government agencies and
multiple departments/units of the Goscomstat of Russia in the Project implementation required
proper interagency coordination arrangements. The multi-agency involvement complicated
harmonization/coordination process which led to delays in the project operations (compared to
the projects with only one agency involved) on the initial stages of the Project implementation.

Procurement issues. Initially, it took some time for the Project PIU and the Interagency Steering
Committee to adopt appropriate procurement arrangements in compliance with the IBRD policies
and procedures taking account of specifics of the Project structure and its targets. Non-
involvement of business entities capable of providing required services caused substantial delays
in the Project implementation. The issue was addressed through making appropriate amendments
to the Loan Agreement to specify the lots (works), for which consulting services could be
provided only by public institutions.




                                                 53

Co-financing issues. Since 2002, the Project co-financing arrangements changed to channel funds
through the Goscomstat of Russia based on the requests prepared by the PIU. This required
amendments to the Project Implementation Agreement between the Goscomstat of Russia, the
Ministry of Finance of Russia and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Delays in coordination of
the above document and lack of Government co-financing funds at that period entailed delays in
signing contracts for procurement of computer equipment for the SCC of Russia and the Ministry
of Economic Development of Russia. This was also one of the reasons for Project implementation
delays.

The PIU was prompt to address the issues faced during the Project implementation mostly owing
the close collaboration with the Goscomstat of Russia, the Ministry of Finance of Russia, the
Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, the Central Bank, the SCC of Russia, and the
World Bank.

Overall, the STASYS Project management system can be evaluated as satisfactory and as the one
to have enabled the implementation of its objectives and targets.

                                   D. Outcomes Sustainability


The implementation of the key STASYS Project activities has facilitated creating favorable
environment for the successful operation of the country's state statistical system under the new
conditions of market economy. Overall, the Project has established the key elements of the new
statistics in the Russian Federation to date, which are in line with socio-economic situation of the
country undergoing transition to the market economy and with the Basic Principles of Official
Statistics approved by the UN Statistical Commission.

                                  F. Conclusion (Lessons Learned)

A total amount of USD 29,942,243 out of USD 30,000,000 of 4468-RU Loan proceeds has been
disbursed during the STASYS Project implementation.

The Project has become one of the key activities to initiate institutional and methodological
reforms in Russia's statistics. The large-scale reforms implemented under the Project have
covered the activities of the key executive agencies of the Russian Federation: the Federal State
Statistics Service, the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, the Ministry of Finance of
Russia, the Federal Customs Service, and the Bank of Russia.

The Project has established new key elements of the state statistics in the Russian Federation
consistent with the Basic State Official Statistics Principles approved by the UN Statistical
Commission. Alongside with that, actions are being taken to further improve state statistics,
which is especially important in the light of Russia's OECD accession and strengthening
cooperation with the European Union as well as with IBRD and IMF. In this context compliance
with international standards in statistics contributes much to the consolidation of Russia's
position.

In order to implement and successfully complete the systemic reform process for the state
statistics of the country, to bring it into line with international statistical standards, to build on the
results achieved, and to further develop statistical system within the framework of economic
policies of the government and acceleration of computerization process there is still a need in
addressing a number of pending major methodological and operational issues covering the
following areas:

    ­    Modernization of statistical methodology through establishing the System of National
         Accounts and adopting international economic and statistical classifications;

    ­    Development of information technologies for collection, compilation, storage, and
         dissemination of data and integrated technology for forecasting and analysis;

    ­    Improvement of labor, demographic/vital, and social statistics;

    ­    Build human resource capacity in statistics.

To sustain the results achieved to date and to continue the state statistics modernization process in
the Russian Federation based on international standards in methodology and technology of
collection, compilation, and dissemination of statistical data the implementation of the Second
State Statistics Development Project is planned. The Project preparation is now completed and
its content is in line with the priority areas of collaboration of the Russian Federation with
international financial and economic institutions.
