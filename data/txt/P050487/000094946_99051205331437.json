The development\n            objectives of the project are to restructure the state\n            statistical system for Goskomstat, and strengthen other data\n            collection agencies. The main components include: 1) the\n            institutional strengthening of Goskomstat, which will\n            improve its organization and management, as well as its\n            strategy and perspective planning. Additionally, fostering\n            knowledge of standards and methodology, will be emphasized,\n            as will the strengthening of statistical infrastructure, and\n            the reorganization of data collection, processing, and\n            dissemination; 2) the institutional strengthening and\n            technical assistance to data collection agencies, which will\n            improve financial statistics, with the introduction of a\n            compilation system. Furthermore, improvements in the balance\n            of payments' coverage and quality will be enhanced,\n            through utilization methods and information for economic\n            monitoring and forecasting, hence improving the processing\n            of vital statistics; and, 3) a project management, to\n            establish a Directorate, supporting the development of\n            STASYS for program management."}, "docdt": "1999-04-16T00:00:00Z"}
