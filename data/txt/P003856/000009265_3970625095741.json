Nutrition and\n            Community Health Project will be threefold: (a) to\n            strengthen the coordination and management of five community\n            health programs aimed at significantly reducing infant child\n            and maternal morality in eleven priority provinces,\n            including direct operational support to these five programs\n            individually; (b) to further develop Indonesia's\n            nutrition surveillance capability in four areas: timely\n            warning and intervention, nutrition monitoring and\n            assessment, nutrition policy and program studies, and\n            nutrition information; and (c) to improve nutrition manpower\n            development at the paramedical and graduate levels. The\n            project's principal direct benefits will include:\n            improved coordination and management, thus increased\n            effectiveness and efficiency, of village-level community\n            health (family planning, health and nutrition) services;\n            enhanced national capability to predict and influence\n            changes in nutrition status, strengthened program monitoring\n            and evaluation capacity, and improved food and nutrition\n            policies; and a more adequate stock of trained nutrition\n            manpower for program management and implementation, and for\n            policy formulation and planning."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
