community\n            health programs aimed at significantly reducing infant child\n            and maternal morality in eleven priority provinces,\n            including direct operational support to these five programs\n            individually; (b) to further develop Indonesia's\n            nutrition surveillance capability in four areas: timely\n            warning and intervention, nutrition monitoring and\n            assessment, nutrition policy and program studies, and\n            nutrition information; and (c) to improve nutrition manpower\n            development at the paramedical and graduate levels. The\n            project's principal direct benefits will include:\n            improved coordination and management, thus increased\n            effectiveness and efficiency, of village-level community\n            health (family planning, health and nutrition) services;\n            enhanced national capability to predict and influence\n            changes in nutrition status, strengthened program monitoring\n            and evaluation capacity, and improved food and nutrition\n            policies; and a more adequate stock of trained nutrition\n            manpower for program management and implementation, and for\n            policy formulation and planning."}, "docdt": "1985-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
