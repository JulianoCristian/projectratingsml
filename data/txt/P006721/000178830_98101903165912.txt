OF TIE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROROSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE SECOND EDUCATION FROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$6.5 million to
the Republic of Colombia.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's second loan for education
in Colombia.  The first loan (552-CO) for US$7.6 million was made in Ju'l
1963 for the construction and equipment of ten comprehensive secondary
schools representing the first phase of the Colombian Government's progr,-,
for the reorganization and improvement of secondary education. The Bank
has now been asked to help finance the second phase of the program, consis-
ting of the construction and equipment of nine additional comprehensive
secondary schools.
3.       A Bank mission to Colombia appraised the proposed loan during
May-June 1969, and negotiations were held in W4ashington during February
2-h, 1970.  The Colombian Government was represented by Dr. Octavio Arizrieniodi,
Minister of Education, who was assisted by several officials of the Itnistry
and the Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones Escolares (ICCE) and by an
outside advisor.
4.       The proposed loan, which would be the fortieth made to Colombia,
would increase the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$624.8
million (net of cancellations). IDA has made one credit of US$19.5
million for highways in Colombia. The following is a summary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits to Colombia as of March 31, 1970:

5.        Twenty-three loans have ';een completely disbursed.  The Executi-ve
Directors were previously informed that the Closing Date on Loan 385-CO
had been postponed to June 30, 1971, to permit the undisbursed balance to
be used largely to pay for equi-pmernt which was delivered late for reasons
beyond the control of the borrower (R69-2l5). In 1967, the Executive
Directors approved an amendment to the Loan Agreement for Loan 369-co, split-
ing the loan into two tranches and postponing the Closing Date by two years
to December 31, 1970 (R67-136). Effective December 26, 1963, US$5 million
of the undisbursed balance of Loan 369-Co was cancelled, and a further
US$4 - 5 million is likely to be cancelled prior to the new Closing Date.
Disbursements under Loan 499-oO have proceeded more slowly than originally
anticipated primarily as a result of an overly optimistic estimate of the
Borrower's administrative capacity, but the project works are now progressirnr,
satisfactorily and are expected to be completed by December 31, 1971, one
year later than the original Closing Date. Disbursements on Loan 502-CO
started more slowly than projected due to an underestimation of the time
required to finalize engineering and agricultural plans, but most of the
construction works are now underway, and the loan should be fully disbursec:
by the original December 31, 1972 Closing Date. On the remaining loans
disbursements are continuing at a normal pace.   While US$6.4 million of
Loan 448-cO remains undisbursed, the purpose of this loan is to finance
ranch development plans, through sub-loans to livestock producers, and
these plans generally take about three years to carry out. It is ex-pecte6
that disbursement of Loan 446-00 will be completed on schedule.
6.        IFC has made 34 investments and underwriting commitments in sevenv-
teen enterprises in Colombia totalling US$17.9 million (net of cancellati0);,S.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
7.        Borrower:                     aepublic of Colombia.
PUrpose:                      Construction and equipment of
nine comprehensive secondary
schools to provide space on a
two-shift basis for 31,000
students.
Amount:                       Equivalent in various currencies
of US$6.5 million.
Amortization:                 In 30 years, including a ten-year
grace period, through 41 semi-



a al insrtaliments beginning
N4ovember 15, 1980 and ending
NIovember 15, 2000.
Interest rate:                 7 percent per annum.
Commitment Charge:             3/4 of one percent per annum.
PART III - THE FROJECT
8.        A detailed description of the Project is given in the attached
report entitled "Colombia - Appraisal of a Second Education Project (FE lOc:).
9.        Current projections of manpower requirements indicate that Colomb;^,
needs to restructure its secondary educational system in order to increase
the number and improve the training of students in the fields of industry,
business, agriculture and social services over the next decade.    Some increa3-
in the total number of students educated by secondary schools and insti-
tutions is necessary to attain these objectives, but more important is an
increase in the ratio of pre-vocational to academic students. The Govern-
ment's comprehensive secondary school program should make an impcrtant
contribution to improving this ratio and to improving the quality of edu-
cation received by pre-vocational students. A Bank loan of US$7.6 million
made in 1968 is financing the first phase of this program, consisting of
the construction and equipment of ten schools which, when completed and
operating on a double-shift basis, will provide places for 48,000 student,,.
Construction of the ten schools is ahead of schedule, and the first school
has recently been inaugurated.   The Second Project involves the constructio.
and equipment of an additional nine schools which would accomodate, on a
double-shift basis, 31,000 students. The physical facilities of the nine-
teen schools will permit the implementation of curricula specially prepared
for these schools and which are designed to expand opportunities for educa-
tion in industry, business, agriculture and social services. The schools
will prepare students for employment or further technical training, but a ;
offer sufficient academic education to qualify students for higher levels
of education.
10.      . The total cost of the Second Project is estimated at the equiva-
lent of US$13.0 million, including interest during construction, with a
foreign exchange component of about US$5.s million. The proposed loan
would represent 50 percent of the Project cost and would cover the estimates
foreign exchange component plus the equivalent of US$600,000 of local cost~.
In view of the key importance of the Project to Colombia's efforts to make
the educational system more relevant to its developmental requirements, I
consider it appropriate and justified for the Banlc to finance one-half of
the Project cost, the same percentage as financed for the first project,
with the consequent financing of a small part of the required local expenc-
ditures.



11.     The proposed loan would finance the cost of construction of the
school buildings, procurement of equipmijent and furniture, site development,
architectural consulting services, and technical assistance required for
the continuing development of programs and methods for teaching industrial
and agricultural subjects.   The loan would finance in full the foreign exch,-.Ng-
costs of equipment and furniture proctired abroad, the costs of technical
assistance, and interest and other charges during construction. The loan
would also reimburse the Borrower for 30 percent of the costs of civil works,
architectural consulting services, locally procured equipment and furniture
and project administration. Equipment and furniture would be procured,
and construction contracts would be let, under the Bank's normal internatio-
nal competitive bidding procedures. At the request of the Government domes-
tic manufacturers of equipment and furniture would be granted a margin of
preference equal to the existing general rate of customs duties for the
goods involved or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of the goods, whichever
is lower.
12.     The Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones Escolares (ICCE) is the
agency attached to the Hinistry of Education which is responsible for plan-
ning and coordinating school construction programs. The first project
is being implemented by the Project Unit established for this purpose withifu
ICCE, and this Unit would be responsible also for the administration of
the Second Project. The Director of the Project Unit as well as the Project
architect and educator would be subject to Bank approval. Experience under
the first loan, where the Project Unit designed and supervised construction
of one of the project schools, shows that it is capable of undertalcing an
increased architectural and engineering responsibility and it would, there-
fore, be permitted to design and supervise construction of a maximum of four
schools in the Second Project. Consultants would be employed to design and
supervise construction of the remaining schools. The Project Unit would
continue to be responsible for curriculum development and the coordination
of teacher training in preparation for the new syllabi.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTTRIUNTS AND ATTHORITY
13.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the txt of the Resolution approving
the proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separE.-
tely.
14.     The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions customary for educato:;-
projects. The Borrower would undertake to staff the Project schools with
a majority of full-time teachers, to cause committees of community represen-
tatives to be formed for each Project school to cooperate with the school



- 6 -
in keeping vocational course curric0la up to date and in assisting
graduates to find employment, to cause all Project schools to be operated
in accordance with the new, diversified curricula and on a double-shift
basis by January 1, 1978, and to cooperate with other educational insti--
tutions offering agricultural courses in Colombia in up-dating and com-
plementing their agric!Altural courses.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
15.     The latest economic report of February 10, 1970 (ItH 197a) noted
a continuing improvement in Colombia's economic situation. In recent years
the gro-wth rate of the economy has accelerated, fiscal revenue of the
Government has shown rapid increases, exports of non-traditional products
have expanded at a rapid rate, there has occurred a major increase in
exchange reserves, and domestic price increases have remained moderate.
In addition, favorable developments in the world coffee market, on which
Colombia still depends for the major share of its exchange receipts, are
now expected to lead to a further acceleration of growth of income and
exports. Official planning is now based on a GDP growth rate of the order
of 7 percent per year, compared to actual growth rates of 6.5 percent in
1969, 5.8 percent in 1963 and below 5 percent in the preceding years.
16.     While recent improvements have been gratifying, sustained efforts
on a large scale will be needed for the solution of Colombia's basic deve-
lopment problems. Among these are urgent needs to reduce underemployment
in the rural areas and to raise income of the rural population, which
accounts for half the total population; to reduce open unemployment in the
urban centers and to make possible absorption into productive urban employ-
ment of the continuing influ: of the labor force from the rural hinterland'.
which occurs at the rate of 5.5 percent per annum; to step up substantially
educational opportunities, particularly for the largely illiterate rural
population; and to continue with rapid diversification of the export stfuc-
ture, in order to reduce excessive dependence on coffee and to expand the
basis for progressive and lasting alleviation of the foreign exchange cons-
traint.
.17.    Development strategy in recent years has concentrated on the esta-
blishinent of infrastructure, particularly in transportation, badly needed
in a country of Colombia's size and topography. During this period great
attention has also been paid to agriculture, and as a result the rate of
agricultural growth at present is about 5 percent p.a. compared to the
postwar trend rate of 3-3.5 percent. The rate of industrial growth was
relatively moderate in the past, about 6 percent p.a. It is now expected
to accelerate in response to higher rates of income growth and improvemeni
in the supply of imported materials and equipment.   Sustained acceleration,
however, will also call for more ample domestic credit.



- 7 -
18.       The increased level of investment needed to achieve a higher rate
of growth will require a large dom:estic saving effort and external
financial support.   Recent efforts to mobilize domesticre6ources are reflected
in the rapid growth in central government revenues and savings.
19.       The present e,:ternal public and publicly-guaranteed debt of Colomb -,
including undisbursed amounts, is about USl.L4 billion. Its debt service
ratio is now 12.5 percent. The terms on which the debt has been contracteo
are favorable, and Colombia does not have a serious problem of short-term
indebtedness. Both debt outstanding and debt service are expected to
increase during the 1970's, which will tend to accentuate Colombia's vul-
nerability to fluctuations in its foreign exchange earnings during this
period. However, if export diversification continues to be successful, it
will reduce the impact of the coffee cycle, which is the main cause of
trade fluctuations. ES.ports other than coffee and petroleum have grown
from US$73 million in 1964 to US$117 million in 1967, US$178 million in
1968 and US$200 million in 1969. The Government has resolved to talce all
measures needed to sustain a vigorous growth rate of these non-traditional
exports.
20.       Assuming continued favorable action in the fulfillment of the
fiscal and export targets (as outlined in Report WH 197a) needed to sustai.
Colombia's investment and external borrowing intentions, the Government's
external financing plans seem reasonable even though they imply an increase
in external public debt from US$1.4 billion at the end of 1969 to US$2.3
billion by 1973. If exports and domestic savings develop as expected, the
debt service ratio will increase from 12.7 percent in 1968 to between 16
and 17 percent in 1973 and tend to level off thereafter. Wlith the continua-
tion of present policies Colombia should therefore, be judged creditworth_
for additional external borrowing.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH THE ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the ArticJ'
of Agreement of the Bank.
PAIRT VII - RECOMNIENDATION
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed lo_n..
