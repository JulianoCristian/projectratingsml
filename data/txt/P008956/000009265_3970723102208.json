The principal\n            objective of the program is the transition to a\n            self-reliant, financially independent and responsive\n            production and marketing system in order to stimulate\n            exports and reattain historical growth. The main instruments\n            would be reforms to: (i) reduce producer subsidization while\n            maintaining adequate incentives; (ii) improve the input\n            distribution, marketing and credit systems; (iii) improve\n            the public investment allocation system in the sector,\n            particularly for the Core Irrigation and Drainage Investment\n            Program; (iv) enhance the research, extension, protection\n            and disease control services; and (v) strengthen management,\n            planning, policy analysis and public expenditure programming\n            for the sector."}, "docdt": "1985-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
