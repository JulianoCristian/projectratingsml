distribution lines\n            and about 20,000 metered connections; (b) the expansion of\n            the sanitary sewer system including the construction of a\n            sewer treatment plant with about 25 hectares of oxidation\n            ponds and associated pumping station and emissary,\n            construction of about 4,450 meters of trunk sewer and\n            installation of 60 kilometers of sewer lines and lateral\n            sewers and about 10,000 new house connections; (c)\n            installation of in-house plumbing and lot lines; (d) data\n            processing and
