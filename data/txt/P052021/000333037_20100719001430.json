Appropriate results\n            and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework is needed\n            to inform about progress towards achieving the expected\n            project development objectives. The project's results\n            and M&E framework have issues of disconnect and lack of\n            attribution. Bank management ought to exercise a more\n            thorough review of the proposed logical framework at the\n            concept review meetings or at a later stage through a\n            quality enhancement review meeting.
