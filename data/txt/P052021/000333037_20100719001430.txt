1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal.

While 90 percent of primary and 56 percent of secondary school age children were enrolled in
schools in Panama at the time this project was identified in October 1997, significant inequities in
access and completion in primary and secondary education existed, especially among the urban
poor, rural and indigenous population. The indigenous population, for example, comprising about
10 percent of the total population of Panama, had on average 4 years less of schooling than non-
indigenous population in the 20-29 year age bracket, with about 17 percent of indigenous children
in the 6-11 year cohort not enrolled in school. Enrollment rates for indigenous children in
primary schools were 14 percent lower, and in secondary schools, 60 percent lower, than other
non-poor-rural population groups. In rural areas, children that had completed their six-year
primary education, mostly in multi-grade schools, were, for the most part, unable to continue with
their education because there were no lower secondary schools offering grades 7-9 in their
communities.

According to the 1999 World Bank (Bank) Panama Poverty Assessment Report of April 2000,
indigenous groups were among the poorest in the country, with about 95 percent of them falling
below the poverty line, and 86 percent living in conditions of extreme poverty, with levels of
consumption below the minimum needed to meet the recommended daily caloric requirements.
About 50 percent of indigenous children under the age of five suffered from malnutrition
compared to 16 percent for all Panamanian children. This assessment pointed to the importance
of investing in bilingual education and relevant educational materials for indigenous populations.
Only 52 percent of indigenous children in primary schools reported having books compared to 91
percent for the non-indigenous population. Although the 1995 Education Law introduced a
provision for bilingual education for indigenous communities, at the time of identification the
Government of Panama (GOP) had not yet implemented any bilingual education program.

The first issue addressed by this project concerned access to quality basic education (preschool,
primary and lower secondary) in an equitable fashion targeted to children of the most vulnerable
population groups that were not fully covered under a previous Bank-financed investment (the
First Basic Education Project). The project aimed at strengthening and expanding programs of
initial and preschool education for children of indigenous communities, in poor rural and
marginal urban areas. Lower secondary education was to be offered through distance education
methods (Telebásica) to students in remote rural areas. Quality was to be sought by: (a) supplying
multi-grade, bilingual and other learning materials and school libraries to all the above-mentioned
targeted students; (b) offering teacher training; and (c) eliminating the dilapidated shanty schools
(escuelas rancho) in poor communities providing not only adequate school buildings with
appropriate learning resources, but also ensuring appropriate sanitary conditions in the schools.

The second issue was to continue supporting the Ministry of Education's (MEDUCA) efforts in
strengthening its organizational, planning, supervisory, policy-making and management capacity.
Management in the education sector was highly centralized in MEDUCA. The educational
system lacked a standardized national learning assessment scheme to monitor the quality of
student learning in mathematics and language. The ongoing management information system,
mostly producing the annual educational statistics in an untimely and unreliable fashion, was also
disconnected from the financial and administrative education management systems.



                                                 1
Government's strategy. The Bank financed project was designed in the context of GOP's ten-
year strategy for the education sector known as Estrategia Decenal de Modernización de la
Educación Panameña 1997-2006, which the GOP enacted through MEDUCA in October 1996.
This strategy recognized the following four key areas in urgent need to be addressed: (i) inequity
in access to school, low completion rates and continuity to post-primary education for the less
privileged groups in rural, indigenous and marginal urban populations; (ii) poor quality of
education as reflected in lack of textbooks and other learning materials, poorly trained teachers
and dilapidated school infrastructure; (iii) obsolescence of the administrative model characterized
by centralized, hierarchical and bureaucratic administration; and (iv) poor distribution of financial
resources, even though educational spending had increased from 5.6 to 6.1 percent of the gross
domestic product in the last ten years.

Rationale for Bank's assistance. The rationale for Bank's assistance was argued on the basis of
the overarching support the Bank was already providing GOP: (i) to implement the above-
mentioned strategy through the then ongoing First Basic Education Project (P007832, Ln 3994-
PAN), a US$35 million operation that became effective on August 26, 1996 and closed on
October 31, 2002; and (ii) in the social sector to alleviate poverty through the following related
operations: the Social Investment Fund Project (P007837), the Rural Poverty and Natural
Resource Project (P007847) and the Rural Health Project (P007846).

Through the First Basic Education Project, technical and financial support was provided to the
GOP to: (i) expand coverage of preschool education to rural and poor urban areas through the
Community and Family Centers for Initial Education (CEFACEI), a community-based non-
formal education model using local promoters and especially designed educational materials in
community-provided facilities; (ii) expand home-based initial education programs targeted to
rural and indigenous communities, providing training and educational materials to parents of
children under 6 years old to improve their child rearing practices and help them guide their
children's early mental, physical and social development; (iii) provide teacher training for multi-
grade teachers in the entire country; (iv) provide educational materials for all multi-grade schools
as well as textbooks for all primary and lower secondary (grades 7-9) students in targeted
townships; (v) build and rehabilitate educational infrastructure; and (vi) provide scholarships to
facilitate access of children from the poorest families to primary and lower secondary schools.

In addition, the Bank brought into the policy dialogue, and subsequently, to the project design its
worldwide experience with addressing similar educational issues in other Latin American
countries and in other regions, in particular with non-formal early childhood programs (like the
Bank-financed Initial Education ­PRODEI ­ in Mexico) and distance education schemes for the
delivery of lower secondary education in rural areas (like the Telesecundaria and Teleprimaria
programs, also from Mexico). Finally, the Bank was also instrumental in helping the GOP to
administer appropriate poverty targeting criteria and mechanisms to focus this operation on the
poorest and most vulnerable school-aged population.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators.

The Project Development Objectives (PDOs), identical to the ones of the First Basic Education
Project were to: (a) improve the quality and efficiency of basic education (preschool, primary and
lower secondary) in the country; (b) improve equity of access to preschool, primary and lower
secondary education for children in rural and poor urban areas; (c) expand the coverage of
preschool and initial education through community-based non-formal education models; and (d)
strengthen the planning, supervision and policy-making capacity of MEDUCA, by expanding the
actions undertaken under the ongoing First Basic Education Project.


                                                 2
The project also sought to contribute to higher-order objectives of (i) lower levels of extreme
poverty; (ii) greater efficiency; and (iii) higher completion rates in primary and lower secondary
schools.

The following project outcome indicators were agreed with the GOP: (a) all shanty schools were
to be replaced; (b) 1,515 classrooms were to be rehabilitated; (c) 30 Telebásica pilot schools were
to open; (d) approximately 240,000 multi-grade students, 37,000 students in indigenous
communities and 40,000 lower secondary education students were to receive appropriate
textbooks and other educational materials; (e) CEFACEIs were to enroll 12,000 new children
while the home-based initial education were to train 6,000 rural parents by 400 new mother
leaders; (f) 54 percent of children in the 4-5 age-cohort were to be enrolled in preschool; and (g)
regional offices operating and trained in all regions.

The PAD and the Implementation Letter include agreed project output monitoring indicators with
the GOP whose attainment is fully described in section 3.2, Annex 2 and the Data Sheet of this
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR). These indicators reflect mostly learning
materials for multi-grade schools, scholarships provided to basic education students in need,
number of Telebásicas, infrastructure and the strengthening of MEDUCA's regional offices.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The PDOs were not modified during project implementation. Project outcome indicators were
adjusted to reflect the additional financing (see Section 1.7).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The project aimed to provide education materials (including bilingual materials) to approximately
280,000 children attending public primary and lower secondary schools, representing about 60
percent of the total enrollment in basic education, including 37,000 in indigenous communities.
These students were attending public schools located in the poorest areas of the country as
defined by the poverty map developed by the Ministry of Economy and Finance with the data
from the 1998 Living Standards Measurement Survey, combined with data on educational gaps.
The scholarships to be financed by the project aimed at benefiting annually about 6,000 primary
and secondary education students living in poor areas (including 3,600 in rural and indigenous
areas) as defined by the poverty map.

Replacement and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure was targeted to priority areas in all
districts as determined by the school map and inventory of physical infrastructure conditions
carried out under the First Basic Education Project. Accordingly, approximately 1,515 classrooms
were to be rehabilitated along with 318 existing sanitary modules and another 2,592 classrooms
were to benefit from preventive maintenance financed by the project.

It was expected that the project would benefit: (i) about 12,000 additional preschool-age children
in disadvantaged rural communities through the expansion of 600 new CEFACEIs; (ii) another
12,000 children, representing 3.8 percent of the population under six years of age, through the
expansion of 400 new groups of the home-based initial education program, including the training
of 400 mothers in small, hard-to-reach rural communities; and (iii) approximately 2,200 primary

lower secondary education, through enrollment in a Telebásica.

1.6 Revised Components

Project components were not revised except as part of additional financing (see section 1.7).

1.7 Other significant changes

The following two significant changes took place during project implementation. First, the
closing date was extended 3 times for a cumulative amount of 4 years, from June 30, 2005 to June
30, 2009. Second, in 2007 the project received additional financing of US$7 million (US$5
million as a new Bank loan and US$2 million in counterpart funding from GOP). This
additional financing loan was signed by the GOP on October 26, 2007 and became effective on
February 26, 2008. Additional resources financed the scaling up of the proven cost-effective
activities of early childhood stimulation programs and the Telebásica to further address remaining
issues of coverage of school-age population in rural areas. This additional financing was also
intended to bridge the completion of this project with the preparation of a follow-up operation
using lessons learned from the Second Basic Education Project.

The US$7 million of additional financing were allocated as follows (summarized in Table 2
below):

Component A ­ Education Quality (total cost US$2.0139 million; US$1.935 million from the
loan and US$0.078 million from GOP). This component representing about 29 percent of the
total additional financing aimed at supporting: (a) the provision of more learning materials for
multi-grade schools (constituting about 74 percent of total schools in Panama) and bilingual
schools including teacher training in multi-grade pedagogy and Spanish as a second language for
indigenous population; (b) the continuation of the scholarship program, 100 percent financed with
counterpart funds; (c) the expansion of the Telebásica program to 20 new centers offering the
possibility for about new 500 primary education graduates in rural areas to continue 7th, 8th and
9th grades of lower secondary education, including the training of 229 Telebásica teachers and
the equipping of classrooms; and (d) the contracting of a qualified external consultant to
supervise the quality and completion of civil works and carry out an evaluation of the
infrastructure activity financed under the original loan.

Component B ­ Early Childhood Education (total cost US$4.154 million; US$2.317 million
from the loan and US$1.837 million from GOP). This component representing about 59
percent of the total additional financing aimed at supporting the expansion of: (a) the CEFACEI
program to 125 new groups reaching 3,125 more children, bringing the total number of children
benefited since 2001 to 66,064, including the training of community educators (promotoras) and
parent's associations (COPAMACEs); and (b) the home-based Initial Education Program to 50
new groups benefiting 900 more children including training and provision of learning materials
and the re-broadcasting of the radio program "La familia Amaya y su sabia Guacamaya".




                                                5
Component C ­ Institutional strengthening (total cost US$0.558 million; US$0.534 million
from the loan and US$0.023 million from GOP). This component representing about 8 percent
of the total additional financing loan aimed at establishing new management information modules
building on the then ongoing human resource management information system (Sistema
Administrativo de Recursos Humanos ­ SIAREH) established under the original loan.
Accordingly, a digital documentation center was to be created to scan, systematize and house
official documents pertaining to MEDUCA, especially concerning human resource and school
related information. This component was also aimed at training MEDUCA's officials in the
collection and use of official statistics and continuing supporting the internal reorganization,
modernization and decentralization of MEDUCA.

Component D ­ Project Coordination (total cost US$0.273 million; US$0.212million from
the loan and US$0.061 million). This component representing about 4 percent of the total
additional financing aimed at supporting the PCU under the then existing arrangements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The ICR considers that strategic relevance and approach selected by the Bank for this project was
appropriate; client orientation was effective; and project design was consistent with Panama's
education sector strategy. The project coordinated its support with that of the IDB but no
multilateral or bilateral institution was included in the financing of this project.

The Bank team was well aware of the technical aspects of the implementation of project activities
and carried out appropriate economic and financial analysis of the proposed project. Nevertheless,
the ICR is of the view that the Bank team did not carry out a suitable institutional capacity
assessment, assuming instead that the new operation would use the same institutional
arrangements as the first Basic Education Project. This assumption proved wrong and it took
MEDUCA until early 2003 to hire the necessary personnel. In addition, as fully explained in
sections 2.3 and 3.2 of the ICR, the PDOs, outcome and output indicators have issues of
relevance, disconnection with what they are trying to measure, and attribution.

The project complied with the Bank's fiduciary and social safeguard policies following current
standards, including procurement and financial capacity assessment, indigenous population and



                                                        6
social assessment, but did not complied with the environmental safeguard. There was a risk
assessment and some lessons learned from similar Bank-financed programs in the region and
elsewhere were included in the project design. However, the risk assessment underestimated key
risks that ended up affecting project implementation, as further described in section 5.1(a) of the
ICR.

2.2 Implementation

The project was approved on September 7, 2000, the loan was signed in January 2001 and
became effective on June 11, 2001, nine months after Board approval and six months after the
expected date of effectiveness set forth in the PAD.

Implementing agency. The project was implemented by MEDUCA following the same
institutional and operational arrangements that were established for the First Basic Education
Project. The financial and administrative responsibilities, as well as the monitoring of project
implementation rested primarily with the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which was a separate
structure created to manage the project. The Institute for Human Resource Development (Instituto
para la Formación y Aprovechamiento de Recursos Humanos ­ IFARHU) was charged with the
responsibility of implementing the scholarship sub-component through a subsidiary agreement
with MEDUCA. The infrastructure activities were entrusted in 2002 to the Social Investment
Fund (Fondo de Inversión Social-FIS) under another subsidiary agreement with MEDUCA. The
General Directorate of Education was assigned the responsibility for the implementation of: (i)
the preschool and initial education component through its Initial Education Directorate with the
support of the regional offices of MEDUCA and local community organizations; (ii) the piloting
of the Telebásica; and (iii) the multi-grade teacher training. MEDUCA's Curriculum Directorate,
in coordination with the General Directorate of Education was in charge of the acquisition of
assorted learning and training materials for multi-grade primary schools including those targeted
to indigenous population. The General Directorate of Finance and Institutional Development was
responsible for all the activities under Component C (Institutional Strengthening). A Project
Management Committee, chaired by the Vice-Minister of Education and including the heads of
each project implementation unit was established to provide the required project oversight
functions.

Physical and financial implementation assessment. The project had a relatively slow start, with
only about US$1.5 million of loan funds disbursed by December 2002. Similarly, the
implementation of activities under the additional loan was delayed by about 8 months due to
longer than expected time lag between Board approval and loan effectiveness. As a consequence
of this delay, about US$1.53 million of the additional financing proceeds were not spent at the
closing of the loan on June 30, 2009. The following reasons explain the challenges with physical
and financial implementation.

First, project design intended that infrastructure sub-component would be carried out by the office
of the Regional Directors of Education of MEDUCA in coordination with the National
Infrastructure Directorate and the General Directorate of Finance and Institutional Development.
This option was canceled in 2001 because of the low capacity of the regional offices to execute
these activities. Instead, a subsidiary agreement was signed between the FIS and MEDUCA in
January 2002 to entrust the former with the implementation responsibility of this sub-component
as FIS had much experience with works. Thus, until this matter was resolved, no civil works were
carried out (category of expenditure representing 28 percent of the total loan).




                                                7
Second, the PCU was not fully staffed, lacking, among others, (i) PCU coordinator (recruited in
January 2003); (ii) procurement officer (recruited in March 2003, almost 20 months after the date
of effectiveness); and (iii) Telebásica officer (recruited in March 2002).

Third, new administrative processes instituted by MEDUCA and the National Comptrollers office,
including extra layers of time-consuming and cumbersome procurement and payment
authorization procedures, adversely affected project implementation.

Once the above-mentioned issues were addressed, the project's physical and financial
implementation pace significantly improved.

Finally, other issues hindered the effective implementation of the project and audits conducted
pointed to possible irregularities in the distribution of learning materials and goods to non-project
beneficiaries.

Extension of the closing date. The closing date of the project was extended three times: (a) the
first time from June 30, 2005 to May 31, 2007 (23 months); (b) the second to December 30, 2008
(19 months); and (c) the last time to June 30, 2009 (6 months). The first two extensions were
granted to ensure satisfactory completion of all project activities. The last extension was granted
to compensate for the implementation delay experienced by the additional financing loan. These
three extensions do not include the extension of the project that took place with the approval of
the Additional Financing Loan.

Possible irregularities. In 2008 Bank supervision identified possible irregularities in the
distribution of goods purchased with two contracts awarded under the project in 2006. One
contract amounting to US$1.125 million concerned the purchase of 100,000 school bags, each
containing school supplies; the other contract for US$0.46 million referred to the acquisition of
children's tables and chairs for the CEFACEIs. This represented 0.035% of the total Bank's funds.
The Bank team promptly reviewed these findings and discussed with MEDUCA and the Ministry
of Finance remedial actions, including an additional technical audit of the distribution of goods
purchased through these contracts and new distribution plans for other goods purchased through
the project. The Bank also discussed with MEDUCA the need for a more effective project
oversight. The Bank team carried out the agreed technical audit in May 2009. Findings, based on
a random check in 14 primary schools in 4 different regions of the country, point that some
school bags made it to the project's intended beneficiaries, while others, perhaps as many as
36,500, were diverted to beneficiaries of another GOP's education program ­ A la escuela
temprano -. Furthermore, the review underlined the lack of documentation to account for up to
thirteen percent of the total inventory of the backpacks. With respect to the tables and chairs
financed under the project, based on a random check of 9 project CEFACEIs in 3 different
regions of the country, this audit concluded that these goods reached their intended beneficiaries.
MEDUCA's legal department has recently ordered another internal audit to determine the
physical location of the backpacks and the functionaries responsible for their distribution.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The project's development objective (PDO) does not fit with the scope of project activities: the
PDO refers to improvement of quality and efficiency of basic education in the country, while the
project really targeted only a segment of the entire basic education system, namely, the multi-
grade schools and few locations in rural areas offering a distance education alternative for lower




                                                 8
secondary education. In the view of the ICR, a more appropriate objective would have been to
focus on improvements in the schools participating in the project.

Design of the results framework and the M&E arrangements. The design of the results
framework and the M&E arrangements for the project has both strengths and weaknesses. Among
the strengths the ICR recognizes the selection of the intermediate outcome indicators listed in the
ICR Data Sheet. Among the weaknesses of the design, the ICR is of the view that there is a
disconnect between the PDOs and the indicators selected to measure their achievement. First,
indicators chosen to gauge the achievement of the PDO are outputs rather than outcomes; which
was the common practice at the time the project was prepared. Second, although PDO calls for
increased quality and equity of education, none of the key indicators address this issue. An
accepted measure of quality in the education sector is learning achievement in several areas of the
existing curriculum, which should be compared to a baseline or a control group. No learning
achievement indicators were included in the project's results framework, nor where reported
during the entire implementation period.

Although most interventions financed by the project were targeted to the poorest segments of
student population, the ICR is of the view that the M&E framework does not include an
appropriate indicator to measure improvement in equity of access. One way this project could
have measured equity would be to compare access to preschool and basic education among
project beneficiaries against a control group of non-beneficiaries attending public preschool and
basic education schools, and/or against a baseline.

Similarly, the M&E framework does not include indicators to measure achievements in
strengthening the planning, supervision and policy-making capacity of MEDUCA.

Implementation and utilization. M&E of project activities, outcomes and impacts were carried
out by the PCU and MEDUCA using four types of data and information sources.

First, the PCU kept track of annual and cumulative financial and physical targets, which were
reported to the Bank on semi-annual basis to assess project implementation progress.

Second, in 2005 MEDUCA piloted the National System of Evaluation of Learning Quality
(SINECA) gathering information on learning achievement in Spanish, Mathematics, Natural and
Social Sciences on a sample of basic education students. The preliminary findings of this
measurement were reported in 2007. At that time it was thought that SINECA would be a one-
time measuring exercise although MEDUCA has continued these evaluations. SINECAS'
preliminary 2005 information has been used by MEDUCA to make some preliminary
assessments of the effectiveness of the early-childhood stimulation modalities and the Telebásica.

The third source of information consisted of the different studies over the life of the project
commissioned by the PCU and financed by the project, for example: (i) one on Early Childhood
Programs (2001 and 2006); and (ii) four on Telebásica (2003, 2004, 2007 and 2009). Findings of
the CEFACEI study (Community and Family Centers for Initial Education, 2006) indicated that
students participating in the program performed as well as their peers who attended formal
preschools according to the 2005 scores provided by SINECA, controlling for type of early
childhood stimulation modality of the students being tested. Similar results were found for
students attending Telebásica centers when compared to similar students in conventional lower
secondary schools.




                                                9
The fourth type of information source is the one provided by the human resource management
information system (SIAREH) developed under the project. This system has in fact modernized
and made more transparent teacher recruitment, deployment and management practices. This
system, which is web-based and with unrestricted access to all regional offices of MEDUCA, is
maintained by the Informatics Department in MEDUCA.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The ICR finds a mixed record on safeguard and fiduciary compliance during project
implementation. Financial and procurement capacity assessments were undertaken during project
preparation finding no major issues. These assessments concluded that the acquired fiduciary
expertise by the PCU of the then ongoing Bank-financed First Basic Education Project satisfied
the Bank's financial and procurement requirements. Nevertheless, in the particular case of the
financial capacity assessment, some recommendations were provided to update the Accounting
and Operational Manuals and to better position the PCU to prepare the quarterly financial
management reports (FMRs) required by this new operation.

Almost every supervision mission included a procurement and financial management specialist to
review the fiduciary compliance by the Borrower. In addition, the Bank carried out in-depth
random ex-post procurement and financial management review missions at least once a year.
Some of these missions detected weaknesses in the procurement and financial management
systems of the project and reflected this situation in supervision reports. Steps to address these
detected weaknesses were agreed upon with MEDUCA, their compliance followed through in
subsequent Bank supervision missions and the findings recorded accordingly. The fiduciary
compliance performance of the Borrower during project implementation was mixed with
procurement and financial management weaknesses uncovered during supervision.

It took about 20 months after effectiveness to appoint a qualified procurement staff to the PCU
after which the Borrower's procurement performance improved. However, by and large,
procurement processes were significantly delayed by lengthy approval procedures that included
many layers of oversights, both within MEDUCA and the Comptroller's Office.

Several Bank supervision missions detected that a significant amount of learning goods acquired
under the project were not distributed to the schools in a timely manner. During project
implementation, the undistributed learning goods remained in the warehouses of the PCU and
MEDUCA.

The overall weak procurement performance of the PCU in terms of capacity to manage
procurement processes made the Bank team recommend to the highest authorities of MEDUCA
to transfer this fiduciary responsibility to MEDUCA in or about the second semester of 2008. To
support this transfer, the Bank provided a series of procurement training workshops, including the
use of the Bank's and IDB's system to monitor the implementation of the approved annual
procurement plan (Sistema de Ejecución de Planes de Adquisiciones - SEPA). Once this transfer
was completed, MEDUCA started using the National Procurement System PanamaCompra,
which together with the transfer improved fiduciary performance. After this transfer MEDUCA
was able to save resources due to improvements in the procurement processes of activities in the
agreed procurement plan.

With respect to works, the FIS acted with little or no direct oversight from MEDUCA/PCU or
Bank supervision missions. The PCU lacked qualified staff in charge of supervising the
infrastructure sub-component under FIS from early 2006 onwards. Bank supervision missions


                                               10
mostly resorted to discussions with the FIS's central authorities requesting specific works-related
information, which, by and large, remained unanswered by this institution. In the absence of
response by FIS, the Borrower, at the Bank's request, commissioned a special infrastructure
assessment, regrettably, at a very late stage of project implementation. As mentioned in section
5.1(b) of the ICR, the findings of this assessment are worrisome.

The quarterly FMRs were often submitted to the Bank late. Some of the FMRs in 2002, 2003 and
2004 were found by the Bank to be of low quality. The project was not able to computerize the
financial and accounting control systems, resorting instead to manual procedures using Excel, in
particular to carry out payments, inventory control and elaborate the project financial statements.
The Bank team found this manual financial control system to be unreliable, untimely in
generating the required information to produce the quarterly FMRs and containing factual errors.
At the writing of this ICR, MEDUCA was attempting to link its financial management systems to
GOP's financial and accounting management system (Sistema de Informacion Financiera y
Contable ­ SIFCO) an effort that was financed by the loan but not completed at its closing date.

Audit reports were submitted to the Bank with an average delay of about six months. With the
exception of the 2002 and 2008 Audit Reports, the rest of the reports were qualified (not clean).
Qualifications listed in these audit reports included: (i) the auditors were not able to verify
counterpart contributions made by IFARHU; (ii) they found ineligible expenditures; and (iii) also
found weaknesses in the internal controls of the PCU such as lack of up-to-date inventories, lack
of IT controls.

The fact that audit report were consistently submitted late, with qualified opinion, coupled with
the fact that the auditors and Bank missions had identified some weaknesses in the reconciliation
of advances to FISDL for the construction/rehabilitation of schools and in the control of fixed
assets and school materials, and that pending actions had not been implemented at the end of the
project contributed to the unsatisfactory financial management arrangements at the end of the
project.

The project record on safeguards compliance was mixed. It did not comply with environmental
safeguards but it did in the case of social safeguards. The project's environmental screening
category was rated "C" at appraisal, however according to current perspective it should have been
rated "B" as the project financed civil works, which ended up representing 32.5 percent of the
total project cost. As a category "B" project, an environmental impact assessment should have
been carried out. The situation was different in the case of social safeguards. At appraisal a
social assessment was implemented and the project materially complied with later provisions of
the Bank policy on indigenous peoples (Operational Directive 4.20): it financed activities that
benefited several indigenous groups of Panama, and these groups were duly consulted on the
design and implementation of project's activities.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Transition arrangements. Most project activities including CEFACEIs and Telebásicas financed
by the project are being technically, financially and institutionally sustained by MEDUCA after
the closing of the loan. Expansion of the CEFACEI and Telebásicas were included in an
approved Bank-financed operation that was subsequently canceled by the Government in
December 2009; this operation is described in the next paragraph. Despite this cancellation, those
activities are likely to be sustained by the Government. Additionally, the infrastructure built or
rehabilitated under the project is being currently utilized as well as all the multi-grade and
bilingual learning materials provided by the project. IFARHU continues with the provision of


                                                11
scholarships targeted to poor students in urban, rural and indigenous communities. Finally,
SIAREH is an ongoing human resource management information system used by MEDUCA.

New education sector Bank-financed operation. Based on the lessons learned of this project, a
new US$42 million operation - Panama Education Quality Improvement Project (Loan 75860-
PA) ­ was prepared during 2007-2008 and approved by the Board on August 5, 2008. This new
operation, partially financed by a Bank loan of US$35 million and by GOP's counterpart funding
of US$7 million was declared effective in December 2008 and was expected to close on
December 31, 2014. This new operation built upon the previous project as it aimed to improve:
(i) the quality of non-formal initial, basic (grades 1-9) and secondary (grades 10-12) education
programs through supply-side interventions on pedagogical methods, curricular relevancy,
promotion of information technology literacy skills and improved technical capacity to measure
learning outcomes; (ii) the coverage and internal efficiency of initial and basic education and
increased transition rates to first grade of primary education; and (iii) the strategic planning and
institutional performance of MEDUCA at the central, regional and local levels through enhanced
administrative, management, monitoring and evaluation schemes. This operation was expected to
finance impact evaluation studies of the CEFACEIs and the Telebásica. Improving equity was
also embedded in each component of the project.

Another key departure from the previous operation was the disappearance of a PCU, in line with
current best practices in Bank-financed operations. Accordingly, MEDUCA was intended to
have overall project execution responsibility, including the fiduciary aspects of the operation,
through its regular central and regional structure, with the day-to-day managing and oversight
tasks of the 3 components assigned to MEDUCA's Director General for Education.

This operation was never implemented. The new administration that took office on July 1, 2009
(one day after the closing of the previous loan) canceled it on December 2009, indicating that
given policy changes in MEDUCA, the Ministry did not need support for the activities that were
meant to be financed by this new operation.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDOs were consistent with the Government's ten year strategy for the education sector at the
time of its design. These objectives remain relevant today. The project PDOs were also
consistent both with the Bank's CAS for FY99-01 (Report 18421 of October 29, 1998 discussed
by the Board on November 11, 1998) and with the current FY08-10 Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) (Report 39040 discussed by the Board in October 2007).

By supporting models of non-formal early childhood interventions, multi-grade schools, bilingual
education, lower secondary distance education, and the construction and rehabilitation of schools
in rural areas, the project aimed at correcting inequities in social spending by targeting
investments to benefit the poorest groups of the Panamanian society, many of whom lived in
conditions of relative isolation and neglect in indigenous, rural and marginal urban communities.
By supporting institutional development, the project aimed at assisting the GOP to strengthen its
capacity to replicate cost-effective activities piloted under the project in other areas of the country.
These objectives remain relevant today despite changes in Government's priorities. Moreover,
the Government new policies of creating "schools of excellence" and of providing full
scholarships to poor students also aim at decreasing inequalities in access, which was one of the
PDOs. Even though the Government cancelled a follow up project that financed similar activities,
most of these activities will be sustained over time, such as Telebásica and CEFACEI programs



                                                  12
and the use of the infrastructure rehabilitated or constructed by the project, and thus most of its
design and implementation also remain relevant.

The ICR is of the view that the PDOs remain relevant today and also most of the project's design
and implementation.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Assessment of PDO achievements. The achievement of the PDOs is mixed. On the one hand,
the ICR found direct and/or indirect analytical evidence that the efficiency of basic education and
the equity of access to preschool, primary and lower secondary education for children in rural and
poor urban areas were improved as a consequence of the project (see the Data Sheet and the
explanation that follows below). Additionally, even though there was no indicator to measure the
institutional strengthening of MEDUCA, there is some evidence that this operation improved the
planning, supervision and policy-making capacity of the Ministry. However, the ICR does not
have any analytical evidence concerning learning outcomes (the appropriate metric to measure
changes in quality) including a baseline and a control group to ascertain if quality of basic
education was improved in the project schools.

PDO indicators. From the information detailed in the ICR's Data Sheet:

(a) The efficiency of basic education in the entire country (outcome indicator 1) was improved as
the completion rates in primary education increased from 88.9 percent in 2001 to 96.8 percent in
2007 and the repetition rates in primary and secondary education decreased from 6.1 percent to
5.6 percent and from 6.3 percent to 5.1 percent respectively in the same period. However, the
ICR does not have any factual information to ascertain the degree of contribution of this project
to this national achievement in sector efficiency.

(b) The interventions in early childhood stimulation programs and Telebásica targeted to the
poorest segments of the school-age population contributed to the achievement of the
improvement in equity of access to preschool and basic education (outcome indicator 2). The
number of Telebásicas established by the project was 3.8 times larger than the target set at
appraisal (114 as compared to 30). As a consequence, the number of students finishing primary
school in rural areas with possibility to continue their lower secondary education (grades 7-9)
went from 0 at the start of the project to 17,211 in 2008. The number of new CEFACEIs
developed by the project was 1.7 times larger than the target set at appraisal (1,027 as compared
to 600). The number of new home-based initial education groups created by the project was 1.6
times larger than the target set at appraisal (664 against 400). Finally, the number of additional
preschool children who benefited as a consequence of the project was 1.61 times larger than the
target set at appraisal (38,500 as compared to 24,000).

(c) The coverage of preschool and initial education (outcome indicator 3) was increased as a
consequence of the project. The preschool coverage of the 4-5 year-old children in the entire
country increased from 31 percent in 2001 to 61 percent in 2008. The enrollment of these
children increased from 55,369 to 92,900 in the same period, 38,500 children as a consequence of
the project.

(d) It was not possible to measure whether the intervention increased education quality. The
monitoring and evaluation framework did not include relevant indicators to track quality changes.
There is evidence that between 2004 and 2007 the percentage of children failing in math went
from 16.2 percent to 15.7 percent and in language from 12.9 to 12.7 percent. These are however


                                                13
national averages and thus it is not possible to know how the project affected these trends. There
is however some evidence showing that student learning in CEFACEI and Telebásica programs,
financed by the project, were at least as good as learning in traditional pre-school and middle
school.

(e) It is also difficult to evaluate whether the project contributed to MEDUCA's institutional
strengthening. The monitoring and evaluation framework did not include any indicator to
measure this. However, the project made significant contributions to the institutional
strengthening of MEDUCA by: (i) establishing CEFACEIs, home-based programs and
Telebásica in rural and indigenous areas thus fostering school continuation; (ii) building capacity
within MEDUCA for the development and distribution of bilingual learning materials and teacher
training modules for at least three major indigenous groups, multi-grade schools and Telebásica;
and (iii) establishing of SIAREH as the first module of an integrated and comprehensive
Management Information System of MEDUCA

Accordingly, weighing improvements in efficiency and equity of access and in institutional
strengthening with lack of appropriate information to measure changes in quality, the ICR rates
the overall achievement of the PDOs as moderately satisfactory. Although the infrastructure
component execution had shortcomings related to achievement of its goals and quality issues,
these shortcomings did not have a major impact on the achievement of the PDOs.

Intermediate outcome indicators. As per the ICR's Data Sheet:

(a) The number of Telebásicas established by the project (indicator 1) was surpassed by almost 4
times (114 against 30).

(b) The educational materials provided to schools (indicator 2) were exceeded by 9 percent in
the case of multi-grade learning materials (260,827 against 240,000 set as a target at appraisal)
and 7.3 times in library packages (30,609 against 4,200). The number of lower secondary
students and teachers who received textbooks and teaching guides was exceeded by 1.3 times
(51,947 as compared to 40,000). The number of bilingual students who gained access to
appropriate learning materials fell short by 7 percent (34,250 as compared to the target of 37,000
set at appraisal).

(c) The number of scholarships provided by the project (indicator 3) was surpassed by 2.45
times (58,870 provided as compared to 24,000). In addition, the ICR attests that these
scholarships were assigned with the poverty reduction criteria and 80 percent of these (47,081)
went to rural (28,961) and indigenous communities (18,120).

(d) The achievement of the improvement of school infrastructure in disadvantaged areas,
representing 45% of the loan documented expenditures, (indicator 4) fell short by 24 percent
(1,151 classrooms constructed or rehabilitated as compared to a target of 1,515) and some of the
construction delivered is of bad quality as an evaluation of this sub-component financed by the
Additional Financing showed.

(e) The strengthening of MEDUCA's regional offices (indicator 5) was partially achieved
through SIAREH while the rest of the envisaged management information systems were not
completed. In addition, there is no evidence of SIAREH's contribution to the modernization and
strengthening of the decentralization process.




                                                14
Weighing the significant accomplishments of the first three indicators with the partial
accomplishment of the last two, the ICR rates the overall achievement towards the targets set for
at appraisal for the intermediate (output) indicators as moderately satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

The benefits from the project include: (i) improvements in repetition and dropout rates; (ii)
increased coverage of primary and lower secondary education; (iii) gains from maintaining and
expanding the school infrastructure. By measuring these positive effects of the operation using
gains in expected wages of better-educated individuals, the ICR finds that the benefits brought by
this operation are higher than its costs. The estimates of the benefits were based on limited
information and on the following assumptions: (i) 9 percent of economic returns to primary
education (based on World Bank Poverty Assessment 2006); (ii) 0.68 average years of additional
years of education per capita a result of the operation; (ii) 15 percent discount rate (World Bank.
2008. Report No. 43757-PA); (iii) 45 year working lifespan per student and an average salary of
US$ 12,000 per year; and (iv) about 1.7 million beneficiaries during the lifespan of the project.
The ICR estimates the private benefits to this operation to be US$ 82 million, while its cost
US$ 67 million. These estimates only include private returns to education. There are positive
externalities to this operation that are difficult to estimate in monetary terms as this operation
potentially helps reduce poverty by increasing productivity of the poor; it might also help reduce
fertility rates and improve health status. There are also other potential spillovers in terms of
better income distribution and a boost to economic growth thanks to a more educated labor force.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

The ICR rates the overall outcome of this project as moderately satisfactory as the project was
able to significantly improve efficiency and equity in access to school and it built institutional
capacity at the Ministry level. Indeed, some of the activities financed by the loan reached or
surpassed their targets. Despite these achievements, there is no information to be able to assess
whether it also improved education quality. Additionally, there is evidence showing poor quality
of some of the infrastructure constructed with the loan funds. Although a large share of the loan
was allocated to the infrastructure component (45 percent of loan's documented expenditures)
whose performance was not optimal, this result does not significantly affect the achievement of
the loan's objectives. In addition, MEDUCA has plans to address the quality problems found in
some of the schools built or rehabilitated by this project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts and Social Development. It is known worldwide that human capital
formation is one of the most effective strategies to reduce social and economic inequities. The
project benefited children living in poor rural and indigenous areas generating new schooling
opportunities for these children. The project provided 38,500 additional 4-5 year-old poor
children with the opportunity of early childhood stimulation and another 17,211 primary school
graduates from rural and indigenous communities were given the opportunity to continue their
lower secondary education. Students in multi-grade and bilingual schools benefited from
appropriate learning materials and many of them are now studying in new or rehabilitated
classrooms. All these achievements are an integral part of human capital formation. Accordingly,
the ICR is of the view that this project had a positive contribution to the poverty reduction
mentioned above, although no information is available to assess the degree of this likely
contribution.



                                                15
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening. This project made the following institutional
contributions: (i) establishment of CEFACEIs, home-based programs and Telebásica in rural and
indigenous areas thus fostering school continuation; (ii) capacity building within MEDUCA for
the development and distribution of bilingual learning materials and teacher training modules for
at least three major indigenous groups, multi-grade schools and Telebásica; and (iii)
establishment of SIAREH as the first module of an integrated and comprehensive Management
Information System of MEDUCA

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative). None.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Based on the weighted risks to outcomes by components described below, we consider the risk to
the overall outcomes of the project to be moderate.

The ICR rates as low to negligible the risk that the GOP will not sustain CEFACEIs and
Telebásicas as well as the provision of scholarships to poor students after the closing of the loan.
This assessment is based on GOP's efforts since 1998 to reduce poverty and income inequality
through the development of human capital, especially in underserved areas of the country. The
GOP's development policy agenda was articulated in its "Strategic Vision of Economic and
Employment Development Toward 2009", along with MEDUCA's 2005-2009 Strategic Plan.
This policy agenda is seen by the ICR as a continuation of the GOP's Estrategia Decenal de
Modernización de la Educación Panameña 1997-2006 that anchored the design of the Second
Basic Education Project 12 years ago.

The ICR rates also as low the risk that the GOP will not sustain the infrastructure financed by the
loan. With the exception of one school, all other schools built or rehabilitated with the loan are
currently in use.

The ICR is of the view that there is a significant risk that the home-based initial modality will not
be sustained after the closing of the project. This assessment derives from two sources. First, this
modality is anchored in the training of a mother leading a home-based group, which in turn trains
other mothers in early childhood stimulation activities and strategies. The "leading mother" does
not have any work-related contractual relationship with MEDUCA and receives from the program
a small financial incentive of about US$50 equivalent. As this modality was being scaled up,
there was an in-built pressure from the set of "leading mothers" to regularize their situation into a
normal job within MEDUCA, a politically and financially unsustainable situation. Second, as the
new operation was canceled this program will not have any additional resources.

The ICR is of the view that there is a significant risk that MEDUCA will not continue the
provision of multi-grade and bilingual learning materials after the closing of the loan. This
assessment derives from the cancellation of the loan approved in August 2008 which would have
financed these activities and from the limited financing these activities currently have.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

This operation was seen as a "repeater project" of the First Basic Education Project. The Bank
provided effective project preparation support to the GOP through a highly qualified and
experienced core Bank team (as listed in Annex 4 of the ICR), which was also familiar with the
preparation and implementation of the then ongoing First Basic Education Project. When specific
technical issues required attention, the Bank team drew on senior expertise from across the Bank
and from outside the Bank. In particular, the Telebásica was based on the Mexican
Telesecundaria two-decade experience, while the corresponding TV distance education materials
were inspired by the ones the UNESCO-based Latin American Institute of Educational
Communication (Instituto Latinoamericano de Comunicación Educativa ­ ILCE), headquartered
in Mexico City, prepared for the Mexican Telesecundaria program.

Only one task team leader (TTL) was responsible for the entire project preparation. This TTL
was also responsible for the supervision of the then ongoing First Basic Education Project, and
thus it provided a welcomed continuity during the preparation phase.

As already mentioned in Section 2.1, the ICR rated the quality at entry of this project as
moderately unsatisfactory. What follows is a more detailed explanation on the reasons of this
rating, highlighting the strengths as well as the shortfalls emerging from the assessment carried
out on the project's preparation file along the dimensions appearing in bold.

Strategic relevance and approach. As explained before, the ICR considers the strategic
relevance and approach of this operation as appropriate. The team was justified in selecting a
Specific Investment Loan as the lending instrument for the project, and the choice of the four and
half year implementation period also seemed appropriate at that time, given that this operation
was intended to be an expansion of an earlier project to other geographical areas of the country.
As mentioned before, this project financed activities that aimed at decreasing inequalities in the
country. The poor in Panama live primarily in rural and indigenous areas; the educational
attainment of people living in these areas is much lower than that of their urban counterparts. The
project financed cost-effective programs, such as Telebásica and CEFACEI, that extended
coverage of initial and lower secondary education in these areas; it also financed activities aimed
at improving quality of education in these areas. Thus, these activities were correctly chosen to
decrease these inequalities. Even though the follow up project was cancelled, these programs will
remain although might not expand.

Client orientation. The Bank team demonstrated a rich understanding of the Panamanian pre-
primary and basic education context in the rural, indigenous and poor urban areas of the country,
and appropriately reflected this knowledge in project design.

Results framework and M&E scheme. As explained in sections 2.3 and 3.2 of the ICR there are
some flaws in the results framework and M&E arrangements including a: (a) disconnect between
some of the outcome indicators and the PDOs, in particular with respect to the goals of improving




                                                17
quality and equity; (b) problem of attribution between the PDOs and the scope of the project; and
(c) lack of an indicator to measure the achievement of institutional strengthening.

Technical, financial and economic aspects. The Bank team was aware of the operational
challenges associated with the implementation of project activities, given their resemblance to the
previous Bank-financed operation. In the particular case of the Telebásica for example, the
required technical knowledge was provided by other similar programs in operation since the late
seventies, like the Mexican Telesecundaria experience.

The Bank team carried out economic and financial analysis of the proposed project and found it
to be economically viable.

Implementation arrangements and readiness conditions. The proposed implementation
arrangements for this operation were similar to the ones already utilized for the First Basic
Education Project. Although at that time these arrangements seemed to be appropriate, it did not
significantly improve capacity at the Ministry level and thus the practice of a parallel PCU should
be discouraged. A review of the project files concerning the preparation and the first two years of
project implementation leads the ICR to conclude that the implementation readiness conditions
were not fully present at the time of Board approval for the following two reasons.

No institutional capacity assessment was carried out during project preparation. The Bank
preparation team, thinking that this operation was a simple extrapolation of the First Basic
Education Project, did not assess institutional capacity constraints that could limit the new
operation. Three examples illustrate this lack of institutional capacity: (i) PCU did not have the
right skill mix at the start of project implementation; (ii) MEDUCA's unit that was supposed to
carry out the infrastructure sub-component did not have the capacity to perform this function, so
that it had to be reassigned to the FIS in 2002; and (iii) the likely implementation effects derived
from the presence of the National Comptroller's Office as a key player in the approval of
procurement and financial related processes.

Compliance with the Bank's fiduciary and safeguards policies. As explained in section 2.4,
the project complied with fiduciary policies and social safeguard policies but not with the
environmental safeguard.

Risk assessments. The Bank team highlighted potential critical risks and proposed mitigating
measures. In particular, the PAD correctly identified the risk that adequate and timely budget
resources may not be available to finance counterpart contribution and incremental recurrent costs
of the project. Proposed mitigating measures (a financial fiscal assessment made during appraisal
and the loan agreement provision of a revolving fund of US$ 250,000) proved effective in
addressing this risk. Similarly, the PAD indicated that the lack of qualified staff to execute
project sub-components may jeopardize implementation, which happened in reality, the
mitigating measure of providing on the job training and hiring consultants to support MEDUCA
were not enough to avoid implementation delays. In the view of the ICR, the Bank team
underestimated at the preparation stage the key risk associated with possible political interference
in the staffing of the PCU and deficiencies in the distribution of learning goods acquired under
the project and thus the distribution plans were inadequate to avoid this type of risks.

Rating criteria. Weighing the above-mentioned relevant achievements and shortfalls of the
Bank team at the preparation stage, in accordance with today's good standard practices in the
Bank, and taking into account the lack of an appropriate and thorough institutional capacity
assessment, a weak results and M&E framework, implementation readiness issues, and the lack of


                                                18
compliance with environmental safeguards, the ICR rates Bank performance at the preparation
stage as moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Project supervision was carried out by three TTLs. The transitions in supervision leadership were
well planned with each incoming and outgoing TTL being part of the same team for several
missions before the change was made official. This leadership continuity ensured a smooth and
effective change of command from the Bank's side.

The Bank team supervised this project very closely through several supervision missions a year,
an average of one technical supervision mission every four months, not including the fiduciary
missions. These missions had the right skill mixed, with only one exception discussed below.
This close supervision was instrumental, among other things, in improving project execution. For
instance, as the Additional Financing Loan had a very low start, the frequency of supervision
missions increased and this allowed a fast increase in execution before the closing date.

The team was proactive in supporting the Government to address project implementation
challenges, offering technical assistance to overcome initial preparation gaps and other challenges.
The Bank was also instrumental in ensuring the evaluation of some of the activities financed by
the loan, including Telebásica and CEFACEI. In addition, to these initial evaluations, the Bank
supervision missions assisted in the appropriate design of the envisaged impact evaluation studies
of the CEFACEI and home-based initial education and Telebásica to be financed under the new
operation.

The Bank team also provided a series of appropriate financial management and procurement
training to MEDUCA on goods and service financed by Bank Loans and on the use of the Bank-
operated annual acquisition and monitoring system (Sistema de Ejecución de Planes de
Adquisiciones ­ SEPA). The Bank team was also instrumental in shifting the procurement
responsibilities from the PCU to the Purchasing Department within MEDUCA. This shift obeyed:
(i) the addressing of likely procurement irregularities; and (ii) the institutionalization of this
fiduciary activity within MEDUCA during the implementation of the new project. Before this
shift, the Bank was also instrumental in ensuring that the technical units of MEDUCA were in
charge of the technical decisions related to the project and not the PCU alone.

The Bank supervision teams were attentive to GOP requests for extending the closing dates.
Once assessed the justification of the request against the status of outcome and intermediate
indicators, the Bank team supported the GOP wishes and timely processed with Bank
management the clearance and approval of such requests. It was also attentive to the GOP request
for Additional Financing to support the expansion of some of the activities financed by this loan.

By and large, supervision missions included the appropriate skill mix to carry out their envisaged
terms of reference as described in Annex 4 of the ICR, except in one key area­ infrastructure.
While all the supervision missions in 2001-2002 included a school construction specialist that
was also part of the Banks preparation team, starting from October 2002 until the closing of the
loan, Bank supervision teams lacked a school architect to assess the quality of the works being
delivered by the FIS. The lack of infrastructure supervision on the Bank's part resulted in finding
out at the very end of project implementation that the quality of the works delivered by the FIS



                                                19
was worrisome: some schools constructed or rehabilitated under the project had to be abandoned
because of safety reasons, others had cracked floors and/or walls, leakages and broken pipes.
These findings are part of an assessment study contracted by MEDUCA in early 2009 whose
preliminary findings were submitted to the Borrower and the Bank in the first quarter of 2009, 3
months before the closing of the loan.

Weighing the supervision's many strengths listed above with the weaknesses, in particular the
lack of oversight of the infrastructure sub-component, weaknesses in the monitoring and
evaluation framework that were not fixed, the environmental category that was not changed and
the corresponding assessments not implemented as explained in section 2.4, the ICR rates the
Bank performance during the supervision as moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The overall Bank performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory because despite several
positive factors (relevant objective, technically competent project design, successful
implementation support of some project components) several key weaknesses of project design
(M&E framework and inadequate institutional and safeguards treatment of the infrastructure
component) were not adequately addressed during supervision.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating at the preparation stage: Satisfactory.

For the purpose of this section, "Government" includes MEDUCA's management team and by
the Central Government represented by the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

The Government team, in this case represented by MEDUCA's management team, had clarity on
the sector issues and wanted their program to be based on international experience. The
Bank team then interacted with a highly qualified and seasoned technical counterpart team of
professionals in MEDUCA. As this operation was a follow up of the First Basic Education
Project, the technical counterpart staff was also familiar with Bank-related operations. This team
had clarity about the key issues affecting early childhood education, bilingual education, multi-
grade teaching and the lack of opportunities for graduates of rural primary schools to continue
their lower secondary education. The technical counterpart team was receptive to the
recommendations provided by the international experts that were included as part of the Bank
preparation missions and to related experiences that were observed in other countries, in
particular the Mexican Telesecundaria program (which underpinned the design of the Telebásica)
and of the initial education which further contextualized the design of the home-based modality.

GOP conducted and completed the project's design and, in due time, when the fiscal conditions in
Panama were more favorable, conducted and completed the corresponding negotiations. Even
though project preparation involved two elected administrations, there was continuity with
respect to the education sector policies (except for bilingual education which was not a priority in
the first administration. The GOP's ten-year education strategy - Estrategia Decenal de
Modernización de la Educación Panameña 1997-2006 - adopted during the administration of



                                                20
President Balladares framing the project concept and technical design, was continued during the
administration of President Moscoso. This continuity was also reflected at the level of the
Minister of Education and the PCU Coordinator.

The GOP strengths shown during project preparation significantly outweigh the two shortcoming
mentioned above and thus the ICR rates GOP's performance at the preparation stage as
satisfactory.

Rating at the implementation stage: Moderately unsatisfactory

The Ministry of Finance was late in allocating approved counterpart funds to the project and, at
times, the allocation was short of the required amount as determined by the LA. As a
consequence, payments to eligible providers of goods, services and works acquired under the
project were, at times, also delayed. As a result, the ICR rates the Borrower performance at
implementation as moderately satisfactory.

Weighting performance at both preparation and implementation stage, the ICR rates the
Government's performance as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

Most of project activities were implemented by MEDUCA through its line units, except the
scholarships that were implemented by IFARHU and infrastructure that was implemented by FIS.
The fiduciary and monitoring aspects of the project were vested in the PCU. Thus, this section
assesses four implementing agencies ­ MEDUCA, IFARHU, FIS and the PCU.

The project was adversely affected by the high turnover of Ministers of Education and PCU
Coordinators. For example, bilingual education had low priority with MEDUCA Ministers of the
Moscoso administration and high with the ones of the subsequent administration. The average
short tenure of PCU coordinators (under 2 years), combined with high variability in their strategic
leadership and management styles, hindered execution of project-related fiduciary responsibilities.

MEDUCA. The ICR does not have any evidence concerning the effectiveness of the Project
Management Committee comprised of the technical heads of each project implementation unit
that was established to provide the required project oversight functions. However, the chairing
Vice-Minister, outside the scope of this Committee, was influential in providing constructive
support to project implementation.

The initial delays in implementing this project during 2001-2002 were mainly caused by: (a) the
firing of the PCU's procurement officer in the second semester of 2001, on or about the time of
loan effectiveness; and (b) the cumbersome procedures established by MEDUCA and the
National Comptrollers Office to clear and approve expenditures above US$10,000, a situation
that was not detected, and therefore, not appropriately addressed during the preparation phase.

The line departments of MEDUCA in charge of Components A, B and to certain degree C,
performed effectively, surpassing in almost all cases the targets set at appraisal, like the early
childhood modalities, Telebásica and muti-grade and bilingual learning resources. In the case of
Component C, only one of the several envisaged management information systems was
developed and implemented (SIAREH). Other subsystems envisaged in the project design, like


                                               21
the linking of MEDUCA's financial management system with GOP's SIFCO as well as the
infrastructure sub-system, were not developed, and the progress on modernizing and
decentralizing the education sector was limited.

Finally, MEDUCA has taken measures to rehabilitate the infrastructure, financed by this loan and
executed by FIS, that was deemed to be of poor quality, in particular, (i) MEDUCA has
instructed its National Engineering and Architecture Directorate (DINIA) to take the needed
measures to ensure the safety of students and teachers using this infrastructure; and (ii) all
infrastructure constructed by FIS and financed by this project will be included in the inspection
plan of DINIA and the infrastructure found faulty will be rehabilitated.

Accordingly, the ICR rates MEDUCA's performance as moderately satisfactory.

IFARFHU. This entity acted very independently from MEDUCA during the entire
implementation period. The coordination between MEDUCA/PCU and IFARHU was very poor.
Bank did not receive regular information about the performance of the scholarships sub-
component. Nevertheless, during the ICR field supervision mission, IFARHU provided written
official evidence of its achievements concerning the intermediate outcome indicator 3
(scholarships). Weighing these achievements with the poor coordination displayed during project
implementation, the ICR rates the performance of IFARHU as moderately unsatisfactory.

FIS. The performance of the FIS in charge of the infrastructure sub-component representing about
32 percent of the total documented expenditures and 45 percent of the loan documented
expenditures (see tables A2.2 and A2.3) was rated unsatisfactory for the following reasons: (a)
the target set at appraisal was not reached (as detailed in the ICR Data Sheet); (b) there was
inefficiency in the utilization of approved resources resulting in resources provided to FIS to
complete the civil works program during 2008 that needed to be refunded to the Bank at the
closing of the original loan; these resources were given in advance for activities that were not
executed before the closing date of the loan; (c) there was poor quality in several of the works
completed as further detailed in Annex 2 of the ICR; and (d) the infrastructure supervisory unit of
FIS lacked appropriate training. The ICR is of the view that both the PCU and the Bank team are
partially to be blamed for this situation due to the lack of timely on-site supervision during most
of the life of the project (May 2002 onwards).

PCU. The performance of the PCU was mixed. Despite a delay in getting the M&E framework
in place (addressed by early 2005), important strengths of the PCU included: (a) the support
provided to the consulting firms that were selected to conduct the early childhood modalities and
Telebásica studies and produce their valuable findings; and (b) the tracking of the annual and
cumulative financial and physical targets resulting in timely reports being made available to the
Bank.

On the downside, the delay by the PCU coordinator to bring on board a qualified procurement
officer until March 2003 practically stalled the implementation of project activities. When the
PCU's infrastructure specialist was laid off in early 2006, the unit lost capacity to oversee the FIS
as it carried out infrastructure investments. The lack of strategic leadership of the PCU
coordinator in turn was partially responsible for causing an eight-month delay in starting
disbursements of the additional financing proceeds after loan effectiveness. As a consequence,
about 30 percent of the total additional financing (US$1.53 million) was not disbursed at the
closing of the project. Nevertheless, this share of the Additional Financing was actually savings
from increased efficiency of the procurement processes.



                                                 22
The PCU did not exercise all the required care in ensuring compliance with procurement and
financial management procedures as agreed with the Bank. Several Bank supervision missions
reported that the PCU was not appropriately following up on agreements reached during previous
supervision missions. There was a clear lack of proactivity by some of the PCU coordinators, and
the coordination between the PCU and other project-related implementing agencies, was, by and
large, reactive, sporadic and deficient. There was a lack of motivation among PCU staff once they
found out that procurement activities were to be transferred to MEDUCA under the new approved
Bank-financed operation that was not going to include a PCU. Finally, all the audit reports were
submitted to the Bank with a delay of at least 6 months, thus limiting the Bank's ability to address
the detected issues. Accordingly, the ICR rates the overall performance of the PCU as
unsatisfactory.

Weighing the strengths with the weaknesses mentioned above for MEDUCA, IFARFHU, FIS and
the PCU, the ICR rates the overall implementing agency performance as moderately
unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The overall Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Despite initial strong
ownership of project objectives and some notable achievements during its implementation, a
combination of political interference in project activities and failure to ensure competent
execution of the civil works component led to implementation delays and poor quality of
infrastructure.

6. Lessons Learned

(a)     Political interference is detrimental to the success of a project as indicated by: (i)
several implementation delays caused by inadequate staffing of higher-level management
positions at the PCU; and (ii) inadequate distribution of some learning goods.

(b)      An appropriate institutional assessment capacity during project preparation could
have prevented most of the delays experienced by this project in the first two years after
effectiveness.

(c)     Appropriate results and M&E framework is needed to inform about progress
towards achieving the expected project development objectives. The project's results and
M&E framework have issues of disconnect and lack of attribution. Bank management ought to
exercise a more thorough review of the proposed logical framework at the concept review
meetings or at a later stage through a Quality Enhancement Review meeting. This lesson has been
considered in the development of the results framework agreed of the new operation that was
recently cancelled.

(e)      Appropriate professionals, determined by the project's key sub-components, should
be included in the Bank supervision missions. Had the Bank supervision teams and/or the
PCU included a qualified professional to review periodically the infrastructure sub-component,
the outcomes of this sub-component would have likely improved due to: (i) early on-site
detection of issues and reaching agreement on appropriate recommendations; and (ii) timely
follow up on compliance with agreed recommendations.



                                                23
(f)     The choice of targeting approach is relevant for equity, transparency and
effectiveness. This project is a good example of a targeted intervention directed to the poorest
and most vulnerable segments of the Panamanian population, like the successful achievement of
equity of access to basic education through the CEFACEIs, home-based early stimulation
program and the Telebásica.

(g)      Impact evaluation included at the onset of project implementation and monitoring
and evaluation frameworks are needed as a means to justify education policies and to evaluate
whether programs or projects like this one achieve their intended objectives. This operation did
not carry out any impact evaluation and its monitoring and evaluation framework did not allowed
a full evaluation of its results. This lesson was, however incorporated in the design of the Bank-
financed operation that was recently cancelled.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

This section describes the outputs of each of the four components as well as the sources of
financing. The assessment is primarily based on Bank supervision reports, Audit Reports, FMRs
and assorted studies that were prepared during the implementation cycle encompassing 38
supervision missions including the September 14-17, 2009 field ICR mission.

Three cost tables are presented to substantiate the story provided in this Annex: (a) the
documented expenditure by component and by source of financing at appraisal (without including
the additional financing approved by the Board in October 2007) and at the time of the ICR
mission including the additional financing (table A2.1); (b) the documented expenditure by
category and by source of financing before the approval of the additional financing but including
the latest reallocation of loan proceeds against the situation at the time of the ICR (table A2.2);
and (c) the same table as A2.2 but including the additional financing in the baseline (table A2.3).

Component A ­ Improvement of Quality and Efficiency of Basic Education. According to
Table A2.1 below, this component estimated at appraisal to cost about US$44.95 million
(US$28.3 million from the loan and US$16.65 million from GOP), ended up documenting
expenditures amounting to US$47.29 million (US$28.17 million from the loan and US$19.12
million from GOP), 105.2 percent of the total estimated at appraisal. This slight change in
overspending is mainly due to the significant increase in the acquisition of learning goods for
multi-grade and bilingual schools as well as Telebásica (176.1 percent above the target set at
appraisal as shown in table A2.2), including the associated consultancies that were required. This
change also reflects the inefficiency of FIS managing the civil works sub-component as further
explained below. The overspending in counterpart funds against the appraised amount (114.83
percent as shown in table A2.1) is due to the provision of a significant larger number of
scholarships (100 percent financed by GOP) against the appraised targets. The following is the
assessment of the key activities included under this Component A, namely, educational materials
for multi-grade and bilingual schools, scholarships, Telebásica and infrastructure.

Educational materials. The project finance the provision of: (i) 260,827 tailor-made printed
materials for multi-grade primary schools including guides in mathematics, science, Spanish and
social sciences for students and teachers; (ii) 15,780 bilingual books for first grade and 65,000 for
second grade as well as 1,080 bilingual teaching guides; (iii) 30,609 library packages for multi-
grade schools; and (iv) 110,197 texts, 55,641 teaching guides and 10,000 maps to lower
secondary education students attending grades 7 to 9. This provision of learning materials
demanded the annual training of about 4,075 teachers and facilitators amounting to an
accumulated total of 32,600 throughout the entire project cycle. As detailed in the ICR Data
Sheet, the targets set at appraisal were significantly surpassed, and thus the ICR rates this sub-
component as satisfactory.

Scholarship program. The project provided a total of 58,870 scholarships in the period 2002-
2008 according to the following yearly distribution: (a) 4,920 in 2002; (b) 7,284 in 2003; (c)
8,893 in 2004; (d) 6,133 in 2005; (e) 11,139 in 2006; (f) 8,763 in 2007; and (g) 11,738 in 2008.
As detailed in the ICR Data Sheet, the targets set at appraisal were significantly surpassed. The
scholarships were allocated to the poorest 297 corregimientos (out of 621 existing in the country)
following poverty reduction criteria provided by the Poverty Map and in a context of social
control offered by the School Parents Committees. These Committees identified the beneficiaries
(3 students per rural community and 5 per indigenous community). About 80 percent of the



                                                 27
above-mentioned scholarships were allocated in rural (28,961) and indigenous (18,120) areas.
Accordingly, the ICR rates the achievement of this sub-component as highly satisfactory (which
differs from the satisfactory rating assigned to the entity responsible for implementing this sub-
component ­ IFARHU ­ in section 5.2(b) of the ICR).

Telebásica. The project established 114 fully operational Telebásica centers for graduates of
primary schools located in rural areas benefiting in the process 17,211 students in grades 7-9
during the entire project cycle (8,461 in grade 7, 5,400 in grade 8 and 3,350 in grade 9). A total of
853 teachers were trained for this modality. As mentioned in the ICR Data Sheet, the targets set
at appraisal were significantly surpassed by almost 4 times. It took MEDUCA about 6 years to
adapt the Telebásica history and geography textbooks to the Panamanian context. These new
textbooks have been in use since the 2007 school year. Furthermore, the preliminary findings of
the studies that were carried out for this sub-component show that students in this modality have
equivalent learning outcomes as those from the traditional lower secondary modality.
Accordingly, the ICR rates this sub-component as highly satisfactory.

Infrastructure. Prior to the signing of a subsidiary agreement in January 2002 between MEDUCA
and FIS for the carrying out of the infrastructure sub-component, MEDUCA completed the
construction of 4 schools under the original implementation arrangements including in the project
design. At the time of the signing, for reasons not clear in the project files, the appraised target of
rehabilitating 1,515 classrooms was transformed in the construction of 313 new schools. With
the participation of FIS from early 2002 onwards, the project completed the construction of 299
schools (averaging about 2 classrooms per school) and 259 new classrooms and rehabilitated 294
classrooms. If the metric to rate performance is classrooms rehabilitated as specified in the LA,
this achievement amounting to about 1,151 classrooms represents 76 percent of the agreed target
set at appraisal of rehabilitating 1,515 classrooms by the end of the project. However, factoring
the rehabilitation of 416 bathrooms and the equipping of schools with 29,832 sets of school
furniture, the above-mentioned shortfall is further mitigated. On the other hand, if the metric is
new schools, then the achievement was 96 percent.

The underperformance of this sub-component is mainly due to poor quality of some of the works
completed and inefficiency in the use of loan proceeds. The infrastructure assessment study
carried out in early 2009 included the on-site visit of 33 randomly selected construction sites in 9
provinces of the country. The preliminary findings of this study show that in 15 sites (45 percent
of the sample) the construction was of poor quality including newly constructed or rehabilitated
classrooms under the project that had to be abandoned because safety reasons, others had cracked
floors and/or walls, leaking problems and broken pipes. MEDUCA has already taken measures to
rehabilitate this infrastructure that were deemed to be of poor quality. In a letter from the
Minister of Finance to the World Bank, dated March 2, 2010, the following measures were listed:
(i) MEDUCA has instructed its National Engineering and Architecture Directorate (DINIA) to
take the needed measures to ensure the safety of students and teachers attending this
infrastructure; and (ii) all infrastructure constructed by FIS and financed by this project will be
included in the inspection plan of DINIA and the infrastructure found faulty will be rehabilitated.

The inefficiency in the utilization of financial resources stems from the simple analysis of more
spending as compared to the appraised amount allocated in the civil works category of
expenditure and not reaching the physical target. As per table A2.2, the works category of
expenditure ended spending US$21.69 million (US$17.45 million from the loan and US$4.24
million from GOP), 173.5 percent above the appraised amount of US$12.5 million (US$10
million from the loan and US$2.5 million from GOP) included in the LA. Despite having more
resources to spend, FIS was not only able to complete the work program authorized for 2008


                                                  28
(which already accounted for the accumulated construction lag of previous years) but was also
requested to reimburse the Bank for US$1.355 million of unused financial resources from the
loan that had been deposited in their sub-account at the time of the closing of the original loan in
December 30, 2008.

In addition, the ICR could not find any evidence in the project files that the envisaged school
maintenance agreed at appraisal was ever carried out.

For the above reasons, and attuned to the ratings of the last ISR #21, the ICR rates the
performance of this sub-component as moderately unsatisfactory.

Rating component A. Weighing the achievements as well as the shortfalls fully described above,
in particular the moderately unsatisfactory rating of the infrastructure sub-component, the ICR
rates the overall implementation of this Component A as moderately satisfactory.

Component B - Expansion of Non Formal Preschool Education Program. According to Table
A2.1, this component estimated at appraisal to cost about US$6.2 million (US$3.1 million from
the loan and another US$3.1 million from counterpart funds), ended up documenting
expenditures amounting to US$14.11 million (US$6.4 million from the loan and another US$7.71
million from counterpart funds), 227.58 percent above the total estimated at appraisal. This
significant increase in spending is mainly due to the notably expansion of the two early childhood
modalities financed by the project, largely surpassing their targets set at appraisal. The following
is the assessment of the key activities included under this Component B, namely the CEFACEI
and the home-based initial education modalities.

The project established 1,027 new CEFACEIs serving almost 22,000 children of rural and poor
urban areas per year, about 1.7 times more than the target set at appraisal for new centers and
almost doubling the amount of beneficiaries envisaged at the completion of the project.

The home-based modality was being adopted by this project in small rural and indigenous
communities where the establishment of CEFACEI was not economically feasible due to low
demand of children to be served (generally in places that could not ensure at least 15 to 20
children). This home-based modality worked through previously trained mothers, selected by the
community, and trained by the project in topics such as early childhood stimulation for children
less the 6 years-old, growth and social, cognitive and physical development. The selected and
trained mother were in turn charged to facilitate the same topics (organized in six training units or
workshops) with at least ten other mothers of children under 6 years old at least for two hours
once a week. The selected mother (group facilitator) received US$50 per month as compensation.
The project provided the training and the required learning materials for parents and children.

A total of 644 new home-based initial education groups were established serving annually almost
16,500 children in isolated rural and indigenous communities, 1.46 times more than the target set
at appraisal for new groups and about 8.3 percent more beneficiaries as the ones estimated at
appraisal to be served through this modality.

These massive achievements demanded the training of more than 5,200 CEFACEI's and 1,027
home-based initial education promoters, 937 COPAMACE members and about 8,250
participating mothers in the home-based modality during the entire life of the project. Training to
the above people was provided twice a year. Likewise, about 79,702 packages of tailor-made
CEFACEI learning materials and another 49,436 packages of tailor-made learning materials for



                                                 29
the home-base modality were distributed and 4,600 tables and 23,00 chairs, specially designed for
CEFACEIs, were acquired by the project..

This scaling up effort undoubtedly contributed to increase the preschool coverage from 31
percent of all 4-5 year olds in 2001 to 61 in 2008, implying that the total number of children
benefiting from all preschool programs in the country increased by 37,531 from 55,369 to 92,900
in the above-mentioned period.

The preliminary findings of the studies conducted for these two early childhood stimulation
modalities confirmed the well-known positive externalities reported in the literature with respect
to preschool education.

Rating component B. For all of the above reasons, the ICR rates the overall implementation of
this Component B as highly satisfactory.

Component C ­ Institutional strengthening. According to Table A2.1 below, this component
estimated at appraisal to cost about US$5.2 million (US$1.8 million from the loan and US$3.4
million from GOP), ended up documenting expenditures amounting to US$1.89 million (US$1.62
million from the loan and US$0.27 million from GOP) including the additional financing, 36.34
percent of the total estimated at appraisal. The significant shortfall is due to a partial
accomplishment of all the envisaged targets set at the appraisals of the original loan and the
additional financing, as explained below.

The project was only able to developed and implement the SIAREH human resource management
information sub-systems. At the writing of the ICR, the efforts financed by the project to link
MEDUCA's financial management systems with the GOP's SIFCO were not completed.

SINECA was not part of this project and therefore never benefited from the project's financing.
However, the preliminary findings of the 2005 learning assessment measurement were utilized to
place additional emphasis in those schools scoring low by revising and upgrading learning
materials and training programs financed by the project, like in the case of 1st and 2nd graders in
bilingual schools in indigenous communities were Ngäbe, Embera and Kuna Yala is the mother
tongue.

However, this Component felt short in achieving the modernization and decentralization
envisaged in the original design establishing more effective linkages between the various levels
of administration of the public education sector. The ICR found no evidence that the central,
regional and provincial levels are today more effective participants in the supervision and policy-
making and have improved their institutional capacity as compared to their situation at the time of
appraisal.

This Component also failed to improve the collection and use of official statistics as well as the
development of a school infrastructure management information sub-system.

Rating component C. Weighing the partial achievements of this Component, the ICR rates its
performance as moderately satisfactory.

Component D ­ Project Coordination. According to Table A2.1, this component estimated at
appraisal to cost about US$2.3 million (US$1.8 million from the loan and US$0.5 million from
GOP), ended up documenting expenditures amounting to US$2.97 million (US$2.27 million from
the loan and US$0.7 million from GOP) including the additional financing, 129.56 percent of the


                                                30
  total estimated at appraisal. The overspending is mainly associated with the financial resources
  required to manage this operation during the 48 additional months of the implementation cycle
  against the original closing date of June 30, 2005.

  Rating component D. Piecing together all the information displayed elsewhere in the ICR, in
  particular the procurement irregularities, the qualified audit and financial management reports,
  the lack of effective on-site oversight of the civil works activities carried out by FIS, the lack of
  proactivity and effective project management reported by several Bank supervision missions in
  the ISRs , the ICR rates the performance of this Component as unsatisfactory.

  According to table A2.1, the total project cost estimated at appraisal was US$59 million
  equivalent (including the front-end-fee), corresponding US$35 million equivalent from the Bank
  (59 percent of the total) and US$24 million equivalent from the GOP (41 percent of the total).
  On October 2007, and additional financing was approved by the Board amounting to US$5
  million, with GOP allocating an additional US$2 million. Adding the two loans and the
  counterpart funding, the total estimated cost rose to US$66 million (US$40 million and US$26
  million from GOP). At the time of the closing of the loan, the total documented expenditure
  amounted to US$66.62 million equivalent (129.15 percent above of the appraised total),
  corresponding US$38.47 million equivalent from the Bank (96 percent of the contracted amount
  at appraisal and additional financing) and US$28.15 million equivalent from the GOP (108.27
  percent of the appraised total at the time of the original loan and the additional financing).

  The three main reasons associated with the shortfall in disbursing the totality of the Bank's two
  loan proceeds stems from: (i) the accumulated delays in executing the project, both during 2001-
  2002 and then the eight-month period after the approval of the additional financing; (ii) the
  inefficiency displayed by the FIS in executing the civil works sub-components; and (iii) the
  partial accomplishments of Component C with respect to the envisaged targets set at the
  appraisals of the original loan and the additional financing.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Macroeconomic context

Panama has experienced a period of fast-pace growth during the period 2003-2007 (annual
average GDP growth above 7%), led by strong expansion of the services sector related to trade
and finance. The Panama Canal, the Colon Free Zone and the International Banking Centre
represent around 80% of total GDP and global trade has boosted these sub-sectors. However, a
skewed economic structure explains the situation of inequality and income distribution, since
these sectors are not labor-intensive.

Overall poverty has been reduced but several differences remain across social groups and regions.
The most recent Living Standard Measurement Study (LSMS) suggests that overall poverty in
Panama has fallen by about 4.1% to 32.7% in 2008.1 Nevertheless, poverty in rural areas is 50.7%
and 96.3% in indigenous areas, of which extreme poverty is about 22.2% and 84.8% respectively.
Indigenous areas concentrate the number of people in extreme poverty (42% of the total). These
inequalities are mirrored in the education sector. While the percentage of illiteracy was 6.4% in
2008, in urban areas this indicator was 2.0% compared to 9.1% in rural areas. Moreover, illiteracy
represents more than 38% in indigenous areas.

The impact of the financial crisis will be significant on public finances and will cause an
increment of public deficit (2.5% in 2009 and 2% in 2010), well above of the 1% mandated by
the 2008 Fiscal Responsibility Law.


2. Methodology and considerations

The project appraisal document (PAD) of the project indicated that three higher-order, sector-
related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) key performance indicators (outside the scope of the
current project) were to be achieved: (i) lower levels of extreme poverty; (ii) greater efficiency;
and (iii) higher completion rates in primary and lower secondary schools. Regarding
outcome/impact indicators, it was agreed that: (a) all shanty schools (rancho schools) were to be
replaced; (b) 1,515 classrooms were to be rehabilitated; (c) 30 Telebásica pilot schools were to
open; (d) 240,000 multi-grade students, 37,000 students in indigenous communities and 40,000
lower secondary education students were to receive appropriate textbooks and other educational
materials; (e) CEFACEIs were to enroll 12,000 new children while the home-based initial
education were to train 6,000 rural parents by 400 new mother leaders; (f) 54 percent of children
in the 4-5 age-cohort were to be enrolled in preschool; and (g) regional offices operating and
trained in all regions.

Although the intervention was targeted to the poorest regions and segments of population, the
above indicators do not provide adequate information to assess if the intended target was reached,
let alone the overall impact in terms of reducing the gaps and inequality in the education sector in
Panama. Therefore, an alternative approach should be taken in order to carry out the economic
analysis. In accordance with the present ICR, the economic analysis will include evidence of: (i)


1
  The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) has estimated that people
living in poverty --that is, living with less than US$2 per day-- fell from 37% to 29% from 2001 to 2007;
and extreme poverty --the population not able to cover their basic food needs-- also fell from 19% to 12%.



                                                   33
increased coverage of primary and lower secondary education; (ii) better repetition and dropout
rates; (iii) gains from maintaining and expanding the school infrastructure; and (iv) gains in
expected wages of better-educated individuals.

There are three reasons limiting the findings in this section. First, there is no statistical
information to assess the impact of project activities over targeted population compared to non-
targeted, thus increasing the problem of attribution. Using information available only at the
country and regional level, it is only possible to show overall trends. Second, even if the project
has targeted a significant portion of student population, assuming that benefits are distributed
equally among beneficiaries may be difficult due to the way the project has linked instruments
with targeted population. For example, the original PAD indicates that "the project will benefit
approximately 280,000 children enrolled in primary and lower secondary schools (...) this
represents about 60 percent of total enrollment in basic education¨ with a combination of
education materials, scholarships, pilot of distance education, infrastructure improvements and
institutional strengthening. Although some of these instruments may contribute to increase
coverage in selected areas and education quality in other cases, these improvements do not
directly lead to the appropriation of microeconomic benefits such as increased productivity or
better insertion to the labor market. Third, the present ICR indicates that most of the
outcome/impact goals were surpassed,2 but assessing additional benefits from these achievements
is not possible with available data.

Nevertheless, the academic literature provides conceptual and empirical evidence that
incrementing years of education by providing more access to education and improving internal
efficiency of education lead to important gains that can be measured in monetary terms.
Therefore, the current section will provide evidence of benefits of additional years of education
and gains of internal efficiency at the national level in order to give an estimate of potential gains
that the project may have achieved. It is worth noting that there exists positive externalities that
are difficult to estimate in monetary terms, such as the extent of which basic education helps to
reduce poverty by increasing the productivity of the poor, by reducing fertility rates and by
improving health. Moreover, there are potential spillovers of reaching higher degrees of education,
in terms of better income distribution, or a more educated labor force that may boost economic
growth and reduce poverty.


3. Assessment of different types of economic benefits

    a. Economic rates of return and salaries




2
 These are the indicators: (a) the scholarship sub-component had awarded a total of 58,870 scholarships (as
compared to a target of 24,000); (b) a total of new 868 CEFACEIs were fully equipped and operating (as
compared to a target of 600) and 554 new home-based early stimulation groups (as compared to a target of
400) were functioning in rural and indigenous communities benefiting both modalities about 112,018 poor
children under six years old (140 percent more than the target set at appraisal); (c) Telebásica, was being
provided in 80 rural centers (as compared to the target of 30 set at appraisal); (d) about 260,000 sets of
multi-grade learning material and 25,000 sets of bilingual material had been distributed; and (e) the
SIAREH had been recently designed and installed and was being utilized by MEDUCA for the
management of teachers at the national level, including teacher hiring, transfers and payments.



                                                    34
In terms of overall impact, there are two pieces of evidence that suggest there were incremental
benefits from these education project, although it is clear that the progress is difficult to
appreciate due to the short period of analysis. First, significant increment of economic rates of
return (ERR) of education materializes in the time span of generations. Evidence from the 2006
Panama Poverty Assessment suggests that ERR have increased from 1991 to 2003 and that the
gap between primary and secondary education economic return has slightly reduced (Table 1). As
coverage increases, specially regarding secondary education, the returns will tend to stabilize.
Again, the gap between these rates of return reflects inequities in access and quality in the
Panama education system.

    b. Internal efficiency savings or internal rates of return (IRR)

Panama has achieved important steps towards increasing enrolment. From 2000-2007, net
enrolment increased from 36.3% to 61.5% in preschool (4-5 years),3 from 95% to full coverage in
primary school (6-11 years), and from 58.5% to 64.6% in secondary school (12-17 years).
Regarding the latter, it implies that more than 130,000 children are not attending secondary
school in 2007, of which 55% are male potential students. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the
enrollment rate in secondary school from 2004 to 2007, showing disparities between regions and
their different progress over the period.

Increased coverage does not guarantee better education or internal efficiency of the education
system. The system should be able to retain students and increase the average years of education,
as well as increase student achievements over time. This sub-section presents two pieces of
evidence. First, it shows that there exist benefits of reduced repetition, dropout rates and
additional years of study. Second, there is evidence that quality of education has improved, in
terms of student's achievements and more qualified teachers. Again, these are overall effects that
suggest that the project may have contributed to some of these achievements and it is pointing to
the right direction, although it is not possible to assess direct effects.

 It is worth noting that increasing coverage in preschool to 54% was one of the aims of the present project,
and one of the impact/outcome indicators established in the PAD.

Promotion rate --the percentage of students promoted to the next grade-- increased from 91.7%
to 92.3% in primary school from 2004 to 2007; but reduced from 83.4% to 82.8% in secondary
school. Since primary schools has 100% enrollment, even modest increments on promotion rates
suggest important achievements: Dropout rates decreased from 2.7% to 2.1% even though
repetition rates have not changed (5.6%). Table 2 shows that these improvements have been
balanced across grades. Moreover, there is evidence that these improvements are balanced
between regions, given the initial conditions: While in Panama dropout rates decreased from
1.4% to 0.2%, in Kuna Yala went from 7.1% to 5.9% and Darién from 6.4% to 3.2%.

Therefore, the main challenges are in secondary education, where promotion, repetition and
dropout rates have worsened over the 2004-2007 as coverage has increased. Table 3 shows that
the first year in secondary school (7th grade) has been critical: repetition rates increased from
6.2% in 2004 to 8.6% in 2007, probably signaling deficiencies of primary school. On the other
hand, dropout rates widely increased in the last year of secondary school, suggesting that the

system is failing to graduate students, even though this rate is stable in previous years. Therefore,
promotion rates are falling for secondary education between 2004 and 2007. Moreover, in
secondary education, regional gaps are wider: in Panama, repetition rates increased from 4.9% to
5.2%, in Colon went from 4.6% to 6.2%. Regarding dropout rates, Darién went from 19.5% to
24.5%, while other regions such as Panama slightly increased from 11.1% to 12.8%.

What are the implications of this situation over overall costs of education? Contraloría General
has estimated the costs to the public sector of repetition at 0.83% of the GDP in 2007. This has
several implications for calculating the effectiveness of the improvements in primary school and
the situation in secondary school. Although repetition rates have improved in the former, these
have not been enough to offset the increment of students repeating grades in absolute terms. From
2004 to 2007 the number of these students increased from 23,477 to 24,409 in primary school.
Using the estimations of cost per student provided by Contraloria General (B/. 413.66 in 2004
and B/. 452.23 in 2007), the public sector may have spent an additional B/. 1.3 million even when
repetition rates are decreasing in primary education. In the case of secondary education,
additional resources due to students repeating grades are B/. 2.3 million. Nevertheless, these are
mainly static effects. It is expected that this will improve as coverage increases, especially in the
secondary education where unitary costs of education are decreasing (from 2006 to 2007, cost per
student went from B/. 884 to B/. 748).

Aggregate effects of internal efficiency are better measured by increments on the average years of
education that students achieve. In this regard, the trend is promissory, but updated information is
needed to draw conclusions. Comparing 2002 to 2005, population with 15 years of more achieved
on average 9.0 and 9.3 years of education respectively. These improvements have been balanced
between the urban and the rural sector (10.1 to 10.3 and 6.2 to 6.6). In Panama, above 9 years of
education represents the number of years that educative institutions are legally bounded to
provide.

On the other hand, there are some improvements regarding the quality of education. First, failing
students in math and language are reducing over the years, although improvements are modest
from 2004 and 2007: In math, failing students went from 16.2 to 15.7 percent, whereas language




                                                   37
students went from 12.9 and 12.7 percent. Nevertheless, these indicators have been improving
over the years.4 Another promising trend has been the percentage of qualified teachers, which has
been consistently improving over the last years. In the same period, 74.3 of primary school
teachers were qualified in 2004, and in 2007 it was 90.8%. In secondary education, this
percentage increased from 83.4% to 90.6%. Although this indicator considers a qualified teacher
the one that has completed a grade that is similar or superior to the grade that is teaching, this
situation may contribute to improve overall quality of education.

The project was also aimed at improving the quality of education for the indigenous population
by supporting the implementation of the "National Plan of Intercultural Bilingual Education"
(2005)--consisting mainly on increasing the number of official schools in these areas, while
increasing the number of teachers and classrooms, as well as improving education materials.5
However, there is little information regarding how education has improved for indigenous
population, let alone information about quality and attainment. One available proxy indicator of
quality is the number of enrolled students over classrooms and teachers: In primary schools of
urban areas is 28.2 students per teacher and 37.4 per classroom, 22.4 and 19.0 in rural areas and
23.8 and 24.5 in indigenous areas. These ratios are comparable for secondary school and have
slightly improved since 2004, suggesting that there is no significant stress in the use of resources
(especially in rural and indigenous areas where these ratios improved slightly more than average),
and given local conditions, there is room to increase productivity.

The expansion of coverage of official education in rural and indigenous areas was in parallel with
the expansion of infrastructure. While the number of official pre-primary schools in urban areas
remained almost unchanged since 2004, the expansion has been significant in rural and
indigenous areas. In rural areas there were 1,137 pre-primary schools in 2004 and 1,699 in 2007,
whereas in indigenous areas the number increased from 341 to 723. This indicates the
administrations' focus at improving access to education in the initial years, taking into account
that enrollment in primary education has reached 100 percent since 2005.

Table 4 presents ratios of internal efficiency comparing secondary and primary official schools in
urban, rural and indigenous areas. In primary, there is a clear gap between urban, rural and
indigenous areas but these have reduced from 2004 and 2007. Despite the high percentage of
failing students in indigenous areas, it is worth noting that the number of dropout students has
reduced from 5.0% to 4.2% in three years. An educative system that is able to retain more
students and provide more years of study, providing that better and more targeted educative
materials are supplied, may be an indication of quality improvements. In the case of secondary
education, results are mixed: although the percentage of dropout students has reduced in rural and
indigenous areas, the number of students failing has increased. Finally, the project also committed
to install 30 pilot Telebásica schools, and in 2007 there were 102 schools operating. Enrolment
increased from 1,657 students in 2004 to 4,645 in 2007, but efficiency indicators are comparable
to other secondary schools: the percentage of promoted students is above 85% on average, while
dropout is 5.0% and failing 10%.

    c. Cost-Benefit Analysis

The PAD of the third phase of the project has estimated that economic benefits from increasing
the average years of education per student by 0.68 years --over the base of a number of benefited
students estimated at 1.8 million in 5 years of project operations, a rate of 9 percent of economic

returns to education, an average yearly salary of US$12,548, a discount rate of 15% and a
working life span of 45 years per student-- yields to a net present value of US$ 378 million.

The operation under evaluation benefited about 1.7 million people throughout its lifespan. For
this analysis we assumed that the learning materials financed through this operation had a lifespan
of 5 years6 but the benefit they give is the same every year (see Table below). This total does not
include other students that might have benefited from institutional strengthening at the regional
levels of MEDUCA.

The different interventions included in this operation were aimed at increasing the years of
schooling and increasing the rate of return of education through quality improvements. The
different interventions aimed at increasing access to school through pre-school programs,
scholarships, infrastructure improvements, and Telebásica in principle have a direct impact on
school years. But improvements in quality can also have this effect. The activities of the project
aimed at increasing quality were: school learning materials and bilingual education. Using the
same assumptions used in the economic analysis of the new project, the activities of the operation
under evaluation on average can increase the years of schooling of beneficiaries in about 0.68
years 7 (see World Bank 2008, report no. 43757-PA). Assuming an average annual salary of


6
     Visits to beneficiary schools show that this material is used for more than 3 years.

7
 We also assumed that the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms had the same effect of 0.68 extra school years.




                                                              40
US$ 12,000 and 45 years of working life at a 15% discount rate yields a net present value of
US$ 82 million which is higher than the total cost of the project of US $ 67 million. The benefits
estimated are the private benefits to this operation. Thus this project brought about more benefits
than its original cost.

    d. Conclusion: Integrating all the elements

The project has targeted the most vulnerable population with better education materials, improved
infrastructure and has been complemented with overall improvements in the education system.
Therefore, improving access and efficiency rates in the three levels of education, especially in
pre-primary and primary indicates that some of the objectives of the project will yield important
gains in this generation of students--although the calculation of benefits are complicated due to
the lack of data as well as most of these benefits will be achieved in the long-term.

First, there is evidence that the number of years of education per student has increased from 2002
to 2005 in 0.3 years on average in the entire country; it is expected that this operation might have
significantly contributed to this increase by increasing the years of schooling among the
beneficiaries. Second, increasing enrolment rates plus a slightly improvement on efficiency rates
in pre-primary, primary and secondary from 2004 to 2007 suggest that the number of studied
years will have an upward trend the next years. Similarly, economic returns of education are
growing over the years and gaps between urban and rural areas are diminishing, as estimated by
the World Bank's poverty assessment. Third, it is difficult to calculate the number of
beneficiaries but over the lifespan of the project around 1.7 million students have supposedly
benefited from the improvements. Fourth, total cost of the project (around US$67 million over 8
years) represents only 10% of total annual education budget, thus making it difficult to assess
specific contribution. Fifth, based on an estimation on the actual increase of schooling years
resulting from this project (0.68), we estimate that the total cost of this operation are much lower
than its cost.

Therefore, the project has pointed in the right direction and has contributed to achieve some
benefits that will materialize over the next years. Most of the benefits arise from increment of
pre-primary and primary enrolment, although secondary education has room to improve internal
efficiency rates. In terms of efficiency, this implies that the project, with a minor investment of
public resources, has been able to improve and complement some of the overall improvements in
the education system over the last years and its costs were inferior to its estimated benefits.

En este apartado se recogen las lecciones aprendidas y las observaciones de cada uno de los entes
participantes, organizadas por etapa del proyecto y luego, en función del desempeño del gobierno
y de los organismos ejecutores.

Lecciones aprendidas y comentarios por etapas del proyecto

2.1 Preparación, diseño y calidad al inicio del proyecto

No estamos de acuerdo con la aseveración de que la capacidad institucional se desvió
significativamente de los parámetros institucionales presenciados con el Primer Proyecto de
Educación Básica, y que le tomó al MEDUCA hasta principios de 2003 abordar
satisfactoriamente estas lagunas de capacitación institucional; dado que el Coordinador General
del Proyecto para ese entonces fungió en dicho cargo, desde el 1 de septiembre de 1999 y hasta el
31 de diciembre del año del 2002 y el segundo coordinador desde enero de 2003 hasta el 31 de
diciembre del 2005. Adicionalmente, el equipo técnico (coordinaciones) de la UCP, así como los
directores ejecutores del proyecto en el Ministerio de Educación se mantuvieron durante el inicio
del Segundo Proyecto de Educación Básica.

De igual manera, el que el autor primario no esté de acuerdo con los ODP y los indicadores de
resultados y productos por presentar problemas de conectividad, atribución y de falta de método
de medición apropiado; nos parece inoportuno, dado que desde el inicio del proyecto y hasta el
momento, se tomó referencia y método de medición el Monitoring Indicators for the Panama
Second Basic Education Project, mismo que fue utilizado por todas las misiones realizadas por el
Banco para verificar el avance del proyecto.

2.2 Ejecución

Los controles y procedimientos aplicados por la Contraloría General de la República no han
cambiado sustancialmente, y fueron los mismos que se aplicaron sin comentarios negativos por
parte del Banco, en el Primer Proyecto de Educación Básica.

Relacionado con las razones que explican el lento progreso físico y financiero, segunda razón,
relativo al Coordinador de la UCP contratado en enero 2003, reiteramos lo indicado en el punto
anterior en donde se comprueba que no sólo se contó con un Coordinador General, sino que fue el
mismo que fungió como tal para la última etapa de ejecución del Primer Proyecto de Educación
Básica. Igualmente hubo Oficial de Adquisiciones de octubre de 2001 a marzo 2003, luego de lo
cual se nombró un nuevo oficial de adquisiciones.

En el Caso del funcionario encargado de Telebásica, aclaramos que estas funciones las ejercía la
Dirección que coordinaba el Programa (Dirección Nacional de Currículo y Tecnología Educativa
del Ministerio de Educación), quien designó a una de sus funcionarias para estas funciones, es



                                               46
decir, pertenecía al personal de planta del MEDUCA. Para corroborar esta afirmación podemos
señalar que los 30 primeros centros de Telebásica se abrieron en los años 2002-2003-2004, a
cargo de esta funcionaria.

No es correcto que los resultados del proyecto excluyan los logros del año 2002, y que sólo
reflejen resultados de la ejecución 2003-2007, por lo tanto, las metas alcanzadas deben incluir la
suma de las acciones realizadas durante la ejecución del proyecto, 2002-2008. Luego de esta
aclaración, las cifras correctas de becas otorgadas fueron de 58,870. El total de CEFACEI en
operación fue 1,027 y los grupos de EIH 644. Las Telebásicas son 114. Los Materiales
didácticos (Guías de aprendizaje de Español, Matemáticas, Ciencias y Estudios Sociales) se
distribuidos fueron 260,827. Los materiales bilingües distribuidos suman 111,110.

2.3 Diseño, implementación y utilización del monitoreo y evaluación

Con relación a los objetivos de desarrollo, y al mejoramiento de la calidad y eficiencia de la
educación básica en el país, el Proyecto no dirigió únicamente sus acciones a un sólo segmento
(multigrado), sino que atendió a las escuelas premedias del país, ofreciendo textos y materiales
didácticos, y a las escuelas ubicadas en zonas rurales que ofrecen la educación a distancia
(Telebásica).

En cuanto al tema de la selección de indicadores de resultados intermedios y el método de
medición expresado por el autor primario del presente IFE, proponemos que en adelante los
mismos sean elaborados conjuntamente con los ejecutores de manera que sean un instrumento
efectivo para evaluar el desarrollo del Proyecto y los resultados propuestos.

2.4 Cumplimiento de salvaguardias y fiduciario

Aclaramos que los Talleres de Capacitación mencionados en este punto, y ofrecidos por el Banco,
se dieron con motivo de la contratación de un nuevo Oficial de Adquisiciones, la cual requería
capacitación sobre los procedimientos exigidos por el Banco. De igual manera, señalamos que el
uso de Panamá Compras, sólo se dio hasta que su utilización fue autorizada por Banco Mundial.

Es inexacto lo manifestado en este apartado, específicamente aquello de que a la entrada en
vigencia del proyecto no se contaba con un Especialista de Adquisiciones. También en cuanto a
Adquisiciones nos llama poderosamente la atención que se le dé la calificación de
moderadamente insatisfactorio cuando justamente se implementó la modalidad de que estas
serían realizadas por MEDUCA, y por otro lado se habla de los controles engorrosos de la
Contraloría General de la República ­ CGR, que dan la impresión de que el BANCO desconocía
el papel y procedimientos de esta institución, siendo que es el ente fiscalizador de todas las
operaciones del Estado.

Por otro lado, la consultoría de evaluación del subcomponente de infraestructura no se debió a la
carencia de respuesta por parte del FIS, ni a insistencia del Banco, sino al hecho de que debido a
la finalización del Proyecto, se procedió a evaluar todos los subcomponentes.

Los informes de Auditoría se presentaron al Banco dentro de la fecha señalada por el Convenio
de Financiamiento, que establece un plazo de hasta seis meses después de finalizado el periodo
fiscal. Las reservas mencionadas en los Informes de Auditoría se referían siempre al caso de los
pagos de becas realizados por el IFARHU, que al no contar con un sistema segregado para las
becas que se reportaban al Proyecto, no les era posible a los Auditores verificar estos pagos. Sin


                                               47
embargo, el IFARHU siempre certificó mediante nota los pagos efectuados y suministró
información detallada de las becas otorgadas (nombre de los estudiantes, escuela, sexo, ubicación,
nivel, valor).

Es lamentable que el autor primario exprese que a las recomendaciones del Banco no se le diera
seguimiento por parte de la coordinación del proyecto, ya que para cada misión de supervisión del
Banco, éste enviaba una propuesta de agenda, la cual era revisada por el MEDUCA y finalmente
era aceptada por ambas partes, luego de lo cual se llevaba a cabo la misión, que iniciaba con la
revisión de los resultados de la misión anterior y seguimiento a las observaciones presentadas,
para entonces abordar los temas propios de la misión.

2.5 Operación post-finalización/Próxima fase

Sin comentarios.

3.1 Relevancia de los objetivos, el diseño y la ejecución

Sin comentarios.

3.2 Logro de los objetivos de desarrollo del proyecto

Es interesante que pese a la calificación de moderadamente insatisfactorio del MEDUCA, el IFE
califique el logro general de los objetivos establecidos como moderadamente satisfactorios, con
expresiones como: se mejoraron, contribuyeron al logro, fue sobrepasado, etc; excepto para los
temas de infraestructura y fortalecimiento de las Oficinas Regionales. Consideramos que no han
podido ser tantos los desaciertos cuando la parte medular del proyecto, es decir, lo relativo a la
parte vinculada al sector educativo propiamente dicho, demuestre resultados en general
satisfactorios, lo que es corroborado por una calificación general del proyecto como
moderadamente satisfactoria.

Con relación a los indicadores de resultado intermedio el (b), referente al número de alumnos
bilingües que se beneficiaron de materiales didácticos apropiados, la meta era 37,000 estudiantes
y la cifra final fue 53,525 niños, a los cuales se les distribuyó 84,370 paquetes de materiales
didácticos, sobrepasando la meta establecida. Adicionalmente, el número de textos y guías
entregados a los alumnos y profesores de premedia fue de 165,837.

Sobre el subcomponente de Infraestructura, nos parece relevante indicar que el criterio expresado
por el autor primario del IFE, se basa en un informe "preliminar", toda vez que la consultora
encargada, hasta la fecha no ha entregado el informe final, y que además sobre las inspecciones
realizadas, la consultora expresa en reciente reunión que desconocía en gran parte el alcance de
las obras contratadas, por lo cual al momento de la redacción de este punto, se ha solicitado
autorización para que sea elaborada una addenda al contrato de la consultora de manera que se
reinicie la evaluación con las consiguientes correcciones. Creemos oportuno dejar de lado la
evaluación de este componente, hasta tanto no sea finalizada la evaluación final del
subcomponente.

Nos parece contradictoria la afirmación de que no hay pruebas de la contribución del SIAREH a
la modernización y el fortalecimiento del proceso de descentralización, cuando en el punto 2.3 se
indica: "Este sistema de hecho ha modernizado y hecho más transparente la contratación, el
despliegue y las prácticas de administración de profesores. Este sistema, que está basado en la


                                               48
Web y sin restricción para todas las oficinas regionales del MEDUCA, es mantenido por el
Departamento de Informática del MEDUCA."

Lecciones aprendidas y comentarios del desempeño del gobierno y por organismo ejecutor

Desempeño del Gobierno

Etapa de Ejecución: Reiteramos que los informes de Auditoría se presentaron al Banco dentro de
la fecha señalada por el Convenio de Financiamiento, que establecía hasta seis meses después de
finalizado el periodo fiscal. Las reservas presentadas en los Informes de Auditoría se referían
siempre al caso de los pagos de becas realizados por el IFARHU, que al no contar con un sistema
segregado para las becas que se reportaban al Proyecto, no les era posible a los Auditores
verificar estos pagos. Sin embargo, el IFARHU siempre certificó mediante nota los pagos
efectuados.

La interferencia por parte del GdP, señalada por el IFE en la distribución de los productos para el
aprendizaje adquiridos bajo el proyecto (100,000 Bolsas con útiles escolares por US$1,125,000),
representa menos del 1% del proyecto, que en nuestra opinión no justifica una calificación de
moderadamente insatisfactoria para el desempeño del Gobierno.

Desempeño por Organismo de Ejecución

MEDUCA

Cabe señalar que en relación a la aseveración de que la educación bilingüe tuvo baja prioridad
con los Ministros del MEDUCA de la administración de la Presidenta Moscoso, en esta
administración sólo hubo una Ministra y en ese periodo se le dio prioridad al desarrollo de los
materiales educativos para el desarrollo de la educación intercultural bilingüe, a través de la
Dirección Nacional de Currículo y Tecnología Educativa, dado que en esa fecha se iniciaron los
primeros textos en lengua madre.

Si los departamentos sectoriales de MEDUCA se desempeñaron eficazmente, sobrepasando en
todos los casos las metas establecidas en la evaluación inicial, no se justifica que el MEDUCA
haya sido evaluado como moderadamente satisfactorio.

La misión del IFE en septiembre de 2009 señala que con el desmantelamiento de la UCP y los
cambios de personal en curso en el MEDUCA se dieron algunas situaciones. Al respecto
queremos aclarar que los docentes multigrado, los de educación bilingüe y Telebásica recibieron
capacitación en el 2009. Igualmente se señala que los promotores CEFACEI y Educación Inicial
no habían recibido su pago desde julio. Esto responde al cambio de administración de gobierno,
en donde se cambian autoridades y firmas autorizadas para los trámites a los que se hace mención.
Consideramos que la situación antes señalada no es indicativo para calificar al MEDUCA como
moderadamente satisfactorio, sino Satisfactorio, dado que durante todos los ocho años de
operación del Proyecto ellos recibieron su pago oportunamente.

Para el personal del MEDUCA las tareas vinculadas al proyecto y contempladas en el POA, eran
señaladas como primordiales, en comparación con las otras funciones que sus cargos exigían, por
tanto, es injusto que se indique que no se puede establecer el grado de contribución del proyecto
en algunos componentes en razón del desacuerdo de los mecanismos de medición, pues da la idea
de que los esfuerzos no rindieron los frutos esperados y que fueron en vano.

Sin comentarios.

FIS
Coincidimos en que cualquier desviación que pudo haber tenido la ejecución de esta institución
debe ser asumida por la UCP como co-ejecutora, reiteramos lo indicado en las observaciones al
Logro de los objetivos de desarrollo del proyecto, en cuanto a que el papel del FIS aún debe ser
dimensionado y calificado en base a la evaluación final del componente de infraestructura que
esperamos sea realizado próximamente.

UCP

Insistimos en lo relacionado al nombramiento de un funcionario encargado de compras hasta
marzo de 2003. En este periodo (2002 a marzo de 2003) hubo un funcionario encargado de las
compras, durante cuya gestión se dieron las adquisiciones para el inicio de los centros de
Telebásica, la licitación de cartillas de Español, Matemática, Ciencias y Estudios Sociales de II a
VI grado, las capacitaciones de todos los programas, equipos y materiales didácticos necesarios
para el funcionamiento de los componentes.

Reiteramos lo señalado sobre los informes de Auditoria que se presentaron al Banco dentro de la
fecha señalada por el Convenio de Financiamiento, que establecía hasta seis meses después de
finalizado el periodo fiscal. Las reservas presentadas en los Informes de Auditoría se referían
siempre al caso de los pagos de becas realizados por el IFARHU, que al no contar con un sistema
segregado para las becas que se reportaban al Proyecto, no les era posible a los Auditores
verificar estos pagos. Sin embargo, el IFARHU siempre certificó mediante nota los pagos
efectuados y suministró información detallada de las becas otorgadas (nombre de los estudiantes,
escuela, sexo, ubicación, nivel, valor). Nos sorprende el hecho de que se indique que hubo varios
calificaciones insatisfactorias aplicadas por las misiones de supervisión del Banco a las gestiones
del Proyecto de adquisiciones y financieras, ya que esto no está reflejado en ninguna Ayuda
Memoria.

Con relación a lo indicado de que el último IER calificó la gestión de Adquisiciones y del
Proyecto como moderadamente insatisfactoria, al respecto podemos señalar que durante la última
gestión de adquisiciones del Proyecto se realizaron satisfactoriamente siete Actos Públicos y
Licitaciones Nacionales e Internacionales (comparado con ocho actos públicos que se hicieron en
los años 2002 a 2007), aprobadas por el Banco, incluso el uso del sistema del Banco para vigilar
la puesta en práctica del Plan Anual de Adquisiciones (Sistema de Ejecución de Planes de
Adquisiciones SEPA) y una vez aprobado por el Banco, se utilizó exitosamente el sistema de
"Panamá Compras". Se elaboró un Plan de Capacitación y Plan de Adquisiciones detallado, que
fue calificado por el Banco, como altamente satisfactorio.

Lo anterior no concuerda con el párrafo que dice que hubo falta de proactividad y que la
ejecución, por parte de la UCP, era esporádica y deficiente y que hubo falta de motivación por
parte del personal al traspasar las adquisiciones al MEDUCA. Prueba de esto es que la
funcionara encargada de las adquisiciones mencionadas anteriormente fue contratada por
MEDUCA, como parte del personal de Compras de la institución, por lo que la calificación de
desempeño de insatisfactoria no concuerda con estas actividades.




                                                50
Diferimos en que la UCP sea evaluado como un ejecutor distinto al MEDUCA desde que el
Coordinador del Proyecto reporta al Ministro de Educación igual que los co ­ ejecutores de los
componentes técnicos-pedagógicos del proyecto.

Finalmente, no estamos de acuerdo a que en el IFE no se efectuaran encuestas a los beneficiarios,
pues en primera instancia es su calidad de vida la que esperaba mejorarse, y es nuestro parecer
que no podría establecerse en cuanto mejoró sin su intervención. Frente a esto, proponemos que
al menos se mencionen los resultados de las encuestas aplicadas para cada subcomponente
durante las evaluaciones realizadas, material que se remitió oportunamente al Banco.
