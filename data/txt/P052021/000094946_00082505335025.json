Project components will: 1) improve the\n            quality of basic education, through enhanced teacher\n            training in primary, and secondary schools in rural, and\n            marginal urban communities. Textbooks, and instructional\n            materials will be provided for targeted areas, and,\n            poverty-based scholarships will be awarded annually at\n            public schools, to include indigenous students. A pilot\n            distance learning project (TELEBASICA), will focus on\n            delivering secondary education, i.e., grades 7-9, to those\n            students in remote areas, where schools are unavailable.\n            Shanty school buildings will be replaced, to accommodate\n            growing student enrollments in primary, and secondary\n            schools; 2) expand the non-formal pre-school education\n            program, through new community initial education centers\n            (CEFACEIs), as well as home-based initial education program\n            groups. Training will be provided to promoters in rural, and\n            marginal urban areas; and, 3) strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of the education system, by supporting\n            decentralization at the regional, and school levels,\n            providing training, and technical assistance to\n            decentralized offices of the Ministry of Education, for the\n            expansion of information, and assessment systems."}, "docdt": "2000-08-10T00:00:00Z"}
