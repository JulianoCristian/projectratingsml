Congo\n            Economic Recovery Operation Project were as follows:\n            outcomes were unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) the time\n            to get long-gestating public management reforms designed and\n            started is before substantial resources become available to\n            the government; 2) it is unwise to rely excessively on\n            reform champions; 3) proactive supervision, always\n            important, is critical to support major reforms in a\n            post-conflict country with weak accountability mechanisms;\n            and 4) technical assistance is unlikely to be effective in\n            the absence of adequate government arrangements to\n            coordinate the reform program as a whole."}, "docdt": "2007-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
