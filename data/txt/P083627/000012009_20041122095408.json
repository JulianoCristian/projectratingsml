The\n            overall macroeconomic framework (Section III B in the PGD)\n            has slightly improved, in particular, the projected annual\n            growth of non-oil GDP over 2005-07 has been revised upwards,\n            from 4.9 percent to 5.3 percent on account of the projected\n            secondary effects of higher oil output, and prices. There\n            has been significant progress with Paris Club creditors over\n            a series of meetings, notably on October 13, and November\n            16, 2004. On the whole, creditors were satisfied with the\n            efforts made by the authorities, and agreed to meet with\n            Congo authorities in December to negotiate a flow treatment\n            on Naples terms (67 percent Net Present Value reduction)\n            that will cover 100 percent of arrears, and debt service."}, "docdt": "2004-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
