                       REPUBLIC OF CONGO
                 ECONOMIC       RECOVERY CREDIT

                CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

Borrower:       Republic of Congo
Amount:          SDR20.5 million (US$30 million equivalent)
Terms:           StandardIDA termswith a maturity of 40 years.
Description:    The proposedcredit aims at helping Congo, as it deepensits reform
                program, benefit from an early accessto HIPC. In particular, it will
                help the country: (a) enhancetransparencyin the oil sector, through
                the implementation of the action plan, devised after the audit of the
                accounts of the oil company; (b) rationalize public investment to
                ensure fiscal discipline   and accountability    and make it more
                consistentwith the pro-poor andpro-sustainabledevelopment goals of
                the I-PRSP; and (c) reduce domestic arrears in an orderly and
                transparentmanner.
Benefits:       The key benefit from ERC is to increase the likelihood of escaping
                the "conflict   trap", notably through early access to HIPC and
                normalization of relations with external creditors, without which the
                prospects for peace, growth and poverty reduction would remain
                bleak. Progress towards this key goal would be fostered by the
                realization, under ERC, of the following:

                Better transparency in the highly visible oil sector, which will
                 contribute to checking fraud, protecting government oil revenue, and
                protecting the environment. It is also expected to improve trust of
                 government among the population, a major benefit in a post-conflict
                 environment, while strengtheninggovernment credibility with foreign
                partners and creditors, an essential benefit in what is hoped to be a
                pre-HIPC environment.

                Higher quality of public investment, notably in terms of efficiency,
                poverty reduction, transparency/governance and protection of the
                environment.

                Improved public debt management,notably an orderly and transparent
                clearanceof domestic arrears.

Risks:          Risks are significant, but must be balanced with the risks of inaction,
                which are considerable. Risks stemming from Congo's post-conflict
                context are being mitigated under a number of IDA credits. Also, the
                ERC would increasethe chancesof accessto PRGF andHIPC, which
                would allow further consolidation of peace. The risk of weak
                implementation capacity is mitigated by the relatively simple design
                of the operation and will be further mitigated by the appointment of a

                         monitoring and follow-up team in the Ministry of Finance, intensive
                         project supervision andtechnical assistanceunder other IDA credits.
Estimated Disbursement:  The proposedcredit will be disbursedin two tranchesandwill follow
                         IDA's simplified disbursement procedures for structural adjustment
                         operations. The first tranche of SDRl 1.6 million (US$17 million
                         equivalent) will be disbursed upon credit effectiveness. The second
                         tranche of SDRS.9 million     (US$l3 million    equivalent), will be
                         releasedupon compliancewith tranchereleaseconditions.

                                       I0       INTRODUCTION


  1      This document proposes an Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) to the Republic of Congo
 (ROC) in the amount of SDR 20.5 million (US$30 million equivalent). The proposedERC aims to
 support the reform efforts of the Government - as outlined in the Interim Poverty Reduction
 Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), which is being finalized, and in a Letter of Development Policy (LDP) -
 to spur economic growth and move towards poverty alleviation in a difficult post-conflict context.
 It focuses on critical reforms aimed at improving efficiency and transparencyin the managementof
 the oil sector;better allocation of public resourcesin support of growth and social priorities, so asto
 ensurean optimal use of such scarceresourcesin support of private sector-ledrecovery and service
 delivery; and settling domestic arrears,which constitute a key constraint to private sector activity.
 The actions supportedunder the ERC, when fully implemented, could result in relieving budgetary
 pressures and enhancing the business environment that could in turn raise growth to nearly 4
 percent (nearly 5 percent for non-oil GDP) per annum over the coming years - and, as a result,
 contribute to social stability, which is critical to help the country escapethe "conflict trap" in which
 it has spiraled down throughout the 1990s.

 2       The preparation of the ERC is taking place in parallel with the negotiation of an economic
 program to be supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through a three-yearPoverty
 Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. Thesenegotiations are currently expectedto
 be concluded in August 2004, with Board presentation tentatively scheduled for October 2004.
 Earlier efforts were supported by the IMF through a series of Staff Monitored Programs (SMP)
 which have been implemented with a gradually improving level of performance. Significant
  support for the country's reform program is also expectedfrom Paris Club creditors, the European
 Union (EU), the African Development Bank (AfDB) andbilateral donors.

  3      The ERC is a key element of IDA's secondTransitional Support Strategy (TSS), discussed
 by the Board on September 11, 2003, which aims to support the country's post-conflict efforts to
  consolidate the economic recovery of the last couple of years and stabilize the social environment.
 It builds on past achievements in macroeconomic stabilization and economic reform, which were
. supported by a one-tranche IDA Post-Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit (P-7467=COB),
 approvedon June 7,200l andnow fully disbursed.



                          II a   RECENT ECONOMIC              DEVELOPMENTS


 A .     BACKGROUND:       THECONFLICT TRAP


 4       Since the early 199Os,Congo has been confined in a cycle of conflict and impoverishment.
 After three decadesof economic central planning starting shortly after independence in 1960,
 during which economic performance was mediocre at best, Congo went through three successive
 rounds of civil war - in 1993, 1997 and 1998/1999. Such repeated violence brought havoc and
 many of the 3 million Congolese went through terrible ordeals. Large parts of the country were
 affected: the 1993 and 1997 civil wars were fought with particular violence in the capital,

                                                  2

Brazzaville, which is home to about 25 to 30 percent of the population (800,000 people); the
1998/1999war spreadfurther, in particular in the most populated Central and Southernregions. At
one point, about one third of the population was internally displaced, having sought refuge in the
forest and surviving in miserableconditions.

5       Throughout the 199Os,conflict and poverty fueled each other - and Congo has become an
ilmstration of the so-called "conflict trap". Each successiveround of conflict resulted in economic
decline and heightened social tensions. In the aftermath, the Government failed to jump-start
recovery and to move towards reconciliation. Impoverished and marginalized groupsbecame easy
prey for political activists, and some of the youth were lured into joining militia groups. In such an
explosive context, new eruptions of violence rapidly transforrnedinto renewed,full-scale civil war.
This pattern has been observed in various parts of the world, and DEC research shows that a
country that just emerged from conflict has a risk of renewed fighting ten times higher than before
the war started (the typical country reaching the end of a civil war faces a 44 percent risk of
returning to conflict within five years).

6       Since 2000, however, significant progresshas been made on the political and security side.
Despite sporadic eruptions of violence (largely fueled by poverty and unemployment) in the Pool
region, security has been restoredthroughout the country. Efforts towards political reconciliation
are paying off - with the liberalization of political life, the adoption of a new constitution, the
holding of presidential, parliamentary, and local elections, and the active representation of the
opposition in Parliament.

7       Thesedevelopments areencouragingbut the situation remains fragile. While much progress
has been made over the past years, the explosion of violence in the Pool region during 2002/03
underlined the fragility of the recovery process. With a population traumatized by a decade of
fighting and insecurity, and unemployment affecting large groups of people, especially among the
youth, Congo still has to tackle difficult issues for peace and reconciliation to be consolidated.
Progress over the last years has created hopes that the conflict trap, the cycle of conflict and
impoverishment, can be broken - but continued efforts will be neededto do so.


B.      RECENT ECONOMIC        DEVELOPMENTS



        The Impact of a Decade of Conflict


8       The decade of recurring conflicts has had devastating effects on Congo's economy. War
and civil disturbance, compounded by the legacy of a long period of economic mismanagement,
have taken a heavy toll on the country.        Infrastructure has suffered considerable damage, in
particular due to the interruption of maintenance (about half of the 17,000km road networks is no
longer passableand most regional urban centers do not have reliable accessto major roads; entire
provinces do not have access to clean water).        Many people have lost their assets- whether
buildings, livestock (75 percent lost), or tools (50 percent lost).      Public debt has dramatically
increased. Although the offshore the oil fields continued to function throughout the wars, GDP per

                                                  3

capita has dropped from about US$l,lOO per capita in 1990 to US$640 per capita in 2003, almost
back to the level at independencein 1960(US$580 per capita).


9.      This has led to a deepsocial crisis, which constitutes a major risk for the country's stability.
About 70 percent of the Congolese live below the poverty line (compared to about 30 percent in
1993). Poverty has become a "near-universal phenomenon" and is aggravatedby the vulnerability
of those who are above the poverty line - with people living in rural `areasparticularly affected.
Unemployment is affecting more than 50 percent of the active population, with dramatic
consequencesin terms of poverty and social exclusion. Youth areparticularly affected: lessthan 30
percent of 15- to 25-year olds have a job, less than 2 percent are employed in the formal sector.
Social indicators have collapsed (primary education attendancedropped from 90 percent in 1990 to
44 percent in 2000, life expectancy from about 52 years in the early 1990s to 48.6 years in 2002)
and the chances for Congo to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 are
seriously compromised. A number of people have been left particularly vulnerable as a result of
conflict: 11 percentof children under 15 areorphans,60,000 women and girls were victims of rape,
5,000 children fought during the war - and HIV/AIDS is spreading(with a prevalencerate of about
7.2 percent).


10      The challenge of recovery is also a challenge of transition. Congo's economy continues to
suffer from the legacy of the oil-dominated, centrally-planned system of the 196Os,197Os,and
1980s (seeBox 1). During these decades,revenuesfrom the oil sector financed a relatively large
public sector, and fueled rural migrations to urban centers (the urban population in the two main
cities of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire grew from about 15 percent of the country's population in
1960 to over 50 percent today). In parallel, a system of predation of oil resources emerged,
allegedly with the involvement of foreign companies.         Overall, the country's rich economic
potential and natural resources has failed to translate into an actual improvement of living
conditions for the largestpart of the population. Reforms to improve governanceand move towards
a market-based economy were initiated in the early 199Os,but these efforts were disrupted by the
conflicts.

                             Box 1: Main Features of the Congolese Economy


   Congo is a member of the Economic         and Monetary     Community     of Central Africa (CEMAC).       It
  uses the CFA Franc, and has committed to regional discipline on monetary matters.
   The Congolese economy is characterized         by the juxtaposition   of competitive,   foreign-dominated
  export sectors (oil, forestry) and traditional     agriculture and informal    activities - with very few
  linkages between the various segments of the economy.          Historically, public service has played an
  important    role in providing   jobs and incomes.      Today, there are about 70,000 public servants,
  including 22,000 in education, 15,000 in the military, and 9,000 in health and social affairs.

   Congo's economy is dominated         by the oil sector. With a production    of 15 million    tons in 2002,
  the sector accounts for 50 percent of GDP, 66 percent of Government           revenues, and 90 percent of
  export    earnings.     Production   is off-shore   and managed      by joint  ventures   between    foreign
  companies (Total and Agip) and the Soci&e' Nationale des P&roles du Congo (SNPC). Ancillary
   services are largely dominated by foreign groups and most supplies are imported.
   The forestry    sector is gradually   recovering from    the years of conflict.    Congo's    forests cover
   about 55 percent of the country (22 million hectares, about the size of the United Kingdom),            and
   account for about 10 percent of Africa's total forest. Recovery is well underway, with production
   having almost doubled between 2000 and 2002.           The sector accounts for about 2 percent of GDP
   and two-thirds of non-oil export revenues. It provides jobs to about 10,000 to 20,000 people.
   The formal    private  sector remains largely undeveloped.        Beside the oil and forestry companies,
   there are only 30 to 40 private companies with 30 to 200 employees (e.g., sugar mills, flour mills,
   breweries), about 100 companies with less than 30 staff (hotels, restaurants, and the trade sector),
   and about     100 individual    firms (such as doctors and lawyers).        The informal      sector is not
   organized and is relatively less developed than in other African countries.
   Agriculture    employs about 40percent      of the activepopulation,   but accounts for only 6 percent of
   GDP (in 2001).      It consists mainly of subsistence activities by smallholders (cassava, sugar cane,
   plantain,  rice), with relatively   little commercialization    (in part due to the poor state of rural
   infrastructure),  and limited export activities (coffee, tea). Fishery (half industrial,     half artisan) is
   also developed in coastal areas. Food imports have increased by 80 percent since the beginning            of
   the 1980s and make up 30 percent of the country's total annual import volume today.




        TheMacroeconomic Context and Performance


11      During 1997-2003, GDP growth has fluctuated between -3.0 percent (in 1999) and 8.2
percent (in 2000), mainly due to the volatility of international oil prices (oil accountsfor about 50
percent of GDP) and changesin the security situation. Consolidation of peaceand higher oil price
explain that growth has been positive in each year following the cessation of major hostilities in
1999, and averaged4.4 percent a year since. Likewise, inflation has been subduedafter 1999 and
has averaged 1.4 percent a year. The external accounts too improved markedly after 1999, as the
current account averageda 1.2 percent of GDP surplus after 1999, versus a 16.9 percent of GDP
deficit during 1997-99.

13.     Primary balances have been positive and large over the past few years with the notable
exceptions of 1998 (negative) and 2002 (positive but small).                                                These were required in order to
finance debt service obligations. Interest alone represented13.9 percent of GDP in 1998 though it
declined thereafter to 5.8 percent in 2003. This resulted in negative overall fiscal balances on a
commitment basis,with the exception of 2000 and 2003.

14      This situation was complicated by: (i) the huge amortization payments falling due (18.1
percent of GDP in 1997,23.3 percentin 1998,but trending down thereafterto 8.3 percent in 2003);
and (ii) the country's inability to obtain debt relief (the last Paris Club arrangement occurred in

in all yearsexcept in 1997.
1996) and/or fresh assistancein significant amount. The result has beennegative,external financing



     1   Moreover, outlays on goods and services fell from 9.2 to 2.5 percent of GDP, while transfers rose from 1.9 to 6.4 percent.
         Wages and salaries amounted to 7.7 percent of GDP in 1997, 8.9 percent in 1998, and have declined to between 5.7 and 5.9
         percent of GDP in the last three years.

                                                                6

14.      Availability of domestic financing has also beenincreasingly limited over the last few years.
Statutory advancesfrom the regional central bank (BEAC) nearly doubled between 2000 and 2002,
from 13.4percent of last year's receipts in 2000 to 23.9 percent in 2002, and are currently close to
or above allowable ceilings. Net credit from deposit banks is insignificant. A saving gracein 2003
was exceptional oil receipts amounting to about3 percentof GDP.

15       The overall picture is however, that the Government hasnot had sufficient resourcesto fully
finance all of its expenditures, including debt service (interest and principal) over the last seven
years. As a result, there has been systematic accumulation of arrears,in net terms. But as may be
seenfrom Table 1, the accumulation of arrearshas beenlimited to foreign creditors, while domestic
arrearshave been reduced. At the end of 2003, total external arrearsamounted to about US$6.0
billion, and total domestic arrears to US$830 million dollars. See paragraphs 22-28 for more
detailed treatment of the debt problem.

         The Reform Effort


16       The Government has embarked over the last decadeon a broad-ranging program of reforms
supportedby the Bretton Woods Institutions. Reform efforts focus on: (i) macroeconomic stability;
(ii) fiscal discipline; (iii) debt management;(iv) transparency(in particular in the oil sector); and (v)
public expenditure management. In this connection, Congo has benefited from support from the
International Monetary Fund (a standby arrangementin 1994-95,an ESAF in 1996,two emergency
post conflict assistanceprograms in the period 19982000, and four staff monitored programs from
June 200Lpresent) and from the World Bank (an adjustment credit in 1994, anotherin 1997 and a
number of investment operations). Bank assistancewas provided through an adjustment operation
in 1994and single-tranchePost-conflict Economic Recovery Credit (approved in July 2001 for US$
37.6 million) aswell as a seriesof investment projects. 2

17       On the macroeconomic front, performance was for a long time lessthan satisfactory, with
l&F programs going off track mainly on account of difficulties in the area of public finance.
However, performance has gradually improved in particular since the appointment of a new
Government in August 2002.                    Implementation of the current SMP (January-June 2004) is
considered by the IMF to be broadly satisfactory (see Box 2), thus extending the positive trend
registered in the last quarter of 2002, and there are solid prospects for accessto the IMF Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) by October 2004, provided that: (i) execution of the SMP at
end-June remains satisfactory; (ii) prior actions are satisfactorily implemented; and (iii) full
financing assurancesareobtained.




      2    These include an Emergency    Demobilization   and Reintegration   Project for US$5 million,   a Transparency   and Governance
           Capacity Building Project for US$7 million, an Emergency Infrastructure   Rehabilitation   and Reconstruction Project for US$40
           million, and an Emergency   Recovery Community      Support Project for US$41 million.     Future projects envisaged include     an
           Education  and Professional Training project for US$l2  million,  an HIV/AIDS    project for US$l2    million (part of the Multi-
           sectoral HIV/AIDS  program, MAP),   and a Multi-sector Infrastructure and Trade Facilitation  Project for US$23 million.

         Box 2: Implementation of the January-June 2004 Staff Monitok-ed Program


             All quantitative targets have beenmet at end March 2004. In particular, the
            primary fiscal balance was met by a comfortable margin owing to higher
             than projected non-oil revenuesand enhancedexpenditure controls. External
             debt service payments due to multilateral        institutions and Paris Club
             creditors on post-cut-off datewere made on a timely basis and the ceiling on
             domestic arrearspayments was respected.

             Progress in implementing structural reforms has been equally encouraging.
             Most structural targetswere met, in particular: (i) the external certification of
             oil revenues in 2003; (ii) the adoption of an action plan to reform the
             operations of the national oil company (SNPC); as well as (iii) the
            publication on the government intemet site of the above mentioned SNPC
             action plan, the reports from the oil revenue certification, and a summary of
             the 1991-2001 audit of the SNPC. Yet, three structural measureswere only
             partially implemented, as of end March - some of the production sharing
             agreementswith oil companies had yet to be published on the intemet site
             even though they had already beenpublished in the official gazette.Second,
             information pertaining to financial transactions carried out by SNPC on
             behalf of the Government was incomplete; and third, part of forestry taxes
             (which represent6 percent of non-oil revenues,or 2 percent of all revenues)
             had not yet beentransferredto the Treasury, thus compromising the objective
             of full centralization of revenues. The Government has however committed
             to taking corrective actions in the short run, in order to ensure full
             compliance with program undertakings.



18.    On the structural front, confronted with the "Dutch disease" and the legacy of decadesof
a centrally-planned economy, as well as the collapse of infrastructure, the Government has taken
stepsto improve the environment for the private sector. While attracting reputable investors in a
post-conflict context is often difficult, the Government implemented a multi-fold strategy (with
supportfrom the Bank, in the context of recent adjustment and investment operations):

   l   First, it successfully privatized all Government-owned enterprisesin the critical sectors of
       oil products distribution and banking (all formerly public banks are now in private hands,
       andthe framework for financial intermediation is broadly appropriate).

   l   Second, it opened up infrastructure sectors to private operators: (i) the railways company
       (Chemin de Fer Congo Ocean, CFCO), which operatesthe key economic link between the
       main port (Pointe Noire) and Brazzaville is being awarded on a concession basis (the
       Government is presently negotiating financial arrangementswith the two candidates, and
       final selection is expectedin the coming months); (ii) efforts to outsourceuser fee collection

                                                     8

         in the power sector,following the unsuccessfulattempt to attract private operatorsthrough a
         concession (in view of the large investments needed for rehabilitation, there was no
         candidate for the concession); (iii) parallel efforts to sign a management contract in the
         water. sector (the foreign investor who won the concession of the water utility is in the
         processof relinquishing it, onceagain due to the significant investment needs).

    l    Third, the Government improved the legal and regulatory framework as a way to prepare,or
         accompany the privatization process: the post and telecommunications were separatedinto
         two     entities  (SOPECO and SOTELCO),            and codes have been prepared for
         telecommunications, water, electricity andpetroleum distribution.

    l    Fourth, it prepared a new forestry code, to improve the management of Congo's large
         forestry resources(which is both a potentially substantialsourceof income and an important
         ecological system to be preserved), increase fiscal revenues from the sector, and ensure
         environmentally-sound andsustainableexploitation;

    l    Fifth, it significantly reducedthe rate of the tax on corporateprofits, adoptedan investment
         chart rationalizing tax holidays and establisheda one-stop window for investors. (Congo's
         economy, which is part of the CEMAC, is quite open to international trade with moderate
         inflation and stable exchange rates, and prices for goods and services and factors of
         production which aremostly market-determined.)

19       Theseefforts gradually paid off. Real GDP growth resumed,largely driven by improvement
of *the security situation (a typical pattern of post-conflict countries), large public investments to
rehabilitate infrastructure, a rebound in the forestry sector, and an increase in oil prices.
Remarkably, however, non-oil GDP during 2000-2003 grew by 10.3 percent, while oil GDP
declined by 4.4 percent (due to a 15 percent decreaseof extracted quantities). Total growth
reflected the combination of the non-oil rebound and the fluctuation of oil prices - at 8.2 percent in
2000, 3.6 percent in 2001, 3.5 percent in 2002, and 1 percent in 2003. As non-oil GDP growth is
gradually returning to a more normal level (also a typical pattern of post-conflict countries), the
challengeis now to keep it close to 5 percent a year.

       External Debt


20      Theseefforts, however, are hamperedby the debt burden: Congo's stock of public debt was
accumulated during the 1970s and 1980s as well as during the years of war. At the end of 2003,
external debt stood at US$8.6 billion, or about US$2,800 per capita, 339 percent of exports and 243
percent of GDP, making Congo one of the world's most heavily indebted countries (Paris Club and
other bilateral creditors account for 58 percent of the debt, with commercial banks and multilateral
lenders accounting for 34 and 8 percent, respectively). Debt service due was about 61 percent of
government revenues during 2000 - 2003, far beyond the country's repayment capacity, and is
expectedto remain at 40 percentin 2004, andbetween 20 and40 percent in 2005 - 2008.                  I

21      Congo began to accumulate external arrears in the mid 198Os,following the collapse of oil
prices and the appreciation of the CFA Franc. During the first half of the 199Os,Congo stopped
servicing most of its debt, which resulted in a significant build-up of arrears(about 69.8 percent of
the total stock at end 2003). Since 2001, the Government has demonstrated its commitment to
normalize relations with some of the country's key creditors - and arrearsto the Bank were cleared
in June2001, and timely payments to the IMF resumed. Arrears to the African Development Bank
and the European Union remain relatively high (US$148.4 million and US$39.2 million at end-
2003, respectively), although there are solid prospectsfor reaching an agreementwith the African
Development Bank within the context of this institution's recently-approved strategy for dealing
with post-conflict countries' arrears.Idem for arrearsto the EuropeanUnion. There have been four
Paris Club re-scheduling since the 1980s(of which the last was in 1996, on concessionalterms),but
none since the end of the conflict, and Congo remains in arrearswith Paris Club creditors (pre-
cutoff date arrears amount to US$2,384.5 million, while post-cutoff date arrears amount to
US$622.2 million at end 2003). Moreover, almost 90 percent of Congo's significant stock of
commercial debt is in arrears.One possibility to engagecommercial creditors is to have a London
Club of creditors*meetingto work out a deal.

I/ Preliminary   staff estimates, World Bank and IMF


22           The resolution of this problem is a condition sine qua non for the country's stabilization and
recovery: debt service obligations considerably reducegovernment resourcesavailable for breaking
the cycle of conflict and impoverishment. In a context of high oil dependence,this further restricts
the room for maneuvering in face of price shocks.

23           Facing this issue, the Government has taken measuresin two key directions. First, it put an
end to the practice of oil-collateralized borrowing (which was extensively used during and after the
conflict, partly in response to the drying up of official assistance),with a significant impact on
public resources: service of oil-collateralized debt decreasedfrom 38 percent of oil revenues in
2002, to 26 percentin 2003, and is projected at 13 percentin 2004, 15 percent in 20053andbelow 6
percent after 2006. Second,it used part of the windfall oil revenues(due to higher oil prices) over
the last years to clear or stabilize part of its arrears, although this effort was insufficient to
effectively settle the issue.

24           Beyond such short-term efforts, Congo urgently needs to access the Enhanced Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. A preliminary analysis indicates that Congo could be
eligible for debt relief under the Initiative. After the application of full traditional debt relief
mechanisms,the debt burden would be above the HIPC threshold, with a ratio of net presentvalue
of debt to government revenue well above 250 percent.4 Reaching the HIPC Initiative decision
point will require intensified efforts by the Government, and in particular: (i) the conclusion of a
PRGF arrangementand its satisfactory implementation; (ii) the normalization of relations with key
multilateral creditors (and in particular the African Development Bank and the European Union);
(iii) the successful negotiation of a settlement plan on post-cut off date arrearswith Paris Club
creditors; and (iv) the regular and timely payment of due debt service to major creditors. Making
best use of the existing flexibility to "front-load" assistancefor post-conflict countries (through an

early decision point combined with a longer period to completion point), and assuming continued
strong economic performance, as well as support from all major creditors, the authorities are
hopeful that the decision point could be reachedin the first half of 2005.

             Domestic Debt


25           The Government is also burdenedwith a large domestic debt, which, including debt owed to
the banking sector and public sectorentities, stood at nearly CFAF558 billion at end-2003(US$l. 1
billion), about 26.9 percentof GDP. Social debt (salary and pension arrears)amountedto CFAF238
billion and accountedfor almost half the total. Debt to banks and public enterprisesis estimatedat
CFAF3 1 billion and CFAF16 billion respectively. Arrears stood at CFAF432 billion, roughly 80
percent of total domestic debt. The entire social debt (CFAF238 billion) andpublic enterprisedebt
(CFAF15.7 billion) is in arrears.

26           Domestic arrearswere reducedby CFAF46.1 billion in 2000 and 2001 (about 1.1 percent of
GDP), and CFAF5 billion in 2002. Domestic arrearswere further reducedby CFAF39.5 billion in
2003 (1.9 percent of GDP, and almost all of the year's windfall oil revenue), even though no
reduction was scheduled. At the same time, in 2003, arrears on external debt increased by
CFAF164.2              billion (CFAF17 billion more than scheduled).While reducing domestic arrearsis good
for businessand government credit, Congo missed an opportunity in 2003 to reduce external arrears
and move closer to normalizing relations with key donors. Looking forward, it is clear that a
comprehensivepublic sector debt reduction strategy needs to be developed to settle both domestic
and external arrears, in order to appropriately balance the interests of domestic and external
creditors.

             Conclusion: Continuation of the Status Quo or Change?


27           Congo is faced with a simple choice: let things stay as they are or changeradically and fast.
Continuing with the statusquo -- non adjustment as per the last seventeenyears -- is not an option,
as it would increasethe already unacceptably high level of poverty as well as create an even more

unsustainableeconomic and social situation for the years to come. Increasingly cognizant of this
reality and that time is short, the Government's economic program is built around the following
pillars:

        p developing a credible PRSP (beginning with a credible I-PRSP);

        > promoting the growth of the non-oil sector(oil resourcesare expectedto decline over the
            next two decades,so growth of the non-oil sector is essential to reducing poverty over
            the long run).

        > normalizing relations with creditors, external and domestic alike, with a view to
            obtaining substantialdebt relief;

        > improving public finance management,as regardsboth receipts and expenditures,so as
            to increasepoverty related recurrentand capital expenditures.

The proposedoperation is in responseto a requestfrom the authorities to assistin this endeavor.

A 0     THE GO~ERNMENT'S         POVERTY REDUCTION       STRATEGY


28.     The Government is finalizing an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP),
which outlines the key strategic directions for reducing poverty in the years ahead(the document is
expectedto be ready by August 2004). The I-PRSP is basedon five axes:

     a Improving governance and transparency, and consolidation of the macroeconomic
        framework.       This includes actions to: (i) increase non-oil revenues; (ii) manage oil price
        volatility; (iii) improve the allocation and management of public expenditures; (iv) enhance
        management of natural resources; (v) reform the judiciary; and (vi) implement an anti-
        corruption strategy.

     l  Sectoral strategies to revive growth in key sectors, i.e. petroleum, forestry, rural
        development, and the private sector - including: (i) strengthening institutions in chargeof
         overseeingthe natural resourcessectors;(ii) encouragingthe development of transformation
         and other value-adding activities (in particular forestry and agro-business);(iii) supporting
         the development of small andmedium enterprisesand facilitating the emergenceof effective
         financial servicesfor these entities.

     a Improving access to social services and social protection.          This includes actions to: (i)
         improve access to health and education services; (ii) rehabilitate infrastructure of health
         centersand schools; (iii) develop partnershipswith civil society; (iv) build capacity of staff;
         (v) reform the pension system; and (vi) implement a genderstrategy.

                                                    13

    l   Infrastructure     development      -   including    transportation,  water,   energy,    and
        telecommunications, and housing. Actions focus on the rehabilitation of infrastructure and
        the improvement of their management (in particular through further involvement of the
        private sector).

    l   HIV/ AIDS prevention.       The HIV/AIDS      prevention strategy is articulated around three
        points, to be implemented in partnership with the international community: (i) preventing
        further infection; (ii) supporting already infected personsand treating opportunistic diseases;
        and (iii) strengtheningepidemiological surveillance.

29      The Government's Letter of Development Policy            (LDP) (See Annex 2) outlines key
measuresto be taken in the coming period, in support of the objectives outlined in the draft PRSP
document. The LDP          covers: (i) the Government's poverty reduction strategy; (ii)           the
macroeconomic andbudgetary framework; (iii) the improvement of transparencyand governancein
the oil, mining, forestry and diamond sectors; (iv) the settlement of public external and domestic
debt; (v) the improvement of the Public Investment Program; (vi) the implementation'of sectoral
policies (forestry; anti-fraud and anti-corruption; civil service reform; private sector development;
agriculture, livestock and fisheries; industry; mining, energy and water; rehabilitation of transport
infrastructure; and telecommunications).       It also includes measures specific to environmental
protection in the oil and forestry sectors. Main measures in the oil sector include: (i) better
enforcement of the Environmental and Hydrocarbons Codes; (ii) strengthening of the Pollution
Prevention Unit within the Ministry of Hydrocarbons; (iii) establishing a Coastal Surveillance and
Clean-Up Unit; and (iv) establishing a regional center at Pointe-Noire for the prevention of major
hydrocarbon pollution. Main measures to be taken in the forestry sector include: (i) better
enforcement of the Environmental and Forestry Codes; (ii) strengthening the sustainable
management of forests through a participatory process involving the State, communities, loggers
andNGOs; and (iii) the protection of biodiversity through the expansionof protectedareas.


B .     THEOVERALLMACROECONOMICFRAMEWORK

30      On the macro-economic front, the Government's main objectives include attaining an
economic growth ratesof 4 percent a year on averageduring the 2004-2007 period, underpinnedby
growth in the non-oil sector of an average4.8 percent a year throughout the period. To foster non-
oil sector growth, the Government favors a strategy emphasizing infrastructure development,
including roads to improve market accessfor the agricultural sector, and electric power (for which
the recently launched Imboulou Dam project is considered essential.) The Government is also
confident that a higher quality public investment program, a better incentive system, as well as
enhancedgovernance will contribute to boosting non-oil sector growth. Inflation is projected to
remain below 2 percent a year, while the external current account is projected to generatea surplus
of 1.1 percent of GDP on average. Likewise, the overall fiscal balance would be in surplus of
between 2.1-3.3 percent of GDP.          Table 4 summarizes the macroeconomic framework being
preparedin the context of the proposedPRGF.

31           GDP growth projections are below the 7 to 8 percent which would be neededto reach the
Millennium Development Goals - but are based on a realistic assessmentof what can be achieved
in the coming years,basedon existing production capacity (including unused capacity which could
be built upon as the economic recovery takes root). Growth in the non-oil sector, and in particular
in the agriculture sector,which is critical for poverty alleviation, will require significant investments
in infrastructure (in particular to improve or restore accessto markets).

32          To sustain macroeconomic stability and foster growth, the Government has committed to
pursue budgetary policies aimed at achieving a primary surplus of 8.3 percent of GDP on average
during 2004 - 2007 (including 8.5 percent in 2004 and 9.3 percent in 2005), through increased
revenuemobilization and conservativeexpenditure policies:                                                                        \


      l     On the revenue side, in the oil sector, the Government has adoptedthe following price rule,
        . to manage price volatility and avoid pro-cyclical spending: the international oil price used

                                                    15

       for revenues projections will be the international price projected by the IMF in its World
       Economic Outlook (WEO) from which US$3 per barrel is deducted. With this rule, and
       assuming an averageincreaseof the volume of production of 7.4 percent, oil revenueswill
       represent about 20.5 percent of GDP in 2004 and an expected 19.1 percent on average
       during 2005-2007, reflecting an expecteddecreaseof prices. In this connection it may be
       noted that the potential additional revenuesresulting from the use of the price rule are
       currently estimated to amount to CFAFl 10 billion in 2005, and about CFAFSO billion in
       2006-2007,if the full WE0 price is realized.

    l  The primary surplus target will be adjusted upwards if oil revenues are higher than
       projected. Specifically, it hasbeen agreedwith the IMF that excessrevenueswill be usedas
       follows, relative to program targets:

           & Financeany residual budgetary gap;
           & Further reduce externalpayment arrearson non reschedulabledebt;
           > Further reduce domestic arrears;and/or
           9 Reducenet claims on the banking systemon the Government (excluding the
               counterpartuseof IMF resources).

    l  On the revenue side, in the non-oil sector, the Government is committed to pursuing its
       efforts to increaserevenues (from 17.6 percent of non-oil GDP in 2003 to 19.2 percent in

       exemptions, aswell asa broadening of the tax base.
       2007) - through measures aimed at reducing fraud, fiscal evasions and discretionary*


    l  On the expenditure side, the Government policies will aim to free up resourcesto increase
       pro-poor spending (in line with the I-PRSP recommendations) and ensurethe service of the
       country's external debt - in particular through an appropriate handling of domestic arrears
       and the implementation of awell-designed public investment plan (as discussedbelow).

33     A primary objective of government policy in the short run, especially 2004/05, is to
normalize relations with its external creditors, in particular through:

    l  full and timely payments on current non-reschedulablematurities to all external creditors;
    l  full clearanceof non reschedulable arrearsto multilateral creditors, in particular, the AfDB
       (CFAF76.8 billion), and the European Union           (CFAF22.8 billion), and post-cut off date
       arrearsto bilateral creditors (CFAF27 1billion).

This would then set the stage for debt rescheduling and relief of reschedulable debt through the
Paris Club (hopefully in the last quarter of 2004). If successful, this would imply clearance of
arrearsin the amount of CFAF 1,039billion or 45.4 percent of GDP. The authorities also hope to
obtain further debt relief through the enhancedHIPC Initiative, around mid-2005, assuming fully
satisfactoryperformance under the envisagedPRGF program.

34        Table 5 (overleaf, page24) presents the Government's capacity to service externaldebt and
clear arrears for the years 2004-2007, as currently projected, while abstracting from the financial
flows resulting from any rescheduling arrangementsthat may occur under the auspicesof the Paris
Club or the enhancedHIPC Initiative. It is thus somewhat of a partial picture but highlights the
difficulties that have to be overcome in 2004 and 2005, both before and after incorporation of
possible external financing to be delivered in the period 2004-2007 by the IMF and IDA. Table 5
addresses:(i) the capacity to pay current maturities of core (i.e., non reschedulable) external debt
service, plus a minimum for domestic debt service which the authorities judge to be politically
essential; (ii) the issue of settlement of non-reschedulable external arrears (CFAF370 billion, of
which CFAF102.7 to multilaterals, in particular the EU and the ADB),                         as well as key domestic

there would be a residual surplus of CFAF62-63 billion for 2004 and 2005. This rises to almost
CFAFlOO in 2006, before declining to CFAF85 billion in 2007.

36      Total payments for projected arrears clearance amount to CFAF358 billion (US$600
million) in 2004, of which CFAF38 billion (US$65 million) to domestic suppliers, and CFAF 320
billion (US$535 million) to foreign creditors. The figures drop sharply from 2005 onwards. Full
payment of current core debt service obligations and clearanceof domestic and external arrears,as
currently estimated,will require financing of CFAF295 billion (US$506 million) in 2004, but only
CFAF3 billion (US$5 million) in 2005.

37      On the external front, discussions are currently ongoing with the European Union and the
AFDB on arrears clearance arrangements,with the objective of minimizing cash payments by
Congo and, if possible, arriving at a situation of non-negativetransfers.

38      In the caseof the European Union, a possible scenario is that Congo would make a down
payment to the European Union who would then advancethe remainder from a project financing
facility to the Treasury, who would use the funds to fully clear arrearsto the EuropeanUnion. The
implicit assumption in the Table is that no down payment is required?

39      Projections in Table 5 assumethat the Congo will make a 33 percent down payment to the
African Development Bank in 2004, and that remaining arrearswould be paid in full in 2005 via: (i)
a grant of 33 percent from AfDB's Post Conflict Fund; and (ii) financial assistancefrom the
international community for the remainder. AFDB has indicated that it hasno flexibility asregards
the sizeof the initial down payment to be madeby Congo in 2004.

40      As regardspost-cutoff date arrearsto the Paris Club creditors, discussions areongoing with
the Paris Club Secretariat,in responseto a request from the authorities for exceptional treatment.
The Paris Club has indicated that any exceptional treatment on post cut off arrears will be
conditional upon a significant partial payment on the part of the Congolese, from windfall oil
revenues.      The heart of the issue is that these post cut-off date arrears to Paris Club creditors
coexist with an outstanding stock of oil collaterized debt to private creditors of CFAF230 billion, all
of which hasbeencontractedafter the cutoff date.

41      In this connection, if it is assumedthat the initial residual financing surplus of CFAF62.5
billion is used in priority to pay AfDB, and if the EU requires no down payment, then CFAF24.2
billion would be available for payment of post-cut off arrearsto the Paris Club. If a larger down
payment on post-cutoff arrears is required, this would effectively have to come from either: (i)
higher domestic revenues;(ii) lower primary expenditures;(iii) fresh international assistance;(iv) a
smaller reduction of domestic arrears,compared to the 38.3 billion currently programmed or (v)
somecombination of the above!




      5   The short fall in the EU project financing would then need to be made up, in order to maintain the same level of project
          expenditure.
      6   Since Congo will be unable to make further drawings on the Regional Central Bank, because statutory advances are already
          their ceilings.

                                                  19

42      Projected disbursements from the IMF, under the proposed PRGF, and IDA under the
proposed Credit amount respectively to approximately CFAFS and CFAFlO billion for 2004,
although the residual balanceswould be positive from 2005 onwards. This scenariowould leave a
financing gap of FCAF257.9 billion for 2004, correspondingessentially to the shortfall in financing
required to cover post-cutoff datearrearsto the Paris Club. To avoid lending for arrearsclearance,
appropriate financing assuranceswill be neededby the IMF for the PRGF to be presentedto its
Board, and for the proposedIDA Credit to become effective.

43.     Taking into account debt service correspondingto current maturities on reschedulabledebt
(line G) will however increase the financing gap in 2004 to about CFAF411 billion and generate
financing needs between CFAF58.6 and 90.5 billion between 2005 and 2007.          These would be
reduced however by any debt relief as may be obtained through the Paris Club and the enhanced        ,
HIPC Initiative.

44      Lastly, it will be necessaryto find the additional resourcesneededto finance the clearance
of precut off date arrears(CFAF1039 billion), other bilateral creditors (CFAF125.2 billion), as well
as commercial banks and other private creditors (CFAF871.9 billion), for a total of CFAF2036.1
billion. This will require debt relief through the Paris Club, the enhancedHIPC Initiative and the
London Club. The authorities hope to benefit from a Paris Club arrangementin the last quarter of
2004, and admission to the enhancedHIPC Initiative in 2005. The issue of arrearsto commercial
banks and other private sectorcreditors would also be addressedin 2005.

45      In conclusion, successfully navigating 2004 and 2005         will pose extremely difficult
macroeconomic managementproblems. Congo will clearly require external concessionalfinancial
assistance and will be able to obtain this initially only from the IMF and IDA.          Hence the
importance of the potential contribution of the PRGF arrangementbeing preparedby the IMF and
the proposedIDA operation. But these operationscan only be a small part of the overall work out
and will need to be complemented by debt rescheduling on a huge scale, for a country of Congo's
size, and much improved macroeconomic management, especially of public resources,as explained
in the next section.     Particular attention will need to be given to oil and non-oil revenue
mobilization, expenditure management in general and the investment budget in particular, so as to
make resources available for poverty reduction, while avoiding accumulation of new domestic
arrears It will be important to establish an domestic arrears settlement strategy that is consistent
with resourceavailabilities.


C .     THEKEYTOSYCCESS:IMPROVEDMANAGEMENTOFPUBLICRESOURCES


46.     To succeed in its efforts, the Government needs first and foremost to improve the
management of public resources. This is particularly important within the context of moving
towards HIPC, aswell as to make best use of the existing potential to consolidate the stabilization
and recovery processes. This will require reforms to enhance the systems used for budget
preparation, execution and supervision, as well as a gradual shifting of public expenditure towards
targetedpoverty alleviation. It should be complemented by a vigorous effort aimed at improving
transparencyand effectiveness in the use of scarcepublic resources,in particular in oil, diamonds
and forestry.

47    A Public Expenditure Review and a preliminary review of the Public Investment Program
ha;e been carried out in the last months with support of the World Bank. Draft findings and
recommendationsinclude the following:

   l  The volatility of revenues. Government revenuesarerelatively high, at about 30 percent of
      GDP on averagethroughout 2001 - 2003. But the shareof oil revenues(about 65 percentof
      the total) causesa high degreeof volatility, which greatly complicates fiscal management.
      Managing this volatility is a key challenge for the Government, which has decided to do so
      by using conservative oil revenueprojections and setting expenditure priorities (with lower
      priority spending executedonly if oil revenuesturn out to be higher than the conservative
      assumption).

   l  The ue-sustainability of current levels of expenditure.       In 2001 - 2003, government
      spending averagedabout 31 percent of GDP, with an averagedeficit of about 3.1 percent,
      financed through the building-up of arrears. Prospectsfor the medium-term arepoor, as oil
      revenuesare expectedto gradually decline with the exhaustion of reserves(currently worth
      15 years of production at current levels) and as there is little room for substantially
      increasing non-oil revenues (already at 18 percent of non-oil GDP).        Reducing public
      expenditureis therefore a priority.

   l  The lack of resources for operating costs.          Confronted with relatively high interest
      payments (5.8 percent of GDP and about 19 percent of spending in 2003) and the need for
      public investment to rehabilitate infrastructure (4.6 percentof GDP and over 15.5percent of
      spending in 2003), the Government has allocated relatively limited resourcesto wages (the
      wage bill declined from nearly 9 percent of GDP in 1998 to 5.9 percent in 2003, due to a
      wage and hiring freeze in effect since 1994) and goods and services (which declined from
      9.3 percent of GDP in 1998 to 2.5 percent in 2003).           Operating resources are often
      insufficient to ensurethe proper delivery of key public services- and can only be increased
      through a reduction of the debt burden or of rehabilitation spending.

      The need to shift expenditures towards social sectors. Due to the conflict, outlays on
      security and national reconciliation have increasedconsiderably since the early 199Os,as
      well as financing for infrastructure rehabilitation (17 percent of total spending). This
      constrains spending for sectors such as education (currently about 3 percent of GDP and
      about 9 percent of total spending, skewed towards secondary and higher education) and
      health (currently about 1.2 percent of GDP and 3.5 percent of total spending, heavily biased
      towards tertiary care and Brazzaville).       As peace and security are consolidated, the
      Government is committed to gradually shifting resourcesto the social sectors, and improve
      their intra-sectoral allocation.

   l  The need to improve public expenditure management.              The Government has made
      substantialprogressto put an end to war-time budget management practices and restore the
      systemswhich were disrupted by the war, but more remains to be done to normalize and
      modernize its public expenditure processes- in particular: (i) to improve the realism of
      budget estimates (for many ministries, budget allocations are out of line with what they
      actually receive); (ii) to frame the budget within the context of a medium-term expenditure
      program; (iii) to strengthencoordination between the Budget Office and Treasury to reduce

                                                  21

        uncertainty and delays in payment; (iv) to improve reporting, including for expenditures
        made at the local level, in particular through the submission of such reports to Parliament;
        and (v) to strengtheninstitutions in chargeof the oversight of public expenditure(e.g., the
        GeneralAuditor Office).

        The Public Investment Program. The Republic of Congo has been spendingbetween 4.6
        and 7.1 percent of GDP on its investment budget since 2001, much of it on the rehabilitation
        of infrastructure in the aftermath of the civil wars of the 1990s. On account of its financial
        difficulties, the Statehas beenunable to pay its suppliers, so that many firms have stopped
        their works in mid-contract. To circumvent this problem, there has been frequent recourse
        to off budget financing, in particular by petroleum companies who have been authorized to
        deduct their payments from oil taxes. Domestically financed projects frequently incur
        payment difficulties, leading to explicit or implicit accumulation of payment arrearsand/or
        interruption in works. Contracts are frequently accordedon a sole source basis rather than
        through competitive bidding. Projects are often inaccurately costed, and their economic
       justification is not always clear. On the institutional front, the respective roles of the
        Ministry of Planning, line ministries and the De'lbgation     G&&ale   des Grands     Travaux
        (DGGT) needto be clarified, at least for large projects.

        Significant improvements in the managementof the public investment program are needed.
        Proper project preparationand evaluation proceduresneed to be restored. Project costsneed
        to include proper estimatesof future recurrent costs,that should be included in the recurrent
        budget. It is essential and urgent to organize a system of physical and financial monitoring
        of projects on a regular basis. DGGT needsto respect procurement and budget procedures
        and produce regular reports on the execution of the projects for which it is responsible.
        Appropriate financial managementinformation systemsfor the investment budget needto be
        put in place so as to facilitate improved financial management and the avoidanceof arrears
        accumulationpertaining to the investment budget.

D.      THE ACTIONS TO BE SUPPORTED UNDER THE ECONOMIC              RECOVERY CREDIT


48      Within this context, success of the overall economic program, and more broadly of the
current efforts to accessthe HIPC initiative and hence free up the resourcesneededto stabilize the
peace and recovery process, hangs on critical public revenues and expenditure issues. In view of
the country's potential resources,and of the difficulties encounteredto date on the path to reform,
three areas have been identified, where reforms could have an impact disproportionate to the
resources used to support them: (i) building on past efforts to further improve governance and
transparencyin the natural resourcessectors, especially oil, diamonds and forestry; (ii) designing
and adopting a public investment program in support of poverty reduction; and (iii) designing a plan
to settle domestic arrears,to ensure the highest possible impact on economic growth for a given
amount of resourcesavailable.

                                                          22



         Enhancing Transparency in the Oil Sector


49       Congo's economy is heavily dependenton the petroleum sector- although the importance
of this sector should not be over-estimated(seeBox 3). With the exception of the small portion of
domestic production sold to the domestic refinery, Congo's crude oil production is destined for
exports,mainly to EastAsia, Europe and the United States. Congolesecrude oil is of relatively low
quality, and sold at prices which are subjectto wide fluctuations.

                             Box 3: Key Data on the Oil Sector in Congo

 Congo is a relatively    minor-player     on international markets.    With a production   of 258,000
 barrels per day, it ranks fourth       in sub-Saharan Africa   (although   with   only 6.4 percent of
 production),  and 36* worldwide       (with 0.4 percent of total production).     Congo is particularly
 exposed to price fluctuations       since its oil is of relatively  low    quality and its production
 insufficient to affect international prices.

 Oil production   is steadily declining:   by 6.2 percent in 2000, by 1.5 percent in 2001, and again
 by 4.6 percent in 2002.      Overall, oil GDP per capita shrank at an average annual rate of 3.5
 percent between 1986 and 200 1.

 Oil reserves are rapidly depleting.     Proven reserves are currently estimated at 1.5 billion barrels
 (0.1 percent of worldwide    reserves), i.e. about 15 years of exploitation at the current pace.
 Oil revenues are significant     - but they remain modest in view of the challenges the country is
 facing.   Annual oil revenues stand at about US$SSO million,       i.e. US$194 per capita.    Total oil
 revenues until depletion of reserves (assuming current oil prices) are about US$3,100 per capita.


50.      Organization of the sector. Oil resourceshave been developedby foreign companies,wmcn
continue to dominate the industry today. In the production sector, TotalFinaElf (which operatesin
Congo as TEP-Congo) and AGIP havebeen the dominant players and control over 90 percent of the
production. In the exploration and development segment, a larger number of foreign companies
have been active in recent years, including Chevron, Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Heritage Oil,
Sasol,and Naphta.

51 .     Until 1998, the Government was involved in the sector through a state-owned company,
Hydrocongo, which was put into liquidation.                The sector was restructured in 1998: upstream
operations (exploration, development, and production) were taken over by the state-ownedSo&e
Nationale desP&roles Congolais (SNPC), while downstream operations (refining and distribution)
were privatized.     SNPC is in charge of: (i) managing the state's assetsin the upstream sector,
including production-sharing agreements (a common practice in oil-producing African countries)
and equity stakes (the SNPC does not operate any field); and (ii) market the state's share in oil
output   (since royalties and profit oil accruing to the state are collected in kind). The company's
revenue comes from marketing fees (set at 1.6 percent of sales revenue) and from its stake in oil
ventures. In addition, SNPC owns the CORAF refinery and has acquired equity stake in several
ventures outside the petroleum sector. SNPC is controlled by the Ministry of Hydrocarbons in
technical areasandby the Ministry of Finance in economic and financial areas.

                                                         23


52.     Fiscal regime.        As a resource owner, Congo derives substantial benefits from its oil
reserves. In the context of production-sharing agreements,the Statereceives its shareof economic
rent generatedfrom petroleum production through a combination of royalties and profit sharing.
Royalties are levied at a rate of 12 percent. They represent a steady source of revenue to the
Government, becausethey are levied on grossvolumes - that is, they arenot subject to deductions-
and flow immediately after the start-up of production. The calculation of profit oil and its split
between the Government and companiesis defined in production-sharing arrangements(seeBox 4).
A very significant part of the revenuesis paid in-kind, through oil which is commercialized by
SNPC for the Government. In addition, Congo participates in production directly through equity
stakesheld on its behalf by SNPC.


                                 Box 4: The Calculation    of Profit Oil

 All production-sharing     arrangements use the same fundamental      approach: profit oil is derived
 from gross production     by deducting allowable production  costs (termed "cost oil") and royalties.
 Profit oil is then shared between the Government and the companies in a set proportion.

 Cost oil comprises      all costs related to the exploration,   development   and extraction     of oil
 reserves under the contract - including        operating costs (current direct cost, overhead,     and
 terminal charges), amortization,    interest charges, and provision for abandonment     of production.
 Cost oil is capped at 50 percent of gross revenues (the so-called "cost stop") with the excess
 allowed to be carried forward until it can be fully amortized.     Although  the cost stop represents
 the upper limit on the deductions of which companies can avail themselves, and not necessarily
 the actual cost, to date companies have nearly always been able to bring their deductible costs to
 this limit - in particular through the "pooling"  of some capital costs across different  fields.

 As the price rises, so does the cost stop, but only up to a point. The cost stop cannot exceed 50
 percent of a predetermined      price ceiling (US$25 per barrel for most arrangements)        - nor go
 below US$7 per barrel. As a result, profit oil begins to rise sharply at prices that exceed US$25
 per barrel - and declines faster than prices below a threshold of US$14 per barrel.



 53.    Recent reforms. In line with improved security, the Government took the following
measuresto improve transparency. In early 2003, the practice of advancepayments was ended,and
oil companies no longer incur expenseson the Government's behalf. In early 2003, a Hydrocarbon
Unit was establishedwithin the Ministry of Finance, to overseeSNPC's operations on behalf of the
Government, and in particular to monitor the volumes and timeliness of transfers of the
Government's oil revenue. The Government also hired an internationally-reputed firm to certify
thesetransferson a quarterly basis, starting with the first quarter of 2003.

54      In addition, with funding from the Bank-financed Governance and Transparency Capacity
Building Project, the Government launched the first audit of SNPC's accounts for the years 1999,
2000, and 2001, which was finalized in the summer of 2003. The key recommendations of this audit

                                                                  24

were posted on the intemet, as a demonstrationof the Government's commitment to transparency.7
An action plan to implement these recommendationswas designedwith the support of the Bank,
which covered all measurescalled for by the auditor. The successfulimplementation of the action
plan epitomizes the Government's oil transparencyagenda.

55      This action plan includes negativepledgesto be maintained over a continued period of time
(e.g., no pre-financing or incurring of expenseson behalf of the State by SNPC and foreign oil
companies, no recourse to the payment par anticipation procedure, no new oil-collateralized
borrowing). Actions taken prior to June 30, 2004 include: (i) transfer of assetsof the refinery to
SNPC; (ii) preparation of an action plan for capacity building of the Hydrocarbons Unit at the
MOF; (iii) implementation of a new reporting system of the SNPC; (iv) acquisition of an
information management system; (v) appointment of auditors for the audit of the SNPC 2000
accounts,and of CORAF, the refinery; and (vi) elaboration of a plan to strengthenhuman resources
in SNPC, including staff in the environment unit. Actions to be taken in the coming six to nine
months include: (i) a study to model reservesand possible revenues;(ii) delivery of the final SNPC
and CORAF audit report; (iii) verification of the received statementspreparedby the partnersunder
the terms of the contract with SNPC - representing itself and representing the State; (iv)
verification of the costs of the past petroleum operations; (v) study for valorization of the past
petroleum assets;(vi) preparation of a procedural manual for each department/function of SNPC;
and (vii) reconciliation of cross debts between the SNPC and the State, taking the results into
accountin the Statebudget).

56      The proposed ERC would support the Government's efforts to improve management and
transparency in the sector, through the release of resources contingent on the satisfactory
implementation of the action plan.

        Improving Governance in the Forestry Sector


57      In the forestry sector, the proposed Credit will help pursue the dialogue and reforms that
were successfully initiated under the Post-Conflict Economic Recovery Credit (Report No. P-7467-
COB). In this context, the proposedcredit will help: (i) facilitate and follow up implementation of
the reforms outlined in the 2003 forest taxation study; (ii) improve coordination between the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry in chargeof Forestsin order to maximize government forestry
revenue and its transfer to the Treasury consistent with the principles of good public finance
management;(iii) certify forestry revenueby an audit company (as being done with oil revenues);
(iv) securelong term financing for the protection and management of forest resources; (v) move
forward with the modernization processof forest sectorinstitutions with an increasedfocus on their
public service functions; and (vi) expand the transparency agenda to cover allocation of forest
concessionsmore effectively and ensuremore competition.

        Improving Transparency in the Diamond Sector

58      The Congo has beenrecently suspendedfrom the diamond-traceability initiative, known as
the Kimberley ProcessCertification Scheme@PCS), becausethe authorities could not account for
a massive discrepancybetween rough diamond exports and diamond production and/or imports. As
stated in the Letter of Development Policy, the Government is committed to reintegrateKPCS and
plans to take the following corrective actions:

        Immediate strengtheningof the Mining Directorate to improve monitoring of domestic
        diamond producersand traceability of gems;

        Closing diamond buying offices which arenot in compliance with regulations;

        Restructuring the office in charge of granting Kimberley certification and firing corrupt
        officials; and

        Holding in Brazzaville, before September 2004 and at the Congo's expense,of a regional
        conferenceof diamond producing countries (the Republic of Congo, DRC, Angola, and the
        Central African Republic) whose agendawill include:

            +%How to betterimplement the KPCS recommendations;
            l3 How to harmonize duties on exported diamonds; and
            l3 How to combat fraud at the borders.

        Designing and Adopting a Public Investment Program in Support of Poverty Reduction


        In the aftermath of the conflict, and in the absenceof significant external assistance,the
tiovernment financed a substantial reconstruction program (through revenuesfrom the oil sector),
which played a critical role in the early recovery of the economy (aswell as for the stabilization of
the country). This program amounted to about US$950 million over tie years, with a focus on
housing and public buildings repairs (in particular in Brazzaville which had borne the brunt of the
fighting), and rehabilitation of transport infrastructure (including the Brazzaville - Pointe Noire
railroad, which is the country's lifeline link, river ports, and airports to accessisolated areas). Its
implementation was largely successful,asevidencedby the scopeof the repairs already completed.

60      Due to the urgency, however, and to the exceptional circumstancesin which this effort was
conducted,two major setsof issuesemerged:

     l  Issues related to the selection of investments.       In a context of limited resources, the
        selection of priority investments is particularly critical.        This selection should be
        underpinned by a solid economic and social analysis, but such analysis is often difficult to
        conduct in a volatile post-conflict environment where detailed information is scarce and
        populations are in flux. As the situation gets more stable, it is important to strengthenthe
        rationale for the choice of specific investments. In particular, public investment should be
        made explicitly pro-poor, pro-environment andmore participatory.

                                                              26


          Issues related to transparency in execution. For urgent expenditures,especially spending
          on public investment, the Government resortedto the paiement par anticipation procedure,
          in which SNPC or foreign oil companiesincur expenseson the Government's behalf, to be
          repaid later through reducedtax obligations. Regularization of the transaction by the Budget
          Office and the Treasury take place after they have been notified. In 2002, about 60% of the
          non-wage expendituresof "sovereignty" ministries were executedin this way. This practice
          has been discontinued in late 2002, but significant efforts are still necessaryto re-build
          effective procurement and contract management systemswhich have been disrupted by the


61        In the coming years, budgetary spending is expected to decrease from an average 32.2
percent of GDP during 2001 - 2003 to an average29.1 percent of GDP for 2004 - 2006. In this
context, domestically-financed capital spending is expectedto decline from an averageCFAF167
billion a year (about US$241 million) over 2000 - 2002, to CFAF120 billion, CFAF130 billion and
CFAF140 billion (about US$173 million, US$lSS million, and US$202 million)* in 2004, 2005,
and 2006, respectively. In this context, it is of particular importance to ensurethe most effective
use of available resources,to help foster private-led growth and resume or improve delivery of key
infrastructure and social services. This will require both the gradual shifting of expenditure away
from the security sector, and the design and adoption of a soundpublic investment program (which
is also critical to provide a framework for donor assistance- and ensurethat the limited amount of
external supportwhich could be made available is effectively targetedtowards priority areas).

62        The proposed ERC would support the Government's efforts to design and adopt such a
soundpublic investment plan, which should in particular: (i) be consistent with fiscal discipline; (ii)
set levels of priorities to accommodate different levels of funding (which could vary with oil
prices); (iii) support clear and realistic strategic objectives to help foster growth and deliver basic
services,with a focus on the poorest and their participation in project selection and implementation;
(iv) respectthe environment; and (v) be framed within the context of a medium-term framework to
ensurethe availability of sufficient resourcesfor operationsandmaintenance.

63.       To attain theseobjectives, the authorities intend to conduct comprehensive audits of: (i) the
current investment procedures and (ii) the investment portfolio itself and on that basis a detailed
action plan for reform will be prepared, with a view to improving project preparation, costing,
execution and financial management. Both would be published on the Government website.

64        At the same time, and beginning immediately, the Ministry of Planning, the De'Zbgation
Gkzkrale des Grands Travaux (DGGT), and all ministries will be required to report on the physical
and financial execution of their projects. A specific objective of thesereports should be to properly
cost all projects and define their execution periods so that the projects can be properly budgeted(in
terms of program authorizations and annual spendingceilings).

65.       IDA will contribute to this processwith a thorough review of the current PIP.

          Designing a Plan to SettleDomestic Arrears, to Ensure the Highest PossibleImpact on
          Economic Growth for a Given Amount of ResourcesAvailable


66        The issue of domestic debt,which was estimatedat nearly US$l .l billion (CFAF557 billion)
at end-2003, i.e. about 23 percent of GDP (excluding debt owed to the banking sector and public
sectorentities), is a double burden:

      l   For the Government, which is struggling with thesecommitments - particularly since about
          half of the total stock (CFAF238 billion) correspondsto salary and pension arrears,which
          are particularly important for the proper functioning of institutions, social stability, and
          poverty alleviation in a difficult post-conflict context.

      l   For the private sector. Resolving this issue is key both to the Government's suppliers (to
          return liquidity to their balance sheetsand therefore permit the resumption or development
          of their activities, which are critical for economic growth and employment) and more
          broadly to attract potential investorsby restoring the Government's credibility andremoving
          an i.mportantelementof uncertainty.

67.       In this context, the Government hasbeen struggling between reducing domestic and external
arrears- the former being critical for the stabilization and restart of the economy, the latter for the
normalization of relations with developmentpartners. In 2001 and 2002, it focusedon the clearance
of external arrearswith the World Bank and the IMF. In 2003, it allocated almost all of the year's
windfall oil revenues to settling domestic arrears,missing a chance to reduce external arrearsand
causing concern among its external creditors. As the situation improves, and within the overall
context of the move towards HIPC, the Government needs to adopt an overall strategy, which is
part of a broaderpublic debt reduction approachandis acceptableto Congo's developmentpartners,
to deal with the issue of domestic debt in an orderly, systematic, andtransparentmanner.

68        The proposed ERC would support such efforts along the lines used in neighboring DRC
(Report No. 27720): (i) audit creditors' claims, to reconcile the domestic debt figures between the
Government and creditors; (ii) negotiate the clearance of arrears with groups of comparable
creditors, including a discount rate (which should be close to that expected under the Enhanced
HIPC initiative, aswas done for similar domestic debt processin neighboring countries), clearance
mechanisms(possibly including securitization at concessionalterms) and payment modalities with a
view to ensuring equality of treatment (although priority could be given to those entities most likely
to reinvest proceeds from the debt payments into the local economy, typically firms which are still
in existence); (iii) carry out the corresponding arrears clearance operations; and (iv) establish
mechanismsto prevent the accumulation of new payment arrears. 9

9  Several independent    audits have been undertaken of domestic arrears over the last few years.        Arrears to commercial   suppliers
(generally referred to as domestic commercial      debt by the Congolese authorities)   as of December    1999 were estimated by external
auditors of international  standing to amount to CFAF233.6     billion for 43 14 creditors, and the results incorporated   into a data base.
Similar audits have been undertaken,    by different   auditors for arrears accumulated   during the years 2000, 2001, and 2002 and are
estimated to amount      to about CFAF32     billion  in gross terms, of which     about CFAF3     billion  pertain to investment    budget
transactions. Arrears   as of 2003 have yet to be audited. There are also large so-called       social arrears.   For civil  servants, these
estimated to amount to 24 months of salaries for the years 1992-1999,          are estimated to amount to about CFAF19 1 billion.         In
addition, arrears to public enterprises employees   (salaries and termination benefits), parliamentarians  and others parties are estimated
to amount to about CFAF47 billion.

                IV .    STRUCTURE OF THE CREDIT AND DISBURSEMENT

A .     OBJECTIVES AND STRUCTURE OF THE CREDIT

69      The credit is aimed at supporting the Government's continued efforts towards stability and
economic recovery, and in particular to allow for the maximization of resourcesavailable to that
effect.  It focuses selectively on three issues which are central to the country's development
prospects and have been at the core of the efforts of the last years (and of the dialogue with
development partners): (i) helping to improve management of, and transparencyin the oil sector,
which is a critical source of revenues;(ii) assisting in the design and adoption of a sound public
investment program, to permit an effective use of available resources in support of economic
growth and social services delivery; and (iii) contributing to the resolution of the domestic debt
issue,both to facilitate accessto HIPC and to remove a critical obstacleto private sectorrecovery.

70      The proposed credit, in an amount of SDR 20.5 million, consistsof two tranches.The two
tranche approachensuresadequateIDA's leverageovertime andhelps prevent the financing by IDA
resourcesof external arrears.The credit is on standardIDA terms with 40 yearsmaturity and a lo-
year graceperiod. It is expectedto be implemented over about 18 months.

B.      INTEGRATION     WITHIN   THE OVERALL DONOR SUPPORT EFFORTS

71      The proposed ERC builds on the Bank's experience in Congo since its re-engagementin
20bl. In particular, it follows on an earlier and successful budget support operation, the US$37.1
million   Post-conflict Economic Recovery Credit, which was approved in July 2001, and
satisfactorily implemented. It also reflects the lessons learned in managing a growing and active
portfolio of four projects (with no significant implementation issue).

72      The proposed ERC is also a critical component of the overall approach developed in the
Transitional Support Strategy, which was discussedby the Board 2003 (Report 26566-COB). This
strategy,which aims to help Congo escapethe "conflict trap", focuseson four key areas:

73.     Supporting job      creation through growth      and divers@ation      -   through: (i) the
implementation of ongoing economic reforms, (ii) the rebuilding of an adequate infrastructure
network to ensure connectivity and develop trade and export potential, (iii) the enhancing of
education andprofessional training, and (iv) supportto rural development:

     l  Helping enhance and reposition the public sector - by focusing on: (i) increased
        transparency in the oil sector, (ii) improved public resources management, and (iii)
        enhancedcapacity.

     l  Helping to mitigate short- and medium-term rish for social environment - by supporting :
        (i) ongoing demobilization and reintegration efforts for former combatantswithin the Multi-

       country Demobilization and ReintegrationProgram (MDRP) framework, and (ii) the fight
       againstHIV/AIDS.

    l  Assisting in increasing resourcesfor peace and development by:         (i) helping Congo to
       accessHIPC at an early stage,and (ii) helping to mobilize support from other donors aswell
       asthe IFC andMIGA, who currently haveno operationsin Congo.

74     The reform program supportedby the proposed credit is also closely coordinatedwith the
INIF, within the context of the implementation of the January - June 2004 SMP and the ongoing
negotiation of a PRGF-supportedprogram for July 2004- June2007 (which is expectedto focus on
enhancedfiscal discipline and public expenditure management). The ERC would be an integral
element of the overall effort to support this program, both through the measuresit focuseson and
through the financial resourcesit is making available to finance essentialimports.

75     The proposedERC would be implemented in a context of gradually increasing interest from
the donor community, as external arrearsarebeing clearedand economic performance is improving.
Such support, which was discussedat a successful donor meeting, held in July 2003 in Paris (and
chaired by the Bank), is expected to translate into stronger financial assistanceonce the PRGF is
approved and relations with Paris Club creditors are normalized. In order to build on the current
momentum, a further donor meeting is scheduledfor September2004.

76     In summary, the proposedERC is a key, albeit small, building block for the normalization of
the Republic of Congo's relations with its external creditors, which is indispensable in the fight  _
againstpoverty andthe diversification of the economy away from oil over the next two decades.


C a    LESSONS LEARNED IN OTHER POST-CONFLICT            COUNTRIES

77     The proposedERC reflects both lessons learned in other post-conflict countries and recent
DEC research.Such lessons and researchindeed suggestseveral key elements, which were taken
into accountin the design of this operation:

       The importance of timely resource transfers to meet essential needs. The availability of
       sufficient resources for the Government to face its basic obligations, vis-a-vis both its
       externalpartners and its population, has proven key to the successof post-conflict recovery.
       Donor support in this context is critical, once a commitment to responsiblemanagementhas
       beendemonstrated.Such support has often a disproportionate impact as it provides the little
       room neededfor the Government to maneuver towards peace and stability, as illustrated by
       the earlier experience in Congo, as well as by similar operations in countries such as
       Burundi or DRC.

    l  The needfor focus and selectivity. In a context of competing priorities, and urgent calls to
       tackle emergency needs and take critical measures, it is particularly important for the
       Government to focus its actions on a small set of areas where they can have a
       disproportionate impact.     This is particularly true when the conflict has resulted in a
       weakening of administrative capacity - and when there are only a limited number of
       decision-makers and public officials to implement complex programs. Bank assistancein

                                                 30

       such contexts has proven most effective when highly selective and focused on those areas
       which aremost critical for the country's sustainablerecovery.

   l   The importance of simplicity in design. Simplicity of design is key to successin the post-
       conflict context, where projects and economicprograms have to be implemented in a highly
       complex political and social environment. Best practices recommend to avoid overly an
       ambitious agendaand to selectimplementation arrangementsthat will minimize the number
       of hurdles.

78     Researchand experience(in addition to the analysisof the country's situation) also informed
the selection of areasof focus for the operation:

    0  The role of natural resources. The role of natural resourcesin conflict (the so-called "curse
       of natural resources") and the importance of sound governance and transparencyin these
       sectorshave been amply demonstrated. Experience shows that while tackling theseissuesis
       a difficult effort which needsto be sustainedover time, early action is critical, both to take
       advantageof the opportunities for reform that immediately follow a conflict, and to send a
       critical signal to all parties involved. In the case of Congo, most observers agree on the
       importance of transparentmanagementof the sector not only to increasethe Government's
       revenues,but also to prevent the emergenceof political and social frustrations which could
       causea fall back into conflict.

    l  The key elements of sustainable economic recovery. Post-conflict economies tend to
       register high levels of economic growth in the immediate aftermath of the war, as people
       restart consuming, trading, and investing. The challenge, however, is to sustain this growth
       over time (in the context of Congo, in particular in the non-oil sector), so as to catch up with
       the losses of the years of conflict. While constraints are specific to each country, typical
       obstaclesto the sustainablerestart of economic activity include the collapse of infrastructure
       (in particular transport and power), which in turn calls for major public investments,and the
       lack of working capital for the domestic private sector (as foreign investors tend to go
       through a wait-and-see period before re-engaging), which is often compounded by large
       stocks of arrearson government debt. Theseobstaclesareparticularly obvious in the caseof
       Congo, and create a particular risk in a context of very high unemployment, especially
       among the youth.

                 Borrower, following a transparentcompetitive selection process satisfactory
                 to the Association, to effect payment to entitled domestic creditors pursuant
                 to the agreementset forth in the sub-paragraphabove.

                                                  32

80      In addition, generalconditions for the releaseof any tranche arethat IDA shouldbe satisfied
that (a) the macroeconomic framework for growth and poverty reduction is acceptable,on the basis
of indicators agreedwith the borrower; and (b) that satisfactory progresshas been achieved in the
implementation of the Program.

E .     DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES AND IMPLEMENTATION             ARRANGEMENTS

81      The Borrower will be represented by the Minister of Economy, Finance, and Budget
(GEFB). Upon approval of the proposedERC, MEFB will open an account at the regional Central
Bank, the "Banque des Etats de Z'Afrique Centrale (BEAC). At the request of MEFB, IDA will
deposit the proceeds of each tranche in the Government's account at the BEAC.                   IDA
disbursements will not be linked to specific purchasesand, hence, there will be no procurement
requirements. The MEFB account will be subject to regular audits, at least on an annualbasis, by
auditors acceptableto IDA.

82      To facilitate the implementation of the reforms supported under the proposed ERC, the
Government will strengthen the existing committee in the MEFB in charge of monitoring and
following up economic reforms. On July 23, 2004, the Government appointed a high level official
in the Ministry of Finance to coordinate and supervisethe implementation of the credit. Support
will be available from the Bank-financed Governanceand Transparency Capacity Building Project
to strengthen the committee as may be needed. The reform program will be reviewed by the
Government in close coordination with regular IDA and IMF missions to ensure continued
implementation of reforms within a soundmacroeconomic framework.


F l     ENVIRONMENTAL      ASPECTS

83      The operation does not trigger environmental and social safeguards. It must be noted,
however, that through enhancedtransparency and governancein the oil and forestry sectors, the
operation is expectedto result in better protection of the environment. Furthermore, as part of the
reform of the public investment program reform to be supportedby the Credit, environmental and
social sustainability areexpectedto figure prominently among the criteria of project selection.

G   l   BENEFITS AND R&s

Benefits

84      Engaging in a post-conflict environment is often a high-risk, high-gain proposition, where
the risks of actions have to be balanced not only with potential benefits, but also with the risks of
inaction which are considerable. In the case of the proposed ERC, the expected benefits largely
outweigh the existing risks as they may have a disproportionate impact on the country's
stabilization and recovery prospects, in particular by improving management of the critical oil
sector and facilitating accessto HIPC. ERC would do so by financial part of essential imports so
helping to reducethe financial gap, but most importantly, given the relatively modest credit amount,
through its catalytic effect, i.e., the positive signals ERC would give to Congo's creditors.
Subsequentbenefits would include the consolidation of the still fragile reconciliation and recovery
process, and more broadly the escape from the cycle of recurring conflicts it has gone through

                                                   33

during the 1990s.Conversely, without ERC, the likelihood of a PRGF arrangementand subsequent
settlementwith Paris Club creditors and accessto HIPC would be considerably lower. Congowould
likely not escapethe conflict trap, and its economy would not grow fast enoughto allow significant
reduction in poverty.

85.     The ERC is expectedto foster progresstowards thesegoalsby:

    l   Further improving transparencyin the highly visible oil sector,through further audits of the
        accountsof the oil company (SNPC) andthe refinery (CORAF), certification of costs stated
       by oil companies and of government oil revenue, and other measures. While improved
        transparency is a virtue in itself, it will also contribute to checking fraud and protecting
        government oil revenue. It is also expected to foster trust of government among the
       population, a key benefit in a post-conflict environment, while strengthening government
        credibility with foreign partnersand creditors, a key benefit in apre-HIPC environment.

    l   Enhancing the quality of public investment by making it more conducive to sustainable
        development, more pro-poor, while improving its execution and ensuring consistency with
        fiscal discipline in order to keep the budget deficit at a sustainablelevel, thus increasing the
        likelihood of satisfactory implementation of the PRGF arrangementand accessto HIPC.

  .  l  Improving the managementof public debt, and in particular of the domestic debt, which is
        key to improving business conditions and government credit, as well as to restore the
        Government's credibility with its external creditors andnormalize its relations with them (in
        turn a critical elementof a successfulapproachtowards HIPC).

        Providing the Government with the financial resourcesneededto help reduce the financing
        gap for the economic program in 2004 and 2005, and hence increasing the likelihood of
        successfulimplementation of this program (to be supportedunder the PRGF) and of an early
        accessto HIPC.

Risks


86      In view of experience to date, the key existing risks to this operation are manageable,
through mitigating arrangementsthat are already largely in place. Theserisks include:

     l  Political or social instability.   The success of the economic program supported by the
        proposed ERC rests on the continued stability of the political and social environment in
        which it is implemented. In view of Congo's recent history, the risk of renewed violence in
        localized areascannot be entirely excluded - but, if contained, suchviolence is not expected
        to have a significant impact on implementation of the ERC. The risk of relapseinto conflict
        is assessedby most observ.ersas relatively low in the short-term       - and is expected to be
        further reducedthrough implem.entationof the ERC, and eventual accessto HIPC.

     l  Weakenedimplementation capacity. A decadeof conflict and of hiring and salary freeze in
        the public     sector have compromised administrative          capacity and could threaten

                                                 34

       implementation of the economic program supportedunder the ERC. This risk is, however,
       mitigated by both the relatively simple design of the operation and its focus on a selective
       set of critical measuresand the appointment of a monitoring and follow-up team in MEFB.
       It will be further mitigated during implementation through intensive implementation support
       and the provision of institutional assistanceas may be needed under other, existing IDA
       credits. It should be underlined that fiduciary aspects of project management has been
       satisfactory to dateon all Bank-financed projects since the re-engagementin 2001.

       Volatility of oil prices. This is a significant risk for a country which derives about 70
       percent of governmentrevenuefrom oil. Congo hasbenefited from high oil prices in recent
       years, but has suffered before and could suffer again from lower oil prices. This risk,
       however, is partly addressed through the choice of a relatively             short proposed
       implementation period of the ERC (18 months), during which current forecasts predict a
       high probability of continued relatively high prices. In any event, the Government has
       adopted a strategy of setting a core spendingprogram basedon a "normal" oil price, and a
       supplemental one,consisting of relatively lower priority spending,to be implemented only if
       the oil price remains abovethe "normal" level for a certainperiod of time.

       Difficulties on the reform path. Constituencies with strong vested interests in the current
       system remain active in Congo, in the public as well as the private sector. This could result
       in taking the adoption of somekey measuresdifficult, in particular in the oil sector and for
       settling domestic arrears. Experience,however, is encouragingas the implementation of the
       economic program (and in particular of the first phase of the oil sector action plan) is
       satisfactory - and as thereis a strong commitment to maintain a solid economic performance
       in the coming period at the highest level of Government. To mitigate this risk, IDA is
       promoting an intensive dialogue with non-government stakeholders,notably in the area of
       transparencyin the oil sector. It will also provide intensive implementation support as may
       be neededto overcome someobstacles.

   l   Failure to fill the financing gap. In casekey external creditors (e.g., Paris Club creditors)
       do not agreeto significant rescheduling of payments of arrears,including on post-cut off
       date arrears,the financing gap would be too large, jeopardizing successful implementation
       of the ERC, and beyond the ERC, prospectsfor growth, poverty reduction and orderly debt
       service. This risk is partially mitigated by the inclusion in effectiveness conditions of the
       requirement that the macroeconomic situation remains satisfactory to IDA.

                             LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY


        Introduction
1.     Congo is a post-conflict country that has experiencedseveral civil wars that have disrupted
its economy, weakened its institutions and undermined the rule of law. The signing of peace
agreementswith armed groups in 1999 and 2003, and further progress towards consolidation of
peaceand democratization of political life in 2002 enabledthe Government to initiate an economic
and social program focused on poverty reduction, higher economic growth, improved transparency
andgood governance,aswell asthe enhancementof human and institutional capacities.

2       Poverty reduction is central to the Government's development strategy as set out in the
interim Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper(I-PRSP).

3       To effectively attack poverty, the Government is seeking the support of the international
communit. In particular, it is asking the International Development Association (IDA) for support in
the form of an Economic Recovery Credit of USD 30 million in order to finance its economic
program for 2004 and 2005 in general, and in particular to: (i) improve transparency in the
petroleum sector; (ii) enhance public expenditure management through the establishment ,of a
rational program of public investment; (iii) reduce government domestic arrearsin an orderly and
transparentmanner.

4       This Letter of Development Policy is fully consistent with the I-PRSP. It deals with each of
the following topics in turn:

            a. preparationof the poverty reduction strategy;
            b. the macroeconomic andbudgetary framework;
            c. transparencyand good governance;
            d. public debt;
            e. thepublic investment program; and
            f. sectoralpolicies.

5.      Good implementation of measures included in this LDP will help the Congo economy
recover.

        I.      Poverty reduction strategy

        11
         l      Background and Objectives


6      The Government is determined to intensify its poverty reduction efforts. The Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper defines five priority strategic themes, namely: (i) promotion of good
governanceand consolidation of the macroeconomic framework; (ii) promotion of key sectorsand
resumption of socio-economic development; (iii) access to basic social services and social
protection; (iv) infrastructure development; and (v) intensification of efforts to combatHIV/AIDS.

        12.     Achievements

7.     In connection with the preparation of the I-PRSP, several activities have thus far been
organized. The two policy-making and steering entities, i.e., the National Committee on Poverty
Reduction (Comite National de Lutte contre la Pauvrete, CNLP) and its Permanent Technical
Secretariat,have been set up. Eleven (11) thematic groups have also been establishedin order to
refine the poverty diagnostic and the content of strategic themes.Members of the thematic groups
have been chosen from the civil service, civil society and the private sector, with the most recent
participatory sectoral consultations taking place in April 2004. At the regional level, Departmental
Poverty Reduction Committees (Comites Departementaux de Lutte contre la Pauvrete) were
installed in the country's ten departements and participatory consultations took place in each
departementin June2003.


8      In addition, the Government conducted a Household Survey (Enquete congolaise aupresdes
menages,ECOM), for which the survey baseis currently being updated.

        130     Actions to be carried out.

9.     Actions that will lead to the finalization of the PRSP include:

            a. Finalization of the I-PRSP;
           b. Poverty survey;
            c. Organization of workshops on the strategy's monitoring and evaluation indicators;
            d. Organization of capacity-building workshops in the areas of decentralization and
                genderissues;
            e. Continuation and enhancementof popular consultations in order to ensurenational
                ownership of the document;
            f.  Assessmentof the impact of external debt reduction;
            g. Production of the final PRSP on the basis of all of the aforementioned contributions.

         II 0    Macroeconomic and budgetary framework


10      The Government is trying to enhancethe short- and medium-term economic and financial
framework in order to achieve the goal of healthy and sustainablegrowth that would make poverty
reduction possible. The challengesto poverty reduction includes not only high rates of economic
growth, but also pro-poor budgetsand appropriatestructural and sectoralpolicies.

11      In 2003, the Government's efforts resulted in a 6.5 percent increase,in real terms, in non-
petroleum GDP. However, due to a 7.6 percent decline in petroleum production, the overall growth
rate fell to 1.3 percent, comparedto the 4.6 percent recordedin 2002. Inflation, asmeasuredby the
household consumer price index, was better controlled, dropping from 3 percent in 2002 to 1.7
percentin 2003.

12      The balance of payments slightly improved in 2003, asthe current accountdeficit declined to
0.; percent of GDP, from 0.3 percentof GDP in 2002.

13      Public finance too, improved in 2003. Revenues increasedby 2.7 percent to 30.1 percent of
GDP, compared to 27.4 percent in 2002, while         expenditures and net lending declined to 29.7
percent of GDP, versus 35.5 percent of GDP in 2002. In sum, despite a difficult economic
environment, the Government's efforts to control public finance have improved the primary surplus,
which rose to 6.8 percent of GDP from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2002, while the overall deficit on a
commitment basis improved from an 8.1 percent of GDP deficit in 2002 to a 0.4 percent of GDP
surplusin 2003.

14      The Government has set the following goals for the 2004-2005period: a GDP growth rate of
4.2 percent in real terms for 2004 and 8.6 percent for 2005. The Government is anticipating 3.0
percent growth in petroleum GDP in 2004 and 16.4 percent in 2005 (with the coming on streamof
the Boundi oilfields), aswell asgrowth in non-oil GDP of 4.8 percentin both 2004 and 2005.

15      The Government intends to mobilize as much internal resources as possible in order to
achieve in 2004 a primary budget balance of 7.1 percent of GDP. Budget policy is geared to
increasing non-oil revenues,which are expected to represent 19.4 percent of non-oil GDP by the
year 2007, thanks to an expandedtax base,improved tax collection andtighter expenditurecontrols.
The external current account balancewould show a small surplus of 0.1 percentof GDP.

         III a   Improving Transparency and Governance


         111.1 Improving Transparency in the Oil Sector


         111.1.1Background
16      Oil plays a crucial role in the country's economy and accounts for over 65 percent of the
State'sresources. Oil activity took off in the early 1970s. Crude oil production rose from 2 million
tons in 1974 to 5.6 million tones in 1986, and then to 10 million tones in 1996, 13 million tons in

                                                  40

1999 and 11. 2 million tons in 2003, and production could increasestill further over the next few
yearswith the coming on streamof new oilfields.

       111.1.2 Goals


17    The Government intends to ensure greater transparency and good governance,as well as
greaterefficiency in exploration, production, marketing andin the collection of oil revenues.

       111.1.3Achievements

18     For the past ten years, and more specifically since the end of the armed conflict, the
Congolese government been engagedin a far-reaching plan to reform the oil sectorwith a view to
maximize its contribution to economic and social development.

19.   In this connection, the following measureshave beentaken:

           a. Approval in 1994 of the Hydrocarbons Code, which sets out the system of
               production-sharing contracts which favorably replaced the earlier concessioning
               arrangements;
           b. Privatization of the downstream sector;
           c. Establishing in 1998 of the national oil company Socie'te'Nationale desP&roles du
               Congo (SNPC);
           d. A convention between SNPC and the State, dated June 29, 2001, delineating the
               respectivepertaining to the holding and managementby former of thelatter's rights,
               assetsand equity in the oil sector;
           e. The passing of a law (February 13, 2003) on oil sub-contracting and other texts on
               the privatization of the downstream sector.

20   These arrangementswere supplemented in late 2002 by the implementation of a policy of
transparencyin the managementof this sectorthrough:

           a. the centralization of all of the State's petroleum revenueswithin the Public Treasury;
           b. the audit of the SNPC's accounts for fiscal years 1999-2001, which generated
               numerous recommendations. An action plan to put these recommendations into
               practice was drawn up with the help of the World Bank and is now being
               implemented (seeAnnex);
           c. the establishment in April 2003 of a Hydrocarbons Unit within the Ministry of
               Economy, Finance and Budget to better monitor the State'sfiscal revenuesfrom oil;
           d. the certification, by an internationally reputed firm, that all oil revenue owed to the
               CongoleseStatehas beencollected by the Public Treasury;
           e. The internet posting, at wwwcongo-site.com,          of essential information on the
               managementof Congo's petroleum resources,including dataon:


                           1. production;

                                                    41

                             2. production-sharingcontracts;
                             3. the SNPC's accounts;
                             4. the SNPC's financial results;
                             5. financial operationscarriedout on behalf of the State;
                             6. the report of the SNPC audit and its accompanying recommendations;
                             7. certifications that oil revenue due to the State has been deposited in
                                the Public Treasury.

        111.1.4Actions to be carried out


21    In order to further enhanceefficiency and transparencyin the oil sector, the Government is
planning to take the following actions:

             a. Continue to implement the SNPC action plan (seeAnnex 2B), andparticularly of the
                following four measures:
                     i. Strengthening of the Hydrocarbons Unit within the Ministry of Economy,
                         Finance and Budget, in order to enablethis ministry to better control all fiscal
                         revenuesfrom petroleum;
                    ii. Reforming SNPC's accounting and analytical frameworks to conform to
                    ...  OHADA standardsandthoseprevailing in the oil industry;
                   111.  Preparing an oil asset valuation study to better estimate the country's oil
                         assetsas a whole, especially its hydrocarbonreservesand, thus, to make more
                         accurateprojections andbetter gaugethe longevity of thesereserves;
                    iv. Establishment of reporting documents that constitute an official record of
                         exchangesof information between SNPC, the Ministry of Hydrocarbons and
                         the Ministry of Finance.
             b. Continue the quarterly certification of oil revenues, in accordancewith the same
                specifications used in 2003;
             c. Carry out audits of SNPC's financesand accountsfor fiscal years 2002 and 2003;
             d. Publish the results of audits carried out in the oil sector; and
             e. Complete the privatization of the oil downstream sector.
             f. Congo's adherence to the Extractive Industries'              International Transparency
                Initiative.

        III.2   Transparency and Governance in the Mining Sector



22      The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) has been -established by rough
diamond producing and trading countries, together with the industry and civil society to prevent,
through a certification system, that `conflict diamonds' fuel armed conflicts and damagelegitimate
trade. In conformity with its new mining policy, the Statenow intervenes largely as a facilitator and
regulator. Within the framework of KPCS, the government intends to do the following:

             a. help artisan diamond producersto organize;
             b. reducerough diamond exports ;

                                                   42

             c. ensuretraceability of rough diamonds;
             d. establish an administrative unit to enforceKPCS; and
             e. enforce tax obligations of diamond buying offices.


23     After the suspensionof the Congo on July 9, 2004 from KPCS, His Excellency the President
of the Republic instructed the Governmentto reaffirm the country's commitment to be again part of
KPCS andto implement urgently the following plan of action:

    a. Increasing the budgetary allocation of the Mining Directorate by 100 millions de FCFA
        before end of August in order to improve monitoring of domestic diamond producers and
        traceability of gems;
    b. Closing diamond buying offices which do not meet establishmentrequirements;
    c. Restructuring the office in charge of granting Kimberbleycertification and firing corrupt
        officials; and
    d. Holding in Brazzaville, before September 2004 and at the Congo's expense,of a regional
        conference of diamond producing countries (the Republic of Congo, DRC, Angola, and the
        Central African Republic) whose agendawill include:

             +Z+How to betterimplement the KPCS recommendations;
             +:aHow to harmonize duties on exported diamonds; and
             +Z+How to combat fraud at the borders.

        IV. Public debt

        IV.1     Background
24.     For over two decades,Congo has been suffering from a heavy public debt burden, which is
now a major obstacleto the country's economic recovery.

25      Outstanding government debt was estimated as of April 30, 2004 at CFAF 4.417 billion, of
which CFAF 3.861 billion (or 87 percent of total) is due to external creditors and CFAF 556 billion
(or 13 percent of total) to domestic creditors. Paris Club creditors account for most of the debt (58
percent), followed by banks (19 percent) and multilateral creditors (10 percent). The ratio of
outstanding debt to GDP is above 200 percent, and per capita indebtednessis very high. Debt
service representsaboutone half of budget revenues.

26      The unsustainablelevel of external debt arrearsremains an obstacle to the normalization of
Congo's relations with its creditors. Arrears are estimated at nearly CFAF 2.920 billion, and have
led to the suspensionof disbursementsby most of the country's creditors.

27      It is thus urgent for the Congo to do everything possible to avail itself of the Debt Initiative
for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). In fact, failure to do so would seriously compromise
Congo's economic future. Access to HIPC would lighten the debt burden, help restart the economy
and reducepoverty. In this connection, the Government is therefore endeavoringto:

                                                  43

            a. come to an agreement with the IMF on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
                (PRGF) arrangement;
           b. remain currentin the service of its debt; and
            c. normalize relations with its main multilateral andbilateral creditors.

28     Domestic arrears are a serious obstacle to the resumption of economic activity, and it is
crucial that this be addressedimmediately in the context of the medium-term program to be agreed
upon with the international community andwith the IMF in particular.

        IV.2    Objectives
29     The Government's objective is to identify, with the help of the international community, the
debt service solutions that are most suitable and most likely to afford the Republic of Congo a
chanceto achievesustainableeconomic growth andpoverty reduction.

        IV.3 Achievements
30     The Government hasmade a greateffort to remain current on its non-reschedulabledebt, and
hasbegun to dischargeaccumulatedexternal arrearsvis-a-vis its multilateral creditors.

31.    Regarding domestic debt, the State has also decided to clear its domestic arrears. The main
objective of this operation is to restore the State's credibility with local businesses. Clearing of
domestic arrears must be based on a three-pronged approach, consisting of data collection,
validation andpayment.

32      With regardto data collection, several audits to assessthe debt in arrearshave been carried
out already, and an inventory of social arrears (i.e., salary and pension arrears owed to civil
servants,etc.) is underway. A payment plan was tested in previous years but unfortunately failed
due to lack of resources. This plan recommendedthe following approach:

            a. a down payment of CFAF 10 million to all creditors so as to cancel debts of lessthan
                CFAF 10million;
           b. application of a 50 percent discount to the post-audit amount;
            c. the issuanceof bonds for the balance, namely:
                    i. seven-year bonds bearing 3 percent interest for debts under CFAF 100
                       million;
                   ii. 15-year bonds bearing 3 percent interest for debts exceeding CFAF 100
                       million.

        IV.3 Actions to be carried out
33     To clear domestic arrears,the Government has adopted a broad strategy articulated around
threepillars, namely, data collection; validation; and clearance.

34     The approach envisagedby the authorities consistsof preparing a plan for the clearance of
domestic arrears with technical assistance from the World Bank. The Government pledges to

                                                  44

involve all stakeholdersso as to ensureconsensusand total transparencyregarding conception and
implem.entation.

35      This approachrequiresin particular:
  l




           a. that the accumulatedinternal arrearsbe identified;
           b. that a deadlinebe set,pastwhich national creditors may no longer:
                    i. ask that debtsbe included in the accumulatedinternal arrears;
                   ii. add to or alter debts the inclusion of which among the accumulated arrears
                      has alreadybeenrequested.
               This deadline shall be published in the official gazette,in the print media and via
               other meansof communication.
           c. that an agreementbe reachedwith creditors concerning debts representingat least 75
               percent of accumulated internal arrears, on the basis of one or more common
               reduction factors;
           d. that a local commercial bank be designatedas a result of a competitive procedure
               and in accordancewith transparentcriteria; and that said bank shall be responsible
               for making all payments to beneficiary creditors.

       V. Public Investment Program

        V.1 Background                                                              C

36     The civil wars of the 1990s causedmassive destruction of infrastructure, the cost of which
was estimatedat some CFAF 1,000billion. The Interim Post-Conflict Program (PIPC) put in place
for the 2000-2002 period enabled Congo to finance someof the reconstruction of infrastructure out
of its own resources. Financing of the reconstruction program suffered from lack of international
support, duemainly to the debt arrearssituation.

37      The volume of public investment financed out of State resources fluctuated from 10.1
percent of GDP in 2001 to 6.5 percent in 2003, excluding investments carried out through 2002 by
the petroleum companies on behalf of the State. Investments expenditures,as a percentageof State
revenues,amountedto about 30 percentin 2001 and22 percent in 2003.


38      But the post-conflict environment was not conducive to good quality investments. The
public expenditure review conducted with the help of the World Bank points up to weaknesses
throughout the expenditure chain, from project preparation to project execution, and from
monitoring and evaluation to contract award procedures.           The Government must establish
mechanisms that ensure transparency and proper management of State resources and of those
provided by external financing.

                                                      45



        v.2      Objectives

39.     The Government's objective is to make the Public Investment Program (PIP) a major
component in the reorganization of public expenditures. The PIP must in particular be in harmony
with the priorities of the poverty reduction strategy.

        v.3      Achievements

40      Within the context of the rehabilitation of the country's economic infrastructures, the
Government put in place an Interim Post-Conflict Program (Programme Int&imaire Post-Con@?,
PIPC) for the 2000-2002 period, and devoted considerable resourcesto it (i.e., about USD 950
million over two years). This program was devoted to housing and building repairs (especially in
Brazzaville where the most intense fighting took place) and to the rehabilitation of transportation
infrastructures (including the country's vital BrazzavilleLPointe-Noire railway link), river ports and
airports, with a view to improving access to remote regions. For lack of substantial external
contributions, however, the reconstruction work could not be carried out on the scale that would
have been required to ameliorate the damageinflicted by ten yearsof conflict andinstability.

41      The Government initiated a public expenditure review in July 2003 with assistanceof the
World Bank in order to better understandthe issues plaguing the system of public expenditure
management. More recently, in May 2004, a specific review of public investment expenditureswas
initiated andwill be supplementedwith sectoral diagnostics.

42.     The Government also beganin 2002 to reform the public procurement system,to clarify the
relationships among the various administrations, the State and the international financial
community, as well as between the State and its suppliers. An interministerial commission hasjust
been setup to pursuethis reform.

        V.4 Actions to be carried out

43.     The Government intends to take the following measures:
            a. Approval of an action and reform plan to improve the selection process of public
                 investments,and to enhancethe transparencyof their management,through:
                     i. consolidation of the execution of investment expenditures, particularly in
                          terms of the physical and financial monitoring of projects;
                    ii. strengtheningof decision-making capacities in the areaof public investment;
            b. Elaboration of a Three-Year Public Investment Program for the 2005-2007 period
                 that reflects the priorities of the I-PRSP;
            c. Continuation of the reform of government procurement to improve its transparency
                 and efficiency;
            d. Preparation of reports on the physical and financial execution of public investment
                 expendituresfor the year 2004;
            e. Monitoring of the environmental impact of the investment program.

      VI. Sectoral policies

      VI.1 Forestry sector

      VI.l.l   Background

44    After oil, the country's forest is its second most important resource. The Congolese forest
covers about 22 million hectares(FAO, 2003), 60 percentof which areproduction forests,about 14
percent protected areas, with the rest consisting of forests and grasslands belonging to rural
communities.     Congo has a substantial forestry potential, with a clear dichotomy between the
northern and southernparts of the country. The north hasvast and still largely unexploited forest in
which very selective cutting is aimed mainly at sapelli. In the south, which is more coastal and
more densely populated, okoume is the most commonly exploited -species (accounting for 58
percent of cuttings), and forestry resourcesappearto be quite degraded.

       VI.l.2 Objectives

45    The Government's overall goal is to ensuresustainablemanagement of forest ecosystemsin
the service of socio-economic development, conservation of biodiversity and stability of the
national and global environment. More precisely, the objectives include the following:
           a. Adopting and enforcing development plans for all commercial forests;
           b. Efforts to combat the illegal trade in bush meat, especially from protected species;
           c. Better management of forest ecosystemsthrough transparency in the issuance of
                permits, in the enforcement of laws and regulations pertaining to forest taxes, and in
                the imposition of penalties;
           d. Greatercontribution to Staterevenuesandto the well-being of the Congolesepeople.

       VI.l.3 Achievements

46    Congo's forestry policy is based on the sustainablemanagement of forest ecosystems.The
country often participates in a leadership capacity in several initiatives aimed at sustainable
management of Congo basin forests (e.g., the COMIFAC Convergence Plan, AFLEG, the Congo
Basin Partnership,etc.).

47    Starting in 2000 with the promulgation of a new Forestry Code, the forestry sector reform
program has been pursued with          assistance from the World Bank-financed Post-Conflict
Rehabilitation Credit (CREPC). These reforms are part of a sustainable approach to renewable
resourcemanagement. Institutional strengthening, improved governance and greatertransparency
were central to thesereforms, which recommended:

            a. a clarification of the respective roles of the public and private sectors in sectoral
                development;
            b. a refocusing of the administration on its functions of regulation, evaluation and
                oversight;

                                                   47

           c. development of a clear legal and institutional framework for delegating certain
              public service functions to the private sector (e.g., inventories, development, social
              facilities, infrastructure construction, etc.).

48     Within this framework, the Government consideredalternative tax reforms and took steps
beginning in 2003 to improve the control over, and volume of, financial flows in the sector.

       VI.l.4 Actions to be carried out

49.    The following actions areto be carried out in the sectorbv 2005:

            a. Resumption of the reform of forestry taxesbasedon the results of studiescarried out
              under the Post-Conflict Economic Rehabilitation Credit (CREPC);
           b. Expansion of management plans for forests, including those in the southernpart of
              the country;
            c. Certification of forest revenues,asis donein the oil sector;
            d. Harmonization of the responsibilities of the Ministries of Forestry and Finance in the
               areaof forest taxation.

       VI.2 Anti-fraud and anti-corruption efforts

       VI.2.1 Background

50    Fraud and corruption intensified during and after the civil wars, but the Government is
determined to combat them. A national plan for the prevention of fraud and corruption is being
developed.

       VI.2.2 Objectives

51.   The objectives of this plan areto:

            a. Strengthenthe national system for the prevention, detection and combating of fraud
               and corruption;
            b. Inspire total commitment and involvement on the part of major stakeholders(e.g.,
               Parliament, Government, administration, civil society, private sector, etc.) in the
               fight againstcorruption and fraud;
            c. Enhance regional and international cooperation in the area of anti-corruption and
               anti-fraud efforts, particularly regardinginternational commercial transactions.

                                                    48



          VI.2.3 Achievements

   52     The Government has establishedthe Ministry of State Control directly under the authority of
   the President of the Republic to coordinate anti-corruption and anti-fraud activities at the national
   level.


.  53     In order to sensitize the national and international community to the phenomenon, the
   Government organized a workshop from December 11 to 13, 2003 on the topic of corruption and
   fraud. The workshop's conclusions and recommendations laid the groundwork for the preparation
   of a national anti-fraud and anti-corruption plan that is receiving technical assistancefrom the
   UNDP.

   54      In the area of capacity-building, officers of the National Fraud and Corruption Prevention
   Committee have participated in study trips and exchanges of ideas in Kinshasa, Democratic
   Republic of Congo.

          VI.2.4 Actions to be carried out

   55     The draft national plan to combat corruption and fraud is to be considered soon by the
   Council of Ministers. The Government is working in close collaboration with the Cairo-based
   Administrative Control Authority (ACA), and plans to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with
   that organization soon. More precisely, the following activities areto be carried out:
               a. publication of the survey results on perceptionsof corruption and fraud;
               b. launchi.ngof an outreachcampaign on corruption and fraud.

          VI.3 Civil service reform

          VI.3.1 Background

   56     The Congolese civil service faces many problems. It is simultaneously too large and aging.
   It cannot absorb the large numbers of young graduateswho flood the job market. Several ills are
   ascribed to it, including cumbersome administrative circuits, failure to observe administrative
   procedures,and unequal treatment, in terms of salaries,of employees in different State employment
   streams. Reforms aretherefore neededto make the civil services a true instrument of development.
   Thesereforms pertain to the following areas:

               a. staff recruitment;
               b. promotions, reclassifications and administrative reviews;
               c. availability and secondmentassignments;
               d. retirement.

                                                  49



        VI.3.2 Objectives

57.    Civil servicereform aims to, among other things, the following:

               Improvement of administrative proceduresin accordancewith Law No. 021/89 dated
               November 14, 1999concerningthe reorganizationof the civil service;
            b. Improved collaboration among administrations involved in personnelmanagement;
            c. Computerization of the civil service rolls in order to better monitor the careerpaths
               of civil servants;
            d. Proper management of the merged salary/civil service rolls, using appropriate
               computer tools;
            e. reduction of salary inequalities in the various Stateemployment streams.

        VI.3.3 Achievements

58      Severalcensuseshave been conductedto get an idea of the sizeof the civil service. The last
one was conductedin 1999. A project to establish a single salary/civil service roll was submitted to
the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget for execution. The Government is currently
recruiting about 3,500 officers in the social sectors(i.e., health, education and social welfare.)

        VI.3.4 Actions to be carried out

59.     To reform the civil service,the Government is planning to take the following measures:
            a. reorganization of the civil servicerolls;
            b. complete computerization of the civil service;
            c. establishmentof a single salary/civil serviceroll;
            d. changein the mode of recruitment (to a competitive procedure);
            e. counting of all civil and military agentsat their duty stations;
            f. implementation of an incentive program to encouragevoluntary departuresand early
               retirements from the civil service.

        VI.4 Private sector development

        VI.4.1 Background

60      Over the last few years, the private sector has suffered enormously from the conflicts that
have devastated the country. In addition, this sector has evolved in an environment strongly
dominated by:

            a. the absenceof regulations conducive to development of the informal sector;
            b. high taxes;
            c. irregular payment of government domestic debt;
            d. the lack of basic infrastructures, particularly roads and energy;
            e. difficult accessto credit.

                                                   50



        VI.4.2 Objectives

61      The Government's objective is to make the private sector the main engine of economic
growth. It is aware of Congo's excessivereliance upon petroleum and is determinedto reduceit by
fostering economic diversification. The Government feels that, with the restoration of civil peace,
the rehabilitation of infrastructure, a suitable macroeconomic framework (including moderate
inflation and a stable exchangerate), a business-friendly incentive system (particularly lower taxes),
a more effective public investment and a completely privatized banking sector, growth in the non-
oil sector will be considerably stronger in years to come. Growth and job creation will be found
mainly at the level of the SMEs and SMIs, which the Government intends to promote actively.

        VI.4.3 Achievements


62 .    The Government has thus far carried out:

            a. The consolidation of the macroeconomicframework;
           b. the privatization of commercial banks;
            c. the establishmentof a centerfor businessregistration, and of a single window for the
                formalities of businesscreation;
            d. approval in 1999, by Congo and other CAEMC countries, of a common investment
                charter that provides a generalframework for promoting businessat the sub-regional
                level;
            e. the promulgation in 2003 of a national investment charter;
            f. the approval and promulgation of sectoral codes and legal texts (notably in mining,
                forestry, water, electricity, andhydrocarbons);
            g.  the development of telecommunications systems and new information                 and
                communications technologies (NICT).

        VI.4.4 Actions to be carried out


63 .    The Government intends to carry out the following actions:

       VI.5 Agriculture, livestock and fisheries sector

       VI.5.1 Background

64     Despite this sector's enormous potential, the subsistencecrops sub-sectoris not expanding
faster than population, while the performance of the cash crops sub-sector is even more
problematic. This has resultedin large food imports, in excessof CFAF 100 billion per year.  Since
1998, the Government has been implementing, with help from the FAO, a Special Program for
Food Security (SPFS), which was launched by the FAO in 1994 to help low-income food deficit
countries (LIFDC) improve food security by increasing and diversifying agricultural production.

       VI.5.2 Objectives

65.    In agriculture, the Government aims to achieve the following objectives:

            a. Adopting and achieving agricultural policies, regarding investment, credit and
                commercialization;
           b. Strengtheningof decentralizedstructures and enhancementof the capacity to support
                farmers, including in credit and marketing;
            c. Analysis of constraints,with a view to fostering sustainableproduction increases;
            d. Diversification of production through the promotion of small livestock operations
                (e.g., sheep, goats, pigs, poultry, etc.), fish farming and agricultural product
                processing;
            e. Improving irrigation to encouragerice production, fish farming and dry seasoncrops.

       VI.5.3 Achievements

66     The above-mentionedSpecial Food Security Program (SFSP) is underway with support from
the FAO. In addition, the Government launched an emergency agricultural recovery program in
June 2003 in order to better gaugethe extent of agricultural problems and identify the meansto re-
start agricultural production.

       VI.5.4 Actions to be carried out

67.    As part of the recovery program, the Government intends to take severalactions, including:

            a. Restarting of subsistenceagriculture, and crops for export;
           b. Implementation of the national transportation plan;
           c. Creation of a fund to support agricultural development;
           d. Monitoring andevaluation of cropping seasons.

       VI.6 Industrial sector

       VI.6.1 Background

68.    Although previously a good performer, Congo's industrial sector has deteriorated over the
years. Its contribution to GDP at current prices, was 8 percent prior to 1997, 4.5 percent in 2001
and 5.2 percent in 2002. It was estimatedat 5.9 percentin 2003.

       VI.6.2 Objectives

69.    The recovery of the industrial sectoris being carried out on the basis of a strategythat relies
on the private sectorto drive economic growth. The aim is to stimulate production in sub-sectorsin
which the country has a comparative advantage,notably:

            a. agribusiness;
            b. lumber;
            c. building materials;
            d. the metallurgical, metal-working, mechanical, electrical and electronic production
                streams;
            e. themicals andpetroleum derivatives.

        VI.6.3 Achievements

70      In 1999, Congo approved, along with all other CEMAC countries, the joint charter and
supplemented it in 2003 with the national investment charter, rationalizing tax exemptions. In
parallel, the corporate tax rate has been reduced. In addition, specific codes dealing with forestry,
water, electricity, and mining were published. Proceduresto establish new businesseshave been
greatly simplified.

        VI.6.4 Actions to be carried out

71.    The recovery of the industrial sector is to be achievedthrough the promotion of the above-
mentioned sub-sectorsin which the country is competitive.

72     The Government notably intends to promote small and medium enterprises(SMEs). A law
granting proper incentives to SMEs and handicrafts is expectedto be approved soon.

        VI.7.1.2 Objectives

75.    The objectives being pursuedarethe following:

            a. Development of the potential of the mining sector;
            b. Expansion of researchandprospection;
            c. Putting in place adequateincentives to encourageprivate investment in mining.

        VI.7.1.3 Achievements

76     Since 1993, the Government has been trying to improve knowledge of mining resources(by
means of cartography, geological surveys, reconnaissanceof drilling sites, etc.), but financial
constraintshave prevented concrete action from being taken. It is worth noting, however, that the
firm Semi Congo hasbegun exploitation of a gold vein in the dbpartementof Sangha.

        VI.7.1.4 Actions to be carried out

77.    Actions to be carried out pertain to:

            a. The establishmentof a basic geological infrastructure;
            b. Studies of the bituminous sandstoneof Lake Kitina, of gypsum on the coastalplain
                andof peat on Mbamou Island;
            c. The establishmentof a laboratory for geological assays;
            d. Prospecting for potassic salts;
            e. The organization of gold pannersand other artisanal operatorsin the mining sector.

       VI.7.2 Energy

        VI.7.2.1 Background

78.    Current constraintsin the electricity sectorareessentially relatedto:

            a. Damages sufferedby public electricity generationfacilities during the civil unrest in
               1997, 1998,and 1999andthe deterioratedcondition of equipment;
            b. The small size of the national electricity market, in which 86,000 subscribers
               consume 760 GWH annually;
            c. The patchwork of technical and commercial conditions under which public
               electricity servicesoperate;
            d. The weaknessof the institutional and regulatory framework in the electricity sector.

        VI.7.2.2 Objectives

79     The Government's objective is to increase service coverage in urban and rural areas,
boosting it from its current level of 25 percentto 50 percentwithin 5 years,andto 80 percentwithin
25 years.

        VI.7.2.3 Achievements

80     In the courseof 2002, the Government undertook a World Bank-supported assessmentof the
electricity sector. This is expected to lead to relaunching the privatization process of the national
electricity company SNE (past attemptsto privatize it were unsuccessful) and upgrading the power
infrastructure under the envisagedEnergy andWater Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRIEE).

81.    In addition, severalprojects arecurrently underway, including:

            a. the Imboulou hydroelectric dam, the cornerstone of which was laid on September
                23, 2003, and which will boost production capacity and improve the conditions
               under which electricity is distributed;
            b. rehabilitation of the Moukouloukou dam;
            c. rehabilitation of the low/medium tension (LTMT)       networks;
            d. construction of the hnboulou-Ngo-Brazzaville very high tension (VHT) line;
            e. rehabilitation of the Djoue dam;
            f.  rehabilitation of the electricity networks of main cities.

82.     In connection with the policy of sub-regionalintegration, the following areplanned:

            a. construction of a 837-kilometer-long Lnga-Brazzaville-OuessoVHT line;
            b. the establishment of the Central African Energy Pool (Pole energetique d'Afiique
                Centrale, PEAC) in Brazzaville, to enhanceintegration of the sub-region's electricity
                systems.

               (PRIEE).

       VI.7.3 Water

       VI.7.3.1 Background

84    Analysis of the situation in the drinking water and sanitation sector highlights the
precariousnessof water supply in urban as well as rural areas,mainly due to the advancedstate of
decay of much of the infrastructure. In all localities served by the national water distribution
company SNDE, output is low, billing is inefficient and fee recovery is inadequate.

       VI.7.3.2 Objectives

85.    The Government's key objectives in this sector are:

           a. Improved reliability of water supply throughout the country;
           b. Greaterefficiency in urban areas;
           c. Improve SNDE's financesthrough bettercost recovery.

       VI.7.3.3 Achievements

86     Projects to rehabilitate drinking water supply are underway in Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire and
the main cities. In 2003, the Water Code was promulgated and the National Water Fund established.

87     The processof placing the national water distribution company SNDE under concession is
not yet complete.

       VI.7.3.4 Actions to be carried out

88.    Theseactionsinclude:

           a. Building of water supply systemsin severaltowns;
           b. Placing SNDE under managementcontract;
           c. Implementing the Energy and Water Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRIEE).

        VI.8 Rehabilitation of transport infrastructures

        VI.8.1 Background

89.     The transportation sector is in a fairly advancedstateof deterioration, and is not meeting the
needsof the economy. Economic growth requires a more efficient transportation sector.

        VI.&2 Objectives

90.     In order to addressthe problem, the Government plans to:

            a. Consolidate and expandbasic infrastructures;
            b. Improve accessto remote areas;
            c. Unify the national territory;
            d. Develop all modes of transport and intra-regional trade;
            e. Reclaim Congo's vocation asatransit country in Central Africa.

         VI.8.3 Achievements

91.     Significant efforts have alreadybeenmade and the following results recorded:

92      In rail transport, the Government has obtained World Bank financing totaling US$ 13.571
million for a priority program to rehabilitate the Congo Ocean Railway (Chemilz de Fer Congo
O&an, CFCO); passengertraffic between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, suspended since April
2002, resumed in June 2003; and, finally, the process of placing CFCO under concession is
continuing and should be completed by the end of 2004.

93      A project to upgrade the river port of Brazzaville is presently being studied by the French
Development Agency. Likewise, severalprojects to upgradesecondaryriver ports arebeing studied.

94      The airport at Pointe-Noire is being expanded.Since the restoration of peace,air traffic has
greatly improved and the number of localities served has increased. A number of airport
rehabilitation andconstruction projects are underway.

95      Lack of resourcesand civil unrest have led to: severedegradation of previously paved parts .
of *the roads network; regrowth of vegetation on nearly 60 percent of paved surfaces; and the
abandonment of certain roads. The roads network is in great need of paving as only 1,264
kilometers out of nearly 17,289 kilometers of roadshave been completed. For the economy to grow
to its full potential and for the Congo to fulfill its vocation as a transit country, the roads network
should be rehabilitated.

       VI.lO.l Background

101.    The Congo is fully awarethat economic development,particularly that of the oil and logging
industries, must take environmental constraints into account. The Government has passed the
Environmental Code in 1991 and elaborated the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP)
which provide the framework for its actions in this area. The Government has designated the
Ministry of Water and Forestry as the entity responsible for the environment. In particular, the
General Directorate for the Environment in the Ministry is responsible for conducting an
Environmental Impact Assessment             for all projects.

     1.1 Contexte     et Objectifs



6.       Le Gouvernement         est fortement    resolu a intensifier   la lutte contre la pauvrete.     Le
document de strategie de reduction de la pauvrete definit cinq axes strategiques prioritaires               a

     I.2 Realisations



7        Dans le cadre du processus d'elaboration               du DSRP-I,     plusieurs   activites ont ete
organisees a ce jour. Les deux organes             d'orientation   et de pilotage,  le Comite National    de
Lutte contre la Pauvrete (CNLP) et son Secretariat Technique                Permanent on ete installes. En
outre, il a ete mis en place onze (11) groupes thematiques               pour affiner le diagnostic     de la
pauvrete     et le contenu     des differents    axes strategiques   retenus. Les membres        des groupes
thematiques     ont ete choisis a la fois au sein de l'administration        et parmi la societe civile et le
secteur prive et les dernieres consultations        sectorielles participatives   ont eu lieu en avril2004.
Les acteurs      departementaux        ont ete egalement       impliques    dans ce processus       a travers
l'installation    des Comites       Departementaux       de Lutte     contre   la Pauvrete     dans les dix
departements      du pays et la conduite         des consultations   participatives   au niveau de chaque
departement      au mois de juin 2003.

8        Par ailleurs, le Gouvernement         a entrepris la conduite de l'enquete      Congolaise   aupres
dks Menages (ECOM)            pour laquelle les travaux de mise a jour de la base de sondage sont en
tours d'execution.

9        Les actions a engager d'ici          a 2005 cadrent avec le chronogramme              etabli pour la
rkalisation des activites devant aboutir a la finalisation        du DSRP complet.      11s'agit notamment
de ..

                                                    69


            a. Finaliser le DSRP-I ;
            b. Conduire l'enquete sur la pauvrete ;
            c.  Organiser les ateliers sur les indicateurs de suivi-evaluation          de la strategic ;
            d. Organiser       des  seminaires      sur   le    renforcement       des    capacites    sur   la
                decentralisation   et le genre ;
             e. Poursuivre      et  renforcer    les   consultations         des  populations     et   assurer
                l'appropriation   nationale du document        ;
             f. Conduire l'evaluation     de l'effet de reduction de la dette exterieure ;
             g. Elaborer     le DSRP      final   sur la base         de    l'ensemble    des   contributions
                mentionnees     ci-dessus.

     II. Cadre macrokonomique          et budgCtaire


10      Le Gouvemement        s'emploie   a renforcer   le cadre economique          et financier   a court et
m&en     termes, afin de realiser les objectifs d'une croissance saine et durable, permettant               de
mener une lutte efficace contre la pauvrete. Les d&s            a relever en mat&e         de croissance sont
enormes, et pour attaquer la question de la pauvrete,             il faudra non seulement         des taux de
croissance eleves, mais aussi des budgets            pro-pauvres       et des politiques      structurelles  et
sectorielles bien adaptees.


11       En 2003, les efforts du Gouvemement         se sont traduits par une progression de 6,5% du
PIB non petrolier en termes reels. Mais a cause d'un recul de 7,6% de la production                 petrol&e,
le taux de croissance global est tombe a 1,3%, contre 4,6% en 2002. L'inflation                  mesuree par
l'indice des prix a la consommation       des menages a ete mieux makisee,             son taux est passe de
3% en 2002 a 1,7% en 2003.


12       La balance des paiements      s'est legerement     amelioree      avec la reduction     du deficit du
compte courant de 0.3% du PIB en 2002, a 0.1% du PIB en 2003.


13       Les finances  publiques     aussi ont enregistre       une leg&e        amelioration   en 2003.    les
recettes ont progresse de 2.7% et sont elevees a 30.1% du PIB, contre 27.4% en 2002, alors
que les depenses et p&s       nets ont decline a 29.7% du PIB, contre 35.5% du PIB en 2002. En
definitive, malgre une conjoncture      economique     difficile,   l'effort   du Gouvemement       en mat&e
de maZtrise des finances de 1'Etat s'est traduit par une amelioration            de l'excedent primaire, qui
a augmente a 6.8% du PIB contre 1.2% du PIB en 2002, et du solde budgetaire                       global base
engagement,    qui est passe d'un deficit de 8.1 % du PIB en 2002 a un surplus de 0,4% du PIB
en 2003.

14       Pour la p&ode    2004-2005,    le Gouvemement         s'est fixe comme objectif une croissance
du'PIB de 4,2% en 2004 et 8.6% en 2005 en termes reels. Le Gouvemement                          escompte une
croissance du PIB petrolier     de 3,0% en 2004 et 16,4% en 2005 (avec la mise en exploitation
des champs de Boundi) ; et une amelioration            du PIB non petrolier        de 4.8% en 2004 et en
2005.

                                                     70


15       Le Gouvemement         entend mobiliser    pour l'annee 2004 le maximum         de ressources
intemes pour degager un surplus du solde primaire budgetaire de 7.1% du PIB. En particulier,
les recettes non petrolieres devront atteindre 19,2% du PIB non-petrolier           d'ici 2007, grace a
l'elargissement    de l'assiette fiscale et l'amelioration   du systeme de recouvrement    des recettes,
et a la makise     de la depense. Le       compte courant exterieur est p&vu      de degager un leger
surplus de 0.1% du PIB.

     III. Transparence      et gouvernance
     III.1  Transparence      et gouvernance   dans le secteur pbtrolier
     111.1.1 Contexte


16       Le petrole joue un role essentiel dans l'economie       du pays et contribue plus de 65% des
ressources de 1'Etat. L'activite       petrol&e    a pris son essor au debut des annees 1970. La
production     du brut est pas&e de 2 millions       de tonnes en 1974 a 5,6 millions      de tonnes en
1986, 10 millions de tonnes en 1996, 13 millions de tonnes en 1999 et 11,2 millions de tonnes
en 2003, production       qui pourrait   encore s'accrojitre les prochaines    annees avec la mise en
exploitation   de nouveaux gisements.

     111.1.2 Objectifs
17.      Le Gouvemement        entend assurer une meilleure transparence et une bonne gouvemance
ainsi qu'une     plus grande efficacite      dans les activites   de recherche,   de production    et de
commercialisation,     et dans la collecte des revenues petroliers.

     111.1.3 Realisations


 18.      Le gouvemement         congolais   a entrepris   depuis    pres d'une   dizaine   d'annees   et

petrolier dans le but de mobiliser      plus de ressources indispensables au financement      des autres
secteurs de l'economie.

 19.      C'est dans ce cadre aue les textes et mesures suivants ont ete pris :
              a. L'adoption     du Code des Hydrocarbures       en 1994 ayant consacre le systeme de
                  contrats de partage de production      en lieu et place du regime des concessions ;
              b. La privatisation    du secteur aval ;
              c. La creation de la Societe Nationale      des P&roles du Congo (SNPC) en 1998 ;
              d. La convention     relative a la detention et la gestion par la SNPC des droits, actifs
                  et participations  de 1'Etat dans le domaine des hydrocarbures,       datee du 29 juin

              a. La centralisation    de toutes les recettes petrolieres de 1'Etat au T&or    Public ;

                                                    71


           b. La mise en place d'audits          de la SNPC, du fait de son mandat.           L'audit  des

           d. La certification     que toutes les recettes petrol&es       dues a 1'Etat Congolais      ont
                ete encaissees par le T&or       Public, par un cabinet de reputation     internationale  ;
           e.   L'affichage    sur internet   sur le site www.congo-site.com,         de l'essentiel    des
                informations    sur la gestion des ressources petrolieres du Congo a savoir :

                             1. La production     ;
                         .   2.  Les contrats de partage de production       ;
                             3. Les comptes de la SNPC ;

    111.1.4 Actions h daliser
21 .  Pour renforcer l'efficacite     et la transparence dans le secteur petrolier,     le Gouvernement
envisage de mettre en Oeuvre les actions complementaires          suivantes:

            a. La poursuite     de la mise en ceuvre du plan d'action           de la SNPC (voir plan

      III.2  Transparence        et gouvernance     dans le secteur minier


22 .       Le processus de Kimberley         designe l'entente     intemationale   etablie pour briser le lien
entre le commerce           des diamants bruts et les conflits        arm&.    Ce processus s'appuie sur un
systeme de certification         visant a controler le trafic des diamants bruts et a exclure le diamants
de guerre du commerce legitime. Dans le cadre de la nouvelle politique                     mini&e   incamee par
le nouveau        code minier,      1'Etat intervient     desormais     comme     facilitateur   en assurant la
promotion      mini&e       et comme regulateur,     en veillant a l'application    dans la legislation.     Cette
politique     engage 1'Etat a mettre en place des infrastructures             geoscientifiques,    necessaires a
l'acquisition     de donnees de base utiles aux investisseurs. En ce qui conceme                    la filiere du
diamant,      pour   repondre      aux exigences      du processus      de Kimberley,       le gouvemement        a

               a.  poursuivre l'organisation        et l'encadrement    les exploitants artisanaux ;
               b. prendre des mesures pour reduire les exportations             ;
               c. assurer la tracabilite des diamants bruts ;
               d. creer une structure pour la mise en ceuvre des dispositions de Kimberley;
               e.  fiscaliser les bureaux d'achat et les soumettre a leur obligation             fiscale de droit
                   commun.


23 .       11 est important       de souligner      qu'apres    l'exclusion    du Congo       du processus       de
Kimberley,      Son Excellence, Monsieur          le President de la Republique        du Congo a ordonne au
Gouvemement          de reaffirmer      la volonte     ferme du Congo       a reintegrer    ledit processus par
l'application     du plan d'action suivant :
   A A                A




      a. Doter la Direction         des Mines de 100 millions         de FCFA avant fin aout pour mieux
           organiser les producteur       locaux de diamant et assurer une meilleures <<tracabilite          )).
      b. Assainir la filiere en fermant les bureaux d'achat de diamant qui ne remplissent pas les
           conditions.
      c. Reorganiser        l'administration    chargee de l'attribution      des agrements et des certificats
           Kimberley    en ecartant les fonctionnaires       corrompus.
      d. Organiser a Brazzaville au frais du Congo et avant fin septembre 2004, une conference
           intemationale       des pays voisins producteurs         de diamant    (Congo      Brazzaville,   RDC,
           Angola, RCA) a laquelle participeront            les experts miniers, douaniers et policiers des
           quatre pays, pour:

               lZ* mieux appliquer ensemble, les recommandations                de Kimberley;
               +   relever et harmoniser       les droits de sortie sur les diamants export&.

     IV. Dette publique


     IV.1 Contexte


24       Le Congo    souffre depuis pres de deux decennies une lourde dette publique               dont le
poids sur l'economie      nationale    s'est accrue d'annee en annee, de sorte que le service de la
dette constitue aujourd'hui     un obstacle majeur pour le redressement economique          du pays.


25       L'encours   global de la dette est evalue au 30 avril 2004 a 4.417 milliards            de FCFA
doht 3.861 milliards     de FCFA au titre de la dette exterieure (87% de la dette totale) et 556
milliards   de FCFA au titre de la dette interieure           (13% de la dette totale).   Les creanciers
membres du Club de Paris occupent le premier rang avec 58% de l'encours de la dette,                  suivi
par les banques (19%),        alors que les creanciers multilateraux         representent 10%. Le ratio
encours de la dette sur le PIB est generalement         superieur ou egal a 200%, et l'endettement      par
titre d'habitant   est tres eleve. Le service de la dette represente pres de la moitie des recettes
budgetaires.


26 .     Le niveau insoutenable      des arrieres de paiement de la dette exterieure reste un obstacle
a la norrnalisation   des relations avec les creanciers du Congo. Le lourd fardeau constitue par
le stock des arrieres est evalue a pres de 2.920 milliards de FCFA. Le probleme              des arrieres a
constitue   et demeure     un handicap      pour l'action     du Gouvernement      en raison du gel des
decaissements par la plupart des creanciers du pays.


27       La situation ci-dessus d&rite      illustre clairement    l'urgence  qu'il y a pour le Congo de
tout mettre en ceuvre pour acceder a 1'Initiative          des Pays Pauvres Tres Endettes (PPTE). Une
telle hypothese permettrait     l'allegement    de la dette, la relance de l'economie    et la lutte contre
la pauvrete. C'est dans ce cadre que le Gouvernement             s'emploie a :

             a. conclure     un arrangement         Facilite  de la Reduction      de la Pauvrete     et la
                 Croissance (FRPC) avec le FMI;
             b. poursuivre le paiement regulier du service de la dette; et
             c. normaliser      ses relations      avec    les principaux    crediteurs  multilateraux    et
                 bilateraux.
11est important    de signaler que le non-acces a 1' initiative       PTTE hypothequerait    serieusement
l'avenir economique      du Congo.


28       Le non-paiement      de la dette interieure      constitue un obstacle majeur    a la reprise de
l'activite economique     et il est primordial    d'y faire face sans delai dans le cadre du programme
a moyen     terme a conclure       avec la communaute          internationale  en general   et le FM1 en
particulier.

    V.2 Ob j ectifs


29      L'objectif   principal    du Gouvernement       et de rechercher       avec le contours     de la
communaute      internationale   les solutions les mieux adapt& aux problemes          de la dette, et qui
sont susceptibles     de procurer      a la Republique    du Congo     l'opportunite   d'une   croissance
economique     durable et d'une reduction de la pauvrete.


    IV.3 Realisations


30      Le Gouvernement        a realise des efforts    importants   pour honorer      regulierement   les
Ccheances courantes       de la dette non reechelonnable        et amorce le reglement      du stock des
arrieres exterieurs envers les creanciers multilateraux.


31      En ce qui concerne la dette interieure, 1'Etat a entrepris de mettre en place une strategic
globale pour 1' apurement      des art-i&es. L'objectif   primordial  vise a travers cette operation est
de restaurer la credibilite de 1'Etat aupres des operateurs locaux. Dans ce contexte, la strategic
d'apurement    des arrieres interieurs devra reposer sur une demarche a trois (3) niveaux : la
collecte des donnees, la validation      et l'apurement.


32.     En ce qui concerne        la collecte des donnees, plusieurs        audits ont ete realises pour
evaluer le stock des arrieres sur la dette interieure commerciale          et un recensement est encours
en ce qui concerne les arrieres sociaux (arrieres de salaires, divers remboursements            aux agents
de 1'Etat).    Un    plan  d'apurement        avait ete experimente       les an&es     anterieures  mais
malheureusement      avait echoue pour des raisons de tension de tresorerie. Ce plan preconisait
la demarche suivante :

             a. paiement     d'un    acompte    de 10 millions     de FCFA     a tous les creanciers de
                  man&e    a solder les creances inferieures a 10 millions ;
             b. application    d'une decote de 50% sur le montant apres audit;
             c. titrisation  du solde :

                               i. titres a sept ans au taux d'interet         de 3% pour les creances
                                   inferieurs a 100 millions de FCFA ;
                              ii.  titres a quinze ans au taux d'interet       de 3% pour les creances
                                   superieurs a 100 millions de FCFA.

    IV.3 Actions h realiser


33      Le Gouvernement       a entrepris la mise en place d'une strategic globale d'apurement          de
la dette interieure   qui s'articule autour des trois Ctapes suivantes : la collecte de l'ensemble
des donnees de la dette, la validation      des arrieres interieurs, et l'apurement   proprement   dit.

                                                    75


34      L'approche    envisagee par les autorites est de preparer un plan d'apurement         des arrieres
sur la dette interieure avec l'assistance technique de la Banque Mondiale.             Le Gouvernement
s'engage a associer l'ensemble des acteurs de man&e              a assurer un consensus et une parfaite
transparence sur la demarche et les modalites qui vont etre appliquees pour sa mise en ceuvre.


35 .    Dans cette demarche, il faut notamment        que :

             a.   le stock des arrieres sur la dette interieure ait ete identifie  ;
             b. une date limite ait ete fix&e, a partir de laquelle les creanciers nationaux            ne
                  peuvent plus :
                                        i. demander que des creances soient incluses dans le stock
                                           des artier& sur la dette interieure ;
                                       ii. completer      ou modifier    des creances dont l'inclusion
                                           dans le stock des arrieres a deja ete demandee.
             Cette date limite sera publiee dans le journal officiel et diffusee par voie de presse
             et autres moyens de communication.
             c.   un accord ait et& conclu avec les creanciers sur des creances representant            au
                  moins 75% du stock des arrieres sur la dette interieure et cela, sur la base du ou
                  des facteurs de reduction commun ;
             d. une banque commerciale          locale ait ete designee a l'issue d'une procedure
                  d'appel a la concurrence sur la base de criteres transparents ; laquelle banque
                  sera chargee d'effectuer   tous les paiements aux creanciers beneficiaires.


    V. Programme        d'hvestissements     Publics


     V.l Contexte


36 .     Les guerres     civiles   des annees     1990    ont   cause des destructions      massives    des
infrastructures    et affaibli  le tissu economique      national.  Le coat de ces destructions       a et&
evalue a quelques 1.OOOmilliards de FCFA en 2000. Le Programme                   Interimaire Post-Conflit
(PIPC) qui a et& mis en place pour la periode 2000-2002             a permis de financer sur ressources
propres une partie de ces infrastructures.        Le financement     de ce programme       a souffert d'un
manque de soutien de la communaute            internationale     a cause principalement    des arrieres de
dette.

37       Sur financement      propre, le volume    des investissements     publics a varie de 10.1% du
PIB en 2001 a 6.5% en 2003, et cela sans compter les investissements realises jusqu'en                2002
par les societes petrolieres pour le compte de 1'Etat. Par rapport aux recettes de l'Etat, le poids
relatif des depenses d'investissements      a et& de l'ordre de 30% en 2001, et 22% en 2003.


38 .     Par ailleurs, le contexte post-conflit   n'a pas favor-i& la mise en place des conditions       de
realisation   des investissements       de meilleure      qualite.  La revue    des depenses publiques
effectuee avec l'appui      de la Banque Mondiale        illustre des faiblesses sur toute la chailne des
depenses, depuis la preparation        jusqu'a   l'execution     des projets en passant par le suivi et
l'evaluation,    et aussi dans les procedures     d'attribution   des marches. il est necessaire que le

          \                                           76


Gouvemement        mette en place des mecanismes garantissant la transparence et la bonne gestion
des ressources propres de 1'Etat et des ressources de financement           exterieur.


    V.2 Objectifs


39      L'objectif   du Gouvernement      est de faire du programme      d'investissements   publics (PIP)
unk composante majeure de la rationalisation           des depenses publiques.      En particulier, le PIP
doit etre conforme    aux priorites identifiees dans la strategic de reduction de la pauvrete.

    V.3 Rbalisations


40      Dans le cadre de la rehabilitation            des infrastructures    economiques      du pays, le
Gduvemement        a mis en place un Programme        Interimaire   Post-Conflit   (PIPC) pour la p&ode
2000-2002,    pour lequel l'effort     consenti a ete considerable      (de l'ordre    de 950 millions    de
dollars sur deux ans). Ce programme            a ete consacre essentiellement         au logement    et a la
reparation  des batiments    (en particulier    a Brazzaville   qui a essuye le plus fort des combats)
ainsi qu'a la rehabilitation     des infrastructures    de transport  (y compris la liaison ferroviaire
Brazzaville/Pointe-Noire     qui est vitale pour le pays, les ports fluviaux         et les aeroports pour
desenclaver les regions isolees). Toutefois,         faute de contributions     exterieures substantielles,
les travaux de reconstruction     n'ont pas pu etre men& a l'echelle qui aurait ete necessaire pour
reduire les sequelles de dix annees de conflits et l'instabilite.

41      Sur le plan de la reforme,      le Gouvemement       a initie depuis juillet 2003 une revue des
depenses publiques       avec l'assistance de la Banque Mondiale         afin de mieux      cemer tous les
problemes    qui minent le systeme de gestion des depenses publiques.              Et plus recemment,     en
mai 2004, une revue specifique         des depenses d'investissements        publics a ete lancee et sera
poursuivie par des diagnostics au niveau sectoriel.

42 .    Le Gouvemement         a egalement      engage depuis 2002 une reforme            du systeme des
marches publics, notamment         pour clarifier les relations entre les differentes      administrations,
1'Etat et la communaute        financiere   intemationale,    et entre 1'Etat et les fournisseurs.       Une
commission inter-ministerielle      vient d'etre mise en place pour poursuivre cette reforme.

    V.4 Actions h rkaliser


43 .    Le Gouvemement       entend engager les actions suivantes :

            a.    Adoption   d'un plan d'action       et de reforme    pour ameliorer      le processus de
                  selection  des investissements      publics   et la transparence     de leur     gestion a
                  travers :
                               i. la consolidation     de l'execution    des depenses d'investissement,
                                   notamment    le suivi physique et financier des projets ;
                              ii.  le renforcement     des capacites de prise de decision en mat&e
                                   d'investissement    public;

                                                       77


            b.    Elaboration     d'un Programme       d'hwestissements     Publics Triennal     2005-2007
                  conforme    aux prior&      du document      de strategic de reduction     de la pauvrete
                  interimaire    (DSRP-I) ;
             c. Poursuite     de la reforme      relative   aux marches publics       pour harmoniser     les
                  relations entre les differents intervenants ;
             d. Production         du    rapport     d'execution     physico-financier      'des   depenses
                  d'investissement    public pour l'annee 2004 ;
             e. Le suivi de l'impact du programme           d'investissement    sur l'environnement.

    VI. Politiques     sectorielles
    VI.1 Le secteur forestier
    VI.l.l  Contexte


44      La for& represente la deuxieme ressource du pays apres le p&role. La for& congolaise
&tend     sur environ      22 millions     d'hectares   (FAO,    2003)   dont   60%    sont des for&s      de
production,   environ     14% des aires protegees, le reste etant des for&s et savanes du domaine
rural. Le Congo       dispose d'un potentiel       forestier  important    avec une problematique        bien
tranchee entre les zones nord et sud du pays. Au nord on trouve de grands massifs forestiers
encore peu exploit&,       et des prelevements       tres selectifs composes largement        de sapelli. Au
sud, pres des totes et dans une region plus peuplee, les massifs forestiers sont plus modestes,
l'okoume    est l'essence la plus exploitee         (58% des recoltes),     et la ressource semble assez
degradee.


    Xl.2    Objectifs


45      L'objectif   de la politique   sectorielle du Gouvernement        est d'assurer la gestion durable
des ecosystemes forestiers au service du developpement             socio-economique,      de la conservation
de la biodiversite    et de la stabilite de l'environnement        national  et global. Parmi les objectifs
specifiques de la politique     nationale on peut enumerer les suivants :

             a. Generaliser      l'adoption   et l'application    des plans d'amenagement        dans toutes
                  les for&s de production     ;
            b . Combat&e       le commerce      illegal de la viande de brousse, particulierement         des
                  especes protegees ;
             c. Assurer une meilleure         gestion des ecosystemes forestiers par la transparence
                  dans l'attribution   des permis, l'application      de lois et reglements    en mat&e    de
                  fiscalite forest&e,    et dans l'application   des p&alit&    ;
             d. Ameliorer      la contribution    du secteur aux recettes de 1'Etat et au bien-etre des
                  populations.


    Xl.3    Realisations


46 .    La politique      du Congo     en mat&e        de for&    est basee sur la gestion      durable   des
ecosystemes forestiers. Le pays participe souvent en role de leader dans plusieurs initiatives

                                                    78


visant la gestion durable des forets du bassin du Congo (Plan de Convergence                   COMIFAC,
AFLEG, Partenariat pour le Bassin du Congo).


47      Initie avec la promulgation      d'un nouveau code forestier en 2000, le programme                de
reformes     du secteur forestier     a et6 poursuivi      avec l'appui       du Credit    Post-Conflit    de
Rehabilitation   (CREPC) finance par la Banque Mondiale.            Ces reformes s'inscrivent      dans une
demarche de gestion durable des ressources renouvelables.              Le renforcement     des institutions,
l'amelioration   de la gouvernance et l'accroissement        de la transparence etaient au cceur de ces
reformes qui preconisaient de :

              a. clarifier les roles respectifs du Public et du Prive dans le developpement               du
                 secteur ;
              b. recentrer I'administration    sur ses fonctions      de regulation,    d'evaluation    et de
                 controle ;
              c. preparer un cadre juridique       et institutionnel    clair de delegation    de certaines
                 missions    de service public      au secteur prive         (inventaires,   amenagement,
                 realisations sociales, constructions    d'infrastructures).


48 .    Dans ce cadre, le Gouvemement           a &die     une reforme      fiscale et a partir de l'annee
2003, pris des mesures pour ameliorer la manrise et le volume des flux financiers du secteur.


    VI.l.4   Actions i rkaliser


49 .    Les actions a engager d'ici 2005 dans ce secteur sont :

              a. La reprise de la reforme     de la fiscalite forest&e        sur la base des resultats des
                 etudes    realisees  dans le cadre du Credit            Post-Conflit     de Rehabilitation
                 Economique      (CREPC) ;
              b. L'extension    des plans d'amenagement        forestiers, y compris au sud du pays ;
              c. La certification     des recettes   forestieres    reellement     percues par le T&or
                 Publique comme cela est fait pour le secteur petrolier ;
              d. La mise en coherence des responsabilites          des Ministeres     charges des for&s et
                 des finances     en mat&e      de fiscalite     forest&e     et la mise en place d'un
                 mecanisme fiable pour le transfert au Ministere          charge des for&s des montants
                 necessaires pour assurer son role de controle, de regulation           et de protection  des
                 ressources naturelles.

    VI.2.1    Contexte


50      La fraude et de la corruption      se sont intensifiees    pendant et apres les guerres civiles,
mais le Gouvemement         est determine    a les combattre.      Un plan national       de lutte contre la
fraude et la corruption    est en tours d'elaboration.

    VI.3 Rbforme     de la fonction  publique


    VI.3.1 Contexte


56     La fonction   publique    congolaise se caracterise par une situation paradoxale : elle est
j&e    en meme temps plethorique        et vieillissante. Elle est contrainte   par consequent,   de ne
plus recevoir la masse des jeunes diplomes qui inondent le marche du travail. Plusieurs maux
lui sont reproches,    notamment    : la lenteur des circuits administratifs,      le non respect des
procedures administratives     et les inegalites de traitement     dans la remuneration   du personnel
dans les differents    corps de 1'Etat. Des reformes        sont done necessaires pour faire de la
fonction  publique   un veritable   instrument     de developpement.     Ces reformes   concernent   les
domaines suivants :

            a. le recrutement    du personnel ;
           b.   les avancements, reclassements et revisions des situations administratives        ;
            c. les disponibilites   et les detachements    ;

            a. l'amelioration     des procedures     administratives   conformement    a la loi numero
                02 l/89 du 14 novembre      1999 portant refonte de la fonction publique ;
           b.   ameliorer la concertation     entre les differentes  administrations   impliquees   dans
                la gestion du personnel ;
            c. l'informatisation    du fichier de la fonction publique      pour un meilleur   suivi des
                car-r-i&es des fonctionnaires     ;
            d. la ma&rise de la gestion du fichier unique solde/fonction          publique  grace a une
                informatisation   appropriee ;
            e. la reduction des inegalites dans le traitement       des revenus dans les corps d'Etat.


    VI.3.3 Rkalisations


 58.   Plusieurs recensements      du personnel     civil de 1'Etat ont ete organises pour tenter de
mamiser les effectifs de la fonction publique.       Le dernier date de 1999. Un projet pour la mise
en place du fichier unique solde/fonction        publique  a ete soumis au Minis&e      de l'Economie,
des Finances et du Budget pour sa realisation.           Le Gouvernement     procede actuellement     au

    VI.3.4 Actions h rbaliser


59      Les actions suivantes sont envisagees pour renover la fonction publique et lui permettre
de jouer un role preponderant     dans le processus du developpement         :

            a. reorganisation     du fichier de la fonction publique ;
            b. informatisation     complete de la fonction publique ;

    VI.4 Dkveloppement        du secteur priv6
    X4.1    Contexte


60 .    Au tours de ces demieres annees, le secteur prive a enormement               souffert des conflits
aui ont detruit une bonne partie du tissu economique             du pays. De plus, ce secteur a evolue
dans un contexte fortementdomine          par :

             a. l'absence     d'une    reglementation      propice    au   developpement       du    secteur
                  informel  ;
            b.    une taxation elevee;
             c. l'irregularite  dans le paiement de la dette interieure ;
             d. le manque d'infi-astructures     de base notamment      rout&es    et energetiques   ;
             e. les difficult&   d'acces aux credits.

    X4.2    Objectifs


61      L'objectif   du Gouvernement       est de faire du secteur prive le moteur de la croissance
Cconomique.     Le Gouvernement       est conscient de la dependance         excessive du Congo sur le
petrole,  et est determine     a la reduire    en favorisant     la diversification   de l'economie.      Le
Gouvemement        estime qu'avec le retour de la paix civile, la rehabilitation      des infrastructures,
un cadre macroeconomique         adequat, notamment      une inflation    mod&e    et un taux de change
stable, un systeme incitatif     attractif,  notamment     une fiscalite plus mod&e,         ainsi que des
investissements      publics  plus  efficaces,   un secteur      bancaire   completement      privatise,  la
croissance du secteur non-petrolier        sera sensiblement     plus forte dans les annees a venir. La
croissance et la creation d'emplois        sera surtout le fait des PME/PMI        que le Gouvemement
compte promouvoir       activement.

    VI.5 Secteur de l'agriculture,      de Wevage      et de la peche
    VI.5.1 Contexte


64 .    En depit des enormes potentialites      dans ce secteur, l'agriculture   vivriere semble cro'itre
au rythme de la population      tandis que la situation de l'agriculture     de rente est preoccupante.
Ceci donne lieu a d'importantes        importations    des produits   alimentaires    dont les depenses
s'eleveraient  a plus de 100 ,milliards par an. Depuis 1998, le Gouvemement              en collaboration
avec la FAO, pilote      un important     programme      denomme     Programme       special de securite

    VI.6 Secteur industriel
    X6.1    Contexte


68      Jadis performant,    le secteur industriel    congolais   s'est delabre au fil des annees. Sa
contribution  au PIB aux prix courants etait de 8% avant 1997, de 4,5% en 2001 et 5,2% en
2002. Elle est estimee a 5,9% en 2003.


    X6.2    Objectifs


69      La relance du secteur industriel     se fait sur la base d'une strategic qui fait du secteur
prive le moteur de la croissance economique.        11s'agit de stimuler la production      des filieres ou
le pays est competitif   et celles qui concourent    a la makise    du processus d'industrialisation     du
pays. Les filieres suivantes sont considerees comme prioritaire           :

            a. l'industrie   agroalimentaire    ;
            b.  l'industrie  du bois ;
            c. l'industrie   des materiaux de construction       ;
            d. l'industrie   metallurgique,  metallique,    mecanique, electrique et electronique       ;
            e. l'industrie   chimique et les derives du petrole.


    VI.6.3  Rkalisations


70      La valorisation   de ces filieres prioritaires   se fait particulierement  par la mise en place
d'un cadre reglementaire      favorable  a la promotion      et au developpement      des affaires.    C'est
dans ce contexte que le Congo a adopte avec tous les autres pays de la CEMAC                       la charte
commune de la CEMAC          en 1999, laquelle charte a ete completee par la charte nationale            des
investissements en 2003. En complement,          des codes specifiques tels que les codes de la for&s,
de l'eau, de l'electricite,   des mines ont ete publies. Ce dispositif          qui se caracterise par la
reduction   de man&e     sensible des exonerations     fiscales et douanieres, a pour objet l'attraction
des capitaux nationaux     et &rangers. La creation d'un centre de formalites           des entreprises a
allege les procedures et les delais de creation des entreprises.

80      Au tours de l'annee 2002, le Gouvernement                a entrepris avec l'appui     de la Banque
Mondiale    l'evaluation    du secteur de l'electricite.    Ce travail avait permis la proposition        des
mesures devant permettre         de relancer avec succes le processus de privatisation        de la SNE. A
ce jour, en depit des demarches entreprises, les soumissions pour la mise en concession de la
societe nationale     d'electricite  se sont aver& infructueuses.        Pour per-n-retire la mise a niveau
des infrastructures     energetiques,   le Gouvernement      negocie aupres de la Banque Mondiale           la
mise en place d'un projet de rehabilitation        des infrastructures    energie et eau (PRIEE).

evidence    la precarite   des conditions    d'approvisionnement      des populations     tant en milieu
urbain qu'en milieu rural, due principalement         a l'etat de vetuste avance d'une bonne partie
des equipements.     Dans l'ensemble      des localites desservies par la SNDE, le rendement           du
reseau est faible ; le systeme de facturation            inefficace ; le recouvrement       des factures
insuffisant.

92      Au niveau des transports ferroviaires,        le Gouvernement        a obtenu un financement       a
hauteur de 13.571 millions $US pour un programme               prioritaire  de rehabilitation   du Chemin
de Fer Congo Ocean (CFCO) finance par la Banque Mondiale,                  la relance entre Brazzaville et
Pointe-Noire    au mois de juin 2003 du trafic de voyageurs interrompu             depuis le mois d'avril
2002 et enfin la poursuite du processus de mise en concession du CFCO qui devrait aboutir
d'ici la fin de l'annee 2004.


93 .    Au niveau des transportsjluviaux,       le port fluvial de Brazzaville fait l'objet d'une etude
en tours de realisation financee par 1'Agence Francaise de Developpement.                11faut relever que
le port autonome de Brazzaville et les ports secondaires beneficient           d'une etude realisee par le
bureau d'etudes SOERNI, qui inclut           le Chantier Naval des Transports Fluviaux           (transports
fluviaux et trans-pool).


94 .    Au niveau des infrastructures       akroportuaires,    l'aeroport    de Pointe-Noire   est en train
d'etre   amenage    et agrandi.    Depuis   le retour   de la paix,      le trafic  aerien s'est ameliore
enormement      en augmentant     le nombre     d.es dessertes locales. D'autres       travaux   importants
sont en tours d'execution    (rehabilitation   et construction   d'aeroports).


95      Au niveau des transports       terrestres, le secteur routier garde son importance          meme si
les difficult&   d'ordre  financier  retardent l'execution     des projets. Cependant,      la vocation de
pays de (( transit H demeure et influence toutes les reflexions.         Le reseau routier couvre pres de
17.289Km      de route a bitumer (1.264Km       ont ete realises). Toutefois,     le manque de moyens a
pour consequence:      la degradation   tres avancee du reseau anterieurement         bitume;   le retour de
la vegetation  sur pres de 60% des surfaces bitumees;         et l'abandon    de certains axes.
