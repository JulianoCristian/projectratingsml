   aims at helping Congo deepen its reform program, as it\n            benefits from an early access to the Heavily Indebted Poor\n            Countries (HIPC) Initiative. In particular, the project will\n            help the country: a) enhance transparency in the oil sector,\n            through the implementation of the action plan, devised after\n            the audit of the accounts of the oil company; b) rationalize\n            public investment, to ensure fiscal discipline, and\n            accountability, and make it more consistent with the\n            pro-poor, and pro-sustainable development goals of the\n            Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP); and, c)\n            reduce domestic arrears in an orderly, and transparent\n            manner. Although risks are significant, these must be\n            balanced with the risks of inaction, which are considerable.\n            Risks stemming from Congo's post-conflict context are\n            being mitigated under a number of International Development\n            Association (IDA) credits. Also, the project would increase\n            the chances of access to the Poverty Reduction and Growth\n            Facility (PRGF) and HIPC, allowing further consolidation of\n            peace. The risk of weak implementation capacity is mitigated\n            by the relatively simple design of the operation, and will\n            be further mitigated by the appointment of a monitoring, and\n            follow-up team in the Ministry of Finance, intensive project\n            supervision, and technical assistance under other IDA credits."}, "docdt": "2004-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
