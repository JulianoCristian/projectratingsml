                                         ReportNo. 29518


 This noteprovides informationon developments which took place since the Project Document
 (PD), dated July 29,2004, was distributed to the Board.

Relationswith the IMF:Theproposedoperation was taken out ofthe Board agendao f
August 26,2004, becausethe IMF, while broadly supportive ofit, informed the Bank that they
were not yet ina position to conclude a PRGF arrangement with the Government, as hadbeen
 expected, because o f one outstanding issue: they had yet to receive more informationto their
satisfaction on transparency aspects o f a settlement between the Government o f the Republic o f
Congo and an oil company regardingan oil field. Since then, the Government has provided the
World Bank and the IMF additional extensive documentation on the settlement, to the
satisfaction o fboth institutions. The Government will also publishdetails o f the settlement on
one o f its websites, aprior action for the PRGF arrangement. Two other prior actions, the
publication o f the 2002 audit o f the national oil company (SNPC) and the hiring o f an
internationally reputedfirmto audit the accounts o f SNPC for the years 2003-2005, have been
implemented.The PRGF arrangement is now onthe agendaofthe IMFBoard for December 6,
2004.

The OverallMacroeconomicFramework(Section 111.B inthe PD)has slightlyimproved
since the PD was first distributed. Inparticular, the projectedannual growth o f non-oil GDP
over 2005-7 has beenrevisedupwards, from 4.9 percent to 5.3 percent on account o f the
projected secondary effects o fhigher oil output and prices. Projected oil revenueover 2005-7
i s now CFAF 254 billion (18 percent) higher than inJuly, despite the adoption by the
Government o f a more stringent oil price rule to prudently forecast oil revenue: the reference
oil price per barrel i s now US$4 lower than the IMFWorld Economic Outlook's forecast,
while it was US$3 lower inJuly. However, without considerable assistance from the Congo's
partners, through debt rescheduling and relief, and additional financial assistance, the projected
financing gap would remainunsustainable. It i s now projectedat about CFAF 2,474.5 billionin
2004 (106.8 percent o f GDP), CFAF 94.6 billionin2005 (3.8 percent o f GDP), CFAF 63.0
billionin2006 and CFAF 64.8 billion in2007 (2.5 percent o f GDP for bothyears).

There has been significant progress with Paris Club creditors over a series o fmeetings, notably
on October 13 andNovember 16,2004. At the latter meeting, it was noted that: (i)      the down
payment on arrears owed to the African DevelopmentBankhas beenmade; and (ii)           part o f the
CFAl8 billioninarrears on post -cut off date debt has beenpaid, with the remainder scheduled
to be cleared by early December. Receipt o fpayment was confirmed by France and Russia,
the two creditors concerned. On the whole, creditors were satisfied with the efforts made by
the authorities. Subject to approval o f the PRGFby the IMFBoard, creditors agreedto meet
with the Congo inDecember (the week ofthe 13th) to negotiate a flow treatment onNaples
terms (67% Net Present Value reduction) that will cover 100%o f arrears and debt service
falling due duringthe period covered by the PRGF on loans contracted prior to the cut off date.
Arrears on post cut off date debt will also be deferredinaccordance with the calculations o f the
country's payment capacity.

UpdatedSNPC Action Plan (Annex 2 B)

Certain target dates inAnnex 2 B have been revised (shown inbold inthe Revised SNPC
Action Plan; new Annex 2 B attached). The revision is the result o f the adoption by the
Government o f a two-stage approach inprocuring the many consulting services under the plan,
to improve efficiency and transparency of the hiringprocess. The first stage, financed by the
Bank through the Transparency and Governance Credit, consists o f recruiting a consultant who
will provide support to the Government and SNPC inhiringand supervision of all activities.
The recruitment process o f this consultant is close to completion and the signing o f the contract
should occur shortly. The second stage consists, after consultants have beenselected, inthe
carrying out o f the activities themselves.
