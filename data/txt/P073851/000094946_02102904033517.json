The project will\n            be the Bank's principal lending instrument to Guyana\n            over the next few years. The Bank is prepared to assist the\n            Government with establishment of the National Protected\n            Areas System (NPAS) by assisting in establishing the legal,\n            regulatory, and technical framework for the system. Of the\n            various PRSC-supported policy reforms, the main ones of\n            environmental significance involve sugar, mining, factory,\n            water and private investment. The PRSC-supported actions of\n            highest environmental sensitivity involve the sugar and\n            mining sectors. These actions, along with those for\n            forestry, are anticipated to be conditions for the PRSC-II\n            (to be processed most likely in 2004). The one of the\n            PRSC-supported activities includes the construction of a new\n            sugar factory along with the expansion of sugar cane\n            cultivation by some 10,000 hectares. The drafting of a new\n            mining law is being considered to facilitate new mining\n            investments while promoting improved environmental\n            management. A new Forests Act is being drafted since the\n            current forestry law was enacted in 1953 and is outdated.\n            The project will also support wholesale restructuring of\n            Guyana's potable water supply system and the\n            establishment of national drinking water quality. All of the\n            policy reforms were discussed during public consultation."}, "docdt": "2002-10-11T00:00:00Z"}
