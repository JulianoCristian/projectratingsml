3. ProgramDescription
3.a      OverallProgram

 1.      The PRSC program consists of a series of (possibly three) Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs) in support of the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy as presented in the PRSP. The
programmatic approach was adopted to allow a flexible and sustained support for institutional reforms
neededto achieve the strategy's objectives. The PRSCprogram i s coordinating its assistanceclosely with
that provided by other donors, notably the IMF, IDB, DFID and several others. IDA'SPublic Sector
Technical Assistance Credit (PSTAC) i s providingtechnical support for implementation of the PRSP and
the PRSC program.

2.      The PRSP and the PRSC program were prepared during a time of near economic stagnation.
Earlier, a prolonged period of rapid growth (an annual average of over 7 percent between 1991 and 1997)
had brought the poverty headcount sharply down, from 42 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in 1999. This
occurred largely in response to the program of structural reforms introduced in 1989. But when the
reform program faltered, and political turmoil and external factors helped to create an unfavorable
economic climate, the growth rate fell to 0.7 percent a year from 1998 to 2002. The reform agenda got
back on track in 2003 and i s supported by an IMF-backed PRGF.

3.      Objectives and main componentsof the program. The ultimate goals of the PRSC program
are essentially the same as those of the PRSP. The overall objective of the PRSP i s to reduce the share of
the population considered poor from 35 percent in 1999 to 31 percent by 2005, and to achieve, by 2015,
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The strategy has three prongs: stimulating economic
growth, improving the provision of basic social services, and better governance. The set of indicators that
had been prepared for the PRSP to allow monitoring progress towards the achievement of its goals has,
with a few modifications, been retainedfor the PRSC program.

4.      The Government's strategy for reducing poverty has seven main components, with needed
reforms identified for each. The PRSC program provides support for four of the seven components and




                                                            5

 i s focused on selected institutional and policy reforms. It reflects the involvement of other donors
 supporting the PRSP. The four strategic components of the program, and related objectives, are:


      0   Creating broad based, jobs creating, economic growth: through sound macroeconomic
          management; establishing an enabling environment that encourages private enterprise; and
          modernizing the sugar industry to make it more competitive.

      0   Better investment in human capital: creating a primary health care system that i s more accessible,
          equitable and affordable; slowing the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; improvingthe quality of
          education at all levels and increasing access for the poor; and establishing a better financial
          management system for allocatingresources to schools and makingschools more accountable.


      0   Better and broader provision of basic services: through establishing sustainable institutional
         arrangements for the water sector; improving the quality, efficiency and sustainability of water
          services provision; and expanding overall access to water, especially for the poor.

         Stronger public sector institutions and better governance: improving the effectiveness of public
          sector management, and monitoring progress under the PRSP; improving the accountability and
         transparency of Guyana's public procurement system; improving the financial management
         capacity of the public sector; improving the intergovernmental fiscal framework between the
         center and subnational governments.

5.       The PRSP set an annual growth target for 2002-2006 of 3.4 percent, which the program accepted.
Sugar, rice and bauxite, traditional exports, are suffering from a decline incompetitiveness, and sugar and
rice are facing at best uncertain preferential access to European markets. Restructuring efforts for the
sugar and mining sectors are under way, however, with safeguards against adverse impacts on the
environment. Achieving the growth target will depend on success with the restructuring efforts and on
private sector led diversification of Guyana's productive base. This is to be supported by improved fiscal
incentives and regulatory environment. The macroeconomic performance targets agreed to with the IMF
will be used to monitor implementation of the program.

6.       Over the past decade there has been some improvement in social indicators, mainly a result of
increased budgetary financing. The program focuses on the inadequate access to and quality of health
care and education, and on the inefficient delivery of services. Inthe health sector, the program considers
reform of the primary health care system together with control of the HIVIAIDS epidemic a highpriority.
With IDB assisting the Government in developing an improved primary health care system, the program
initially supports strengthening implementation capacity for the fight against HIV/AIDS. In education,
better management of resources receives support from the program as well as monitoring the
implementation of actions in the Education Sector Planaimed at raising the quality of education. Access,
quality and efficient delivery are also the principal issues the program addresses with regard to the
provision of safe water.

7.       The PRSC program deals with a range of issues concerning strengthening public sector
institutions and governance. It follows up on findings and recommendations from an earlier Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) and a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA),
both of which address the need to increase the transparency and accountability of public financial
management.       It takes into account ongoing technical assistance being provided on public sector
modernization, including civil service reform, notably by the IDB.

 3b. The operation

 8.      The aim of PRSC-I, the program's first operation, was to move towards achieving the program's
 desired outcomes by initiating or guiding policy reform and adapting institutions relating to each of the
 four main components of the program. The operation required 29 different actions to be taken, most of
 them falling into three broad groups: a) those aimed at reaching agreement on a plan or action program, to
 be implemented during subsequent phases; b) those establishing a legal or regulatory framework for a
 sector; and c) those creating institutional mechanisms for implementing policies or conducting operations.
 The PRSC-I measures require follow-up action during subsequent operations in almost all areas of
 reform.

 9.      The first group of measures included the preparation of a strategy for combating the HIV/AIDS
 epidemic, action programs for implementing the Education Sector Plan and the CFAA recommendations,
 and agreement on a plan for monitoring and evaluation of progress under the PRSP, as well as on a
 macroeconomic program with the IMF. Among the measures of a regulatory nature were the passage of
 the Procurement and Water Acts, the drafting of a new Audit Act and a review of the legal framework for
 the mining and forestry sectors.        The establishment of arrangements for managing the HIV/AIDS
 program, for monitoring the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, and for water sector
 management were among the measures in the third group. The component aimed at strengthening
 governance accounted for most of the operation's actions as it dealt with a wide range of issues.

 4. Achievement of Objectivesand Outputs

 10.     PRSC-I being the first of a series of operations, its performance i s evaluated against the
achievement of the more immediate objectives of each of the program's four components, rather than in
terms of progress made towards the program's intended outcomes: reducing the share of poor people in
the population, and achieving the MDGs. Most of the actions required under PRSC-I aim at creating
conditions for effective government intervention - preparing action programs, implementation
mechanisms and a legal framework. These need a longer timeframe before progress towards improved
outcomes can be measured. The assessment has looked at achievements up to the time of writing this
report, not Board approval. As summarized in the matrix below, the performance of the operation i s
considered satisfactory, although it i s not always possible to attribute the achievements to the operation.
Other factors have played a role as well.

11.      The operation supported actions to put the economy back on a growth path, focusing on three
areas: increasing the competitiveness of the country's traditional sugar sector, diversifying the economy
by encouraging private investment in non-traditional activities, and maintaining a sound macroeconomic
policy framework. The sugar sector in Guyana accounts for 16 percent of GDP. It has suffered from low
and falling world market prices and its factories are old. It may also lose its preferential access to the
European market. The state-owned sugar company's restructuring plan, including the construction of a
modem sugar mill and measures to reduce labor costs, i s designed to raise the profitability of the sugar
industry. The measures to rationalize the use and payment of labor have already reduced labor cost as a
share of recurrent spending from 53 percent to 43 percent by June, 2002 (see PRSP-PR). The reviews of
the laws covering mining and forestry and of the tax system and administration are first steps towards
establishing a satisfactory legal and regulatory framework and adequate incentives for private investment
to exploit the potential in these sectors. The IMF i s monitoring implementation of the agreed policy
performance targets under the PRGF. GDP growth both in 2002 (1.1 percent) and in 2003 (-0.6 percent)
has fallen short of the target rate of 3.4 percent for the period covered by the PRSP (see para 2 above).

 12.     With the IDB taking the lead in helping to reform the primary health care system, the PRSC
 program in the health sector has focused on curbing the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS infection. The first
 operation required agreement on strategic priorities in the fight against HIV/AIDS and the establishment
 and staffing of a National AIDS Program Secretariat in the Ministry of Health, which are essential to
 making this effort effective and sustainable. In education as well, an action program was developed,
 including monitoring capacity, which i s crucial if resources are to be allocated to efforts considered most
 effective in achieving the PRSP's goals. Better use of resources i s also being pursued by makingschool
boards more accountable.       The design of a formula-based allocation system and testing the system
through pilot trials are first steps in this direction. In addition, Guyana developed an Education For All
Fast Track Initiative Program (EFA-FTI) which achieved donor endorsement. The three main initiatives
 of the program are in consonance with the PRSP, the Education Strategy Development Plan (ESDP) and
the EFA-FTI goals for primary education, all of which aim to achieve equity in accessing quality
education and producing a more literate and numerate society.

 13.     Guyana's water supply system suffered from high production costs and large water losses. The
supply was unreliable and water quality poor, while the efficiency of operations was hindered by
responsibility for water services being split between two utilities. Significant progress has been achieved
on the institutional front through the merger of the two utilities and passage of the new Water Act, while
the issue of an operating license and steps towards private management of the new utility have led to a
stronger organizational arrangement for the sector.

 14.     The structural reforms of the 1990s did little to improve the performance of the public sector.
Weak institutions and a depleted and poorly qualified civil service are key constraints to reducing
poverty. The PRSC program supports measures in three areas: more effective public sector management
at the top, improved public financial management, and strengthening of local government. The new unit
inthe Office of the President will help to manage the PRS more effectively by coordinating the efforts of
government agencies, donors and civil society and monitoring implementation of policies and programs.
The CPAR and the CFAA identified a number of weaknesses in public financial management. The
National Procurement Act of 2002 and creation of the National Procurement and Tender Administration
were supported by the PRSC-I. The 2003 Tender and Procurement Act corrected some deficiencies in the
earlier Act. Further actions to improve public accountability under the operation have led to the Fiscal
Enactments Amendment Act 2003 and the Amended Customs Order 2004, which have reduced the
discretionary powers of certain agencies, and Parliament recently passed a new Audit Act. The agreed
program to implement the CFAA's recommendations provides a framework for further actions to
strengthen financial management in the public sector. In particular, this includes: (a) implementation of
the new Audit Act; and (b) strengthening the fiduciary oversight process through: increasing
Parliamentary oversight; reducingdiscretionary powers; and disclosing officials' assets.

15.     Even when progress towards achieving the program's objectives can be assessed, it is not always
obvious that the results can be attributed to the operation. External events, activities of other donors and
other IDA projects have also contributed, at times in a major way. In other words, certain actions by the
Government might have been taken inthe absence of PRSC-I. For example, the review of the tax system
and administration, the formulation of a national HIV/AIDS strategy, and the drafting of a new Audit Act
would probably have been undertaken without pressure from PRSC-I. However, there i s no question that
the operation has exerted strong leverage in many areas, and played a decisive role in moving the
Government to take most of the actions listed as conditions for PRSC-I.

 5. MajorFactorsAffectingImplementationandOutcome

 16.     The political crisis that slowed down implementation of the PRSP abated in the course of 2003,
 when the Government and the political Opposition agreed to go ahead with constitutional and
 Parliamentary reforms. However, tension between the two main, ethnically divided, political parties
 could easily re-ignite and again stall the reform process. At the time of preparation of this report (March-
 May 2004), the Opposition i s boycotting the current session of Parliament. The security situation also
 remains a serious risk to the program, as it discourages private investment and encourages out-migration
 of skilled workers. Strong unions have in the past been able to obtain excessive wage increases. Their
 support for moderation i s crucial for successful restructuring efforts and fiscal discipline, but cannot be
 counted upon. Finally, implementation capacity in the public sector i s weak. While efforts to modernize
 the public service are underway, their success rests in part on effective cooperation of Government and
 the unions.

 17.     A strong point in the design of the PRSC program i s the linkage between the actions in the first
 and subsequent operations. The program comprises a phased set of actions, with those under PRSC-I
 preparing the ground for follow-up measures. Most of the measures under PRSC-I - whether action
 programs that need to be implemented or legal and regulatory measuresthat have to be made effective, or
 new institutional arrangements to be made operational - all require follow up actions to ensure they
 achieve the intended results. This approach emphasizing the coherence of the program's operations i s
 expected to make the program more effective.

 18.     The PRSC i s a well-designed program prepared under difficult circumstances.                It faced
 considerable problems, including an unstable political situation and serious capacity constraints in the
public sector. It had to put together a coherent action program selecting from a wide range of issues
presented inthe PRSP while taking into account active support from many donors. The program's strong
features are: its broad base, the continuity of actions throughout the program period, the extensive
technical assistance provided during preparation and appraisal, and the link with a separate TA project,
the PSTAC, aimed at overcoming capacity limitations in specific areas relevant for future operations
under the program. Examples of TA provided during preparation and appraisal include advice on
procurement legislation and helping to amend the 2002 Procurement Act, the preparation of a plan to
strengthen capacity in the Ministry of Human Services, Labor and Social Security (to be implemented by
the PSTAC) as well as help with the preparation of the Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA).
Moreover, a number of reports were prepared in support of the program including, apart from the PSIA,
the CFAA and a Review of Amerindian Issues.              A simulation model was developed to look at
development alternatives in the light of their poverty and employment impacts. OP 4.01 applied and an
Environmental Analysis was prepared. In view of the risks associated with operations in Guyana, the
timetable of the program - one operation per year - may have been too optimistic.

19.      While committed to the implementation of the PRSP and the PRSC program, the Government
had difficulty meeting some of the requirements of PRSC-I because of a deteriorating political and
security situation, which included a boycott of Parliament by the Opposition. This pushed back the
introduction of certain structural reforms and hurt the economy.         The slow implementation of the
procurement reform and the delay in getting the macro-framework back on track contributed to the delay
in the disbursement of the credit and the preparation of the next operation by nearly a year. However,
good progress was made in several areas, including institutional and regulatory reform (e.g. in the water

sector and on procurement) and achievement of the PRSP objectives in the education and sugar sectors,
and inthe fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

        first operation has been most useful, this may not be possible in future. It would therefore be
        important to ensure that such assistance can be provided in other ways, either through a TA credit

    >  Future operations might have fewer trigger actions and exclude measures that are expected to be
       taken as part of other operations, whether by IDA or other donors;

       Subsequent operations need to take a fresh look at the desirability of including new components
       in the program, notably actions more focused on poverty alleviation, takinginto account planned
       activities of other donors.
