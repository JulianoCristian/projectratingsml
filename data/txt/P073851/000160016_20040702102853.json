and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Findings and implications for subsequent\n            operation(s) in the series are:  1) In view of the many\n            risks the implementation of this program faces, the\n            timeframe of future operations should be established with\n            care, taking into account possible political obstacles as\n            well as capacity constraints in the public service. 2) While\n            the provision of formal and informal technical assistance as\n            part of the preparation of the first operation has been most\n            useful, this may not be possible in future. It would\n            therefore be important to ensure that such assistance can be\n            provided in other ways, either through a technical\n            assistance credit or PHRD grant (Policy and Human Resources\n            Development Fund - Japan) or by other donors. Such\n            assistance is crucial for the success of the program. 3)\n            Future operations might have fewer trigger actions and\n            exclude measures that are expected to be taken as part of\n            other operations, whether by the International Development\n            Association or other donors; 4) There are areas covered by\n            the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, but so far not\n            included in the Poverty Reducation Support Credit for\n            various reasons. Subsequent operations need to take a fresh\n            look at the desirability of including new components in the\n            program, notably actions more focused on poverty\n            alleviation, taking into account planned activities of other donors."}, "docdt": "2004-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
