Consumed by his\n            own day-to-day challenges, Georgievski knew little about the\n            hurdles state institutions faced to make assistance to\n            farmers like him available. The project left its mark. It\n            strengthened the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture,\n            Forestry and Water Economy. Among other things, it improved\n            the agency's ability to formulate and implement\n            effective policies, and it increased the effectiveness of\n            public expenditures in a way that complies with EU\n            requirements. Government assistance to farmers was improved.\n            And the necessary institutional framework was set up for the\n            country to obtain pre-accession EU rural development funds.\n            In December 2009, the European Commission conferred full\n            management of these funds to the Macedonian Paying Agency.\n            Macedonian farmers and agro-food processors could then apply\n            for grants to finance investments that would allow them to\n            modernize the country's agriculture, hire workers and\n            be in a better position to access EU markets and compete\n            with the EU producers."}, "docdt": "2012-05-29T05:37:03Z"}
