                                    RESTRUCTURING PAPER



1.     The closing date for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Agriculture
Strengthening and Accession Project (IBRD Loan Number 48610-MK, P101216) will be
extended from September 30, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2.      The project objectives continue to be achievable, with noteworthy results and
positive outcomes already achieved.1 The action plan and proposals that the Government
has presented to complete the remaining project activities are satisfactory to the Bank.2
The Project has been rated Satisfactory and Moderately Satisfactory for the last 12
months for Progress towards the Development Objective and Implementation Progress
respectively. Overall, project implementation is progressing well under all components,
with the exception of one construction activity under Component 1, related to the
completion of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE)
headquarters building, which is about two months behind the original schedule, and is
now expected to be completed by October 2011. As of April 25, 2011, 76.3% of project
funds have been disbursed. Financial management performance is satisfactory, and there
are no overdue audits. Financial covenants have been complied with.

3.       The proposed extension is necessary to allow additional time for remaining
project activities to be completed. One ongoing specific activity, the MAFWE
headquarters building construction, is close to completion. However, the main contractor
has been unable to pay the essential sub-contractors to complete the relevant works due to
financial issues. The Bank team has assessed and discussed progress under this activity
during a Technical Mission on March 14-18, 2011, and has presented the client with
options for proceeding with the construction. The Government is now in the process of
resolving this situation to finalize construction by October 2011. With respect to the
remaining training activities and the implementation of software packages (listed in the
letter from the Government), these activities are on track to be completed by the planned
dates. The project team fully supports the request as the proposed extension would
provide the time needed to fully achieve Project objectives.

4.         This will be the first extension of the project.
