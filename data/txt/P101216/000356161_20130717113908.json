Agriculture\n            Strengthening and Accession Project for Macedonia were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            partnering with the European Union (EU) proved to be highly\n            beneficial to the project which was built on a set of\n            analysis carried out by EU consultants. This ensured aid\n            coordination across a common objective to help the borrower\n            meet the EU accession agenda in the agricultural sector and\n            satisfied the necessary institutional arrangements. But this\n            coordination effort is also costly in terms of time and\n            funding since it requires frequent meetings, trainings, and\n            travel. Institutional development does take time, and in\n            fact the original implementation period was not sufficient.\n            Even to complete the construction of the headquarters\n            building during the four years of implementation period was\n            challenging. Institutional development of irrigation\n            management is a long and continuous process. The period\n            since the previous centralized socialist irrigation\n            institutions started to reform has not yet been sufficient\n            to complete the decentralization process to make them fully\n            demand-driven and financially sustainable."}, "docdt": "2013-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
