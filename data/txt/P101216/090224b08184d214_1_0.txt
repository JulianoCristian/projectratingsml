                         The Project Development Objective is to improve the delivery of government assistance to the agriculture sector in a manner consistent with the European Union's pre-accession
                         requirements. Overall, the Project activities have been fully implemented and many of the institutional structures established under the Project are being applied in the Ministry of
                         Agriculture and Water Economies’ (MAFWE’s) regular program. These include: a fully functioning Market Information System (MIS) with the Agricultural Market Information System

                         users and managing irrigation infrastructure according to its resources. The Paying Agency is still considered a good practice among the European Paying Agencies. The Project
                         has also assisted the Food & Veterinary Agency (FVA) in upgrading its operational capacity in line with the relevant EU aquis and practices, and to more effectively safeguard animal
                         health and consumer protection. For example, in 2012, the laboratories at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine were certified with ISO 17025. With respect to food Hygiene lab
                         achievements, the laboratory tests were considered fully in compliance with all requirements. These key achievements have contributed to improving the government's ability to
                         assist the agriculture sector in an EU-compliant manner.

                         The Project has been slow in some areas; the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is fully developed; however, only 55 percent of the parcels have been identified by farmers
                         and this process is expected to continue until spring 2013. This means that the LPIS will not be completed and used for administrative controls under IACS by the end of the project.
                         The system is nevertheless in the process of being connected to the IACS according to the LPIS Unit. The Veterinary Information System (VIS) is not fully developed yet due to
                         unforeseen complications encountered in the process.
