The\n            closing date for the project will be extended from September\n            30, 2011 until June 30, 2012. The extension is necessary to\n            allow additional time for remaining project activities to be\n            completed. One ongoing specific activity, the Ministry of\n            Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE) headquarters\n            building construction, is close to completion. However, the\n            main contractor has been unable to pay the essential\n            sub-contractors to complete the relevant works due to\n            financial issues. The Bank team has assessed and discussed\n            progress under this activity during a Technical Mission on\n            March 14-18, 2011, and has presented the client with options\n            for proceeding with the construction. The Government is now\n            in the process of resolving this situation to finalize\n            construction by October 2011. With respect to the remaining\n            training activities and the implementation of software\n            packages (listed in the letter from the Government), these\n            activities are on track to be completed by the planned\n            dates. The project team fully supports the request as the\n            extension will provide the time needed to fully achieve\n            project objectives. This will be the first extension of the project."}, "docdt": "2011-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
