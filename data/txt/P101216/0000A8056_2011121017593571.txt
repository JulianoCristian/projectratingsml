                         Implementation Status Overview
                         ASAP is now operating in its extended period and most activities have thus been completed. As established in previous ISRs, the implementation of the project has proceeded well
                         overall and institutional capacity has been visibly strengthened across institutions and agencies involved in the project. Since the last ISR, several of the outstanding activities have
                         been completed. The refurbishment of the Paying Agency is finished and the PA staff has moved back to the premises. Also, the two remaining WEs in Bitola and Gevgelia are now

                         staffed properly, and it is expected that the funds allocated will be fully disbursed by December 2011 and January 2012 for Bitola and Gevgelia respectively. Water fees for the 2011
                         season are still being collected by the WEs and the final figures will not be available until the end of 2011. Therefore it is difficult to draw any conclusions about to what extent costs
                         for water services to the agricultural sector will be recovered this year. However, a new law that has been adopted under which farmers are obliged to submit verifications of
                         payments of irrigation water fees in the applications for agricultural subsidies is likely to have a significant impact on the water fee collection rate for the WEs.

                         There are a few outstanding activities still remaining under the project, notably the completion of construction of the MAFWE HQ, the refurbishment of the Ministry branch offices, and
                         the setting up of the Integrated Administrative Control System (IACS) software.
