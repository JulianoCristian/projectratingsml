INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LWAN TO THE
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A THIRD VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Arab Republic of Egypt for the equivalent of *19.3 million to help finance
a Third Vocational Training Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       A report on "Current Economic Situation and Growth Prospects" (Report
No. 4498-EGT) was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 20, 1983.
An economic mission visited Egypt in October and November 1984; this section
is based on the findings of that mission. Country data sheets and
macroeconomic accounts are presented in Annex I.
Background
3.       Following an extended period of inward-looking and centralized
economic policies, the Government in 1974 began to gradually introduce an
"Open Door" policy with the aim of accelerating development by liberalizing
the economy and stimulating foreign and domestic private investment.
Supported by large external capital inflows, the economy grew faster during
the next two years. Concomitantly, a rapid rise in foreign exchange earnings
helped narrow the current account deficit in spite of growing imports. During
the following five years, increased petroleum exports at favorable prices,
swelling remittances from Egyptian workers abroad, revenues from the reopening
of the Suez Canal, and rising tourist receipts facilitated this process.
Between 1974 and 1980, earnings from these sources grew by 40% per annum in US
dollars, accounting for over 70% of export earnings by 1980. The resulting
increase in income stimulated the economy, which grew by more than 9Z per
annum during this period.
4.       The combination of rapid inflation abroad and fixed prices at home
created growing distortions in the domestic economy. Controlled prices for
consumer goods, energy, transport, rents, public sector wages and foreign
exchange lagged far behind international or economic prices and domestic
prices for many of the same goods in the uncontrolled parts of the economy,
resulting in a severe duality in the economic system.  Although the fixed
prices avoided stressful adjustments in the living standards of those with
access to controlled goods and services, they created major distortions and
inefficiencies in domestic production.
1/ Part I is substantially the same as Part I of the President's Report
P-4060-EGT (Second Agricultural Development Project) dated May 7, 1985.



5.       Investment, production and employment in the private sector have
grown faster than in the public sector; however, the latter still accounts for
402 of total employment, 54% of value added, 60Z of total expenditure and 70:
of total investment. The public sector finances have generally been in the
red; the overall deficit has been around 20% of GDP. Although foreign
resources and private saving have financed a considerable portion of this,
between 30Z and 50% has been financed by borrowing from the banking system.
6.       Egypt's population, estimated at 45 million, is already large
relative to its quite limited arable land, with an average density higher than
that of Bangladesh or Indonesia. And this population is growing rapidly, by
2.6Z per annum, or by over one million people every year. Almost half of this
growth is concentrated in the greater Cairo area. The family planning
programs have been weak, but a recent decree has strengthened the program's
structure within the Government. The rapid economic growth of recent years
has been stimulated by external circumstances and has had only limited impact
on agriculture, industry and services which in the end are the sectors where
productive gains are needed to meet the needs of the economy and provide the
necessary jobs. For example, the Suez Canal and the petroleum sector account
for over 20% of GDP but only 1% of employment. While tourism and employment
abroad absorb considerably more Egyptians, their levels of activity have been
determined by external factors.
Recent Developments
7.       A reversal in Egypt's economy started in 1980, triggered by the fall
in the price of oil. In 1981/82, key macroeconomic variables took a turn for
the worse, with the reappearance of large deficits in the public budget and
the balance of payments and the rapid growth of both domestic borrowing from
the banking system and short-term borrowing from abroad. During 1982/83, the
Government took several important measures to redress the short-term
situation, even though it did not make much progress in tackling the more
fundamental items on Egypt's long agenda of pressing policy reforms. It
curbed imports and public expenditure, raised additional fiscal revenues,
reduced the growth of credit and retired aome short-term debt. Both the
budget and balance of payments deficits were reduced. The one longer-term
issue addressed was export policy, which was greatly improved in ways that
will have quite favorable long-term consequences.
8.       During 1983/84, the deterioration continued.  The elections held in
May 1984 inhibited any further measures to curb domestic expenditure, raise
additional revenues or dampen imports, particularly of consumption goods.
Although the rise in domestic credit was a bit faster than in 1982/83 (20% in
1983/84 versus 16% in 1982/83), the Government did restrain the growth of the
money supply, which fell from 28% to 20% in 1983/84, thus helping to reduce
inflation pressures somewhat. Petroleum exports rose 9%, in value terms, due
to a significant rise in volume; but they were still below their dollar value
in 1980/81. Suez Canal revenues were constant at just below $1 billion and
tourism receipts remained at the previous year's level of about $0.5 billion.
An unexpected rise in imports by 14% caused the current account deficit to
increase from $2.7 billion (11% of DMP) in 1982/83 to $3.3 billion (12% of
GDP) in 1983/84, despite a sharp jump in workers' remittances of almost $800
million. Net longer-term capital inflows did not rise by as much due to



- 3 -
rising debt service obligations. The debt service ratio rose from 28.5% in
1982/83 to 30.1% in 1983/84. As a result, short-term external debt grew by
about $700 million and now constitutes 24% of overall civilian debt. These
are all well-known symptoms of an unsustainable external situation pointing to
the need for structural adjustments.
9.       The 1984/85 budget, delayed due to the May election, was presented to
the new People's Assembly only in September 1984. Several taxes have been
raised and, through the sale of a higher-priced loaf of bread, food subsidies
are expected to fall. Although opposition to this move in some quarters
caused its temporary roll-back, the higher-priced bread is slowly replacing
the lower-priced one and was about 80% implemented at the beginning of 1985.
The price of electricity was raised in November 1984-for the fifth time since
April 1982, and another rise is expected in the Spring of 1985. These rises
have kept the price of electricity from falling in real terms over the last
three years, arresting the steady fall over the previous decade. A subsidy on
cigarettes (about LE 170 million per annum) has been eliminated. Price
increases have also been authorized for some products manufactured by the
public sector. These measures are encouraging as first steps and are expected
to reduce the budget deficit from 23Z of GDP in 1983/84 to an estimated 19% of
GDP in 1984/85, a level which is still much too large to be sustainable.
10.      The balance of payments deficit is likely to prove troublesome in
1984/85. The price of oil has fallen so that the large increase expected in
export volume is unlikely to result in higher dollar earnings. Reflecting
slower activity in the Gulf and turbulence in the foreign exchange markets,
workers' remittances are expected to decline.  Non-oil commodity exports
(i.e., manufactured and agricultural products), which rose by over 50% in
volume terms from 1981/82 to 1983/84, are the one bright spot. Although these
are projected to increase substantially, they will not translate into major
increases in total dollar export earnings, as the base is small and commodity
prices in dollars have fallen sharply. The result of the above forces is that
foreign exchange is scarce. The Government has begun to cut overall imports
by raising prices and extending import controls. In January 1985 the
Government introduced a flexible and depreciated rate for use in the
commercial banks, initially set at LE 1.25/$, while it abolished the own
exchange import system (on licensed imports financed by the sale of foreign
exchange deposits between private individuals). This means all imports now
require a license from the Import Rationalization Committee. As a result, all
commercial bank transactions which previously had occurred at LE 1.12/$, and
those which had occurred in the free market at a rate which has fluctuated
between LE 1.301$ and LE 1.40/$, are now to be conducted at the flexible
commercial bank rate.
11.      While the introduction of a flexible, unified and more depreciated
rate for foreign exchange is to be welcomed, the extension of the import
control system is harmful to improving the competitive efficiency of an
already overly-protected, high-cost domestic productive structure. Egypt
needs to adopt policies (reduce subsidies further, raise publicly controlled
prices, cut the budget deficit, raise interest rates and rationalize
investment) to improve allocative efficiency and, in this way, manage more
effectively the demand for foreign exchange.



-4-
Development Potential and Constraints
12.      The external resource position facing Egypt during the 1980s
inevitably will be less favorable than in the 1970s. Nevertheless, given
appropriate policies, Egypt has the potential for sustained economic growth
and development. Its population constitutes a large domestic market, and the
Nile River provides ample and reliable irrigation to the country's
agricultural land. Favorable year-round growing conditions suggest that
considerably higher yields are possible. Egypt has a key geographical
location, a relatively skilled labor force, somewhat varied raw materials and
major reserves of energy; these would allow a substantial degree of
industrialization and trade in manufactured goods.
13.      Egypt has been making some of the needed policy adjustments, even if
at a slow pace. For the past three years the Bank and the International
Monetary Fund have been advising the Government to accelerate the process of
policy reform. Perhaps the most important of these is to increase energy
prices to international levels and to rationalize domestic energy
consumption. Curbing the growth of demand for energy and substituting natural
gas for petroleum fuels would encourage more efficient use of Egypt's energy
resources and would add to the exportable surplus of petroleum. There have
been some petroleum price rises to selected industries and, as stated, power
rate adjustments. But these have stopped short of the substantial and
comprehensive actions needed to rationalize energy use and reduce the high
implicit economic subsidy to users (on average, domestic energy prices are at
15Z to 20Z of international prices). The growth of consumer subsidies also
needs to be contained by price increases and improved targeting to low income
groups. This would ease the burden on the government budget, curb the
consequent inflationary pressure and reduce the growth of imports of basic
consumption goods.
14.      There is considerable scope to increase value added in agriculture by
shifting to a more intensive pattern of higher value crop production and by
motivating farmers to raise yields. Farmgate prices have been increased for
most crops over the past three years, but government procurement prices are
still only 602 to 80X of world market prices. Loopholes and tax exemptions
should be drastically reduced to help improve Government finances. The
foreign exchange system should be further simplified and maintained flexible,
reflecting the value of foreign exchange to the economy, both to stimulate
exports and ration funds for imports. Improvements in the structure and
operations of industrial production through export promotion, exchange rate
movements, more liberal pricing and production control policy, a carefully
designed investment program and greater autonomy in the management of public
sector enterprises would have a substantial impact on industrial productivity,
employment and foreign exchange availability. In addition to improving the
efficiency with which resources are used in the economy, most of these changes
would have a favorable impact on the mobilization of public savings and
foreign resources to help reduce the public budget deficit and restore
macroeconomic balance. Additions to the country's infrastructure would also
help reduce rising economic costs.
15.      The medium-term outlook will depend on the pace and magnitude of
essential policy reforms. Clearly it would be unrealistic to expect rapid



adjustments on all fronts, and in some cases it might even be
counterproductive to make sweeping changes. But adjustment with deliberate
speed across a broad spectrum is required to lay the base for sustainea growth
at rates close to those which can be achieved, given the resources available
to the economy. Assuming reasonable progress in the policy area, Egypt could
maintain growth of 5% to 6X per annum in the medium term. Although the public
sector budget _nd current account deficits will still remain high, both should
improve over the period; and savings and investment can grow at rates that
provide for longer-term growth on a stable basis. Oil exports and Suez Canal
revenues are not likely to rise as rapidly as in the past but non-oil exports
have the capacity to compensate for this. With sound policies, Egypt could
finance needed imports by additional export earnings and continued success in
attracting private foreign investment and official aid transfers.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
16.      At mid-1984, Egypt's publicly guaranteed non-military medium- and
long-term external debt was estimated at $16 billion. Private non-guaranteed
debt has been assessed at about $700 million. In addition, other banking
system obligations, including short-term debt, not reported in the Debt
Reporting System (DRS), are estimated to be $7.4 billion; so that Egypt's
total identified civilian debt is about $24.1 billion (82% of GDP). Egypt's
military debt is reported to be $5.7 billion (excluding an estimated $3
billion military debt to the eastern block countries, which is not being
serviced). Total civilian debt service payments in 1983/84 are estimated to
be about 03.4 billion, giving a debt service ratio of 30.1% as against 28.5%
in 1982/83.
17.      The volume and structure of Egypt's medium- and long-term external
debt is dominated by large borrowing from official sources. Loans from
bilateral sources comprised 60% of mediumr and long-term non-bank debt
outstanding at June 30, 1984, and those from multilateral institutions 23%
(the Bank Group by itself is 10%). The United States was Egypt's foremost
bilateral creditor (47% of outstanding bilateral loans) followed by Kuwait
(12%), Saudi Arabia (10%), Japan (9%) and Germany (6%).
18.      Given Egypt's immense development needs and growing resource gap,
gross external capital requirements are projected to remain sizeable. Even if
these were reduced to keep the debt service more manageable by curtailing the
growth of imports, appropriate macroeconomic policy adjustment would still
remain critical.  Without this, external debt service could become
unsustainable in the medium term. The Government recognizes the urgency of
the matter and, as stated, has begun to take some measures. It is also
negotiating a possible standby arrangement with the International Monetary
Fund and is trying to obtain additional bilateral aid. This support, together
with appropriate policy actions, should enable Egypt to manage its medium-term
growth on a sustainable basis.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN EGYPT I/
19.      As of March 31, 1985 the World Bank Group had approved 41 loans and
31 credits to Egypt. Total commitments as of that date amounted to $2844.1
1/ Part II is substantially the same as Part II of the President's Report
P-4060-EGT (Second Agricultural Development Project) dated May 7, 1985.



-6-
million, of which t1897.0 million had been disbursed.l/ About 34% of approved
operations finances projects in the industrial sector, while 181 supports
agriculture, 18% transport and telecommunications, 18% power and energy, and
10% the social sectors (including education, population, urban development and
water supply and sewerage). Annex II contains a summary of Bank loans and IDA
credits as of March 31, 1985.
20.      The strategy underlying Bank activities in Egypt during the 1970's
and early 1980's aimed at rehabilitating damaged capacity, improving
maintenance practices, eliminating critical deficiencies and bottlenecks to
development, and helping the setting up and strengthening of institutions. To
achieve these goals, the Bank supported development in a wide spectrum of
sectors and served not only as provider of direct financing but also as a
catalyst for bilateral and multilateral aid to Egypt.
21.      In support of this strategy, the Bank helped the Government
rehabilitate the Suez Canal, and assisted in maintaining the productive
capacity of the railways and of the agriculture sector. Bottlenecks in the
transportation sector (particularly ports) and in the power sector were also
addressed with Bank financing. Attention was also given to the provision of
productive inputs, with special emphasis on imported materials and energy.
Deficiencies in the areas of cement production, textiles, agricultural
productivity and skilled manpower were eased through projects in the
respective subsectors. Most projects included important technical assistance
components aimed at strengthening the implementing agencies and other sector
institutions. The Egyptian Electricity Authority, the Development Industrial
Bank and the Suez Canal Authority are good examples of agencies helped by Bank
efforts to promote institution building in Egypt.
22.      The Bank strategy for the future will focus on helping the country
restore aacroeconomic balance through improved investment allocation, resource
mobilization, export promotion and employment policies. To do this, efforts
will concentrate on projects that raise output, exports and employment in
agriculture and industry. Other projects planned to be financed would support
economic development by providing the necessary Lransport and urban
infrastructure, as well as skilled manpower. The Bank's past experience in
these sectors is being supported by substantial economic and sector work to
enhance our policy advice to the Government.
23.      Continued dialogue is proceeding on macroeconomic and sector policy
issues, including energy pricing, agricultural incentives, and fiscal
disequilibria among others. The dialogue would hopefully lead to agreement on
some important policy actions that currently preclude Bank cooperation in
energy and related activities that would be good candidates for Bank
assistance. These include power generation, energy conservation, industrial
restructuring, fertilizer production, gas development and coal terminals.
Progress in this area would also facilitate the reactivation of cofinanciers
meetings to help finance an important share of Egypt's resource gap.
1/ These numbers exclude a $100 million loan for a Constructio_ Industry
Project, a $170 million loan for a Small and Medium Scale Industry
Project, and a $125 million loan for an Export Industries Development
Project, approved by the Board, but not yet signed, and a $59 million loan
for a Power III Project, which is not yet effective.



24.      Bank and IDA disbursements in FY84 represented 112 of Egypt's medium-
and long-term capital inflow.  The Bank and IDA shares of total external debt
outstanding and disbursed (excluding military debt) were about 4% and 3%,
respectively, as of June 30, 1984. These shares are expected to remain at the
same level in FY86 and FY87. It is estimated that in FY86, debt service
payments to the Bank and IDA will be about 5Z and 0.2%, respectively, of
Egypt's external debt service payments. Disbursements have shown a rising
trend in the last three fiscal years, and reached $347 in FY84, up from t252
million in FY83 and t190 million in FY82. This trend is the result of
improvements in overall project implementation and of better knowledge of the
Bank's procurement and disbursement procedures by the Egyptian authorities.
IFC
25.      IFC's equity participations and lending commitments for projects in
Egypt as of March 31, 1985, totalled $102.47 million. Most of the
Corporation's activities have been lending operations. The most important
projects financed are a project for an agricultural complex primarily for
sugar beet, a building materials project in Suez and a reinforcing bar project
at El Dikheila. IFC has provided technical assistance in the design of
incentives to private sector investments and in the developmevt of the capital
market. IFC is considering several other private sector and joint venture
projects. A summary of IFC operations in Egypt is given in Anne} Ti.
PART III - MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT IN THE ELECTRICAL POWER SECTOR
The Power Sector
26.      Egypt's electrical power sector is controlled by the Ministry of
Electricity and Energy (MOEE) through five administrative agencies
(authorities). The Egypt Electricity Authority (EEA), one of the five
agencies, is responsible for most electricity generation and primary
transmission. Distribution and customer service are carried out through the
Electricity Distribution Authority (EDA), a holding company for seven regional
distribution companies.
27.      The Egyptian power sector has witnessed an enormous growth in both
size and complexity over the past ten years, with an average growth rate in
electricity supply of 13% per annum between 1974 and 1982. Electricity demand
is expected to continue a trend of fast growth until well into the 1990's.
Future demand will have to be met through an important investment effort and
improved operational efficiency. The availability of adequately trained staff
will play a crucial role in this respect.
Major Training Issues
28.      Manpower problems are one of the major development constraints of the
electricity sector in Egypt and cause considerable inefficiency in power
generation and distribution and in the critical area of maintenance of
facilities and equipment. The main issues related to this problem refer to:
(a) the inadequate supply of skilled manpower; (b) shortage of training
staff; and (c) inadequate coordination of training activities among the



various agencies. These problems affect most sectors of the Egyptian
economy. Their relevance to the electrical power sector is discussed below.
29.      The shortage of well qualified, experienced staff in the electricity
sector is attributable to the sector's high growth rate in recent years, to
the increased specialization due to technological change, to the attraction of
oil-rich Middle Easc countries, to the salary differentials between the public
and private sectors and to the lack of training capability in the sector.
Recent studies reveal a critical need for formal training to correct present
imbalances between skilled manpower demand and supply, to improve,the quality
and relevance of job skills among new and existing employees and to increase
the effectiveness of manpower utilization. It is estimated that the capacity
of existing training facilities would meet less than 20% of the projected need
for trained new manpower in the electricity sector over the period 1985-2000.
In addition, the skills of the existing work force should be upgraded.
30.      Most instructors for the training facilities in the electricity
sector are experienced employees of the production and distribution agencies
who are given special training in technology and teaching methods. This
arrangement is satisfactory and EEA and EDA plan to continue to recruit
teaching staff this way. The main issue with respect to the availability of
instructors is the need to improve the institutions' ability to retain
qualified teaching personnel. The remuneration policies of both agencies were
modified recently to adopt a bonus remuneration policy intended to discourage
instructors from seeking alternative employment and to increase their
motivation. As a result, the retention and attraction of instructors is now
improving.
31.      The proliferation of agencies and the absence of an integrated
manpower development plan for the electricity sector have caused some
coordination problems. Improvements in this respect are necessary to ensure
coherence in training, avoid duplication and set up a trade testing and
certification system to help employers assess and ameliorate the competence of
the staff. Under the proposed project, the training needs of the MOEE will be
reviewed to provide the basis for a ministry-wide comprehensive training
policy (para. 45).
Government Strategy
32.      Rapid development of skilled manpower is essential for Egypt's
economic development and constitutes a major theme of the Government's
education and training strategy presented in the 1983-87 National Development
Plan (NDP). The main elements of this strategy aim at solving the training
issues mentioned in para. 28 above.  The objective is to improve the quality
and relevance of the skills of the new and existing labor force, to distribute
training opportunities equitably and in accordance with regional needs, and to
strengthen the institutional base for manpower development, including
improvements in the provision of basic education. The NDP underlines the
importance of specific industry and sub-sector training programs tailored to
the needs of enterprises and institutions. The Government regards investments
in manpower training of the type of the proposed loan as being cost
effective. Given the relevance of adequate manpower skills to economic
development, this strategy is considered appropriate.

Previous Bank Group Lending
33.      The Bank's support for education and training in Egypt has been
consistent with the high priority given by the Government to training for
productive employment. The Bank and IDA have lent a total of $143 million for
four education and vocational training projects. The major focus of these
projects is t:.. expansion and upgrading of the training of managers,
technicians, and skilled and semi-skilled workers in industrial, agricultural,
construction and commercial trades and the improvement and expansion of
teacher and instructor training in selected areas.
34.      The First Education Project (*25 million Credit 681-EGT) was
satisfactorily completed in December 1980, as reported in the Project
Performance Audit Report (No. 5070 of May 7, 1984). Tnis project, together
with $40 million Credit 868-EGT of FY79 (Second Education Project) and $40.1
million Credit 1069-EGT of FY81 (Third Education Project), supported basic
vocational training in several industrial subsectors for teachers, management
and instructors. The two latter projects are being satisfactorily
implemented. The First Vocational Training Project (*38 million Loan 2264-EGT
of FY83) focuses on vocational training in the construction and industrial
sectors, as well as on the upgrading and expansion of instructor training.
Project implementation is proceeding according to expectations. A proposed
*20.6 million loan for a Second Vocational Training Project would continue
support for increasing the supply and upgrading the quality of skilled and
semi-skilled manpower in industry. The distinctly differing and specific
training needs of industrial enterprises and the electrical power industry
have resulted in the separate treatment of these two projects.
35.      The Bank Group has also assisted the development of the power sector
through Loans 1453-EGT (FY77), 1733-EGT (FY80) and 1886-EGT (FY81) and Credits
935-ECT (FY80) and 1052-ECT (FY81). Including a $56 million Supplemental Loan
to Loan 1886-EGT approved in June 1984, total Bank Group financing to the
power sector amounts to 4370 million. In addition to physical facilities,
all loans financed technical assistance for improved planning and for
implementing several training activities for the power sector. Under the
Second Power Project (Loan 1733-EGT and Credit 1052-EGT), the Bank assisted
EFA in taking steps to address the problem of manpower training and
development by financing consultants to help develop a five-year training
plan. Although the Government has succeeded in attracting substantial
external assistance to implement this plan, the Supplemental Loan included an
additional *3.7 million to finance the continuation of training activities and
the strengthening of EEA's Manpower and Training Department.
Bank Strategy
36.      The Bank lending strategy for the training sector is to continue to
support the Government initiatives and priorities for training programs aimed
at improving labor productivity. This strategy is consistent with the general
objectives of Bank operations in Egypt stated in para 22. Financing of the
proposed project will broaden the experience of the Bank in the field of
vocational training for the electrical power sector.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
37.      The proposed project aims at strengthening Egypt's capability to meet
the training requirements of the electrical power sector and is consistent
with the Government's investment priorities for economic development. The
project was appraised in December 1984. Negotiations took place in Washington
on April 25 - 26, 1985. The Egyptian delegation was led by Dr. Erfan Shafey,
Firat Undersecretary of the Ministry of Planning and International
Cooperation. A Staff Appraisal Report (IBRD Report No.5481-EGT) is being
circulated separately. The main features of the loan and the project are
given in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III. IBRD Map No. 18755 is
attached.
Project Objectives and Scope
38.      The proposed project will alleviate the shortage of trained manpower
in the electrical power sector and will raise the quality of existing staff by
developing the training capability of the MOEE and two of its agencies, EEA
and EDA. As a result of the project, EDA and EEA are expected to be able to
train each year 530 new skilled craftsmen, 120 new technicians and 90 new
electrical engineers over their existing training capacity, and to provide
on-the-job training for upgrading each year the skills of about 1,500
craftsmen, 500 technicians and 250 engineers.
Project Description
39.           The project would establish four training institutes for skilled
craftsmen, technicians and engineers (one for EDA and three for EEA). In
addition to these multipurpose training institutes, six craftsmen training
centers would be established for the EDA. The project includes the provision
o':
(a) construction, equipment and furniture for: (i) a training
institute for EDA in Cairo and another for EEA in Aswan; (ii)
four EDA training centers, in Aswan, Alexandria, Minya and
Ismailia; (iii) expansion of an EDA training center in Tanta;
and (iv) renovation and conversion to a training center of an
existing EDA facility at Dokki;
(b) construction and furniture only for an EEA training institute in
Fayid, for which equipment would be provided by the German
Society for Technical Cooperation (GTZ);
(c) equipment and furniture only for an EEA training institute in
Abu Qir; and
(d) technical assistance including: (i) specialist services and
fellowship training for the project training centers and
institutes; and (ii) consultant services fer the preparation of
a study of manpower needs, a training development and management
plan and a possible follow-up project.
40.           Skilled Craftsmen Training.  All project training institutions
would provide in-service and pre-service training programs for skilled



- 11 -
craftsmen. Pre-service programs would be based on a cooperative arrangement
with the Ministry of Education. Trainees would receive general education in
the local secondary schools and technical specialization in the training
centers. EDA's training centers and institutes would work closely with
industrial secondary schools and would accept applicants who have completed
the first year in such schools. EEA's institutes would work closely with
general secondary schools and would accept applicants who are just beginning
general secondary schooling. Recruitment of candidates is not expected to be
a problem.
41.      The proposed skilled craftsmen training programs would provide job
preparation for installation, operation and maintenance in the EDA
specializations of overhead lines, cable joining, meter and equipment repair,
and sub-station installations, and in the EEA specializations of mechanics,
electricity, and instrumentation, plus in-service courses in welding and
machine mechanics. Curricula for the EDA programs, about equally divided
between theory and practice, are satisfactory to the Bank. Detailed syllabi
and instructional aids would be developed under the technical assistance
component. Curricula for the EEA programs are being developed under bilateral
aid (para. 51). The ten proposed training facilities would have an output
capability, upon reaching full operational status in 1992, of 530 new trained
skilled craftsmen per year. Over the next 15-year period (1986-2000), the
project training institutions, combined with existing training facilities,
would supply approximately 70% of the projected skilled worker demand of 8,000
for the EDA/EEA operations. Unskilled individuals would continue to be
recruited and given on-the-job training by experienced staff in order to meet
the remaining skilled manpower needs. In addition, in-service training
programs focusing on selected skilled workers in need of refresher training or
skill upgrading would be designed. These in-service programs would serve
about 1,500 skilled workers per year through three-week intensive training
courses.
42.      Each training institution under the project would introduce four
skilled craftsmen training programs, which would need one instructor and one
teaching assistant per program. Most instructors and assistants required
would be recruited among experienced employees of the respective electricity
institutions and given special training in technology and teaching methodology
at the Cairo North Training Institute and through the technical assistance
component of the project.
43.      Technician Training.  The multipurpose training institutes of Fayid,
Abu Qir, Aswan and Cairo would provide in-service training to existing
technicians and pre-service training to replacement staff. Pre-service
technician training would consist of post-secondary studies implemented as
two-year, full-time programs. The courses would be open to graduates of the
skilled craftsmen programs and to secondary school graduates with relevant
work experience. The expected output is 30 skilled technicians per year in
each training institute, i.e., a total of 120 per year for the project. The
project training centers and institutes, combined with existing training
facilities, would produce approximately 46% of the projected new technician
demand of EDA and EEA. The projected gap is expected to be met partially
through the promotion of suitable skilled workers. The in-service technician
training programs would aim at improving low worker productivity and poor
quality work by existing staff. About 10% of the staff (some 500 technicians
per year) would receive three-weeks of intensive refresher training or skill
upgrading.



- 12 -
44.      Engineering Training.  Programs  specially designed for professional
staff would also be conducted in the four multipurpose training institutes
through pre-service programs and on-the-job training. Pre-service programs
would consist of one-year, full-time courses of instruct-on in the theory and
practice of operations in EEA or EDA, plus field work supervised by
experienced engineers. The courses would complement the theoretical,
non-operationally oriented engineering degrees from university faculties. The
expected output is 90 engineers per year, or about 82X of the projected new
demand through 1990.  The remaining needs would be met by placing new recruits
on the job immediately after university graduation and providing onr-the-job
orientation in the traditional manner. In-service training programs for
existing staff would be provided as three-week courses for a total of 250
engineers per year.
45.      Technical Assistance.  This component would consist of:  (a)
consultant services for the development of instructional materials and course
syllabi, and for the development of institutional management policies and
planning procedures; (b) fellowships for training abroad for EDA's training
administrators and staff; and (c) consultant services for a sector-wide study
of manpower and training needs to provide the basis for a comprehensive
training policy for the entire MOEE. Item (a) above includes 96 man-months of
consultant services to be obtained through bilateral support (para. 51).
Terms of reference for consultants to be employed for the project and a
preliminary plan and schedule for the fellowship program have been prepared
and are acceptable to the Bank. The MOEE manpower needs study is planned to
begin before January 31, 1986 and would be completed no later than March 31,
1987. After that, the MOEE will exchange views with the Bank on the
recommendations of the study and their implementation (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01(d)).
Project Implementation
46.      EEA's Managing Director of Manpower and Training has been appointed
by the MOEE as coordinator of project implementation. The Project Coordinator
would have overall responsibility for managing the implementation of both the
EEA and the EDA project components and for the preparation of the MOEE
manpower needs study. Specifically, the project coordinator would: (a)
ensure that the necessary budget appropriations are requested for the project;
(b) liaise with the bilateral agencies supporting the EEA components; (c)
supervise procurement, preparation of architectural designs, maintenance of
financial records and preparation of withdrawal applications for the
disbursement of loan proceeds; and (d) recruit staff, nominate fellowship
candidates and select the required consultants (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01(b)). In addition, EEA's and EDA's training departments have project
implementation units already in operation to handle project execution.
47.      Preliminary drawings for the Aswan EEA institute are completed.
Preliminary plans for all centers (except for the EEA institutes at Aswan and
Fayid that are being prepared under bilateral aid) and drawings for renovating
the Dokki EDA center were reviewed and agreed upon at negotiations. All sites
for the proposed new training centers and institutes have been acquired by EDA
and EEA, and are acceptable to the Bank. Detailed lists of project furniture
and equipment were reviewed and agreed upon at negotiations. Suppliers of
major equipment packages will provide installation and maintenance training.



- 13 -
48.      To ensure the adequate availability and retention of instructors,
both EEA and EDA have recently introduced a remuneration system based on a
bonus that makes their remuneration comparable to competitive sources of
demand for teaching personnel. Assurances were provided at negotiations that
such a remuneration system for EEA and EDA instructors would be maintained
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(c)).
49.      To assist in determining the success of the project training programs
and to provide a basis for continued improvement, the project institutions and
programs would be evaluated by a committee with representation from both EDA
and EEA. The Government provided assurances that no later than June 30, 1991,
an evaluation of the training activities under the project would be completed
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(b)(v)).
Project Cost and Financing
50.      Total project cost is estimated at $49.3 million equivalent, of which
$27.9 million (about 57%) would be in foreign exchange. The cost of civil
works is estimated on the basis of unit prices from current contracts for
similar institutions under ongoing Bank projects, adjusted for regional cost
differences. Furniture and equipment costs are based on current c.i.f.
prices, standard costs per student place in similar institutions and current
market costs of specialized equipment, adjusted to include local
transportation and installaticn costs. Since Government agencies are exempt
from import duties and taxes, these items are not included in the cost
calculation. Costs for architectural services, engineering and technical
assistance are based on current rates charged by consulting firms. All costs
are expressed in April 1985 dollars. A physical contingency allowance of 10%
of the estimated base cost of civil works, furniture and equipment and 5Z of
the estimated cost of technical assistance is included. Price contingencies
are assumed to be 16% in 1985, 14% in 1986, 13% in 1987 and 12Z in 1988-93 for
local costs, and 5% in 1985, 7.5% in 1986, 8% in 1987-90, and 5% in 1991-93
for foreign costs.
51.      The proposed $19.3 million loan would finance 69Z of the total
estimated foreign cost of the project. The Government would finance 98Z of
the local cost ($21.1 million equivalent). The Swedish Commission for
Technical Cooperation is financing the feasibility study and preparation of
preliminary design and construction documents for the EEA training institute
at Aswan. The provision of instruction equipment and technical assistance for
the EEA training institute at Fayid is expected to be financed by the German
GTZ. This bilateral aid would finance about 2% ($0.3 million) of the local
cost and 15% ($4 million) of the foreign cost of the project. The Government
would finance the balance of the foreign cost of the project, now estimated at
$4.6 million (16% of the foreign cost).
52.      It is anticipated that when fully operational in 1992, the recurrent
costs for each project component would represent less than 1% of the recurrent
budgets of the respective implementing authorities. In view of the high
priority of the proposed training components within the Ministry of
Electricity and the two implementing agencies (EEA and EDA), no funding
shortage of these activities is foreseen.



- 14 -
Procurement
53.      Civil works contracts for the new training institutions would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB). Extension
and remodelling works for the EDA training centers at Tanta and Dokki, which
are small and dispersed, would be conducted on the basis of local competitive
bidding procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. It is expected that all
civil works and furniture contracts would be awarded to local firms.
Contracts for furniture and equipment in excess of $100,000 would be awarded
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for ICB. Small items or groups of
items estimated to cost less than the above figure, or items of a specialized
nature for which ICB would not be practical, or items which must be compatible
with other equipment procured under ICB, would be procured under normal
Government procedures which would be acceptable to the Bank and would include,
to the extent possible, quotations from at least three manufacturers or
suppliers. The total value of furniture and equipment s8 procured would not
exceed $3 million equivalent. Bid evaluation documents would be approved by
the Bank prior to the award of all contracts for furniture a-Ad equipment
procured under ICB and for all civil works financed under the loan. The Bank
would approve all contracts. Technical assistance financed by the loan would
be obtained in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for t'ae Use of
Consultants. Procurement arrangements are summarized in the following table.

- 15 -
Disbursement
54.      Disbursements would be made on the basis of 272 of total expenditures
for civil works. For furniture and equipment, the disbursement percentage
would be 1002 of the foreign cost for imported items, 100% of ex-factory costs
for locally produced goods procured under ICB, and 802 of the total cost of
goods procured otherwise. For technical assistance, the Bank would disburse
100% of foreign expenditures for fellowships and consultants. Withdrawal
applications for less than $20,000 will be made against statements of
expenditure. All other disbursements will be fully documented. To facilitate
timely disbursement, the Government may open a Special Account with a
commercial bank to be designated by the Central Bank into which an amount of
not more than $800,000 would be disbursed (Loan Agreement, Section 2.02(b) and
Schedule 5). The project implementation and disbursement schedules are based
on the average time required for the disbursement of all loans in Egypt, i.e.,
8 years. The closing date would be June 30, 1993.
Audits
55.      EEA and EDA will maintain separate budget accounts for their
respective components of the proposed project. All project accounts,
including the Special Account, would be audited annually by the Central
Accounting Agency, a Governmental institution responsible for auditing the
accounts of all public sector agencies whose audit methods are in accordance
with Bank guidelines. All audited reports would be submitted to the Bank
within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Project Benefits and Risks
56.      Benefits.  The proposed project would greatly increase the training
capacity of the MOEE, both in terms of training new staff and of upgrading the
skills of existing staff. The project is also expected to contribute to
substantially decreasing operational costs in the power sector through
improved manpower productivity and operational efficiency of the two main
power sector agencies, EDA and EEA. Specifically, EDA anticipates that the
project would gradually reduce the faults of the electricity distribution
system from the present level of about five times the international average to
a figure approaching the average, over the medium term. In addition, the
study of the training needs of the MOEE would help establish the basis for
continuing long-term development of the power sector human resources.
57.      Risks.  Since the project is fully consistent with the Government's
investment priorities, and the coordinating agency, EEA, has established a
record of effective project implementation performance through previous Bank
financed projects, the risks of the project are considered minimal.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the
Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed to the



- 16 -
Executive Directors separately. Features of the project which are of special
interest are listed in Section III of Annex III.
59.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
60.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
