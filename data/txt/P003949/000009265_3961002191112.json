        maintenance of an increasing share of the maintainable part\n            of the kabupaten road network as well as rehabilitation and\n            improvement of selected roads project kabupatens over three\n            fiscal years starting in 1992/93; (ii) workshops and\n            laboratories upgrading and equipping; (iii) provision of\n            equipment, spare parts and
