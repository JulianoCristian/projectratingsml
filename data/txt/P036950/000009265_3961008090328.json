The project will support the government's\n            efforts to make primary education universal by the year 2000\n            by putting more educational inputs into teaching points,\n            increasing the enrollment in complete schools, expanding\n            multigrade and multisubject teaching in rural areas, and\n            reducing dropouts rates of minority children through\n            improved bilingual educational programs. The project\n            consists of the following components: 1) an institutional\n            component comprising: (a) facilities upgrading; (b)\n            instructional equipment, furniture and books; and (c) staff\n            upgrading; 2) a management improvement component including:\n            (a) local education management training; (b) project\n            management training; and (c) expansion of education\n            management information system; and 3) a central component\n            consisting of: (a) national training; (b) research\n            dissemination program; (c) stipend program; (d) study tours;\n            (e) experts panel; and (f) studies."}, "docdt": "1996-02-23T00:00:00Z"}
