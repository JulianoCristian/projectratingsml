This\n            involves provision of roads, public lighting, refuse\n            collection and the construction of a market. In (c) Salines\n            Ouest, this undertaking involves a site and service\n            development as a joint venture with the Societe Immobiliere\n            de Djibouti (SID) on land owned by them. The project would\n            finance the cost of the off-site and on-site infrastructure.\n            Further, the project would fund; (d) institutional support\n            to the Land Office, the District of Djibouti, SID, Caisse de\n            Developpement de Djibouti, and a small Project Management\n            Unit; as well as (e) housing credit to improve existing\n            homes and the construction of new housing units in the\n            target areas."}, "docdt": "1984-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
