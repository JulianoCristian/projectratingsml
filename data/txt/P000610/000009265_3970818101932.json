and\n            (ii) to strengthen the absorptive capacity of the key\n            agencies involved in the urban sector. Specifically, the\n            project calls for: (a) upgrading and drainage works in the\n            Old Wards to alleviate stormwater damage and provide\n            protection from flooding of all low lying areas. Roads,\n            water distribution, fire hydrants and refuse collection\n            would also be included; (b) in Balbala, the project includes\n            upgrading of a squatter settlement. This involves provision\n            of roads, public lighting, refuse collection and the\n            construction of a market; (c) in salines ouest, this\n            undertaking involves a site and service development as a\n            joint venture with the Societe Immobiliere de Djibouti (SID)\n            on land owned by them. The project would finance the cost of\n            the off-site and on-site infrastructure. Further, the\n            project would fund; (d) institutional support to the Land\n            Office, the District of Djibouti, SID, Caisse de\n            Developpement de Djibouti, and a small project management\n            unit; and as well as (e) housing credit to improve existing\n            homes and the construction of new housing units in the\n            target areas."}, "docdt": "1984-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
