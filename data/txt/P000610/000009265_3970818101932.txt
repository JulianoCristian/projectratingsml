I. PROJECT SUMURY
Ebrrover: Republic of Djibouti
imunt: SDK 4.9 million (US$5 million equivalent)
lerua: Standard IDA terms
Project Objectives and Description:   The project's main objectives are to
increase the absorptive capacity of key agencies by providing staff
training, equipment and a clearer and more appropriate franework for the
management of urban investments; to improve the living conditions of the
urban poor in Djibouti; and to introduoe more rigor in cost recovery
practices, with special emphasis on improving the revenue base of the local
agencies and recycling recovered project funds.  The project consists of
the following components:
(a) Old Wards.  Upgrading and drainage works in the Old Wards to
alleviate  stormwater  damage  and  provide  protection  from
flooding of all low  lying areas.   Roads, increased vater
distribution, fire hydrants and refuse collection will also
be included.
(b) Balbala.    Upgrading  of  a squatter  settlement;  this will
include   provision  of  roads,   public   lighting,   refuse
collection and the construction of a market.
(c) Salines Ouest.   A site and service development as a joint
venture with the Société I mDbillère de Djibouti  (SID) on
land owned by them. SID's contribution will include the land
and core housing units; the project will finance the cost of
the off-site and on-site infrastructure.
(d) Institution Support.   Technical support including staffing,
training and equipment to the Land Offioe, the District of
Djibouti, SID, Caisse de Développement de Djibouti (CDD), and
a small Project Management Unit (PMU).
(e) Housing Credit. Housing credit to improve existing homes and
for the construction of new housing units in the target
areas.

Benefits and RiBks
The project objectives will be achieved through the servicing of
urban land and the provision of housing credit. The project vill improve
the living conditions in the Old Wards (161 ha., 10,390 householde) and
Balbala (105 ha., 2,500 plots) and will provide 176 serviced plots at
Salines Ouest. The project will ale strengthen the operations of existing
urban institutions. The main risks faced by the project are those derived
from weaknesses in the execution capacity of the implementation agencies
which may lead to delays in project implementation, and co0t recovery.
Specific measures, including a high degree of institutional support which
is considered of high priority in Djibouti, have been included as part of
the project to limit these risks.

II. SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. Backgrou.d and Urban Conditions
2.01       The Republic of Djibouti  es a small country of 23,200 km2 which
became independent ln 1977. Over sixty percent of its population, estima-
ted at 330,000 inhabitants in 1982, live in the capital, Djibouti.
Djibouti now exists as a separate state only because France developed a
bunkering port there in the late l9th oentury for ships using the Suez
Canal. Its boundaries correspond to no natural ethnic, geographic or more
ancient historical distinctions.   Djibouti consists of  three economic
sub-units: the city of Djibouti wlth the port/railway terminal, government
services and practically all of the couatry's commercial activity;  the
French military base, the country's main source of economic activity; and
the  relatively  remote,  poor  and  sparsely  populated  hinterland.    The
military base, with a personnel of approximately 4,500 people, and the port
are expected to remain the main source of economic activity for the near
future.  Known natural resources are few, except for vossible availabillty
of geothermal resources which is under investigation with a proposed
IDA-financed project.  The interior of the country is likely to remain as
impoverished as the neighboring regions of Somalia and Ethiopia, with the
main rural activity continuing to be nomadic pastoralism. France, together
with several other countries and international agencies, supports the
development effort of the couatry with substantial financial and techilcal
aid, most of which is provided on a grant basis.
2.02       Since accession to independence, the Government has concentrated
on developing agriculture and industry and on accelerated training of
Djibouti nationals to take over from the expatriate personnel who in many
Instances stLll handle both the technical and management aspects of those
two sectors and the country's modern services.   Although this effort has
already produced appreciable results, it is important to recognize that
agriculture and industry face formidable natural obstacles and that the
country lacks any abundant natural resources other than its fishing
grounds, its geothermal potential and some mining activity.
2.03       The development effort since independence hns produced tangible
results in investment and economic growth.   According to Bank estimates
(Economic Report No. 4692-DJI), fixed public investment grew in real terms
at 37% annually between 1978 and 1982, reaching a total of US$75 million in
1982,  or over  21% of GDP.   There was also  a small boom in  private
investment,   particularly  in  building  and   infrastructure,   although
equivalent to less than 10% of public investment.   This expansion, and
sustained demand from the French military establishment, gave a real annual
3% growth rate in GDP between 1978 and 1982.  Per capita GDP reached a
nominal value of US$880 in 1982, an estimate which falls to US$480 if
adjusted for the purchasing power parity approach and the presence of a
large resident expatriate community.
2.04      Over the past several years the city of Djibouti has grown at an
average rate of 5.4%, to a present population of 195,000. Although lower



now tlun during the past two gdecades, this growth will add 125,000 people
by 1992 to a city whose quality of life i8 already poor for the majority of
its people.  For most of this century, settlement vas confined to a narrov
peninsula,  with  the  Wadi  Ambouli  serving  as  a  natural  barrier  to
expansion.     Recent  population  pressures  have  changed  this  pattern.
Expatriates and a small number of high-income Djiboutians remain in
low-density areas north of the commercial center and in military compounds
around the city.   By contrast, the poorer  Old Wards" of the inner city
have become more densely settled, and now contain 65Z of the city's
population.   About half  the  population of  the Old Wards  are  tenants.
Beyond the Wadi Ambouli, 23,000 people (12% of the city's population) live
in the squatter settlement of Balbala, an area with poor access to the rest
of the city and virtually no services.
2.05         Djibouti has essentially a service rather than a production
economy with 80Z of total production coming from the tertiary sector,
located in the city.  The largest sources of formal sector employment are
the state and its parastatal agencies, followed by the port, the railway,
the military base, and businesses dependent on these three.  A container
port project is under preparation for possible Arab funds financing.
Small-scale manufacturing for the domestic market has been largely confined
to food and beverages, furniture, and maintenance and repair services.
2.06       Average monthly family income is US$550 for the Old Wards and
US$170 for Balbala.  This income, while rather high in absolute terms, is
offset by the extremely high cost of living, such that a monthly income of
US$175 puts a family on the verge of starvation. Malnutrition is therefore
severe in the overcrowded,  poor parts of the city.   Unlike most other
African countries, the "informal sector in Djibouti is not a major
employment source; it makes up at present only about 30% of total
employed.
2.07        Eousing conditions in the Old Wards and Balbala are generally
poor. Paradoxically in this almost treeless country, over 17,000 dwellings
are made of wood, most of which is imported from Ethiopia.  Few houses are
of permanent construction.   A few units are being upgraded, although at
present this is an expensive and time-consuming process, requiring lengthy
administrative approval because of the inappropriately high building stan-
dards of the Ministry of Public Works. Houses in Balbala are poorly built,
of whatever materials are available, including cardboard and scrap plastic
sheets.
2.08       The construction sector suffers from a scarcity of trained local
labor, unreliable materials supply, and the volatile and irregular nature
of demand.  In addition to these factors, self-help builders also have to
contend with the present cumbersome, 16-step process of obtaining a plot
authorization and building permit.   The lack of long-term financing has
meant that up to now, the housing market has operated almost exclusively on
a cash basis. Apart from sand, aggregate and lime, all building materials
are imported. USAID is financing research on the local production of earth
bricks; should the results prove positive, USAID and the French Government
Technical Assistance (FAC) are envisaging financing a small project to
produce these bricks in the future. This vas not included in this project
as no conclusive results are yet available.



- 6 -
2.09      The higher income areas and the commercial center are vell served
with surfaced roads, water, sewerage, and electricity.   These areas are
also relatively well drained.   Although adequately served by both major
access roads and secondary streets, the Old Wards suffer from poor quality
incerior roads and drains.  Secondary streets are unsurfaced and often too
narrow for anything but pedestrian access. Some areas lie below sea level
and are subject to flooding during even light rains; severe floods occur
every few years.   The Old Wards have street  lighting and a few public
standpipes (27 in the whole city, including four for the 23,000 people in
Balbala), as well as some private water and electricity connections. Water
quality is satisfactory.   Water connections which exist often serve many
neighboring houses; the householder with a connection often charges hie
neighbors  high  prices  for  this  service.    There  are  soue  individual
connections to tle water-borne sewerage system but most housing in the Old
Wards is served by septic tanks and pit latrines.
2.10       Life expectancy is about 50 years, and infant mortality is esti-
mated at 120 per 1,000. The climate is relatively healthy. While Djibouti
has a large number of expatriate medical personnel, it appears that
inadequate attention i8 given to basic health services and to preventive
medicine.   Government sector priorities are for promotion of mother and
child health, training of staff, and development of health education.
Although 11% of the national budget is devoted to health, most is for
curative services.
5. Inst:tutlonal Frameuork
2.11        Institutional Setting.   As a city-state, it is not surprising
that the urbanized area comprising the city of Djibouti is regarded as a
national rather  than as a municipal asset.   In such an environment the
distinction between national and municipal responsibilities is thus hard to
define; at present, there are no elected or appointed local government
officials,   although   recently   introduced   legis;Laiiû    provides   for
the  appointment  of  municipal  advisory  councils.    Responsibility  for
planning, execution, and financing of urban infrastructure and other
facilities rests with national agencies, primarily with the Ministry of
Public Works, Urban Planning and Housing.
2.12        Ministry of Public Works, Urban Planning and Housing (MPWUH).
Regional and urban physical planning, execution and maintenance of roads
and drainage, construction and maintenance of government buildings and
housing, and building code enforcement are among the wide range of respon-
sibilities of this ministry.  The Ministry has some 26 expatriates provided
by FAC and 400 Djiboutians.  An organization chart is attached (Annex 3).
The proven technical capability of this ministry has led the Government and
international aid agencies to further increase its responsibilities,
particularly   as   regards   construction   and   maintenance   of   urban
infrastructure.   A Presidential Decree  issued in June 1982 transferred
responsibility for maintenance of Djibouti city streets from the District
to the Public Works Ministry;  a subsequent decree, dated September 20,
1982, enlarged this mandate to include maintenance of drainage canals,
sidewalks, and public squares.



- 7 -
2.13       A strong technical bias has led the MPWUH to insist on unrealis-
tically high standards for planning ane. construction. The French building
code, without any modification or adaptation, is still in force in Djibou-
ti. Award of full title can only be granted if a permanent house is built
on a plot and on-site services ccnforn to the planning regulation. As pro-
cedures for grantirg permanent title to land and issuing building permits
are overly long, complex, and political, the bulk of house construction
since Independence has taker piace outside Public Works control.  A review
of the building code and permit procedure was undertaken during preparation
of the proposed project. This review has produced recommendations aimed at
simplifying the cxisting procedures to obtain building permits and allow
lower building standards, which will be incorporated in the project (see
Annex 10).
2.14         District of Djibouti (DD).   The country is divided into five
administrative districts; the District of Djibouti (further divided into
three sub-districts or arrondissements) covers the city areas. Rather than
a true Mayor, tcxw head of the District administration represents the
national authorities in thc city, as his title (Commissaire de la R1pu-
blique) implies.   The District of Djibouti which  is  supervised  by  the
Kinistry of the Interior, is zesponsible for issuing licenses anu permits,
mad provîdes police and emergency services (floods, fires, etc.).  Two of
its most important functions are garbage collection and street cleaning,
which are handled by the Technical Services Department.   The Government
collects  taxes  for  these  services   which go  directly  to  the national
Treasury.   The District has no  financial autonomy,  all of its recelpts
being central guverument cransfers.  The Technical Services Department of
the DD employs a total of 389 staff (of which two are expatriate
supervisors financed by FAC); 136 of these are specifically employed in
refuse collection and street cleaning.   An organization  chart of DD is
included (Annex 3).
2.15        Land Office (LO).  The Land Office which is under the titular
control of the Ministry of Finance, processes all requests for plots,
collects registry fees and propQrty taxes, and manages public land
reserves. This agency is divided into three divisions: the Public Property
Division which manages all public land, the Survey Division which handles
all topographic work, and the Records and Titles Division which registers
all titles.   The Public  Property  Division  processes  approximately  200
provisional or final property concessions per year.  Drafting of decrees
presently is needed for concessions ranging from a single plot to a major
site. The Survey Division is currently able to handle one application per
day or roughly 300 per year.   The Survey Division therefore needs to be
strengthened if its handling capacity is to be increased. The Land Records
and Titles Division is able to meet current demand comfortably; however, it
requires becter registration and filing systers.  An organization chart of
LU is included (Annex 3).
2.16       The Société Immobilière de Djibouti (SID) (Rousing Agency) is the
parastatal agency responsible for developing and managing housing for
lover-  and  middle-income  groups.    Until  1975,  SID  benefited  from
concessional financing from the French Caisse Centrale de Coopération
Economique (CCCE), a minoricy shareholder in SID. Since this financing has
been  discontinued, no new  projects  have  been  undertaken.   Between  its



- 8 -
creation in 1956 and 1975, SID bullt some 2,120 housing units, of which it
still owns about 780, the rest having been sold through rent-purchase
agreemencs. 0f the 7b0 dwellinge, 50Z are under lease-purchase contracte,
and the balance under simple lease contracte.  SID has a total staff of 34
persons   to  manage   the  portfolio   of  properties  under   lease  and
lease-purchase.  SID has undertaken no new operation sinoe 1975.  SID has
assets totalling US$6.2 million of which US$3.6 million is invested in term
deposits with five Djibouti banks.  In the period 1980-1983 delinquencies
in payuents on leases and lease-purchase have averaged 282 of SID's
portfolio. SID's management advised during appraisal that this was due to
the fact that penalties for late payment are not accepted under Djiboutian
law and SID's only recourse against late payers is to seek a judguent
through the legal system.   A condition of disbursement for the Salines
Ouest component wlll be that SID reduce their present delinquent accounts
to lees than 20% of their portfolio. Thereafter the Government shall cause
SID to maintain the accounte delinquent for more than three months in its
portfolio of leased and lease purchase properties to less than 20% (para.
6.04).
2.17        Caisse de Développement de Djibouti (CDD) (Development Bank).
The Caisse de Développement de Djibouti is a parastatal agency founded in
January 1983 as a development bank with capital from the Gçvernment (51%),
CCCE (14%), the Banque Européenne d'Investissement (14%) and six local
coumrcial banks (21Z). The objective of CDD le to make medium- and long-
term loans to industry, transport, fishing, housing and in particular to
email- and medium-scale enterprises which generate employment.  CDD is an
organization still in its lnfancy and as yet does not have its own payuent
facilities; it uses those of a commercial bank.  CDD was formed primarily
tO  support  directly  productive  investments;  however,  its  statutes
specifically provide for the granting of loans for low- and intermediate-
cost housing provided that these do not exceed 40Z of the corporation's net
worth. CDD has a total current staff of five persons, the director ie an
expatriate recruited by CCCE.   At the time of appraisal CDD had granted
loans amounting to DF 55 million (US$310,000), of which DF 25 million
(US$140,000) to the private sector for real estate purchases, DF 15 million
(US$85,000) to commercial firos for equipoent and DF 15 million (US$85,000)
for farm equipment.  CDD ensures that it has proper guarantees and makes
mortgage loans at 8% interest for a period not exceeding 15 years.
Mortgage loans are subject to a ceiling of DF 3 million (US$17,000) each.
C. Governuent Initiatives in the Sector
2.18          Urban Master Plan.   A Master Plan study for the long-term
development of the city of Djibouti has been prepared, with financing from
the European Development Fund.   The study, completed in February 1981,
recommends the development of new residential areas to the west of the city
in the Balbala area, improvement of conditions in Balbala itself, and cor-
rection of the drainage problem in the Old Wards.  The general approach
suggested by the Master Plan is sound, calling for standards of housing and
other urban facilities to be set according to affordability criteria.



- 9 -
2.19       Ibuslng.  Since 1975 the Goverament has constructed 410 housing
units,  to bouse the Djibouti army and security forces.   Although  the
Governnent of Abu-Dhabi offered financing for several hundred houslng units
after  Independence, only  about  50 were  actually  built.   Recently, a
dermonstration project for 300 finished houses (Cité Cheikh Osman) vas
undertaken by MPWUH with Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti financing. Construction
cost estimates lndicated that under full cost recovery, these units would
be affordable only to 5% of the population.
2.20       The DD leveled and demarcated 650 plots adjacent to Balbala in
1982, primarily to relocate people from the mast crowded areas of the cor-
munity but also to settle refugees and to resettle a small squatter group
currently located next to the offices of NPWUH. No infrastructure services
vere provided.  This vas a successful experience and the District would
like to continue this process until all of Balbala has basic road access
and all resicdents are on demarcated plots.
2.21       Education.   The Govermeant is acting rapidly to expand primAry
education; primary school attendance ta the city as a whole is about 60% of
the relevant scbool-age population. However, literacy is still low, as is
the level of marketable ekills among the population in general. Only 9% of
the population can read, vrite and couut.   Several donors are financing
construction of primary and secondary schools, including vocational
schools, as well as providing teachers. A primary teacher training college
has been in operation since 1980.  However, there is still a shortage of
qualified candidates for admission to this college and Djibouti will
continue to depend on expatriate teachers for many years to come.
2.22       Water and Electricity are provided by state owned companies, the
Water Department of Djibouti (WDD) and the Djibouti Electricity Board (DEB)
(which is attached to the Ministry of Industry).  The water distribution
network in the city needs rehabilitation. A WHO-CP sector mission visited
Djibouti in April 1981 and prepared a report of its findings dated December
1981. The African Development Fund agreed in May 1983 to finance a water
supply project for the city of Djibouti based on a study by a Belgian firm
(Tractionel) of investment needs for reinforcement of water supply systems
which vas financed by Belgian technical assistance.   This project wlli
provide 22.4 km of vater distribution network with 38 standpipes and 35
fire hydrants in Balbala; individual connections are envisaged later as
needed.
2.23        Industry and Artisanal Production.   Djibouti has only a small
local market and little artisanal or industrial activity has developed.
A small industrialization unit has been set up in the Ministry of Industry
but, as yet, no services are offered to small or large scale industry. The
labor force is lacking in industrial skills; while the need for basic
training is videspread, training facilities are not necessarily compatible
with the needs as more fully covered in the Education and Training Sector
Hemorandum of December 10, 1983 (Report Number 4682-DJI).  Wage rates in
the formal sector are high, sustained by minimum wage legislation.
Development  of  productive  activities  in  the  industrial  sector  will
therefore be extremely difficuLt.

B. Bank Involvement ini Dj ibouti
2.24       Djibouti joined the Bank and the Association on October 2, 1980.
Since then a Technical Assistance Project (CR 1232-DJI) and a iighway Main-
tenance Project (CR 1303-DJI) have been approved. The Technical Assistance
Project  (Credit of US$3 million)  became effective in May  1982.    lhe
project, which is co-financed with UNDP, provides technical assistance to
the Directorates of Planning and Statistics.  The project has encountered
severe difficulties in the planning area; however a major reorganization of
the Planning Directorate is now under way.   Assistance to the Statistics
Directorate has been satisfactory. The Highway Maintenance Project (Credit
of USf6 million) became effective in october 1983.  Consultants have been
selected  for  pre-investment  studies.    This  project  will  assist  the
Government  to carry out  road maintenance  throughout  the country.    A
geothernal project was approved by the Board on May 31, 1984.  This will
thus be the fourth project ïn Djibouti since it joined the Bank Group. An
economic mission from the Bank visited Djibouti in June 1983 and bas
recently completed a report on its findings, "Ecunomic Situation and
Prospects," October 30, 1983 (Report No. 4692-DJI). The Bank participated
in a roundtable donors' conference held in Djibouti in November 1983.  A
possible education project focusing on expansion and improvement of primary
education lias recently been appraised following the recommendations of the
Education and Training  Sector Memorandum of December 10, 1983 (Report
Number 4682-DJ1).  This project will provide primary education facilities
for the underprivileged rural and urban areas, including those to be
assisted by the proposed urban development project.
E. Rationale and Background for Bank Involvement
2.25      The rationale for Bank involvement in the project is as follows:
(a) Djibouti is a city-state; with the country's population
concentrated in the city, an urban project is the best
vehicle to have a significant impact on a large segment of
the population, given the scarce investment resources and
limited agricultural development potential of the country;
(b) the bank's substantial experience with low-income shelter
projects in Africa gives it a comparative advantage în
working with the Government to develop realistic policies
for the urban sector emphasizing cost recovery and lower
investment costs;
(c) the project is in line witn government priorities and Bank
strategy in Djibouti for institution building and will
strengthen the urban institutions and convert this into au
effective and financially viable sector; and
(d)  the  Bank's  participation  in  the  sector  has  laid  the
foundation for the Bank to coordinate and attract other
donors, includingUSAID, and CCE, which are co-financing this
project.



- il -
2.26     The Goverament  of Djibouti  initially approached  the Bank  for
assistance in 1981 regarding the proposed project, following which the
Goverument commissioned a feasibility study for a program of investuents
financed by an IDA Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$500,000,
carried out by SEDES/Groupe Huit, a consortium of French consultants in
1982/83. Throughout the feasibility study, there has been a close dialogue
between the Comité de Suivi (an interministerial committee established by
the Presidency) and the Bank Group. This dialogue helped to translate the
program of investments proposed by the feasibility study into specific
project components suitable for donor financing.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The proposed project which vas identified ln 1981 is ln line with
government priorities and Bank strategy. Its objectives are to:
(a) increase the absorptive capacity of key agencies by providing
staff training, equipment, and a clearer and more appropriate
framevork for the management of urban investments;
(b) improve the living conditions of the urban poor in Djibouti,
particularly the residents of Balbala and the Old Wards; and
(c) introduoe more rigor in cost recovery practices, with special
emphasis on improving the revenue base of the local agencies
and recycling recovered project funds.
B. Project Components
3.02      The project will include the following five components which are
outlined below and described in detail in Annex 1.
<a) Old Wards.  Upgrading and drainage works in the Old Wards.
The infrastructure works vill alleviate stormwater damage and
provide protection from flooding of all low-lying areas.
Roads, increased water distribution, fire hydrants and refuse
collection will also be included.   The actions vill benefit
all the wards (161 ha. and 10,390 families) but will be par-
ticularly centered on wards 3, 5, and 6 (63 ha., 4,529 fami-
lies).
(b) Balbala.   Upgrading of a squatter settlement containing the
poorest segment of the population on a total of 137 ha. with
4,900 households; this will include provision of roads, public
lighting, refuse collection, and construction of a market.
Water is being provided under a separately financed African
Development Fund credit.
(c) Salines Ouest. A site and service development as a joint ven-
ture with the Société Immobilière de Djibouti (SID) on land
owned by them.   This will be a first phase development to
provide 176 plots, with the construction of 106 core housing
units ranging between 16 and 35 m2 each,  the remaining 70
serviced plots vill be sold vith services but no housing.
SID's contribution will include the land and housing units;
the project will finance the cost of the off-site and on-site
infrastructure.
(d) Institutional Support.  Technical support including staffing,
training and equipment will be provided to the Land Office,



- 13 -
the District of Djibouti, SID, CDD, and a small Project
Management Unit (PMU) (para. 3.03).
(e) Rousing Credit.   Credit for some 100 new housing units of
US$9,700 each approximately and some 600 loans of approximate-
ly US$1,400 each to improve existing houses in Balbala and the
Old Wards.
C. Institutional Support
3.03        InstitutionaL support and training is considered a key element
of the project in view of the much needed institutional strengthening of
the urban agencies  and accounts  for  24% of  total  project  costs.   It
includes managerial and financial assistance to SID and CDD technical
training for the staff of the LO and DD, as follows:
(a) Support to SID will include the provision of a specialist in
management  and  financial  institutions  to  assist  in  the
reorganization of SID into a more effective housing agency to
undertake low-income housing promotion activities and better
management of their existing housing stock.
(b) Support to CDD will be focused on strengthening the agency's
capabliity to finance low-cost housing ard ensure cost recovery
on their loans.   It wiLl include the provision of a financial
axnd managerial specialist and a work foreman.
(c) Support to the LO will strengthen the three divisions of this
agency (Public Property, Land Records and Land Conservation).
It vill include staff training abroad as well as advanced
training   at   the   Centre   de   Formation   Professionnelle
Administrative (CFPA) and on-the-job training.
(d)  Support provided to DD will aim at strengthening the Technical
Services Division which provides for household refuse collection
and disposal.  This vill include short-term training abroad for
the garage chief as well as a basic training program for diesel
mechanics and an advanced training for auto mechanics, both at
CFPA, as well as on-the-job training.
3.04        A project launch will be held to familiarize the personnel of
the urban agencies with all aspects of project implementation, including
Bank   and   USAID   requirements  regarding   procurement,   disbursements,
reporting, accounts and audits.   This is considered warranted in view of
the unfamiliarity of Djiboutian agencies with Bank and USAID-financed
projects.

IV. PROJWECT IMPLEMEUTATION DETAILS
A. Project Cbsts
4.01      The total cost of the Project, net of taxes and duties, is esti-
mated at US$15.2 million (DF 2,705 million), of which 62Z or US$9.5 million
is estimated to be forei8n exchange. This cost includes refinancing of an
IDA Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of US$500,000 which vas approved in
1981 for project preparation and has been almost totally disbursed.
4.02      Physical contingencies amounting to 9.9% of total base cost have
been estimated at 15% for civil works based on preliminary desigas for all
sites.   Detailed designs for the infrastructure works  to be carried out
during the first year of the implementation period will be available by
Board presentation.   No physical contingencies were allowed for technical
assistance, studies or housing credit.   Price contingencies of 3.5% for
1984, 8.0% for l985, and 91 thereafter have been applied for both the
foreig- and local cost components.  The resulting price escalation factor
represents 17.6% of total base costs.   The project will be exempt from
taxes and duties. Summary cost estimates adjusted to January 1984 levels,
net of taxes and duties, are provided in Table 4.1 below. A more detailed
breakdown is provided in Annex 2.
4.03      Cost estimates for equipment and vehicles are based on recent bid
prices and quotations in Djibouti.  The costs of civil works and construc-
tion are in liae with the costs of recent similar works in the country.
4.04      The project provides for an estimated 55 man-months of consulting
services for the preparation of the detailed design and bid documents and
for uorks supervision. It also provides for 179 man-months of consultants
for technical assistance to the agencies involved in the project and to the
Project Management Unit.
B. Project Financlng

4.06           The  IDA Credit  (US$5 million)  will  cover  40X  of  total
costs for vehicles and equipment net of taxes, 50% of total costs net of
taxes for civil and construction works, 50Z of total costs for detailed
design and supervision, 40Z of total coste for housing credit and
refinancing of the PPF amounting to US$500,000.  T1-, USAID grant (US$5.5
million) will finance a share of ail project components.  Caisse Centrale
financing (US$1 million) will cover institutional support to CDU and public
lighting in Balbala.   The Governument contribution amounting  to US%k.7
million will cover local salaries of project personnel, local expenditures
relating to consulting services, 20Z of total expenditures for housing
credit and additional operating expenses of the Land Office beginning in
1986.   The SI» contribution (USfl  million) will cover the core housing
units in Salines Ouest.   The Bank vill review the qualifications of all
personnel proposed for technical assistance and institutional support and
will approve all appointments made.
C. Flow of Foeds
4.07        The Government will make the proceeds of the IDA credit, the
USAID grant,the CCCE loan and its own contribution available to the
implementing agencies, either as grants in the case of components for which
there is traditionally no cost recovery or as subsidiary loans to SID and
CDD and government allocations to LO and DD where costs will be recovered.
To ensure prompt availability of funds at the start of the project, a
Revolving Fund (Special Account) will be opened at the Treasury with an
initial deposit of US$500,000, corresponding to the largest estimated
quarterly disbursement by IDA (para. 6.03 (b) (ii)). All disbursements by
IDA  will  be  made  to  this  special  account.    Government  and  USAID
contributions will be placed in a Project Account at the Treasury.  All
payments to the implementing &;eacier will be made by the PHU from the
Project Accouat and Special Account.  The ID/ and governaent couaterpart
funds for on-site infrastructure at Salines Ouest will be onlent to SID at
8X for a period of five years with three years' grace; the USAID and
counterpart funds for housing credit will be oalent to CDD at 6% for a
period of 12 years with one year grace. CDD will make loans for housing
improvement and new construction to final beneficiaries at 8% for 12 years
with one year grace.   CDI  presently makes housing loans at 8%;  this
interest rate will be nominally positive in real terms given the expected
inflation rate in Djibouti during the term of these loans. These terns and
conditions were confirmed at negotiations (para. 6.03(c)).   The flow of
funds is shown in Annex 4.
D. Project Implementation
4.08       The project will utilize the existing institutions and agencies
and will strengthen their operations as they implement the project.   The
Land Office will have contracting responsibility (maItre d'ouvrage) for
upgrading at Balbala and the Old Wards; execution responsibility (maltre
d'oeuvre) will rest with MPWUH). SID will have contracting responsibility
for the site and service project at Salines Ouest; execution responsibility
will rest with MPWUH (para. 6.03 (d). The District of Djibouti vill have



- 17 -
contracting respousibility for the construction of a small market at
Balbala and management of refuse collection ln the city, including the
low-income areas.
4.09          The PMU vill consist of seven people, a PMU director, aa
expatriate adviser, two accoantants, and three support staff (a secretary,
a driver and a messenger).  Appointment of the PMU director, who has been
selected after consultation with IDA, viii be a condition of credit
effectivenesa (para. 6.03 (a)).  The role of the PMU will be to:  program
project execution, ensure liaison between the executing agencies, authorize
payment for project expenses, administer technical assistance, and provide
for monitoring and overall supervision of the project, including the

4.11          Procurement of equipment and vehicles financed through the
Project vill total US$0.7 million; they will be packaged as far as possible
and awarded on the basis of international competitive biddiug (ICB) in
accordance with World Bank guidelines.  A margin of preference, equal to
15% of the CIF bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and
import  taxes,  whichever  is  less,  will  be  allowed  for  domestic
manufacturers.   Office equipment (US$0.l million) over US$10,O0O in value
and less than US$20,000 will be purchased through local competitive bidding
(LCB), in which foreign suppliers are eligible to participate, folloving
local  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  the  World  Bank.    Office
equipment and supplies valued at lesa than US$10,OOO will be purchased by
local shopping with at least three price quotations (para. 6.01 (a)).
4.12          Civil works,  totalling  US$7.4 million,  comprising  roads,
drainage, water supply, sewerage and electricity will be awarded through
ICs, in accordance with World Bank guidelines.  A preference of 7.5% vill
be applied to bids from local civil vorks contractors, if any. Contracte
for simple works such as those for the cleaning of existing drains, land
filling, the construction of the Balbala market and the improvement of the
District garage facilities, totalling US$0.9 million, will be awarded
through LCB, following local procedures acceptable to the Associatinn
(para. 6.01 (a)).
4.13      Engineering services for detailed design and supervision, consul-
tants for training and technical assistance totalling US$3.2 million will
be obtained from consulting firms or consultants on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the World Bank.   Incremental operating expenses include
US$0.7 million for staff salaries, for which procurement is not appli-
cable.   All cont-acts above the value of US$50,000 for equipment and
US$100,000 for civil vorks vill be subject to prior Bank review; they vill
cover 75% of the value of works  and 75% of equipment value.   Other
contracts will be subject to post-award review.
4.14         Government's present procurement procedures generally allow
discretion to Government in awarding contracta. Agreement to comply with
Bank Group procurement guidelines and use procedures for LCB and shopping
that are acceptable to tle Association vas confirmed during negotiations
(para. 6.01 (a)).   Procurement procedures to be followed were reviewed
during appraisal and will be closely monitored by both the PHU and the
joint Bank and USAID supervision missions.



- 21 -
F. Disbursements
4.15      Disbursements from the proposed IDA Credit of SDR 4.9 million
(US$5.0 million) will be made such that the total amount disbursed under
each category vill be as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures and 95Z of local expenditures up
to 40% of total coste of equipment, vehicles and supplies;
(b) 100% of expenditures up to 30Z ot total costs for civil works;
(c) 100% of expenditures up to 30% of total costs for consulting
services;
(d) 100% of expenditures up to 33% of total cost6 for housing
credit;and
(e) 100% refinancing of PPF.
The participation of USAID is expected to be in the form of joint
financing. An understanding concerning co-financing arrangements has been
vorked out between USAID and IDA which would accommodate the availability
of USAID funds in any particular year or for any contract since USAID will
share financing of all components. All contracts financed either by IDA or
USAID or jointly by both will be procured in accordance with World Bank
procurement guidelines (paras. 4.11 - 4.14). The Development Credit
Agreement containe the cross-effectivenese and cross-default clauses normal
for this type of co-financing. Both institutions vill keep each other
closely informed of any disbursement request as well as of any disbursement
made under said contracts.
4.16    All disbursements vill be fully documented and will be monitored by
the PMU. Refinancing of PPF (US$500,000) vlll be made as soon as the
credit becomes effective.  The estimated schedule of disbursement from the
IDA credit is shown in Annex 7. Since this is one of the first IDA
projects in Djibouti, there is no disbursement profile for the country.
The disbursement schedule used is based on the disbursement profile for IDA
credits in the region, adapted to take account of refinancing of the PPF of
US$500,u00 and establishment of a special account at the Treasury of
US$500,000.
G. Account8 and Audit
4.17      Separate project accounts vill be established by the LO, DD, SID,
and CDD.
4.18      The LO and PMU will be required to complete preparation of
financial statements of project transactions within three months of the
close of the government fiscal year. Auditorst opinions on these financial
statements will be prepared by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and
submitted to the Government and to IDA within eight months of the end of
the government fiscal year.  Independent auditors are available in Djibouti



- 22 -
and presently perfora such audits.   The audit report of the PMU vill
include a separate analysis of the use of IDA funds under the special
account.   CDD and SID vill be required to submit audited project related
accounts to IDA vithin eight montho of the close of cheir fiscal years.
4.19        Ihe PMU will prepare and transmit to the Association progress
reports each quarter that vill briefly identify major problems and
recommend solutions; review the performance of ioplementing agencies; and
maintain performance indicators in fulfilling project goals.
4.20       à Project Completion Report will be prepared by the PMU and sent
to IDA within six months of the close of disbursements.
B. Mnitoring, Evaluation und Supervision
4.21       lhe PMU will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the
progresa of the project.  IDA supervision of the project, which vill  be
carrled out jointly with USAID, will require up to 95 weeks of staff and
consultant time over the period of project implementation.  Ibis level of
effort is justified by the technical assistance provided by the supervision
team.   The level of involvement vill be concentrated in the first two
years, after which the PMU vill have acquired greater management
experience.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Cash Flovs
5.01       The cash flow for the project is shown in Annex 4.  By 1990 when
all proiect components have been implemented, the cumulative net inflows
for the project will be US$ 1.9 million. The cumulative surplus by the
year 1994 will be US$12 million. The bulk of the surplus funds relate to
the sale of government land and the recovery of infrastructure costs at
balbala and the Uld Wards in a shorter time than the repayment period on
other components. This surplus, which will be deposited in the Urban
Development Fund (UDF) to be established at the lreasury, will allow for
replicability of the project in other urban areas of Djibouti. The
establishment of an Urban Development Fund at the Treasury, to which all
directly recovered costs will be credited, including the sale of land at
Salbala and the Old Wards, will be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that the UDF will be used to
finance further civil works in urban areas of Djibouti (paras. 5.07, 6.01
(g), and 6.03 (b) (i)).
B. Cost Recovery
5.02       The cost recovery measures adopted are snlch that they will relate
the charges borne by the beneficiaries to the benefits they receive.
On-site infrastructure costs in the Old Wards, Balbala and Salines Ouest
will be recovered directly through plot sales in the case of the Old Wards
and through property taxes in Balbala and Salines Ouest. Loans made by CDD
for home improvement and home purchase will be recovered directly through
loan repayments by the beneficiaries. Operating costs of CDD will be
recovered directly from beneficiaries through the spread allowed CDD on the
on-lending terms. The costs that are recovered directly account for 73% of
total project costs.
5.03      An additional 14% of total project costs will be recovered
indirectly through property and refuse taxes payable by the population of
the city. The costs recovered in this manner are off-site infrastructure
at ialbala and Salines Ouest, the incremental operating costs at LO and the
institutional support at DU to improve refuse collection. Refuse taxes are
paid to the LU by residents of tlie city, including the Old Wards but not
kialbala. Refuse taxes vill also be charged to Balbala residents once
collection is started there. An analysis of receipts on refuse taxes
carried out during appraisal showed an increase in collection during the
period 1980-82. Property and refuse tax collection will be closely
monitored by the joint Bank/USAID supervision missions. Both direct and
indirect recovery will be closely monitored by the PMU, IDA and USAID
supervision missions. Together, direct and indirect recovery account for
87% of total project costs. The balance of 13Z covers the institutional
support to LO, DD, SID, CDD and the PMU.  These costs are not considered
recoverable, and they will be absorbed by the Governinent. A breakdown of
cost recovery is summarized in Table 5.1 below.

C. Recurrent Costa
5.04       The major share of recurrent costs attributable to the project
are for maintenance expenses, operating costs of the agencies and the PMU,
and the operation of the market at Balbala. Maintenance costs will accrue
primarily to the individual hone owners and landlords for maintaiuing their
dwellings. The Government will be responsible for maintenanoe costs on the
roads, drainage and water supply systems which amDunt to 5% of capital
works or approximately DF 11.87 million (US$67,000) in annual charges for
the Old Wards, DF 3.9 million (US$22,000) for Balbala and DF 2.4 million
(US$13,000) for Salines Ouest. Annual project related operating costs of
the implementing agencies will be recovered from the property tax and
refuse collection tax. The recur.ent expenses for operation of the market
at Balbala will be covered by direct user charges.
D. Affordability
5.05      According to surveys coaducted during project preparation, tenant
households in the Old Wards spend about 21% of their lncome on housing
(rent, water, electricity, and fuel) while households in Balbala spend 27%
of their income on lousing (rent, water, and fuel). Affordability calcula-
tions for Salines Ouest are based on household expenditures for tenants at
existing housing development estates at Einguela, Stade and Progrès who
spend about 30% of their income on housing (rent, water, electricity, and
fuel). The income distribution of households in these areas is preseuted
in Annex 9, page 1.
5.06         Home improvement loans will be available for improvement of
existing homes or for building additional rooms at Balbala and the Old
Wards amounting to DF 240,000 (US$1,370).  Based on an estimate of 15% of
income spent on house improvement, these loans (repayable over 12 years at
8Z) will be affordable by households above the 45th percentile in Balbala
and above the 7th percentile in the Old Wards. Calculations of affordabi-
lity have been done for the various options available at Salines Ouest,
Anne% 9, page 2. The various options are affordable by households ranging
from the l.th percentile for a one-room unit on a small (72 m2) plot to
the 35th percentile for a two-room unit on a large plot (120 m2). Plots of
160 m2i will be marketed com ercially and are affordable at the 41st
percentile level.
E. Replicability
5.07       A mechanism has been set up for replicability of the project in
the target areas of the city which were included in the feasibility study
but are not financed by the proposed project.  Detailed designs for the
proposed project are being financed by the Technical Assistance Project (CR
1303-DJI). Funds are included in the proposed project to finance detailed
designs of future sites and the Government will prepare by December 31,



- 26 -
1984 a priority plan setting down the sites that should next be upgraded
aid developed (para. 6.01 (e)). The Government will undertake to use the
funds allocated in the proposed project for preparation of detailed designs
for the proposed future sites (para. 6.01 (f)). The Goverament will also
undertake to use the funds recovered in the UDF to finance the civil works
for the proposed future sites (para. 6.01 (g)). SID will undertake to use
the funds recovered from the sale of plots and core housing units at
Salines Ouest to develop other sections of the Salines Ouest site (para.
6.01 (h>). The project wilL thus establish a clear means for replicating
the results by (i) establishing priorities for developnent of the future
sites, (ii) providing funding for detailed designs of the future sites, and
(iii) by establishing a means to finance future development of these sites
using the UDF (para. 6.03 (b) (i)).
F. Urban Poverty Impact
5.08        The poverty income level per capita amounts to DF 29,857
(US$168) per year. Ilousehold incomes amount to DE 179,142 (US$1,008) per
year. Over 90% of the households in the Old Wards (9,350 households) and
virtually 100% of the liouseholds in Balbala (2,500 households) have incomes
below the poverty level. Therefore, these components which represent 34Zof
total project costs, and will benefit slightly more than 11,850 poor
families, are virtually serving the target poverty group as defined by the
Bank.
G. Project Benefits
5.U9       lhe benefits from this project fali into two categories: direct
benefits to the final beneficiaries and indirect benefits and externali-
ties.  Direct benefits have been quantified for project components consti-
tuting 69% of total project e:osts and yield an overall weighted average
economic rate of return of 2ff.
5.10        Economic rates of return based on quantifiable direct benefits
have been calculated for the Old Wards, Balbala, and Salines Ouest sites.
Benefits were estirnated as a stream of incremental rental values, based on
surveys of inarket rents for similar housing in each area.  No adjustrnents
were made for possible changes in market prices due to tlhe project, as it
is expected that population growth will be adequate to sustain demand at
current real prices. Costs include all costs for infrastructure and



- 27 -
shelter construction, including shelter improvement, design and project
management, maiatenance costs and technical assistance to the related
implementing agencies.   The foreign exchange rate used in the calculation
is the same as the market exchange rate. The individual economic rates of
return, together with the results of the sensitivity analysis, the cost and
benefit streams are presented in Annex 8.
5.11      The indirect benefits of the project fall into two categories:
(a)  Improvement in capacity of urban institutions.
The project wi1L have a substantial impact on the key urban
institutions by improving their operations and enabling them
to  implement  future  projects.    The  overall  financial
management capability of these agencies will also be
enhanced.
(b) Enhancement of capacity for locally-financed projects.
It is not feasible to expect foreign financing to provide
the major portion of urban services and shelter needed by
Djibouti in  the  years  to  come.   This  project includes
initiatives-through the development of an urban development
fund at the Treasury and the financial participation of SID
in  Salines  Ouest-to  develop  alternative  methods  for
financing urban services and lower-income shelter delivery.
5.12      The benefits described above do not lend themselves to quantifi-
cation.  However they represent an attempt to create the capacity through
Institutions and approaches, to replicate the direct benefits of the pro-
ject.   They,  therefore,  constitute  an important justification for this
project.
K. Project Risks
5.13       The principal risks associated with this project are inherent in
the iixexperience of the institutions which will be involved in the imple-
mentation of the project.   Bank supervision efforts will pay particular
attention to these risks during the early stage of supervision. The speci-
fic risks are concerned with project execution capacity of agencies and
cost recovery.
5.14      Project Execution Capacity.  Weaknesses in the execution capacity
of the implementation agencies may lead to delays in the project.   This
risk is limited because of the special attention given tO institutional
support.   The possibility of slippage and related cost overruns will be
minimized by the provision of consultants who will assist the Government in
civil works supervision.   Implementation schedules have been adjusted to
reflect possible delays; the Bank missions will supervise closely the civil
works iin the first phase of upgrading in the Old Wards before allowing the
next  phases  to proceed.    In  this  way  adjustments  will be made  where
necessary.   Should implementation delays with the resultant cost overruns
occur, consideration vill be given to cutting back on the last phase in the
Old Wards and on housing credit.

5.15       Cost Recovery.  Djibouti has a tradition of non-payment for ser-
vices ln low-income areas; cost recovery is therefore a risk. Assurances
were reached at negotiations that the LO vill follow the measures provided
for land sale (para. 6.02 (a), and Annex 10) and that the funds collected
from the  sale vill be deposited  in the Urban Development  Fund  (para.
5.01).  This risk is reduced in the project because of the large pent-up
demand for land ownership in Djibouti.   Land acquisition ln the target
areas vill be tied to repayment of upgrading costs. New measures have been
established, at the request of the Bank, for obtainiug simplified building
permits with lower building standards for Balbala and the Old Wards (para.
6.OZ (b), and Annex 10).  These measures provide that owners of existing
structures in Balbala and the Old Wards vill have a period of three years
to purchase the land on which the structures are located.  An upgrading fee
equal to the prioe of 10 m2 of serviced land vill be charged to all
structure owners who do not undertake to purchase the land within the
prescribed period.  Should the owners not exercise their purchase option
within the three-year period, the plots will be sold by the LO to other
purchasers, with priority given to existing tenants to purchase these plots
within one year after the expiration of the structure owner's option.
These measures, which vill secure land tenure, will also ensure full cost
recovery of the Infrastructure costS (see also Annex 10, Article III.3A).
Repayment on housing credit will be closely monitored by CDD which will
receive institutional support as part of this project.

Rater Rates Study
Marne of Reference
1.            The main objective of this water rates study is to lay the
groundwork for the introduction of new potable water rates, the structure
and level of which are to reflect the real cost of service, while also
taking into account the financial capacity of the various income groups.
The new rates should also encourage long-term conservation of water.
2.         The first phase of the study shall review in detail the current
rate structure and its changes ovnr the last ten years as compared with
changes ln the cost of living.  It shall cover the cost per m3 of water as
well as the charges for lease of meters, maintenance of connections and
meters, cost of private connections and similar services.
3.            The Consultant, while giving the book value of total fixed
assets, shall revalue them as of the date of the study, mentioning all
lnvestments to be made over the next ten years.
4.          The Consultant shall project water consumption by user categorN
and monthly volume: less than 10 m3, from 10 to 20 m3, from 20 to 50 m
and more than 50 m3.
5.             Operating costs shall be projected year by year, based on
expected consumption and planned investments. The share of unbilled water
should steadily decrease from itS current level to 20% by the end of the
10-year period.
6.        The long-term marginal cost per m3 of water is to be compuced on
the  cost of planned expansions  and projected operating  costs.   A  10%
discount rate shall be applied to water costs and volumes.
7.         Using existing studies, the Consultant shall draw up a table of
income groups.
8.            The Consultant shall then propose a rate policy designed to
accomplish tuie following objectives:
(a) the lowest income groups should have access to potable water
at a cost not exceeding 2% of the household budget;
(b) as many households as possible should be able to have
private connections, to be achieved by reducing the charge
for installation to the actual cost and spreading payment
over four years at low interest;



- 76 -
AN<NEX 11
Page 2 of 2
(c)  projected  operating  costs,  debt  service  and  capital
investment should be fully covered.
9.           Kecommendations shall be made on the rate structure and the
levels to apply by consuaption category.
10.        Alternatives are to be proposed under which revenue would cover
only 20Z, 40X, 60% and 80% of capital cost respectively.
11.       Each alternative should be examined for accessibility and for its
foreseeable impact on overall consumption.
12.          An indexing formula should be proposed whereby rates can be
adjusted each year to reflect price changes.
13.        For each alternative, the rate of return on the revalued fixed
assets is to be calculated by dividing net operating revenue, including
provision  for  depreciation  of  fixed  assets  but  before  payoent  of
debt-service obligations, by the average of revalued net fixed assets for
the preceding and current years.
14.         The time allowed for the study is six months, aplit into two
phases.    An  interim  report  is  to  be  submitted  after  three  months.
Following its approval, the final report can be prepared. Both reports are
to be sent in duplicate to the World Bank.
15.       The Water Authority (Service des Eaux) will provide the following
to assist the ronsultant:
(a) a full-time engineer to vork in conjunction with him on the
studies and eventually take on the responsibility for
regular updating of the study data;
(b) a furnished office and secretarial support;
(c) a vehicle;
(d)  access to all available data, existing reports, statistics
and annual accounts.
