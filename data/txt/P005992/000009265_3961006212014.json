physical capacity\n            to serve better the secondary-school-aged population and\n            strengthening institutional capacity under a decentralized\n            framework. The project will strengthen the capacity of the\n            National Ministry of Culture and Education (NMCE) to provide\n            policy guidance and supervision, as defined by the federal\n            education law. Additionally, the project will strengthen\n            institutional capacity by: 1) modernizing sector management;\n            2) improving administrative efficiency; and 3) improving\n            productivity . Several subcomponents, such as the School\n            Innovation Programs and school rehabilitation will be\n            implemented with community participation."}, "docdt": "1994-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
