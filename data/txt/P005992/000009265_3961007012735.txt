MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEKNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE                     DiRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC FOR A
DECENTRALIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT OF
SECONDARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.    1 submit for your approval the following me m  and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Argendne Republic for the equivalent of US$190 million to help
finance a project to improve Argendna's recenty-decentralized secondary education
system. The loan would have a 15-year repayment period including a grace period of five
years with loan amortization based on level repayments of principal.
2.    Background. After one of the most severe economic crises in the Region's recen
history, Argentia has embarked on a comprehensive program of structura refoms.
Reform of the social sectors-severely affected by fte economic crisis of the 1980s and
suffering from years of neg'ct-supports the Govermment's economic goals of ensuring
economic stability, long-term growth, and competitiveness in world markets.
3.    Argeina's education sector has deteriorated as a result of low and misdivcted
invesmts: public expenditues in education flucated sharply between 1980 and 1993;
and expendiures were mainly concenrt  on personnel. As a consequence, students
lack educaticnal materials, teacher morale is low, and physical facilites are in poor
conditon. The low quality and efficiency of secondary education -a crucial link with
the labor market-- is a major problem in Argentina. Evidence includes low scores on
achievement tests as well as excessive repetition and high dropouts. Forty-nine percent
of a sample of stuents tested in Buenos Aires scored 50 percent or less on a Spanish
proficiency test, while on a mathematics test 82 percent of stdents answered less tham
half the questions correctly. Low quality and efficiency tend to reduce the nmber of
secondary school-aged students (13-18 years old) in school so that only 56 percent of this
population natonwide is enrolled. These problems are in part attibutable to inadequate
spending on educational materials and other educational inputs, which is less than 5
percent of the education budget. Inefficiency is earated by low staff productivity,
with student-teacher ratios among the lowest in the region.
4.    To increase quality and efficiency in the education sector, the Goverment in
1993 passed and has begun to implement a new Federal Education Law (FEL). The FEL
provides a framework for reorganizing the management and internal structure of the
educational system. A central tenet of Government strategy is decentralization of the
provision, financing, and management of -a process carricd out for primary schools in
1978 and now recently completed for national secondary schools. This policy redefines
the roles of the cental and provincial governments: The provinces now finance and
adminisr all public pre-university education while the central goverment provides
policy guidance, estabLishes only basic curricular content, monitors student achievement,
and provides technical assistance. Long-term objectives outlinrd by the FEL comprise:
(i) raising compulsy education from 7 to 10 years, including one year of preschool; and



2
(ii) changing the curriculum of each cycle, converting the prmary level into a General
Basic Education cycle and establishing a multi-modal cycle at the secondary level. As
a first step towards improving sector productivity, the Government currenly is carrying
out a nationwide survey of education sector personnel.
5.    Transfer of the secondary schools formerly under federal control to the provinces
has created new demands and serious stresses on provincial managerial, fimacial, and
infrastructure capacity. The impact of this transfer varies widely among provinces. The
proposed project is designed to strengthen the capacity of a downsized NMCE to
establish qualitative norms, evaluate how well they are being achieved, and respond to
the demands of decentralization by strengthening provincial sector management and
implementation capacities, providing technical assistance and financing for pedagogical
improvements, and impro-ving urgently-needed infrastructure.
6.    Project Objectives. The objeetive of the project is to increa- student learning
in the seven selected provinces by financing improvements in the qiz-1.y and efficiency
of secondary education, strengthen institutional capacity under a decentralized framework
and increase/improve physical capacity to serve the secondary-school-aged population
better. The project would strengthen the capacity of the NMCE to provide policy
guidance and supervision, as defined by the FEL. Additionally, the project would
strengthen institutional capacity by: (i) modernizing sector management; (ii) improving
admiistrative efficiency; and (iii) improving productivity. Several subcomponents, such
as the School Innovation Programs, and school rehabilitation will be implemented with
community partucipation.
7.    Project Description. The project includes three components: (a) enhancement of
education qualitv (US$84.1 million, including contingencies, or 31 percent of total
project cost): provision of in-service training and other programs for upgrading sldls of
teachers and administrators, establishing meclianisms for assuing availability of
textbooks and teaching materials, and strengthening curriculum development; (b)
institutional stren , (US$84.5 million, including contingencies, or 31 percent of
total project cost): consolidating a new, downsized structure for NMCE by providing
technical and financial assistance to NMCE to operationalize its new role in areas of
curriculum, information, and student assessment; and strengthening the seven
participating provinces' capacities in the areas of management, budgeting, and
supervision. The project would support a more efficient and simple administration of the
sector. It would support improved sector productivity, develop human resource policies
to ensure more disciplined management and control of sector personnel, and develop
management information and student assessment systems; and (c) rehabilitation and
maintenance of physical infrastmcture (up to US$76.8 million, including contingencies,
or 28 percent of total project cost): repair and rehabilitation of provincial schools and
essential infrastructure; and establishing systems for rational use and continuing
maintenance of buildings. About 80 percent of the loan proceeds would be provided



3
directly to the seven participating provinces. The remainder would support the national
component.
8.    Seven provinces have been selected for this project -Cordoba, La Pampa,
Mendoza, Misiones, Neuqu6n, Rio Negro, and Santa Fe- on the basis of criteria
established jointly by the Bank and NMCE. Tese criteria were to: (i) have a signed
Transfer Agreement for secondary schools; (ii) indcate commitment to participate in the
National Management Information System (NMLS) and the National Student Assessment
System (NSAS); (iii) have prepared a satisfactory diagnosis of the provincial education
sector and a project proposal; (iv) demonstrate willingness to carry out reforms to
improve productivity and efficiency in the sector; and (v) have significant need to
improve secondary education coverage and quality as reflected by educational indicators.
The remaining 16 provinces would be eligible for participation in future projects, which
would complement the proposed project in objectives and design.
9.    Project Costs and Fanaciug. The proposed project would be financed by a Bank
loan of US$190 million or 71 percent of total project cost. The loan would cover 100
percent of foreign exchange expenditures and about 70 percent of estimated local costs
(excluding taxes). The Closing Date for the project would be June 30, 2000. Given the
social nature of the project, the bulk of project costs are composed of local expenditures.
These include technical assistance to develop a management information and a student
assessment system, teacher training, and rehabilitation of school facilities. The
Government of Argentina and the seven provincial governments would finance the
emaining US$78.7 million, including taxes and duties. The proposed cost-sharing is in
line with current guidelines for social sector projects. A subsidiary loan agreement will
be signed between the Ministry of Economy and each participating province. These
agreements will include a description of the provincial subproject, its financial and
project obligations, as well as prov_ons for: witdrawals, conditionalities, remedies,
and bearing the foreign exchange risk. The Bank will finance up to US$13 million
(approximately 7 percent of the proposed loan) retoactively for expenditures incurred
after June 15, 1994 and before the date of loan signing in accordance with Bank
procurement guidelines. Retroacive financing is required so the Federal and Provincial
Governments may begin the gradual implementation of the sector productivity study,
management and student assessment systems, and teacher training, and facilitate the
timely start-up of the project.
10.   Project Implementation. The project would be carried out within the existing
organizational strctures of the NMCE and PMEs, supported by project coordination
units at both the federal (the National Project Coordination Unit, NPCU) and the
provincial level (Prvincial Project Coordination Units, PPCUs). Each province would
be responsible for executing its respective subproject while the center (NPCU) would
execute its own subproject and provide general coordination. Each of the project
coerdination units would be responsible for a wide range of activities including: (a)
planing, programming, monitoring, and evaluation of subproject activities; (b)



4
procurement of civil works, goods and services; (c) contracting technical assistance, and
personnel; and (d) contracting independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. Both NMCE
and PMEs would be assisted in policy formulation and monitoring by a Project
Consultative Council (pCC).2
11.   Project Su nbilit. The finacial and institutional sustainability of the project
has been a matter of continuous discussion with national and provincial authorides
throughout project preparation. Education expenditures average approximately one fourth
of public expenditures in the seven participating provinces. It is clear that ivements
in quality and access during the next few years must come primarily from efficiency
gains and improved use of resources. Improving sector efficiency is a key focus of the
project. Financial sustainabiity: Counrpar financing requiements and incremental
recurrent expenditures arising from the project will average less than 0.5 percent of
anal public spending in the participating provinces during the lidtime of the project
and should not place an undue burden on them. The economic ministies of the seven
provinces have signed financial commitment letters to the national government
guaraneing adequate counterpart funding.  During negotiations, assuraces were
obtained from the national and provincial governments on the provision of agreed
counterpart funding during each year of project implementation.  Insttional
sinaiIi1 improving national and provincial capacity to plan, manage and evaluate
education is key to the success of the government's decenlization efforts. A key focus
of the project will be institutional strengthening: training of staff; development of
mawnagement information systems; improved budgeting and planning; decentralized
decision making and incresed productivity.
12. Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. There bas been only one
education project, the Vocaional Training and Technical Education Project (1980). This
project of US$58 million was intended to improve institutional capacity and expand the
quality of Argentina's voaional trinng system. It was cancelled seven years after
approval, disbursing less than 2 percent of funds because of deterioratng economic
conditions, political turmoil, project complexity and unanticipated changes in project
administration. Also, as the initial project in the sector, counterparts were not fbmiliar
with Bank procedures; in particular there were misnderstandings about procme. To
overcome this problem the proposed project has already provided extensive traing to
project staff and agreed with the Government on the content of bidding documents.
Important lessons learned from previous Bank secondary education projects worldwide
involve a nunber of factors, such as the need to: simplify project design; strengthen
implementation capacity; support a decentalized implementation framework; establish
a clear definition of functions between the central and provincial level; support teacher

from all the poject provinces.

trang; and provide learning inputs to improve quality. These lessort have been
incorporated into the project.
13.   Rationale for Bank nv olement. The proposed project is dircted at supporting
and deepenung the Government's current efforts to improve the quality and efficiency of
secondary education in a decentralized framework. The project is consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy, which was discussed with the Board on Febrary 4, 1994
in connection with a Capital Market Development Project (Report No. P4161-AR). The
second of four main polic) objectives of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for Argentina is "strengthening greatly weakened public institutions, with incmvs
attention to those responsible for social service delivery. " The CAS makes explicit
reference to the proposed project, mentioning that it will "support deentalization of the
(education) system in seven provinces and strengthen their capacity to deliver cost-
efficient education." This project is also consistent with Bank policy to shift from
adjustment lending tC investment loans, and to extend federal reforms to the provinces.
The proposed project contributes directly to transferring public service responsibilities
to the provinces, reform of provincial finances and downsizing provincial governments.
The Bank has been a strong advocate of educational decenuaizon: Sector work (Bank
Country Study, Argentina: Reallocating Resources for imovement of Education, 1991)
and the ongoing FY89 Social Sector Management Technical Assistance Loan, SSMTAL
(Loan 2984-AR), have provided the groundwork for many interventions proposed in this
project. The FY90 Provincial Development I (Loan 3280-AR) project is financing
investments in primary education infrasc    and, in a complementary project under
preparation, the Inter-American Development Bank will support basic education (pre-
school and primary) focusing on problems similar to those faced at tlh secondary level,
especially with regard to quality and efficiency. The proposed Bank involvement at the
secondary level thus complements existing and proposed investmezs in basic education
and focuses on the urgent need to improve secondary education to ensure the trainabilit,
adaptability, and productivity of the workforce.
14.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreements or assurances were reached
with the Argentine Government on the following: (a) project implementation
arrangements between the NMCE and PMEs including the distibution of responsibilities
for procurement and disbursement procedures; (b) provision of specified amounts of
counterpart funds for each year of project implementation and thereafter by the Federal
and Provincial Governments; (c) final ver-sion of model docuwens for LCB, ICB and a
letter of invitation for consultants; (d) final version of the subsidiary loan agreements
between the Federal Govermnent and Provincial Governments; (e) final agreement on
impact and project monitoring indicators; and (f) schedules for carrying out the Sector
Productivity Studies, and presentation to the Bank of the corresponding Action Plans for
the provinces. The Bank also discssed current measures in place to improve efficiency.



6
15.   As conditions of loan effectiveness, the Bank would reuire: (a) at least two
signed subsidiary loan agreements; (b) the legal establishment of the NPCU and at least
two PPCUs, in those same provinces witt signed subsidiary agreements; and (c) the
resolution establishing the Project Consultative Council (Instancia de Consulta
Instutucional). As a condition of disbursement in each subproject, the Bank would
require: (a) signed subsidiary loan agreements for each remaining subproject; (b) the
legal establishment of PPCUs in each remaining province; and (c) Action Plans by
subproject to address sector inefficiencies, satisfactory to the Bank (for disbursement of
civil works) in light of the suadards set by the project's impact indicators regardless of
whether a Sector Productivity Study and the corresponding Action Plan have been carried
out with Bank iancing.
16. Environmental Impact. The project does not present environmental risks other
than the relatively minor ones associated with school construcuon and maintance
activities. These will be addressed in the design and approval stage of investment
subprojects. An environmental rating of "C" has been granted by the Environmental
Department (LATEN).
17.   Project Benefits. The project would: (a) contribute to a more educated and
trainable workforce by raising students' cognitive achievement and problem-solving
skills; (b) increase the opportunity of children in marginal areas to receive a better
quality education, thus increasing their possibilities in the labor market as well as
increasig their social mobility; (c) help consolidate the decentralization process by
strengthening provincial inStitUtions, thus inducing more efficient responses to local
problems; and (d) help increase sector productivity, thus creating net savings of
approximately US$55 million a year once the project's programs have taken effect.
18.   Risks and Safeguards. The main risks associated with the project would be: (a)
limited implemeion capacity at both the national and provincial levels as well as
limited sectoral experience with Bank-financed projects; and (b) unresolved policy
decisions and political frictions among federal and provincial governments arising from
implementation of the FEL such as definition of new curricuhlm content, the criteria for
compensation policies towards the provinces, and fumding implications.
19.   Regarding limited implementation capacity, the design of the central and
provincial subprojects includes one central project coordination unit and seven
implementation units at the provincial level staffed by high-level personnel. Additionally,
the Bank has begun and will continue to train local staff in Bank procedure
(disbursement and procurement) to speed-up project implementation. Furthermore,
provincial project coordination units will benefit from the experience of other Bank
project execution units. Lastly, the project will train ministerial staff in management and
implementation issues. To better monitor the decenralization process and supervise
project and non-project activities, a MIS will be established and training of NMCE and
PME staff will be trained in management skills and Bank procedures (e.g. procu ).



7
To face unresolved policy decisions, the project design has incorporated studies and
institutional strengthening, which will advance the policy process in key areas (e.g.,
curriculum reform and implementation of compensatory policies) by establishing planning
mechanisms, providing analytical information, and training technical personnel.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
it.
