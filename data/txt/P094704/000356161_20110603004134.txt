                            Extension of Closing Date

    ETHIOPIA — FINANCIAL SECTOR CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT
                           (P094704)

                                 GRANT NO. H239-ET

                                 Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for ETHIOPIA - FINANCIAL SECTOR CAPACITY
BUILDING PROJECT, [Grant No H239-ET], P094704 will be extended from May, 31,
2011 to September 30, 2011.

2.      Overall implementation progress of the project remains Satisfactory. Progress is
being achieved in the two core components of the National Payments System (NPS) and
the Credit Information Center (CIC) following the restructuring that followed the
reallocation of Ethiopia’s IDA allocation following the food crisis last year. Since the last
implementation support mission of the World Bank in March 2011, considerable
achievements have been made in implementing the National Payments System, which
will formally be launched on May 27, 2011. With respect to the Credit Information
Center, major equipment including servers and the third party software have been
delivered and are currently being installed. Technical documentation including data
standardization manuals, business and functional specification documents, data
submission specifications and most of the credit information center user trainings have
been delivered. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) has also strengthened the credit
information center, which reports directly to the Vice Governor. However, completing
the Credit Information Center component requires additional time for user acceptance test
and operational test of the system before closing of the project.

3.       Despite the successful completion of several components of the Financial Sector
Capacity Building Project, the implementation of the credit information center has
witnessed delays due to several technical reasons. These include delays in the delivery of
the required hardware by the vendor, Compuscan, development of required software, and
the connectivity of the CIC with the National Payments infrastructure since the credit
information system and national payments system share common infrastructure for
connectivity of banks and microfinance institutions for data sharing. These issues have
been addressed and the extension would allow for completion of the ongoing project
activities.

4.     The project’s closing date is currently May 31, 2011. This will not be sufficient to
allow for the successful completion of the Credit Information Center component of the
project and the training and development of oversight guidelines for the National
Payments System. Out of the US$9.18 million earmarked for this project a total of
US$4.8 million has been expended and the remaining US$4.38 million has been
disbursed to the projects’ Special Account. These funds will only be fully expended once
the installation, testing and training for the Credit Information Center have been
completed, including consultancy assignments associated with technical support for the
National Payments System and the Credit Information Center.

5.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow for the successful installation and
completion of the Credit Information Bureau. We have reviewed the action plan and
propose to extend the project closing date by four months instead of the requested three
months, from May 31, 2011 to September 30, 2011. This would enable the project to
fully disburse the allocated funding for the project and allow the project the come closer
to achieving its development objectives.

6.     This will be the third and last extension of the project. The original closing date
was June 30, 2009 which was extended two times to the current date of May 31, 2011.
