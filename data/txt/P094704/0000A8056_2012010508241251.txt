                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Although substantial progress has been achieved in the projects implementation over the past 6 months, much more is required to ensure a more efficient financial sector in Ethiopia
                         capable of channeling resources to the private sector. The most recent supervision mission discussed with NBE the importance of continuing the building of the capacity of the NBE
                         and the financial sector in Ethiopia and the possibility of continued engagement in the financial sector in Ethiopia after the current project closes in May 2011.
