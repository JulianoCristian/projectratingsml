REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMASSOL SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:     The Sewerage Board of Limassol - Amathus (SBLA).
Guarantor:    The Republic of Cyprus.
Loan Amount: US$16.8 million.
Terms:        Fifteen years,  including  three years  grace  at  the  standard
variable interest rate.
Project
Description: The proposed project represents part of a two-phase development
program of the Government to provide suitable sewerage and flood
drainage systems to the major urban center of Limassol and the
contiguous area of Amathus. The project's main objectives are
to: (i) protect the area's water supply from contamination,
thereby eliminating potential health hazards to the populace and
preserving  the  important  tourist  industry;   (ii)  eliminate
intermittent flooding that creates substantial repair and
rehabilitation costs and interrupts industrial and commercial
activity; and (iii) contribute to the further rationalization of
the management of Cyprus' scarce water resources. The project
consists  of:   (I) a  central  sewage  collection and treatment
system (ii) upgrading the existing stormwater flood drainage
system;   (iii) provision for recycling of treated effluent for
irrigation use; and (iv) training of SBLA staff. The proposed
systems for both sewerage and drainage proved, after examination
of alternatives, to be the least cost solutions. The project is
affordable to the least affluent of the area's population and no
significant risks nor environmental issues are associated with
it.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMASSOL SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report appraises a sewerage and drainage project for the town of
Limassol and the contiguous improvement areas of Yermasoyia and Amathus.  The
project covers the construction stage of the facilities required to provide a
centralized sewage collection and treatment system, certain works to reduce
intermittent flooding in the commercial and industrial areas of Limassol, and
training required for the specialized personnel needed to operate the system.
The proposed works and training are estimated to cost US$37.3 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$16.8 million, and are programmed to be
completed during the years 1984 through 1990.  A Bank loan of US$16.8 million,
to finance the foreign exchange cost is proposed.
1.02     The project concept was first discussed with the Sewerage Board of
Limassol - Amathus and the Republic of Cyprus officials in September 1982.  In
1983, a feasibility study with preliminary design data was developed that
addressed an environmental issue (location of the treatment plant), and links
this project, through the reuse of its effluent, with the Southern Conveyor
Project for Water Resources Development (SCP) - also proposed for Bank
financing.
II. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
A. Water Resources
2.01     Water resources in Cyprus are scarce and their rational management
and development is critical to the well-being of the economy. Cyprus' average
annual rainfall varies from about 1,000 mm in the mountains to about 40 mm in
the plains. About 85 percent of the total rainfall occurs between November
and March, and most of it runs off in flood flows. Major deep aquifers are
sandstone and gypsum, and waters from both aquifers are frequently very hard
with a high sulfate content. Shallow aquifers have variable yields which drop
considerably during the dry season when water extraction is high and induced
recharge  from rivers ceases altogether.   Groundwater from shallow aquifers
together with a few perennial springs, have been the main source for
irrigation  and  for  water  supply  of  urban  and  rural  communities.   Most
groundwater resources have been developed and many aquifers overpumped.  As
development of minor aquifers is limited and there is little scope for
artificial  recharge,  surface  water  is  increasingly  important  as  the
predominant source of water for development. The principal sources of surface
water exist on the southern slopes of the Troodos mountains.   A number of
reservoirs  have been built by  the Government with Bank assistance.  Most



- 2 -
recently, the Government, with Bank assistance, initiated the Southern
Conveyor Project for Water Resources Development (SCP), a major multi-purpose
irrigation and water supply project designed to tap the island's last
remaining source of surplus water to alleviate water shortages in the major
urban centers and tourist areas and provide vitally needed irrigation water.
Since the SCP is likely to be the largest of the major water resources
developmen' projects for Cyprus, the Government and the Bank have taken the
opportunity of its implementation to introduce basic policy measures aimed at
further rationalizing the utilization of the country's water resources and
implementing realistic cost recovery measures for both domestic and irrigation
water.
B. Sector Service Levels
2.02     Virtually  the whole  population of Cyprus receives piped water of
satisfactory quality.  However,  the rapidly increasing water demand in the
major tourist center of Limassol is approaching its maximum level, a situation
being addressed under the SCP.  In general, all existing water supply systems
are well maintained and operated. As for sewerage services, only Nicosia has
a modern sewerage  system constructed  under  a Bank-assisted  project.   The
remaining population is served by individual disposal units consisting of
septic tanks and percolation pits, which function generally well, except in
high density population areas, and in coastal areas with high groundwater
levels and where soils have poor permeability. The Government plans to expand
and construct  sewerage  systems  in major cities and tourist centers.   The
proposed project represents the Government's first major effort since the
Nicosia and Famagusta projects (para. 2.07) in this regard.
C. Sector Organization
2.03     Water  resource  development  and  the  supply  of  bulk  water  for
agricultural and urban use is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR), and is carried out through its Water
Development  Department   (WDD).   Drinking  water   quality   standards  arer
established and monitored by the Ministry of Health. Sewage effluent quality
standards are regulated by the Sewerage and Drainage Law of 1971 and
subsequent amendments, and the Ministry of Interior is responsible for its
implementation.   Ocean  sewage  effluent  disposal  is  regulated  through
legislation prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources
Department of Fisheries. Sewage effluent quality standards for ocean disposal
are in compliance with the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean
Sea, of which Cyprus is a signatory.
2.04     Each  city  is  responsible  for  the provision  of water supply and
sewerage within its corporate municipal boundaries, and in some cases, to
contiguous areas when agreement is obtained from the concerned authorities.
These services are provided through separate Water Boards, and Sewerage and
Drainage Boards, whose establishment is authorized by the Council of
Ministers,  and  for  each  of  which  enabling  legislation  exists.   The



distribution of water supply in rural areas is the responsibility of local
communities, administered through Village Councils.
2.05     Management  of  water  resources  is  fragmented  in  both  policy  and
execution. The Government is aware of the inefficiencies resulting from such
fragmentation, and under the SCP, has agreed to take the steps necessary
towards the establishment of an integrated national water entity, which would
be responsible for all water resources in Cyprus, their development and their
use, and the implementation, operation and maintenance of all major water
supply schemes for both domestic water and irrigation.
D.  Sector Objectives
2.06     In  determining  the  optimal  utilization  of  Cyprus'  scarce  water
resources, the Government gives first priority to domestic water supply and
aims to develop available fresh water resources to maintain a continuous and
safe  water  supply.   The Government has,  therefore,  consistently given the
domestic water supply sector a high priority as evidenced by past and
projected  sector  investments.   At the same time,  it promotes  conservation
practices through such measures as the maintenance of a tariff structure
designed to discourage wasteful high consumption. Other important objectives
are the construction of modern sewage treatment systems, and the further
rationalization of the sector's institutional framework.
E. Bank Involvement in the Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
2.07     Bank involvement in the water supply and sewerage sector started in
1971 with the Nicosia Sewerage Project (Loan 729-CY) and Famagusta Sewerage
and  Drainage  Project  (Loan  730-CY).   These  projects  provided  for  sewage
collection and disposal facilities and were well advanced until the events of
July 1974 when the Famagusta Project was suspended. The Nicosia project, on
the  other  hand,  was  completed  and operations  began  in  1980.   A  Project
Performance Audit Report (No. 3694) was issued on November 24, 1981 for the
Nicosia  project,  which  highlighted  the  Bank's  assistance   in  project
development and implementation as well as the institutional development role
of the Bank. The Bank is also assisting in the implementation of two major
multi-purpose water resource development projects, namely the Vasilikos-
Pendaskinos (VPP) (Loan No. 1658-CY) and the SCP.  The SCP was presented to
the Bank's Board of Executive Directors on March 6, 1984. Implementation of
VPP is underway and proceeding satisfactorily.
F.  Bank Strategy
2.08     Bank lending strategy in Cyprus is to focus on projects that aim to
provide assistance  to areas of most pressing need in major sectors of the
economy. The Limassol Sewerage and Drainage Project provides much needed
infrastructure to protect the population from potential health hazards,
represents the first of a series of actions by the Government to provide



modern sewerage facilities in major urban centers to safeguard Cyprus' vital
tourist industry, and complements the program initiated under the SCP to
optimize the utilization and management of Cyprus' scarce water resources by
providing for future use of treated sewage effluent for irrigation of
agricultural lands.
III. PROJECT AREA
A. Project Area
3.01     The project area defined as Greater Limassol, comprises areas within
the Town of Limassol, the Ayios Athanasib, Mesa Yetonia, Kato Polemidhia,
Yermasoyia and the Amathus Improvement Boards, located on the southern coast
of Cyprus along the shore of Akrotiri bay.  Its benign climate, white sand
beaches,  and the Troodos mountains behind the city make  this  one  of  the
principal tourist areas in Cyprus.
3.02     Since  the events of 1974,  the population of Greater Limassol has
increased from 95,000 in 1973 to about 122,000 inhabitants estimated for 1982,
making  it  the  second  largest  urban agglomeration in Cyprus.   Tourism has
greatly expanded and in 1981 about 164,000 tourists visited the area.  This
number  is  projected  to reach 490,000  by  1990.  This large population of
residents and tourists, together with the lack of a central sewage collection
and treatment system, and an inadequate stormwater drainage system, has
created a situation in which sanitation in the Greater Limassol area has
deteriorated and could prejudice the health of the city and undermine the
valuable tourist industry.
B. Population
3.03     Population projections for Greater Limassol and the project area are
summarized in the following table:
Population Proiections
Year      Greater Limassol       Proiect Area Population
1980          115,000                     58,000
1988          149,000                     70,000
1990          159,000                     76,000
1995          181,000                     98,000
2000          200,000                    130,000
2005          210,000                    155,000
2010          220,000                    180,000
Population projections have been based on the city's master plan dated May
1974, and  subsequent  statistical  analysis  of  population  published by the
Government Statistics and Research Department,  taking into account  factors
such as growth potential, land availability, building codes, tourism and
industrial development. Service area population beyond 1995 have been based



on the assumption that the second phase of the proposed sewerage scheme will
be implemented in the period 1995-2010.
C.  Population Served and Standards of Service
3.04     The proposed Limassol - Anvthus sewerage scheme consisting of a piped
sewerage colLection system and a centralized treatment  facility,  is to be
constructed in two stages.  The first stage would be constructed in the period
1984-[994, with most of the new works to be built in the first seven years
(1984-1990).   Thus, only extensions to the collection system would be built
beyond  1990.   The second stage  is assumed to take  place  beyond  1995  and
service projected  populations  through the year 2010.   In the first stage,
sewerage scrvice would be provided to about 40% of the domestic population of
Limassol,  100% of the main commercial and industrial areas of Litmssol, and
the majority of the tourist hotels and residences in the Amathus Improvement
Area.  This first stage encompasses an area of about 400 meters wide and 20
kilometers long along the Akrotiri bay, with extensions to the two Government
Industrial Estates, and to areas of the city near the Garyllis and the
Yermasoyia rivers to provide protection to the city's water supply boreholes.
The second stage would provide service to another 40Z of the Limassol
residential population located at higher elevations. The remaining 20X of the
population living in the less densely populated higher elevations are not
considered in the sewerage master plan, and would continue to be serviced by
individual disposal units consisting of cesspools and percolation pits which
is considered to be adequate.

as a result of recent and proposed water tariff increases under the SCP
project. Sewage volumes from hotels and holiday apartments have been based on
per capita flows of 400 l/c/d and 240 l/c/d respectively.
D. ExistingjWater Suppty
3.06     The  town of Limassol  is supplied with water from springs  located
along the Kryos river, in the Kouris catchment area, some 30 kilometers
north-west  of  the  town,  and  from  local  boreholes.   The water supply and
distribution system is owned by the Limassol Water Board.  Bulk water supply
in thc remaining project area outside the town limits is  provided by the
Water Development Department (WDD), which is an office of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources; distribution is the responsibility of
village councils.
3.07     In 1982, the total water production in the town of Limassal reached
7.6 Mm3 (million cubic meters) or an average per capita consumption of 167
liters  per  day.   The  total  water  sales  of  5.7  Mm" represented  74%  of
production,   leaving   26%   unaccounted-for   water.    Domestic   consumption
represents 74% of the total demand, commercial institutional and tourist 8%,
and  18%  for  industrial  needs.   Project  areas  outside  the  town  limits
(Yermasoyia and Amathus areas) consumed 716,700 m' (cubic meters) of water
in 1982. Per capita consumption in these areas are more than double those in
the city due to the high tourist consumption.
E. Existing Sewerage System
3.08     At  present,  wastewaters  are  disposed  of  in  individual  systems
consisting mainly of septic tanks and absorption pits, except for hotels and
industries some of which have installed wastewater treatment units.   These
treatment units are costly to construct, operate and maintain.  However, in
spite of these installations, some raw sewage and industrial wastewaters are
discharged into the Akrotiri bay and pollute some beaches but it is expected
to be corrected by proposed solutions to be presented in an on-going interim
treatment study, para.  4.02(f).   These interim solutions  to the industrial
wastewater disposal problem will include wastes segregation and pretreatment
methods, which eventually will be required prior to discharging wastewaters
into  the sewerage  system.   In addition,  septic  tanks and absorption  pit
systems can no longer be used in the densely built-up areas along the shore.
They do not function properly because: (i) volumes of wastewaters far exceed
the soil absorption capacity; (ii) of the lack of sufficient space for
construction of required disposal units; and (iii) of the high groundwater
table. Due to neglect. the septic tanks fill with solids in a few years, and
solid materials flow into absorption pits, plugging the surrounding soil.
Such facilities fill with surface and groundwater during the rainy season,
requiring  frequent  pumping  at  relatively  high  cost.  and  even   then,
occasionally the effluents overflow into the streets creating both health
hazards  and  nuisance odors.   This  situation  will  be  exacerbated  by  the
increased water demands within the project area.  Wastewater volumes in the
Limassol area could be as high as 11.4 million cubic meters (MCM) in 1990,
i.e., 95% higher than in 1982.



-7-
F. Existing Drainage System
3.09     The existing drainage consists primarily of surface flow to natural
water courses and rivers. Four major streams, the Yermasoyia, the Vathias and
Garyllis rivers and Zakaki Creek, cross the town area on their way to the
sea. Most of the runoff is drained into these water courses via roadside
ditches and storm drains.  It is estimated that about 30 kilometers of storm
drains have been laid in the downtown area of Limassol which represents about
20% of the total length of streets and roads.  Canalization of the lower
sections of the Yermasoyia river have been made to reduce flooding in low
lying areas.   The existing  storm drainage  system  is  inadequate  and will
require considerable improvement.   A consequence of the  inadequacy of  the
drainage system, particularly in flood prone areas, is the financial loss
incurred due to lost production during the winter rainy season period of
flooding. The continued growth of the town toward the high grounds together
with the obstruction of natural drainage courses by roads and by increased
development along the shore, will further increase the frequency and severity
of flooding problems.
G. Existing Solid Waste System
3.10     Domestic and commercial refuse collection and disposal in Limassol is
carried out by the municipal government while private companies service
primarily  the  industrial  community.   A  landfill  site  located  about  5
kilometers  northwest  of  the  town  is  operated  and  maintained  by  the
municipality.  This  facility  is provided with holding ponds for separate
disposal of septic tank sludge.   Generally,  the town appears to be clean.
However, in spite of municipal ordinances some refuse is occasionally dumped
in natural drainage ravines and vacant lots. Control measures are being taken
by municipal officials to reduce such problems by prosecuting violators.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Genesis
4.01     The original master plan for Sewerage and Drainage of the town of
Limassol was completed in May 1974.  As a result of the events of 1974, no
action was  taken due  to budgetary  constraints  resulting  from  population
relocation in July of that year.   Subsequently,  the sewerage and drainage
study was brought up to date in 1977, and the Amathus tourist area was added
in a  1979 study.   At  Government's request, a Bank project identification
mission visited Limassol in September 1982, discussed the proposed project
with Municipal and Republic of Cyprus officials, and requested that the
project costs be updated.   The updated feasibility study was completed by
consultants in August 1983. A Bank preparation mission visited Limassol from
August 22 to September 2, 1983, at which time the updated feasibility ztudy
was reviewed and additional preparation work identified and scheduled prior to
project appraisal from October 30 to November 17, 1983.



-8-
4.02     During project preparation the following studies were undertaken:
(a) Limassol City Master Plan for Drainage and Sewerage, dated May 1974,
and prepared by Balasha - Louis Berger - Hadjiminas Joint Venture;
(b) Supplement to Part I: Sewerage of Limassol City Master Plan for
Drainage and Sewerage.  A 1977 update of the 1974 sewerage master
plan prepared by Balasha Jalon consultants and Engineers;
(c)  Amathus  Area  Sewerage  Scheme,  dated June  1979,  and  prepared  by
Balasha Jalon consultants and Engineers;

Balasha Jalon consultants and Engineers;
(e) Preliminary Report on Temporary Measures for Sewage Disposal, dated
February 1980, and prepared by Balasha Jalon consultants and
Engineers;
(f) Temporary Solutions for Industrial Waste Disposal in Limassol (Seven
Industries), Interim Report, dated August 1983, and prepared by Louis

(g) Limassol - Amathus Master Plan and Feasibility Study for Sewerage and
Drainage, Updated Report, dated August 1983, and prepared by Louis
Berger Int. - S. Hadjiminas Joint Venture.
B. Proiect Obiectives
4.03     The objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  through  provision  of  sanitary  sewage  collection  and  treatment
facilities to eliminate potential health hazards to the city and
tourist populations from untreated sewage discharges into the bay,
and to protect the city's present groundwater supply sources from
contamination;
(b) to provide a stormwater drainage system to eliminate the intermittent
flooding which occurs during the rainy season and which presently
interrupts commercial, industrial, and other activities; and
(c) to enhance and complement the optimization of water resource
management by providing for the reuse of sewage effluent for
irrigation purposes.
C. Technological Aspects
4.04     Several  alternative  schemes  for  the  collection,  treatment  and
disposal of sewage from the town of Limassol and the Amathus area were
studied. The alternative consisting of separate collection, treatment and



- 9 -
disposal schemes for each of these two areas, as well as a combined system
flowing from the west to the east (para. 4.02), were ruled out for economic
considerations and also because they would not provide for reuse of sewage
effluent for irrigation of agricultural areas the majority of which are
located immediately west of Limassol.  Therefore, the alternative consisting
of a combined sewerage system to service Limassol and Amathus, designed to
follow the natural slope of the terrain towards the southwest, resulted in the
least cost solution with the maximum effluent available for agricultural
irrigation.
4.05     In the design of the main interceptor, several alternative schemes
were considered. The alternative consisting of a single coastal interceptor
to service the entire area, was ruled out for economic reasons due to the high
initial investments. The alternative consisting of two interceptors, a lower
one to service the densely populated coastal area (Phase I), and a higher one
(Phase II), to service the higher grounds of the town, both of which would
drain by gravity to the main pumping station prior to reaching the treatment
facilities,  resulted  in  the  least cost  solution.   The  lower  or  coastal
interceptor (Phase I) would then be sized for the ultimate population of the
lower area in Limassol and for the first stage flows from the Amathus area.
The higher interceptor (Phase II) would be sized for the additional flows from
Amathus ultimate development plus the saturation population of the remaining
service area in Limassol.   Initially the lower interceptor will carry the
first phase sewage volumes from both Amathus and coastal areas of Limassol,
and from the two industrial estates, Yermasoyia village and the areas in the
vicinity to the city's water supply boreholes. The last three of these areas
would eventually be serviced by the Phase II Interceptor.
4.06     For the treatment and disposal of sewage several alternatives were
studied. The least cost alternative consisting of aeration lagoons, polishing
ponds and evaporation pans was ruled out by environmental considerations
because the only site with sufficient area to accommodate such facilities is
located within the wet lands and lake area along the north shore of the
Akrotiri  Salt  Lake,  an  environmentally  sensitive  area.   The  alternative
consisting of primary treatment and a long outfall into the Akrotiri bay was
ruled out for economic reasons.   Finally,  the alternative consisting of a
combination of activated sludge process with sludge drying beds and an outfall
for effluent disposal into Episkopi Bay away from the tourist areas during the
interim period before utilization for irrigation, resulted in the least cost
alternative.   Two  types  of  activated  sludge  process  were  compared,  the
oxidation ditch and the extended aeration methods. However, because of the
lack of sites with sufficient area to accommodate an oxidation ditch plant,
the extended aeration process was selected as the only viable choice.
Therefore, the alternative consisting of an extended aeration sewage treatment
process with a short outfall into Episkopi bay resulted in the least cost
solution.
4.07     The proposed drainage  system  only  includes  those  priority  areas
recommended in the Limassol Drainage Master Plan dated May 1974.. The proposed
drainage schemes have been based on an evaluation of alternatives consisting
of either diverting stormwater runoffs from higher grounds into existing



- 10 -
natural water courses, or increasing the size of existing storm water drains
in the lower areas of the city to provide adequate capacity to carry the
increased stormwater runoff.   The alternative of  diverting the Polemidhia
river into the Garyllis river together with the construction of trunk
stormwater drains in selected areas of the city, which would also be
discharged into the Garyllis river, resulted in the least cost solution. The
proposed canalization of the Zakaki Creek which is currently blocked by built
up area, is the only solution to provide the much needed drainage relief to
the Limassol Industrial Estate and the western areas of the city presently
subject to flooding. And finally, the proposed improvements to selected areas
of the existing drainage system consist primarily of replacing the undersized
catch basin and inlet structures. These inlet structures (about 20 cm. x 40
cm. gratings) do not function properly, and because of their small size, they
are easily clogged-up. These improvements are essential for the optimum
utilization of the existing storm water drains and are the least cost solution.
D. Project Components and Description
4.08     The proposed Limassol - Amathus Sewerage and Drainage Schemes are to
be constructed in two stages.   The  first stage  sewerage  system would be
constructed during 1984-1994, of which only tne works constructed during
1984-1990 would be considered for financing under the proposed Bank project
described in detail in para 4.09 (Maps IBRD 17544, 17545). The works to be
constructed from 1990 to 1994 would consist of additional lateral and main
sewer extensions to the collection system, which would be implemented annually
during that period of time. These works are projected to cost about US$20.0
million equivalent, and would be financed from internal funds together with
Government and/or Council of Europe financing. In order to make full economic
use of the investment included in the project, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the borrower will continue to expand the sewers and laterals
within its area of operations in accordance with a plan acceptable to the Bank.
4.09     The proposed Bank project  (1984-1990 construction period) includes
the following major components:
(a)  a sewage collection  system  consisting of about 67 kilometers  of
laterals and main sewers, and service connections of sizes from 150 -
300 millimeters (mm) diameter and necessary appurtenances;
(b)  a main interceptor to be located along the coastal road from Moni
Power Station in the east to the west boundary of Limassol,
consisting of about 20 kilometers of sewer pipe varying in size from
300 - 1100 mm diameter, and five sewage lift stations;
(c)  a main sewage pumping station with a capacity of 28,000 m3/day and
about 9 kilometers of 700 mm force main;
(d)  an extended aeration sewage treatment plant sized for the first stage
sewage  flows  (28,000  m   per  day average volume),  and an  ocean



- 11 -
outfall  into Episkopi bay.   Space  is available  at  the site for
modular extension of the treatment plant for the second stage;
(e) a storm drainage system consisting of 1 kilometer (km) of open
channel and diversion weir to divert the Polemidhia river into the
Garyllis river; 4.5 km of canalization of the Zakaki creek to restore
the historical flows into the Akrotiri Salt Lake which is presently
blocked by build-up areas and to service the western area of Limassol
and the Limassol Industrial Estate; about 10 km of storm drains in
the upper and lower sector of the city; and various improvements to
catch basins and inlet structures of some sections of the existing
stormwater drainage system;
(f) operation and maintenance equipment for the sewerage and drainage
systems;
(g) consultant engineering assistance for construction supervision; and
(h) training of SBLA's staff in the operation and maintenance of the new
sewerage system.

4.11     The cost estimates of the sewerage system have been based on final
designs of laterals and main sewers, main interceptor, pumping stations and
force mains, and sewage treatment plant.   The cost estimate of  the ocean
outfall has been based on the feasibility study, and minimum length required
by law which is adequate. Cost of pipe materials and major electromechanical
equipment have been based on representative quotations furnished by well known
suppliers. Unit prices for civil works construction were established based on
data furnished by major local construction companies.   Cost estimates have
been based on early  1984 price  levels.   Physical  contingencies  for  the
sewerage system were 10 for equipment and materials and 152 for civil works;
for drainage works, a 10X factor was used for both civil works and materials.
4.12     Foreign price contingencies have been estimated at 7-1/21 for 1984,
7x for 1985, and 6% for 1986 and thereafter. A local price contingency of 6%
was assumed for 1984 and thereafter.
4.13     The cost estimate for project construction supervision would cover
about 66 man-months of expatriate consultants (based on average monthly cost
of  U.S.  $8,180   including   fees,   overhead,   international   travel   and
subsistence); and about 230 man-months for local consultants based on average
monthly cost of U.S. $3,000 including fees, overhead and local travel.
4.14     The foreign exchange component has been estimated at US$16.8 million
equivalent. This figure reflects assumptions made regarding imported goods,
civil works contracts to be awarded to foreign and local contractors and the
foreign cost component of locally manufactured material and equipment. The
Bank loan would cover 1001 of foreign exchange requirements amounting to
US$16.8 million, which includes 251 of the civil works amounting to US$5.7
million.

F. Project Implementation
4.15     The Sewerage Board of Limassol - Amathus (SBLA) (para. 5.01) will be
responsible for project implementation and for the operation and maintenance
of the sewerage and drainage system.
4.16     The project implementation period will be from mid-1984 to end-1989
plus one year guarantee period (Chart 1). Tendering for the interceptor and
lift stations will be made in the last quarter of 1984, and for all other
works in the first half of 1985. Detailed Critical Path Method (CPM) networks
will  be  prepared  by  respective  contractors.   A  project  monitoring  and
reporting system including financial performance indicators was discussed and
agreed upon during loan negotiation, are shown in Annex 1, Table 4.
4.17     During  project  implementation,  the  SBLA will  appoint the project
staff (para. 5.02), who will be assisted by an engineering consulting firm for
(i) tender evaluation; (ii) review of contractors drawings, verification of
equipment and materials quality for approval by SBLA; and (iii) construction
supervision of civil works, equipment and materials supply, installation,
training,  testing and commissioning.   During negotiations,  assurances were
received that engineering consultants will be employed for construction
supervision under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
4.18     Acquisition of land for pumping stations and sewage treatment plant
and rights-of-way for pipelines are in the process of being secured and are
expected to be completed in 1984. Compensation would not be required for the
treatment plant site. Compensation to villagers for rights-of-way is covered
under Law 25/83 of 1983 which provides for fair, adequate and timely
compensation. At Loan negotiations, the Republic of Cyprus presented evidence
that the British Sovereign Base Authority (SBA) has agreed, in principle, to
lease a site within its territory to SBLA for the construction and subsequent
operation of the sewerage facilities included  in the project.   A  special
condition of Loan effectiveness is finalization of the agreement setting out
these arrangements.

Four sewerage works contracts are anticipated which will be procured in
packages containing the furnishing and installation of equipment and materials
in the same contract with the corresponding civil works. However, tender
documents will require provision of materials and equipment separate from
prices for civil works. And during construction, contractors will be asked
for separate materials and equipment invoices to permit 100X reimbursement of
imported  items.   These  contracts  will  be  procured  through  International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank Group
'    Figures in parenthesis are the amounts proposed to be financed by the
Bank.

guidelines.   Those portions  of the  drainage  works  within  the  limits  of
sewerage  laterals  and  mains  will  be  included  in  those  contracts.   The
remaining drainage works outside the sewerage works area, which do not exceed
US$350,000 for equipment and US$1,000,000 for civil works, will be procured
through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures which are satisfactory.
Contracts to be procured through ICB amount to about U.S. $31.0 million, which
represents about 83Z of the total project cost; contracts under LCB are
estimated to be about US$ 4.1 million, which represent approximately llZ of
the  total  project  cost.   Procurement  under  "Other"  include  consulting
engineering services for construction supervision, training of SBLA staff
(para. 5.03), and land acquisition.   Presently,  the SBLA has retained the
services of a consultant for all engineering studies, final design and
preparation of tender documents.  The SBLA has indicated its intentions to
retain  the same  consultant  for construction  supervision.   This consultant
engineering firm is technically qualified to undertake such assignment. The
Bank will review all documents for those contracts to be subject to ICB, and
will review representative samples of LCB contracts as well as the contract
for construction supervision services.  During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that procurement will be in accordance with the current Guidelines
for Procurement under World Bank Loans.
4.20     It is anticipated that most of the pipe materials and all of the
electromechanical equipment will be supplied by foreign manufacturers, and
that contracts for the main interceptor, pumping stations and force main,
sewage treatment plant and outfall would be awarded either to foreign
contractors or to joint-ventures of foreign and local contractors.   It is
expected that contracts for laterals and main sewers and drainage works would
be awarded to local contractors who are competent.
H. Disbursements
4.21     Statistical records in the Bank for the disbursement of the water
supply and sewerage sector in the EMENA region extend over a nine-year period
while the country profile extends over an 8-1/2 year period.  However, the
overall implementation of the proposed project is estimated to be completed in
7 years because: (i) country sector experience is limited to two projects
(para. 1.05) whose disbursements where affected by the 1974 events and
therefore are not representative; and (ii) the proposed project is based on
final design while previous projects where based on feasibility studies which
normally  require  two  years  to  complete  final  design.   A  forecast  of
disbursements is presented in Annex 1, Table 5.
4.22     The  proposed  Bank  loan  of  US$16.8  million  equivalent  would  be
disbursed against normal documentation as follows:

4.23     During  loan negotiations  assurances were obtained  from SBLA that
within six months following the closing date of the loan it will prepare and
submit to the Bank a project completion report. This report will cover the
planned objectives and achievements of the project including the costs, and
benefits, and performance of the SBLA regarding the project execution and
operation of the new systems.
V. THE BORROWER, IMPLEMENTINC AND OPERATING AGENCY
A. Background
5.01     The borrower would be  the Sewerage  Board of Limassol - Amathus
(SBLA), a recently created entity, established by the Council of Ministers
order 248/80 -'' published September 5, 1980, in accordance with the Sewerage
and Drainage Law of 1971. The Republic of Cyprus will be the guarantor. Tnis
Law and subsequent amendments is very broad and comprehensive and provides the
Council of Ministers with the authority to: (a) establish sewerage and
drainage boards, define the area in which those boards are to operate, and to
nominate members of the board to represent the interests of non-municipal
areas included in the boards operating area; and (b) approve the sewerage
boards annual investment programs, and its proposed schedule of rates, charges
and fees. The law also provides that boards are to be financially autonomous
corporate entities, gives those boards rights-of-way and power to compulsorily
acquire property, and provides record keeping and auditing requirements.
B. Organization and Management
5.02     The  SBLA  Board  members  were  appointed  by  Council  of  Ministers
decision 20,216 dated April 2, 1981. All project preparation work has been
carried out by Limassol's municipal staff in the offices of the town clerk and
the municipal engineer.  The SBLA recognized that the working arrangements
were not appropriate to handle the rapidly developing project requirements,
1' Order 248/80 also specified the area of operations.



- 17 -
and in May 1983, initiated action to solicit candidates for a full-time staff
to carry on the work of project implementation. The Board proposes appointing
five operating staff, i.e., an engineer, a chief accountant, a technical
assistant, a typist, and a messenger as the initial project nucleus as soon as
budgetary  approval  is  received  from  Ministry  of  Fin-ance.   While  final
authority for all decisions rests with the Board, the engineer would be
responsible for physical project development, and the chief accountant would
develop arrangements for the billing and collection of the rates based on
property assessment values, and other required office and administrative
procedures.   During negotiations assurances were obtained that the engineer
and accountant will be appointed not later than August 31, 1984.
C. Staffing and Training
5.03     The technical staff of SBLA would receive training by the consultants
during  project  implementation.   SBLA has agreed  that  the treatment plant
superintendent/foreman would be hired in sufficient time to provide him with
3-6 months practical training abroad in management and process operation of a
similar treatment plant, and would also be given three months training in
Limassol by the treatment plant equipment suppliers. In addition, the chemist
would be provided with three months training abroad in system technology,
sampling  and  laboratory  testing.   Other  technical  staff,  i.e.,  mechanic,
electrician, sewerage foreman and pumping station operator, would be trained
locally by suppliers of the equipment and through arrangements with the
Nicosia Sewerage Board. The proposed Bank Loan would cover the foreign cost
of training.
5.04     Administrative and accounting staff would be added as required.  Such
staff are available in Cyprus, and would be under the direct supervision of a
competent accountant/administrator (para. 5.02), thus not requiring consultant
services.
D. Accounting, Billing and Collection
5.05     The Sewerage and Drainage Law of 1971 specifies the content of an
annual budget which is to be submitted to the Minister of Interior for review
before forwarding to the Council of Ministers for approval. SBLA will use a
chart of accounts which is appropriate to the development of public utility
financial statements, will maintain separate accounts for sewerage and
drainage direct charges, and will use an accrual accounting system.
5.06     SBLA will develop its billing arrangements by adapting the forms,
systems and frequency of billing that are in use in Nicosia which are
acceptable. SBLA also plans to contract with a local bank for issuance of the
bills through the computer facilities offered by local banks since this is
functioning well in Nicosia.
5.07     Collection of eventual billing is also planned to be handled by the
bank issuing the bills as is the case in Nicosia. The Sewerage. and Drainage
Law of 1971 makes provision for Sewerage Boards to request the Council of



- 18 -
Ministers to order collection of overdue bills by the Department of Inland
Revenue (Amendment of 1972), and authorizes a 20Z late-payment fine (Amendment
of 1978).
E.  Audit
5.08     Annual  audits  of  the accounts  of  the  SBLA  are  required by  the
Sewerage and Drainage Law of 1971, and are to be carried out by the Auditor
General  of  the  Republic.   Assurances were  obtained at negotiations  that
beginning with fiscal 1984, SBLA's financial statements would be audited by
the Auditor General of the Republic, and a copy of the statements and the
audit report would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of
each fiscal year.
F. Insurance
5.09     SBLA presently carries third party liability coverage on vehicles as
well as for employee accident insurance.  During negotiations, agreement was
reached that SBLA will provide fire and theft coverage on buildings, equipment
and warehouse stocks as these are completed during the course of the project.
VI. FINANCE
A. Past Performance and Present Position
6.01     SBLA was established in 1980, in accordance with the Sewerage and
Drainage  Act  of  1971  (para.  5.01).   SBLA  is  the entity which will be
responsible for project execution, and will be the Borrower of the Bank loan,
which will be guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus.  There are no central
sewage facilities to acquire.  Projected balance sheet, income statement and
source and application of funds statements as well as the underlying financial
assumptions are in Annex 2, Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4.
B. Proposed Rates and Charges for Revenue Generation
6.02     During discussions with officials of the SBLA and the Ministry of
Finance, it was agreed in principle that SBLA revenues would comply with the
Sewerage and Drainage Act of 1971 (para. 5.01) which sets rules for financial
viability,  i.e.,  that  revenues  should  cover  all  costs  of  operation,
maintenance and administration, full debt service or depreciation (whichever
is higher), provide adequate working capital, and, in addition, provide a part
of the investment cost. Thus, the various rates and charges were developed in
order to meet that goal. The rates and charges were assumed to fall into the
following four general categories:



- 19 -
a)   a rate applicable  to  the assessed property values  1' for those
properties to be covered by the project as well as its expansion to
1994 when the full first phase of the project is completed.  This
rate is divided into two parts:   the first part is applicable to
properties to be connected to the system in the first phase; and the
second is a lower rate for properties to be connected during the
second Phase of project expansion (1995-2010);
b)   a "user charge" assessed as a surcharge to the water bills for those
properties that are actually connected to the sewerage system;
c)   connection fees which have been designed to bear heaviest on the
tourist properties and hotels, where both land area and built-up area
charges are assessed, and flat fees for other properties; and
d)   a  drainage  charge assessed upon  the  property  values  within  the
municipal limits of Limassol only.
6.03     Application of these rates is to begin in 1985.  Although there is a
possibility that some of the treated effluent could be sold for citrus crop
irrigation during 1989 through 1991, and thereafter to be used in the second
stage of the Southern Conveyor Project for Water Resources Development
(para. 2.07), such potential revenues were not included in the financial
forecasts as a conservative measure.
6.04     The above-mentioned charges and rates are appropriate to this type of
project, are provided for under the Sewerage and Drainage Act of 1971, and are
in use in Nicosia, the only other town in the Republic of Cyprus where such a
central  system  of  sewage  collection  and  treatment  exists.   Drainage  is
currently funded from municipal budgets.
C. Financing Plan
6.05     A detailed forecast of the sources and applications of funds for the
period 1984 through 1994 is detailed in Annex 2, Table 3. A summary for the
Bank financed project, and for the full 1984/1994 period is presented below:
For purposes *bf this SAR, the assessed property values used in the
projections are the existing values at November 1983 which were
developed from Land Registry Office data. That office is proceeding to
revalue all properties in the project area to the equivalent of 1980
market values; revaluation is expected to be completed by the  nad of
1984, at which time, the actual rates and charges, are expected to be
modified in order to generate the same quantity of revenues as projected.

6.06     The project financing plan consists of 15S from internally generated
funds, 45.1% from the proposed Bank loan, and the remainder to be financed by
a Government  lean (26.3Z) and Council of Europe loans.   The Bank loan of
US$16.8 million equivalent would finance l00S of the foreign exchange cost of
the project.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations  that the Government
will: (a) provide SBLA with a loan, or loans, of US$9.8 million equivalent;
and (b) will provide appropriate funding for any project cost overruns.
D. Future Performance
6.07     The highlights of  SBLA's  future  financial  performance,  for which
details are in Annex 2, Tables 1, 2, and 3, are summarized below:

*         6.08     In order for SBLA to meet the financial targets of this proposed
project, there are two very important considerations.  The first is that SBLA
must begin its customer billing operations during the first half of 1985
(rates are to be billed semi-annually) at the levels agreed upon. Assurances
to that effect, and the rates, were agreed to during negotiations. Secondly,
the installation of sewer mains and laterals must be staged so that the major
water consumers are connected during 1987 and 1988.  The remaining more
dispersed residential areas are staged to be constructed during 1989-1994
(para. 4.08). In addition to these actions, SBLA will have to publish in the
official Gazette regulations for immediate connection, and then scriraulously
enforce the requirement in the Sewerage and Drainage Act of 1971, para 33(1)
that ... "every owner or occupier of premises... abutting on any street in
which there is located a public sanitary or combined sewer within one hundred
feet of the boundary... shall... construct a private building sewer, and...
discharge all sewage into the public sewer." Also the Board will have to use
the provisions of the same law in the event of non-payment (para. 5.07).
6.09     The proposed financing plan, wherein 85% of the full constructioni
period consists of borrowed funds, means a heavy debt load for the newly
created SBLA.  While  its debt/equity ratio is projected to reduce fairly
rapidly after the initiation of operations in 1989 from 65/35 to 59/41 by
1994, its tariffs provide debt service coverage averaging only 1.1 from
1989-1994. Agreement was obtained at negotiations that SBLA will not, during
the project implementation period, contract any medium or long-term debt
(other than for carrying out the project) without the Bank's prior agreement.
The preceding assurances, together with the financial covenant proposed below
in para 6.10, should provide assurance that SBLA would have sufficient funds
to meet its annual investment contribution, para. 6.06.
6.10     Bearing in mind the above discussion, during negotiations agreement
was obtained with SBLA that beginning in FY85, it will implement rates and
IS 1988.



- 22 -
other  charges  to provide adequate  funds  to cover:   (a)  all expenses  of
operations, maintenance, administration and other taxes and contributions
required by law, but excluding depreciation; (b) all interest and other
charges on debt as well as principal repayments; (c) all increases required to
maintain adequate levels of working capital; and (d) 15% of each year's annual
investment.   This  covenant  simply  requires  SBLA  to  adhere  to  existing
legislation.  This  financial  discipline would be  monitored  through annual
reviews, and during negotiations assurances were obtained that SBLA will,
three months before the beginning of each fiscal year, provide the Bank with a
copy of their proposed budget for such fiscal year and financial projections
for the following two years as well as their proposed rates and charges plans
for its review and comments.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Background
7.01     The present system of sewage disposal using private septic tanks and
absorption pits for domestic sewage disposal, and some biological treatment
for tourist hotels and industry is inadequate, produces nuisance odors and
health hazards, and sewage contaminates the beaches, which could affect the
all  important  tourist  industry.   In  the  older  areas  of  Limassol,  the
population density and long period of usage has reduced the ability of the
soil to absorb the septic tanks' effluent resulting in overflows during the
winter rainy season.  The only satisfactory and permanent solution to this
problem is to install a central collection and sewage treatment system.  In
addition  to  the  unsatisfactory  sewerage  situation,  Limassol's  existing
drainage system is inadequate to absorb the rainfall run-off of the severe
tropical-type rainstorms, which due to construction blockage of normal run-off
channels, and the steep rise of the land, creates flooding in the lower part
of the city encompassing most of the commercial and industrial area. The need
for correction of these problems has been recognized by the municipal
authorities who commissioned a feasibility study in 1973 for both a city
master plan and a sewerage and drainage project from which the proposed
project evolved.
B. Least-Cost Solution
7.02     The proposed project is the least cost solution to both the sewerage
and drainage problems, (para. 4.04 through 4.07). Other alternatives to the
treatment of sewage either require substantially larger areas of land, which
are only available in the highest elevations of the city or 20 km to the west
of the city.  Both possibilities were rejected because of the unacceptable
increase in energy costs.  The land area available for sewerage treatment
would support electromechanical sludge drying equipment. but again the energy
cost and additional investment were substantially in excess of sludge drying
beds that are in the proposed system. The drainage component rehabilitates
and makes more efficient the existing drainage system, and provides for
diversion channels in those built-up areas which block the natural flow of the
water.



- 23 -
C. Project Benefits and Environmental Impact
7.03     Benefits from the project are in four principal areas:  (i) it will
reduce the health hazards to the residential and tourist population by
eliminating the overflow from the individual septic tanks, and the direct
discharges of the canneries and wine factories into the Old Harbor area; (ii)
it will protect the tourist industry which provides more than 20 of Cyprus'
foreign exchange, of which the Greater Limassol area provides a major share;
(iii) it will also protect the local employment in tourist related industries
which accounts for about 20% of the 38,000 plus employed in 1982; and (iv) it
will reduce, if not eliminate,  the lost-productivity which results from the
flooding of the lower town during the intense rainfalls that frequently occur
during the winter season.
7.04     The tourism industry in the Greater Limassol area generates about 35Z
of the country's tourist industry revenues, which in 1982 amounted to about
CE138.0 million.   Greater Limassol's share is estimated at more than CE45
million, or more than twice the full current cost of the project.  In terms of
employment protection, of the 38,200 people registered as employed in Limassol
and the contiguous tourist areas, 3,853 were directly employed in hotels,
rooming houses,  cafeterias  and other direct tourist functions.   A further
10-15X of employable people were estimated to be employed indirectly in taxi
fleets,  souvenir and gift  shops,  night clubs, beverage producers and the
like. Hence the proposed project is of great importance to the economy of the
country, and particularly the Greater Limassol area.
7.05     With  respect  to  the  intermittent  flooding  which  impedes  road
transport for varying lengths of time over the winter season, it was not
possible to get direct data from industry and commercial sources as to the
value of lost production. However, the managing partner of Touche Ross & Co.,
an internationally known public accounting firm who was also a former Minister
of Industry and Commerce, estimated that about two days equivalent of lost
production occurs each year representing approximately C£1.5 million, or 31%
of the cost of the drainage component of the project.  A further potential
benefit to the project would be the re-use of the treated effluent for
agricultural irrigation.  Since water is in scarce supply,  the effluent is
planned to be used in stage II of the Southern Conveyor Project (SCP) which is
under Bank review.  At the SCP 1983 price of CE0.17/M3, and allowing 50X for
reservoir, additional treatment and pumping costs, the effluent could provide
revenues, in 1992, at 1983 prices, of CE800,000 per vear as irrigation water.
The health benefits, although vitally important, cannot be quantified.
7.06     Environmentally,  the  project  does  not  pose  any  problems.   The
treatment plant is located about 2 km from the Akrotiri Salt lake on
sandy/rocky soil without vegetation, well outside the areas utilized by the
migrating bird flocks. The ocean outfall is in an area which is dangerous for
swimming,   and  in  which  construction  of  any  facility  is  prohibited.
Furthermore, the treated effluent is expected to be of very high quality and
thus eliminates any possible negative impact in the receiving body of water.
It would only be injected into Episkopi Bay during 1988-1992, after which the
effluent is to be used in conjunction with the SCP project when the ocean



- 24 -
outfall   would  be  used  only  during  emergencies.   Moreover,   drainage
improvements such as the canalization of Zakaki creek, will re-establish the
historical stormwater flows into the Akrotori Salt Lake, thus ensuring the
ecological balance of the lake.  Thus, the project is environmentally sound.
D. Affordability
7.07     The rates and charges envisioned for the project should not impose an
undue burden on the lowest paid population in the Greater Limassol area. The
lowest salaries paid are municipal grade A-1 and beach boys at the tourist
hotels who average C£2,100/annum. The average family of four persons would
have an income of about 1-1/2 salaries, or CE3,150/annum. Assuming that this
lowest paid family resided in a small duplex house - the lowest assessed
property value in the Limassol area - and would use 135 liters of water per
capita per day, its annual sewerage and drainage bill would represent about
3.5% of one family salary which is well within the 5% affordable level of one
minimum salary. The annual cost to the lowest income earner represents about
six emptyings of the present cesspool system which the Limassol authorities
consider to be necessary to maintain the existing system in working order,
i.e., without  overflowing during  the rainy  season.   Thus  the  project  is
considered affordable.
E. Risks and Safeguards
7.08     As in all civil works contracts, the principal risks are associated
with delays in execution which could escalate the project costs. However, the
implementing agency is expected to minimize this risk through the use of
reputable contractors and the use of an experienced consulting firm during the
construction  period.   Construction restrictions  in the commercial area and
tourist areas are well known, and will be minimized by being included in the
bidding documents.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01     The  Republic  of  Cyprus  has  agreed,  as  a  condition  of  Loan
effectiveness that satisfactory arrangements be made for the leasing of land
for purposes of construction and subsequent operation by SBLA of the sewerage
facilities and related structures under the project (para. 4.19).
8.02     Agreement having been reached on all other issues referred to in
Chapters IV through VI of this report, the proposed project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$16.8 million to Sewerage Board of Limassol - Amathus with
final maturity of 15 years, including a three-year grace period, at the
standard variable interest rate.

MONITORING INDICATORS
A. CONSTRUCTION MONITORING
I. REPORTING WORK PROGRESS
Quarterly and Annual Reports
1.01     One copy of quarterly reports shall be submitted every three months
within a period not exceeding eight (8) weeks from the end of the quarter
(March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31). The annual report shall be
the last quarterly report.  The financial information shall be as specified
under Section B of this Annex.
Progress Reports Content
1.02     Quarterly reports shall include but not be limited to the following
minimum contents:
(i)  Introduction.   It  shall  include  a  summary  of  the  construction
progress to date as detailed in the remaining sections of the
report.    Progress   delays,   additional   construction   costs   and
construction problems should be highlighted indicating the impact on
project completion schedule and on project cost and giving specific
recommendations to correct the problems raised.
(ii) Status of Procurement. This section shall list all project contracts
that have been procured giving procurement method, date of bid
opening, date of award, name of contractor, contract amounts in the
various currencies and in US$ equivalent (as of bid opening date),
contract duration in months or days, percent of advance payment and
of retainage.
(iii) Description of Work Progress. This section shall briefly desczibe
the construction work progress by contracts.  Changes in quantities
and in design should be explained, and major construction problems
highlighted indicating corresponding solutions.  Briefly discuss the
work  program  for  the  following  quarter.    The  work  progress
description should refer to the bar chart (see (iv) below) by
contracts as required. Each contract work progress shall include an
average percentage of completion based on physical quantities of work



- 30 -
ANNEX 1
Table 4
Page 2 of 5
approved as it relates to the total quantity of work, and in monetary
terms, a percentage of the cost of the work completed for which
payment requisitions have been submitted by the contractors as it
relates to the total cost of the contracts, updated to include any
additional costs.
(iv) Project Implementation bar Chart. The bar chart shall be prepared by
contracts subdivided in major components of work (i.e., pumping
station civil works and electromechanical equipment, force main,
treatment  plant   civil  works   and  electromechanical   equipment,
outfall). A top bar shall show the original schedule and a parallel
lower bar shall show the revised schedule depicting the actual work
to date.
(v)  Schedule  of  Disbursements.   The  second  quarterly report  and  the
annual report shall include a schedule of disbursements of Bank loan
by categories as shown in the following format:
Amount Requested
Contract                   Category   (US$ Equivalent)   Date    Total
Lateral Sewers/Contractor
Sub-Total
Interceptor/contractor
Sub-Total
(vi) Updated Proiect Cost. The annual report shall include an update of
the total project cost by contracts taking into consideration any
additional costs due to extra work, cost escalation adjustments, or
any cost reductions due to deletions or changes in design.
B. FINANCIAL MONITORING
Financial monitoring will consist of two parts:
(A) quarterly reports for the first, second and third quarters of the
year only which would consist of the following data:

ANNEX 1
Table 4
Page 3 of 5
Cumulative
Quarter Only    Year to Date
1. Revenues billed
2. Operating Costs
3. = (1-2) Profit before depn.
& Interest
4. Interest Paid or Payable
5. Loan Principal Paid or Payable
6. Contribution to Investment
7. = (3-4-5-6) Surplus (Deficit)
in Funds
8. Revenues billed but not collected.
In addition to the above data, a one or two page narrative should be
attached, and should describe:
(a) changes, if any to the revenue rates and charges which occurred
during the quarter;
(b) changes, if any to individual operating costs such as increases
to electric energy rates, prices of fuel and transport, etc;
(c) any short-term borrowing (or lines-of-credit) established, and
why these were necessary;
(d) any legal actions which might result in eventual costs to the
Sewerage Board;
(e) any changes which occurred to the exchange rate;
(f) any changes to laws which might affect the Sewerage Board such
as application of income taxes, changes in import duties, etc.;



- 32 -
ANNEX 1
Table 4
Page 4 of 5
(g) any other condition which created financial difficulties for the
Sewerage Board.
(B) Annual monitoring which would consist of:
(i) copies of the Sewerage Boards annual financial statements (income
statement, balance sheet, and source and application of funds) in the
formats shown in the IBRD Appraisal Report, Annex 2, Tables 1, 2, and
3, together with a copy of the Sewerage Boards annual report; and
(ii) a three year financial forecast using a Source and Application of
Funds format as described in IBRD Appraisal Report, Annex 2, Table 3
together with the assumptions used to develop the forecast.
The first year of the three-year forecast should be SBLA's proposed,
or approved, budget - please state which.  The second year of the forecast
should be the year following the budget year, and the third year would be the
second year following the budget year.
This forecast requires the cooperation of the technical as well as
the financial side of the Sewerage Board since the fundamental forecasts of
connections to the system (which is the basis for forecasting revenues),
revisions to the cost of the investment prvbra. resulting from increased work,
delays (or early completion) of project components which is the basis for
forecasting sources of financing of investments: when the system is
operational, the technical staff will be able to provide parameters for much
of the operating cost basis' for forecasting.
The purpose of this forecast is to define in advance potential
financing problems such as the need for adjustment of the rates and charges
schedules, the need for short-term financial assistance, or in the unlikely
case that too much money is available, the need to invest it wisely until it
is required.
The assumptions to be used should be reviewed by Ministry of Finance
and/or other appropriate Republic of Cyprus officials since certain of the
assumptions, i.e., exchange rate changes, annual inflation indices, etc., are
of national interest and should be similar for all such reporting.

REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS
LIMASSOL SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
THE SEWERAGE BOARD OF LIMASSOL - AMATHUS
FINANCIAL ASSUMPTIONS
A. Rates of Inflation
1.       All financial statement projections are in current Cypriot pounds.
The same rates of internal inflation, as used for capital investment costs
(para. 4.12), have also been used in estimating operational and maintenance
costs.
B. Income Statements
2.       Tariffs (rates and charges) are consistent with the revenue covenant
(para.   6.10),  and  were  devised  to  cover  operating  costs,  excluding
depreciation, debt service, appropriate increases to working capital, and to
provide 15% of the investment cost during the period of 1985-1994. For record
purposes, the rates and charges assumed to be applied during the first half of
1985 are:
SEWER RATES:
Project Area                    CEO.1725 per C£1.0 of Assessed Property Value
General Benefit Area            CEO.023 per CE1.0 of Assessed Property Value
Sewer Service Charge            CEO.15 per M3 of Water Consumed
ONE-TIME CONNECTION FEES:
Domestic:
One-Story Building            CE50.0
Multi-Story Building          CE250.0
Hotels and Apartment Hotels:
Connected Plot Charge         CEO.6 per M2 of Land Area
Built-up Charge               CE1.5 per M2 of Floor Area
DRAINAGE RATE                       CEO.031 per CEI of Assessed Property Value
in the Limassol Municipal Boundary

ANNEX 2
Table 4
Page 2 of 4
The above rates were assumed to increase by 15% in 1986, 1988 and 1992.
3.       Volume basis - The assessed valuation of the project area and the
general benefit areas were developed by the Land Registry Office, and are 1983
valuations. A nominal increase of 2% per year for new construction was
assumed. The volume of water consumed was developed by assuming connection of
the areas of major consumption  first,  i.e.,  industries,  commercial  area,
tourist   hotels   and   apartments.    Residential   areas   were   connected
proportionately over the ten-year Phase I period.
4.       Other revenues consists of fines and interest on late payments.
5.       Operating costs:
(i)  Manpower - the number of personnel needed to establish the project
cadre group, the initial operating, maintenance and administrative
staffs were developed from similar type operations, and were compared
- where possible - with the Nicosia sewerage system. Annual salary
levels were developed by Sewerage Board staff, and include the second
half 1983 allowances of 67.5% cost-of-living allowance, the 10%
allowance, and the 13th salary;
(ii) Energy - this consists primarily of the electric power consumption of
the various project components at current energy costs;
(iii) Maintenance - maintenance costs were developed from engineering
experience on similar type projects, and was phased in at 20% of
normal during the first year so that full cost would be included by
year 5 and  thereafter.   The  cost  of  operating  the vehicles  was
estimated and included in this line item;
(iv) Other - includes estimated administrative costs of communication,
paper supplies, data processing, audit, insurance and other related
costs;
(v)  Collection Fee - an allowance of 2% of revenue was made to cover
collection costs by banks and water boards for their services;
(vi) Depreciation  -  was  calculated  on  a  straight  line  basis.   The
investment costs were segregated by type of asset, and the rates
applied were:

Mechanical/electrical equipment    20 year life -  5.0Z
Vehicles                              5 year life - 20.01
C.  Balance Sheet and Source and Application of Funds
6.       Fixed Assets  - The  investments  during  the Bank  financed  project
period were incorporated into the Sewerage Board's fixed asset accounts in the
year in which they were commissioned. Thereafter, investments are principally
extensions to sewerage laterals and mains, and were incorporated in fixed
assets at the end of the year of investment.
7.       Accounts  Receivable  consist  of  an  estimated  102  of  revenues,
declining to 5% by 1992. Any tax related bill overdue for six or more months
is referred to the Inland Revenue Office for judicial collection under the
terms of the 1971 Sewerage and Drainage Law.
8.       Inventories represent an estimated two months of maintenance costs.
There are no chemicals involved in this type of treatment.
9.       Accounts payable were assumed to be equal to one full months' cost of
operations, excluding depreciation.
10.      Due to contractors was assumed to be one month's investment cost
based upon Limassol officials practice of paying all bills the 15th of the
month after receipt.
11.      Long  Term  Loans.   The  loans  assumed  for  purposes  of  these
projections, and their payment terms provide for 901 of the financing of the
investment throughout the period forecast. The loans and their terms are, in
addition to the Bank loan:
ti)  Council of Europe Resettlement Fund - 5 years grace and 10 years
final maturity at interest rates of 92 per annum; and
(ii) Government - 5 years grace and 20 years final maturity at interest of
61 per annum.
12.      Interest is not assumed to be financed by any of the lending agencies
involved.  Interest was capitalized during the construction period until the
date of commissioning in accordance with local practice, and thereafter
charged to operating results.

13.      Advances of about CE350,000 have been made by Government  to  the
Sewerage Board for consultants fees and other preliminary services which were
"repaid" in 1985 and 1986.
