contiguous area of Amathus.\n            The project's main objectives are to:  (i) protect the\n            area's water supply from contamination, thereby\n            eliminating potential health hazards to the populace and\n            preserving the important tourist industry; (ii) eliminate\n            intermittent flooding that creates substantial repair and\n            rehabilitation costs and interrupts industrial and\n            commercial activity; and (iii) contribute to the further\n            rationalization of the management of Cyprus' scarce\n            water resources. The project consists of:  (i) a central\n            sewage collection and treatment; (ii) upgrading the existing\n            stormwater flood drainage system; (iii) provision for\n            recycling of treated effluent for irrigation use; and (iv)\n            training of SBLA staff."}, "docdt": "1984-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
