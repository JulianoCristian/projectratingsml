CYPRUS
LIMASSOL SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2411-CY)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Memorandum for the Limassol Sewerage
and Drainage Project, which the Bank supported with Loan 2411-CY (US$ 16.8
miliion). The borrower was the Sewerage Board of Limassol-Amathus (SBLA);
the guarantor was the Government.
The loan was made effective on September 19, 1985, with a delay
of about one year, due to the Government's inability to secure a site for the
sewage treatment plant. The Loan Agreement was terminated on April 8, 1987,
34 months after loan signing (May 31, 1984) at the request of the Borrower
and the Guarantor.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Memorandum was read by the
operations Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by
OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft Project
Completion Memorandum to the Government and the Borrower for comments.
Comments received from the Government are reproduced as Attachment 1.

LIMASSOL SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2411-CY)
Introduction
This memorandum was prepared in lieu of a project completion report
(IPCR), as Loan 2411-CY (US$ 16.8 million) terminated on April 8, 1987 at the
request of the Borrower and Guarantor. Although the loan was made effective
on September 19, 1985, no portion of the loan was ever disbursed.
Proiect Description
The project corsists of a first stage of a two-stage sanitary
sewerage system, sewage treatment and sea disposal facilities, and storawater
drainage sewers for the town of Limassol and the Amathus Improvement
District. The objectives of the project were: (i) to eliminate the potential
health hazards to the population of the Limassol-Amathus area and the growing
tourist population resulting from untreated sewage discharged to the sea and
overflowing from inadequate septic tanks; (ii) to eliminate intermittent
flooding during the rainy season; (iii) to utilize sewage effluent for
irrigation; and (iv) to improve the operation and management of the Sewerage
Board of Limassol-Amathus (SBLA). The project cost was estimated at US$ 37.3
million of which US$ 16.8 million corresponded to the foreign cost component.
The project was supported by a Bank loan of US$ 16.8 million to SBLA, which
was in charge of project implementation and subsequent operation.
No economic rate of return for the project was calculated at
appraisal. The expected benefits were described in terms of enhanced
environment for the tourist industry and the population of the area.
Loan Processing. Negotiations, and Signing
The project was identified in September 1982 on the basis of a Water
Supply and Sewerage Master Plan developed in 1974 and updated in 1979.
Project appraisal Was carried out from October 30 to November 17, 1983 on the
basis of a well advanced design and bidding documents prepared by consultants
in 1982-83. No major problems delayed loan negotiations, and a Bank loan of
US$ 16.8 million to SBLA was approved on May 8, 1984. Loan signing took
place on May 31, 1984.
Loan Effectiveness and Cancellation
The loan was made effective on September 19, 1985 after a one-year
delay due to the Government's inability to secure a site for the sewage
treatment plant.
Although the issue of siting the sewage treatment plant was
satisfactorily resolved, further issues of political and financial nature
emerged after the newly elected municipal officials took office on June 1,



2
1986. The new management of SBLA unofficially approached the Government (i)
to consider developing a project for disposal of treated sewage on land in
lieu of disposal in sea, and (ii) to consider providing further financial
assistance in the form of grants (for the drainage components) and greater
contribution of soft loans. /1   The Government indicated that, although it
would favorably consider the first request /2 , it would be unable to
accommodate the second on the grounds of not wanting to establish a precedent
due to budgetary constraints.
Finally, in view that the financial issue could not be favorably
resolved and having lost the benefits of the grace period of the loan plus
the cost of commitment fees, SBLA requested through the Government the
cancellation of the Bank loan on February 13, 1987. The Government has
indicated that the reason for loan cancellation was the continuing local
opposition to the chosen location for the sewage treatment plant (Attachment
1). Although the Bank does not have any evidence on this matter, it learned
that SBLA hired a consultant to review the sewerage master Dlan with the
purpose of recommending other alternatives.  The Bank requested copies of
such studies, but none was provided.
The project was officially cancelled on Aprit 8, 1987 and the final
payment of outstanding commitment fee was received on June 15, 1987. The
amounts of US$ 42,000 and US$ 320,695.89 were received in payment of front-
end fee and commitment fee, respectively. No disbursement was made out of
the loan proceeds.
/1   Government loans for 20 years with five years of grace at 6Z interest per
annum.
12   Actually this alternative is being considered under the development plans
of the Southern Conveyor Project for Water Development.
