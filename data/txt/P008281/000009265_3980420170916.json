The first component\n            improves textbook production and distribution by financing\n            the following: (1) purchasing and distributing core\n            textbooks for general education grades 1-10 to schools over\n            a four-year period; (2) providing equipment and technical\n            assistance to establish a computerized system for\n            consolidating textbook orders; (3) providing technical\n            assistance and training in curriculum design and preparation\n            of publishers guidelines; (4) providing technical assistance\n            and training for bid administrators, bid evaluators,\n            authors, and publishers in book procurement; and (5)\n            providing training and information for school directors,\n            teachers, and parents in managing school-based revolving\n            funds and in allocating subsidies to poor students. The\n            second component supports detailed design, piloting, and\n            implementation of the government's strategy for\n            reforming the general education system. Its sub-components\n            will increase efficiency by rationalizing schools and\n            staffing; and improve resource mobilization and school\n            performance by granting schools legal and financial autonomy."}, "docdt": "1997-10-28T00:00:00Z"}
