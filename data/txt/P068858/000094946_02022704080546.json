will assist in the restoration\n            of wetlands in the Danube River basin and pilot the use of\n            riparian wetlands as nutrient traps. Since this is the first\n            project of its kind, it should be well-designed,\n            environmentally sound, and socially acceptable so that it\n            can be a model for similar development in the future. This\n            environmental assessment concludes that firstly, the\n            wetlands restoration may not lead to the expected increase\n            in fish resources. A technical solution is proposed to\n            ensure an annual flooding for around 60 days which would be\n            sufficient for successful spawning of fish and for inflowing\n            of significant volumes of water from the Danube to be\n            treated by the water vegetation. Secondly, risk of negative\n            impacts by flooding and groundwater on arable and non-arable\n            land, buildings, and drainage structures is considered very\n            high. A compensation system should be agreed upon with the\n            affected land owners. The technical project should stress on\n            the inland protection. It should also focus on continued\n            functioning of the remaining part of the drainage system to\n            prevent flooding and damaging of the drainage system.\n            Thirdly, increased population of mosquitoes, risk of\n            malaria, and population of fish products are not expected.\n            However, it is advisable to have a mosquito management plan\n            using both biological and chemical control measures, and\n            introduce the European standards for control of fish products."}, "docdt": "2002-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
