local communities and local authorities in\n            the Persian Nature Park and Kalimok/Brushlen Protected Site\n            areas adopt sustainable natural respurces management\n            practices. There are two amin project components. First, in\n            the initial phase of this component, marshland will be\n            recovered and restored in two already identified sites to\n            demonstrate the use of wetlands as nutrient sinks.\n            Additional sites are expected to be identified and restored\n            later during project implementation. The GEF funds will\n            finance consultancy services for the elaboration of detailed\n            engineering designs, baseline surveys, and the supervision\n            of construction and rehabilitation activities of small\n            infrastructure which will regulate water flows. Grantsupport\n            is being sought for consultant services pre-feasibility and\n            feasibility studies, design of restoration activities, and\n            needed civil works. The second component supports the next\n            step towards sustainable resource managmeent and protection\n            within the two protected sites by funding the preparation of\n            protected areas management plans at the two sites. It moves\n            on to then support the implementation of priority actions\n            identified in these plans; strengthens monitoring programs\n            for water quality, biodiversity, socioeconomic indicators,\n            and health risks; builds a public awareness and education\n            campaign; and strengthens land/water management institutions."}, "docdt": "2002-05-17T00:00:00Z"}
