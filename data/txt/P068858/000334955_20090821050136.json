development outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: participatory\n            approaches to wetland restoration design were critical for\n            project success, which hinged on changing people's\n            perceptions of wetlands, and gaining the full support for\n            restoration among authorities and stakeholders. Protected\n            area (PA) local consultative councils and public awareness\n            campaigns effectively supported stakeholder involvement. The\n            established panel of experts was instrumental in providing\n            independent assessments that balanced the best interests of\n            local stakeholders and Government. Skepticism about wetland\n            restoration among stakeholders transformed into strong\n            support through their early involvement in planning and\n            decision making processes. Linking small grants and farmer\n            transition support programs to the broader objective of\n            wetlands restoration was highly beneficial to local\n            communities to ensure: (i) commitment to common goals;\n            engagement with the main restoration activity; and (ii)\n            raising public awareness of environmental and conservation\n            issues. If well targeted and managed, the community-level\n            grant programs financing local initiatives on the ground can\n            be effective to engage diverse local stakeholders\n            (communities, farmers, etc.) with the main project activity\n            and to foster stronger public commitment to the project\n            objectives. The project region had lost over 80 percent of\n            its floodplains and wetlands and restoring these is a\n            significant environmental achievement. This project focused\n            on wetlands potential to reduce nutrient loads; however, the\n            wider environmental benefits, especially for conservation of\n            biodiversity and reproduction of bio-resources such as fish\n            and birds, have produced additional benefits."}, "docdt": "2009-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
