This Indigenous\n            peoples Plan (IPP) provides specific actions to be taken\n            (Annex 1) during project implementation, Annex 2 identifies\n            the statistics regarding minorities in the different project\n            areas, while annex 3 outlines the ethnic minorities\n            education strategy. The demand for child labor among ethnic\n            minorities - largely living, and working in agriculture or\n            herding - is very high, which conflicts with the costs of\n            sending a child to school, thus accounting for late\n            enrollments, absenteeism from school, and/or drop out cases.\n            As well, educational attainment of the adult population, and\n            its impact on minority family aspirations for the education\n            of their children, demonstrate the high illiteracy rates,\n            and susceptibility to cycles of poverty. Basic education\n            will be expanded, consistent with the Ministry of\n            Education's standard criteria for all schools, to\n            include as well existing minority language textbooks, and\n            identified supplementary reading materials at the Provincial\n            level, prepared jointly with the Chinese Experts Panel.\n            Special attention will be provided to girl's education,\n            their enrollment, and school attendance, while distance\n            education alternatives shall be provided for remote areas.\n            The capacities of local departments of education will be\n            strengthened to administer educational policies that include\n            minority education strategies."}, "docdt": "2003-03-31T22:47:04Z"}
