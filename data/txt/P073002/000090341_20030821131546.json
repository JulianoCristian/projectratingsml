 project are to improved access to and completion of\n            affordable and quality basic education for poor boys and\n            girls in Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan Provinces, Ningxia Hui and\n            Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions. There are three\n            components to the project. Component 1. The objective of\n            this component is to improve access to quality primary and\n            junior secondary education, by providing schools which are\n            close to where children live and eliminating dangerous and\n            dilapidated school buildings. School Construction and\n            Upgrading: This subcomponent will assist county and township\n            governments to finance the construction and repair of\n            approximately 1,600 schools. School Furniture, Teaching\n            Equipment, and Library Books: This subcomponent will support\n            acquisition of school furniture, teaching equipment and\n            library books for primary and lower secondary schools.\n            Component 2. Strengthening Management and Administration:\n            The objective of this component is to strengthen the\n            capacity of local departments of education to implement the\n            project and administer education policies. Project\n            Monitoring: The monitoring will be managed at the county and\n            provincial levels by project implementations offices, under\n            the supervision of the Foreign Investment and Loan Office\n            (FILO) of the Ministry of Education (MOE). Institutional\n            Development: This subcomponent will strengthen the\n            management skills at the provincial and county levels.\n            Component 3. Implementing Strategies to Improve the Quality\n            of Teaching and Learning: This component seeks to strengthen\n            the delivery of teacher training services to improve the\n            poor quality and limited coverage of qualified teachers,\n            including bilingual and multi-grade teachers in primary and\n            junior secondary schools, and upgrading the quality of\n            temporary (daike) teachers. Rural Education Reform Pilots:\n            This subcomponent will support the research in support of\n            current education policy reforms in areas of direct\n            strategic interest to the Ministry of Education and project\n            Provinces and Autonomous Regions."}, "docdt": "2002-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
