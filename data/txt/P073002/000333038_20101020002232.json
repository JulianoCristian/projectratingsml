Areas Project", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7194", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Basic Education in\n            Western Areas Project for China were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned include: this project has\n            benefited from a very close alignment of China's\n            national interest with local demand in overcoming inequities\n            between boys and girls, between Han and ethnic minorities,\n            and within and between provinces. There was a close match of\n            the Bank and Department for International Development's\n            (DfID's) partnership strategies with the Government of\n            China's (GoC's). The outcome indicators enabled\n            the assessment as to whether the project had achieved the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO). The use of Chinese\n            Expert Panel forged a link between national-level experts\n            and provincial level experts, resulting in transfer of\n            knowledge and skills. This addressed a critical capacity\n            constraint at the local level. The impact evaluation will be\n            more effective if it was planned at the time of project\n            preparation. The baseline data collection exercise should\n            take place before the delivery of inputs. Signing on to the\n            impact evaluation could be a condition for the counties to\n            participate in the project in order to obtain the highest\n            level of cooperation and to maximize the use of the findings\n            to improve practices. The Wenchuan Earthquake is a wake-up\n            call for all Bank projects in countries with seismic\n            activities. It is worthwhile to engage civil engineers to\n            look into the construction standards and structural\n            soundness of the designs for schools. It is also worthwhile\n            to build into co-curricular activities drills for evacuation\n            and first aid."}, "docdt": "2010-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
