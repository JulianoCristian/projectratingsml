efforts to restore the delivery of\n            primary education of acceptable quality during the 1996-97\n            school year. A second objective is to help build capacity\n            for planning and implementation of education programs at the\n            state, entity, canton, and municipality level. To achieve\n            these objectives under the prevailing constraints, the\n            project focuses on meeting immediate educational needs in\n            primary schooling which can, for the most part, be put in\n            place prior to the start of the next school year in\n            September, 1996. The components of the project are the\n            following: 1) primary school reconstruction; 2) books and\n            educational materials; 3) project implementation and\n            capacity building; and 4) project preparation and pilot\n            implementation in the Republica Srpska. They include civil\n            works, provision of furniture and equipment and technical\n            assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1996-04-22T00:00:00Z"}
