The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            Emergency projects should use a simple design as well as\n            simplified procurement procedures. 2) Sector work should be\n            undertaken and policy issues addressed during projects\n            supervision using grant financing and through coordination\n            with other donors. 3) Emergency projects should be designed\n            in a modular nature, allowing for flexibility in\n            re-allocating resources during implementation. 4) Qualified\n            borrower personnel should be appointed full time to an\n            implementation unit during the project preparation period\n            and be given autonomy in the execution of the project. 5)\n            Continuous technical assistance for implementation should be\n            built into emergency projects from preparation through the\n            first year of implementation. 6) The borrower's project\n            unit should enjoy autonomy in its day-to-day operations. 7)\n            Appointment of experienced Bank staff to field offices is\n            the best way to ensure timely client service necessary for\n            early project start-up, clearance of bidding documents, etc.\n            8) Streamlined procurement guidelines are important\n            ingredients for accelerated implementation of emergency\n            projects. 9) Donor confidence in autonomous project\n            management units should be strengthened through special\n            procurement reviews as well as technical and financial\n            audits. 10) Close communication and coordination among\n            donors and nongovernmental organizations is important."}, "docdt": "1998-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
