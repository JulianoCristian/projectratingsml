"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory,\n            and project sustainability is rated likely. The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. General lessons learned from the project\n            focused on the following: 1) Consensus among the key players\n            of any institutional reform is essential for successful\n            implementation. Solving the perennial problem of weak\n            coordination between ministries is critical. Where the\n            project was weakest-decentralizing teacher recruitment,\n            solving the teacher payment problems, undertaking\n            evaluations to make the link between teacher training and\n            student achievement--was where more than one ministry was\n            involved. 2) While the LIL instrument has been flexible, it\n            would be useful if the number of performance indicators was\n            determined at an earlier stage. 3) The LIL strengthened the\n            capacity in the education sector to pilot, test, and adjust\n            the decision-making process to evolving situations. 4)\n            Ministries of Education generally do not undertake\n            systematic monitoring and evaluation because they are\n            ill-equipped to do adequate economic and financial analysis\n            and generate the information needed to understand costs.\n            This is a general problem, but needs to be tackled upfront\n            if information and analysis is to be used in the decision\n            making. Project-specific lessons comprised the following: 1)\n            The involvement of associate teachers and school directors\n            in the practical training of the student-teachers was\n            extremely important in providing a solid professional basis\n            to the student-teacher, stabilizing them in their respective\n            classrooms within a very short time, and providing the\n            necessary professional support that they need on a\n            day-to-day basis within the school. However, associate\n            teachers and head teachers should be selected with great\n            care and given appropriate and sustained training and\n            incentives to make them want to host, monitor, and mentor\n            new student-teachers. 2) Regular training and a coherent\n            capacity-building program for all concerned parties (tutors\n            in the college, the pedagogic advisers, associate teachers)\n            is extremely important in ensuring consistency of messages\n            to students. 3) Lessons learned and difficulties encountered\n            during training should be fed back into the revision of\n            college-based courses for greater efficiency and relevance.\n            4) To ensure consistency and coherence, it is necessary to\n            put in place an in-service teacher-training program that\n            draws from the approach and contents of the current\n            pre-service teacher education program. 5) Project managers\n            attention should constantly be drawn to the importance of\n            monitoring and evaluation, and Bank staff should pay greater\n            attention during supervisions of monitoring and evaluation\n            activities. 6) The increase in the entry level qualification\n            enabled the teacher training institutions to focus and spend\n            a significant portion of their time on professional and\n            pedagogic training. 7) The rapidly changing composition of\n            the teaching corps and the growing numbers of contractual\n            teachers in the education system, is an urgent call for the\n            need to adopt a career development plan. 8) Adequate human,\n            fiscal, and physical resources are extremely important for\n            the smooth implementation of any program."}, "docdt": "2003-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
