objective of the Pre-Service\n            Teacher Education Project is to develop an innovative,\n            school-based teacher education system with sufficient\n            capacity to respond to Guinea's decision to provide\n            primary education to all children. The project's\n            specific objectives are to: (i) make teacher education\n            institutions more productive and less costly; (ii) enhance\n            quality by strengthening links between teacher education and\n            school/classroom realities; and (iii) design and implement\n            new systems for recruiting and managing teachers on a\n            decentralized basis, in support of an increasingly important\n            contractual, non-civil service teacher corps. The project\n            components are: (i) pre-service teacher training; (ii)\n            decentralized teacher career management; and (iii) project\n            preparation facility."}, "docdt": "1998-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
