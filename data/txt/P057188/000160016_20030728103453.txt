  OED Mission:Enhancingdevelopmenteffectiveness through excellenceand independence inevaluation.


About this Report
      The OperationsEvaluationDepartmentassessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two
purposes:first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank`swork is
producingthe expectedresults,and second,to help develop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough
the disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As part of this work, OED annuallyassessesabout 25 percentof
the Bank`s lendingoperations. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment, preferenceis givento those that are
innovative,large, or complex;those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations;those for which
ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhave requestedassessments;and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.The projects,topics,and analyticalapproaches selectedfor assessmentsupport larger evaluation
studies.
     A Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
Report (a self-evaluation by the responsibleBank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interviewoperationalstaff, and in most cases visit
the borrowing country for onsite discussionswith projectstaff and beneficiaries.The PPARthereby seeks to
validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
OED studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsibleBank department and amended as necessary.The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrower for review;the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank`s
Board of Executive Directors.After an assessment report has beensent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the OED RatingSystem
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methods offer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. OED evaluatorsall apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Followingis
the definition and ratingscale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
http://worldbank,org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project`s objectivesare consistentwith the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, NegIigible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved,or expectedto be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance.Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency:The extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Sustainability:The resilienceto risk of net benefitsflows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      InstitutionalDevelopmentImpact: The extent to which a project improvesthe ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate,which derives from these
institutional arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extentto which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance:The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure
quality of preparationand implementation,and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievementof developmentobjectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory,Highly unsatisfactory.

        Attachedis aPerformance Assessment Report(PAR) on five educationprojects in
Guinea.The SecondEducationProject(Cr. 1341-GN), approved for a credit ofUS$11
million equivalent on March 29, 1983, closed on December 31, 1990, after extensions
totaling two years; US$700,000 was canceled. The African Development FundandSaudi
Fundprovidedparallelfinancing ofUS$11.7 andUS$4million, respectively. The
EducationSector AdjustmentCredit(Cr. 2155-GN), approved for acredit o fUS$21.6
millionequivalent inJune 1990, closed onJune 30, 1994, after a one-year extension and
was hlly disbursed.The U.S. Agency for IntemationalDevelopment (USAID) provided
parallel financing o fUS$29.1 million. EquityandSchoolImprovement(Cr. 2719-GN),
approved for a credit o fUS$43 millionequivalent inJune 1995, closed on June 30,2002,
after a one-year extension; abalance ofUS$8.9 millionwas canceled. The Higher
EducationManagementSupportProject(Cr. 2787-GN), approved for a credit o fUS$6.6
millionequivalent inNovember 1995, closed on December 31,2001, after a one-year
extension; abalance o fUS$590,000 was canceled. The Pre-ServiceTeacher Education
Project(Cr. 3119-GN), approved for a credit ofUS$4.1millionequivalent inMay 1998,
closed as scheduled on March 31,2002; US$0.2 millionwas canceled.

        The assessmentswere conductedto study the effectiveness o fBank strategy ina
country that had one o f the lowest school enrollment rates inthe world as well as
considerable determination to bringabout sustainedchange.

        The PPAR is based on the following sources: Project or Implementation
Completion Reports (ICRs), Staff Appraisal Reports (SARs), Loan Agreements for the
projects, andproject files, particularly the supervision reports. An OED mission visited
Guinea inDecember 2002 to collect other pertinent information. The author thanks the
government officials who received the mission for their extensive cooperation.

        Following standard OED procedures, copies o fthe draft PPAR were sent to the

 Summary
         This is the GuineaPerformance Assessment Report (PPAR) on five education
projects inGuinea. The SecondEducationProject,approved for a credit o fUS$11
millionequivalent onMarch29, 1983, closed on December 31, 1990, after extensions
totaling two years; US$700,000 was canceled. The African DevelopmentFundand Saudi
Fundprovided parallel financing ofUS$11.7 andUS$4 million,respectively. The
EducationSector Adjustment Credit,approved for US$21.6 million equivalent inJune
 1990, closed on June 30, 1994, after a one-year extension and was fully disbursed.The
U.S. Agency for Intemational Development(USAID) providedparallel financing o f
US$29.1 million. Equityand SchoolImprovement,approvedfor US$43 million
equivalent inJune 1995, closed on June 30,2002, after a one-year extension; a balance o f
US$8.9 millionwas canceled. The HigherEducationManagementSupportProject,
approved for US$6.6 million equivalent inNovember 1995, closed on December 31,
2001, after a one-year extension; a balance o fUS$590,000 was canceled. The Pre-
Service Teacher EducationProject,approved for US$4.1 million equivalent inM a y
 1998, closed as scheduled on March 31,2002; US$0.2 million was canceled.

         While each project had its own specific objectives, the common goals were to
increase access to primary and vocational education, train teachers, and improve the
quality o f education. Overall, activities have beenimplemented as expected, including
innovative components. Most objectives were met or exceeded, and they have been
relevant to the human resource development needs o f the country and the goals of the
Bank's Education for All strategy.

         The projects contributed to a large increase inthe gross enrollment ratio from 32
percent in 1991 to 72 percent in2002, particularly for girls, whose enrollment increased
from 19.7 percent in 1991to 62 percent in2002. Project-financedbuildings including
functional, though underused, vocational-technical institutions, havebeen used for
generations o f students and educators. The many staff who received fellowships inthe
early 1980s have since staffed educational institutions. Successful systems have been
implemented to produce reliable educational statistics and train teachers.

        However, the projects faced financial management problems. Irregularities in
school construction andtextbook acquisition have resulted insuspendeddisbursements
and wasted funds. There i s currentlyan almost total lack of textbooks inschools, partly
because o f theft. Without textbooks, all levels o f the system face a severe limitation inthe
provision and processing of information, and students learn very little. At least half the
time o f any class observed i s taken up with copying and recopying. LimitedFrench
knowledge make it hardto transmit complex concepts inclass. Student assessment results
suggest that the vast majority students in grade 6graduate without having learned basic
skills. The limitedstudent skills have made it difficult to train teachers within short
periods o f time.

        Onbalance, project outcomes were ratedsatisfactory. Thoughmost objectives o f
Education I1were not met, the project was rated moderately satisfactory becausethe
infrastructure andstaff training it provided has increasedinstitutional capacity inthe long

run.The EducationSectorAdjustment Creditwas ratedhighlysatisfactory becausenearly
all its policy conditions were met, and their effect was lasting. Institutionaldevelopment for
the Pre-service Teacher Training Project was rated substantial but for all others it was rated
modest. Sustainability was ratedlikely for all projects. Bank performance was rated
unsatisfactory for EducationI1(Bank didnot effectively interveneto resolve problems) and
satisfactory for the other projects. Borrower performance was rated unsatisfactory for
Education 11, highlysatisfactory for the Education Sector Adjustment Credit and for the
Pre-service Teacher Training Project; it was rated satisfactory for the remaining three.

         Experience with the projects confirms OED lessons fi-omeducation projects:

     0   Policy dialogue andproject activities must stay focused on improving instructional
         effectiveness andproviding students with basic skills. Activities aimed at strength-
         eningmanagement andprocuring educational commodities maybenecessarybut
         they are not sufficient for the improvement o f learning and quality ineducational
         systems. Providing mass education under clearly inadequate instructional condi-
         tions may graduate hnctionalilliterates andbenefitonly a minority o f students.

     0   Textbooks are crucial providers o f information inschools. Ifthey are unavailable
         or ifstudents cannot study from them sufficiently, the effectiveness o fthe
         educational investments i s reduced. Procurement methods andplans must aim at
         making large numberso f textbooks available at an affordable cost and free to the
         poor. Textbook management mustbuild on the strengths o f the private sector and
         o f community associations.

     0   Sustained investment inhuman resources can improve implementation capacity o f
         specific institutions. For example, foreign fellowships for persons who retum and
         devote their career to the agencies they were expected to serve may result ina
         considerable cadre o f trained and competent staff.

     0   Inearlier decades, the Bank supported vocational training schools inmany
         countries, which often function with few students, highunit costs, and outdated
         equipmentandcurricula. Bankinvestments will bebest usedifpolicy dialogue is
         focused toward modemizing courses, generating income, and catering to the
         populations likely to be interestedinvocational training.

                1.        Background

                1.        Guinea i s one o fthe few low-income countries to have sustained over the past
                decade the primary school enrollment rate increases necessary to achieve universal
                primary education inthe near future. Despite a weak macroeconomic environment, the
                government worked out approaches to solving various problems and forged ahead. This
                has included some innovative approaches, such as instruction innational languages
                (though it was eventually abandoned infavor o f French), preventive health activities in
                schools, teacher-driven school grants, instruction via interactive radio, sample-based
                assessment o f school learning, gender equity committees, NGO-led construction, and
                reform o fteacher education.

                2.        The government that succeeded Sekou Toure in 1986includedseveral visionaries
                who focused on sustainable development and strong national institutions. Their efforts
                produced "Guinea 2010," a document o fnational consensus that emphasized
                decentralization and community involvement. Ineducation, Guinea adopted the National
                Program for Education for All in 1990and set goals to expand the gross primary school
                enrollment rate from 28 percent to 53 percent by the year 2000, to increase the efficiency
                o fresource use withinthe sector, to increase overall government support for basic
                education, and to improve the quality o f education. The government's willingness to take
                action attracted considerable donor support from USAID, African Development Bank
                (ADB), Islamic Development Bank, Saudi Fund, andAfricanDevelopmentFund(a
                Washington-based NGO). The Bank has coordinated donor efforts and policy dialogue
                since the 1980s.The larger IDA-financed projects have hadmultiple donor participation,
                particularly inbuildingcivil works.

                3.       Bank role. The Bankhas designedits country assistanceportfolio for Guinea
                around three main areas: growth (mining, agriculture), community involvement, and
                institutional capacity incentives. Ineducation, it financed seven projects that were
                completed between 1983 and 2002 (Table 1).

Project Objectives

4.          Bank lendingineducation has focused on increasing access and improving
quality and management at all levels, including higher education. Project objectives show
that inits earlier stages, the Bank was concerned with increasing access and developing
the humanresources that would teach inthe sector and manage it. As inmany countries,
lendinginthe 1970s focused on training vocational-technical education teachers rather
than students, the main goal ofthe First Education Project (Table 2), assessedby OED in
 1986.' Concems with quality of primary education became more prominent after 1995
and are prominent inthe Education for All project, currently under implementation.

1. Project Performance Appraisal Report. Guinea: First Education Project. November 26, 1986, Report no. 6498. The
project financed construction of the Ecole Normale Superieure d'Enseignement Technique (ENSET). Teachers
received training ingeneral and auto mechanics, welding, electricity, masonry, carpentry, plumbing, metalwork, and
operation o f public works equipment. A Baccalaureate and good knowledge o f French was required for entrance, which
few people possessed.When audited, the institution had an insufficient budget and only 230 students instead of the 400
expected annually. Though ingood condition in2003, it had only 285 students and was not serving the poor residents
o f the area.

2.          Implementationof theAssessedProjects

 5.         Project implementationshared the following common activities and problems
(Annex A, Tables 1-5).

6.          Civil works. The projectsbuilt andrefurbishededucational institutions o f various
 sizes. Much o f the constructionwas carried through parallel donor financing. Education
I1built four vocational andtwo teacher training centers that cost morethan expected. The
Education Sector Adjustment Program(known as PASE I)' the Equity and Schools      and
Improvement project (known as PASE 11)built or rehabilitated a total of 4,796 primary
classrooms, mainly inrural areas (Annex A, Tables 1-3). LocalNGOsproved capable o f
buildingbetterquality schools and at lower cost than the g~vernment.~                           Nevertheless,
communities provedless capable o f financing andmaintaining schools than had been
expected at appraisal. Overall civil works were completed as expected andwere o f
acceptable quality.

7.          Textbooks.The projects financed no textbooks to vocational andteacher training
students, only to primaryeducation students. The three projects that containedtextbook
components, however, hadmajor problems. EducationI1produced about 450,000
textbooks4that were to be sold for cost recovery, but the poor could not afford the books,
so only 12,000 were sold, mainly inConakry. (The OED mission could not get a clear
answer regarding the fate o fthe rest.) UnderPASE I, textbooks and guideswere
                                                                          400,000
distributedinschools, andthey were inuse in 1997.5PASEI1financed 2.4 million
textbooks that were to be rentedto students at low prices (US$0.20 for primary and
US$0.50 for secondary students). The scheme worked well insome areas of the interior,
butthe rental fees were lost to mismanagement o fbank accounts.6At the same time,
manybooks were stolen from schools or soldillegally and lack o f funds prevented
renewal o f the stock. Otherswere worn out. (See section on PASE I1implementation
below.) As a result, schools had almost no textbooks in2003.

8.         Teacher training. Education I1as well as bilateral donors gave large numberso f
foreign fellowships (about 85 staff years could be documented) for ministry staff and
teachers o fvarious educationalinstitutions. Education I1also financed the operation o f
pre-service teacher trainingcolleges but did not finance the instructional aspects o f
training teachers. The issue was revisited about 20 years later, when the Pre-service
Teacher Training Project invested insome o f the existingfacilities to make possible the

3. Under the adjustment credit, government tried to build its own schools with its own construction unit but built fewer
than 300 classrooms inthree years.
4. The project was to provide textbooks in sevennational languages, but only 10 ofthe planned 22 titles were
developed and those only inFrench. This was the result o f a government policy change in 1984, to which the Bank did
not contribute.

1'Education Civique. Annuaire statistique Enseignement Primaire. Conakry June 2002.)
6 . The donors expected the rental fees to be kept locally to help maintain the book stock and to accustom local officials
to managing money. The central government, however, required that the fees be deposited inregional accounts, which
were subsequentlyusedfor political purposes.

  intensive training o f large numberso fteachers. (See details o f this project below.) The
  concept o f in-sewice training was introduced as a policy item under PASEI. than                      Rather
  carry out large-scale workshops, which have often limitedoutcomes, PASE I1developed
  a tailored approach through a program o f about 1,200 grants to schools. The grants
  mainly financed training inFrench and mathematics, but also some infrastructure repair.

  9.        Planning and institutional development. Nearly every project has supported the
  development o f educational statistics units at the primary and higher education level
  through staff training and hardware (Annex A, Tables 1-4). Attempts under Education I1
  were unsatisfactory, but later projects resultedinthe production o f timely statistical
  reports. The higher education project also supported 25 studies on governance and
  finance issues (at the ministryand at the institutional level), some with grant-financed
  research (Annex A, Table 4).

  10.       Educational telecommunications. Ina country with a limitedtelephone network
  the PASE I1project financed VHF (very high frequency) radio to link 10regional and 38
  prefect-level offices. The higher education project financed a VHF satellite antenna for
  telecommunications and Internet access linkingthe Ministry o f Higher Education and the
  universityo f Conakry with the moreremote towns o fBok& Farana, and Kankan.

  11.       Financial management. Most projects have faced large governance and financial
' management issues. Prominent were procurement irregularities andmissingrecords. The
  magnitude o f the problems became more evident inthe later projects, after the Bank
  emphasized procurement planning and audits. PASE 11, inparticular, had multiple and
  major issues. For example, a 1998 audit' found lax accounting procedures, ineligible
  expenditures, and no archiving o f documents on providers. Misuse o f the emergency
  school repairs fund resulted insuspended disbursements for that subcomponent. In
  addition, multipleaspects o ftextbook provision were mismanaged. Inthe Ministry o f
  HigherEducation, the expenditures o fthe financial controller's unitthat was to be
  strengthenedthrough the higher education project could not properly be accounted.

  12.       Below is the implementation experience for individual projects as well as mission
  visit findings.

  13.       The project dealt with multiple subsectors, and its designconsisted o fweakly
  linked components. The complexity contributed to longdelays. Conflicts betweenthe
  Bank and the government arose regarding the cost o f various activities. Total project
  costs were 23 percent higher than expected (though an extra center was included).
  Support to the pedagogical institute and financing o f a printingpress for textbooks had
  limited outcomes (Annex A, Table 1).

14.       The project continuedthe vocational-technical education investments o f the first
project, which had focused on vocational teacher training.8 The vocational centers built
were staffed by instructors who hadbeentrained under the first project. Their operational
policies included entryrequirement o f 10 years o f education, instruction inFrench, and
no cost recovery from students.

15.       In2003, the centers continuedto operate the sameway. Havingreceived little
investment inthe past 20 years, they have little equipment left. Few studentswith the
requisite education are interested inthe training, and without adequate tuition levels, it
has not beenpossible to institute popular courses such as computer technology. For
example, the Lab6 center has only about 250 students (35 girls) and operates on a
shortened schedule, closing at 2 p.m., but few pieces o f equipment remain from the
second. The linkage with businesses i s limited, mainly consisting o f an effort to train the
informal apprentices o f local artisans inthe afternoons. However, staff have developed
and are disseminating to studentstechniques o fmaking bricks andbuildings o f stabilized
unbaked clay to alleviate the environmental consequences o fbakingbricks. The
vocational training center of Boke (financed through Italian aid) presents a similar picture
o f large buildingsused for halfa day. The center caters to the bauxite industry and
currently i s training 410 students (36 girls) inmine operations, usingequipment obtained
through Canadian aid.

16.       While these campuses are underused, potential students with lower levels o f
education have few options open. Admission requirementsalso kept teacher training
colleges underoccupied untilthe Preservice Teacher Training Project used these
institutions more efficiently (see below).

17.       The needfor this project arosebecause o frapidly deteriorating economic conditions
duringthe 1980sanddropping primaryschool enrollments that resulted from the increasing
poverty." The Programme d'Ajustement Sectoriel de 1'Education (PASE I)                           consisted o f
three tranches totaling US$20 million that were to be released as specific conditions were
met: adoption o fa nationalpolicy to increase primary-school enrollments (particularly for
girls), redeployment of teachers from offices to schools, increased spending inprimary
schools, and establishment of financing norms for non-salary expenditure (Annex A, Table
2). IDA contributed 45 percent o fthe total government program. Some 20 donors financed

18.       The project coincided with aperiod o f strong political commitment and dedicated
leadership inthe Ministryo f Education. A team o f competent managerswas assembled
that took charge o f implementation. O f 16 policy-related activities 15 were carried out
and 13 had a sustained effect (Annex A, Table 2). The gross enrollment ratio" rose from
32 in 1990 to 52 percent in 1997, while girls' enrollments almost doubled from 19 to 35
percent over the same period. The share o fprimary education inthe educationbudget
increased from 35 percent in 1993 to 68 percent in2002.12It was a period o f important
sectoral achievements and the foundations were laid for future progress.

Equity and School ImprovementProject(FY95)

19.       Implementation o fthe sector adjustment policies continued through an investment
project, PASE11.Inaddition to increasing access the project focused more on quality o f
education. As with PASE I,the project involved coordinating several donors-the
African Development Bank (US$11million), Canada (US$1.6 million), European Union
(US$15.6 million), France (US$9.5 million), Japan (US$15 million), and USAID (US$20
million)-in       separateprojects. IDA'SUS$43 millionconstituted 37 percent o f donor
financing for the project.

20.       The project showcased the government's strengths and weaknesses. It included
components that were innovative or hardto implement inpoorer countries: School-based
preventive health measures were taken (deworming, micronutrients, folic acid
supplementation), but disagreements with donors on drug prices resulted insporadic
administrations and ultimatelywere not effective inreducing the children's parasitic load
(Annex A, Table 3). The school-based teacher training grants reached about halfthe
teacher p~pulation,'~        andall but three o fthe teachers interviewed bythe missionhad
participatedinone. The teachers spoke very positively about the experience andthe
books they hadbought. A sample-based assessment of achievement inthree grades was
carried out in 1998; this activity i s hardto achieve in low-income countries.

21.       However, a cabinet change inthe government in 1998 resulted inless attentionto
instructional issues. The student as~essment'~showed very limitedachievement for most
students(Table 3), but no measures were taken to improve it. To the contrary, the
multipletextbook management and financial issues'' deprived students o ftextbooks and

 Observations included:

      0    There were few textbooks except inthe hands o f the teachers (even ina private
           school visitedinLabe). Teachers spendmucho f time copying on the blackboard
           the material that i s normally intextbooks, and students recopiedthe material.
           Thus, most o fthe class time was spent copying, and students got little practice
           reading or elaborating the materialpresented.

      0    Even ingrades 5 and 6, students read haltingly andwithout comprehension; some
           were unable to readback what they hadcopied. Fewwere fluent readers.

      0    Due to limitedinformation and Frenchknowledge, the discourse inclass was o f
           low level; for example, students were learning the names o f clothes ingrade 4.
           The students lacked the vocabulary to carry out higher-order questioning, class
           discussions, or engage inanalysis and synthesis. Evento become able to read a
           newspaper, manymust go to secondary school.

HigherEducationTechnicalAssistance Project(FY96)

23.        According to the Staff Appraisal Report, higher education inGuinea in 1993
sufferedfrom poor physical infrastructure, erratic policy history, and a severe lack o f
relevance, quality, efficiency, and equity. However, the government was resistant to
meeting efficiency goals as a condition of lending, so a small project o fUS$6.6 million
was designedto improve only management capacity and help the government make
strategic decisions regarding sector performance.

24.        Project activities focused on studying sectoral issues andlocating opportunities
for change. Twenty-five studies were financed by the project (Annex A, Table 4). A
small research grant program was established, and all faculties explored ways to update
their offerings (including graduate courses and doctorates), though there were limited
funds for doingso. Training was offered incomputers inconjunction with the Internet
that was made available through the project. Activities resultedina few policy changes.


parallel funds and finance a different series o fbooks, that were to be printedinFrance. IDA subsequently canceled its
own component. Many of the 2.4 million ADB-financed textbooks that were to be imported were lost from the storage
locations.
16. Those who have textbooks increase their scores by 2.4 points inFrench and 2.2 inmath, while those doing
homework score 7.6 points higher inFrench and 9.8 points higher inmath over those almost never doing homework
(Barrier at al. 1998, p.47, grade 6 summary)
17. The schools were: Federico Mayor in Conakry, Kurula 2 in Labe, Yacine Diallo inLabt, College de Daralabe,
Mamadou Koumbaga inKindia, Franco-Arab school inNianaya, Ecole de Goneye inBoke, catholic school o f Boffa,
and Ccole de la Garre in Conakry. The need to cover long distances made it hard to visit more schools. The rural
schools were chosen for their accessibility and were near the country's main road network, so their conditions are
probably better than average. (Schools inthe more remote forest Guinea may have very different conditions.)

All students continue to receive stipendsbutnow do so only iftheypass examinations.
The expensive cafeteria was closed, and scholarship amounts were increased to allow
studentsto get their own food. However, efforts to increase teaching hours andreduce the
large numbers o fpoorly paid professors failed. Though the project fulfilled its objectives,
it didnot improve instructional deliveryinhigher education, an issue o fmanyAfrican
universities.l8

25.       Inafocus group discussion withthe OED mission, professors anddeans at the
University o f Conakry expressed much satisfaction with the Internet and communication
linktheynow havewith other campuses. Otherproject outcomes were considered
moderately satisfactory. The staff expressed disappointment because no civil works had
been financed; the Universityo f Conakry was built for 1,500 students and houses 10,000.
A needwas expressed for a library where students would findbooks to studybecause
professors must still dictate texts; however, there was no interest inensuring that students
have access to textbooks for home use.

26.        Project effects outside Conakry are unclear. Inthe Higher Education Instituteo f
Mines inBokk, curricular studies were completed but not implemented. The
approximately 500 students study outdated curricula without textbooks and get no
computer training. It was not possible to complete a small buildingto house computers,
so they remaininstorage. Teacher qualifications are low, and the large campus i s
underutilized. The project has not helped implement policies regarding this important
institution.


Pre-Service Teacher Education Project (FY99)

27.       This project was financed to deal with the needto train andhire 20,000-25,000
more teachers inthe next 12 years at the rate o f about 2,000 per year at salaries that the
government can afford. Existing programs produced only about 500 teachers altogether,
and training lasted three years for the trainees who had finished grade 10.19Though three-
year training would strengthen students' weak basic skills, urgent needs for teachers
demanded faster course completion. The project targeted studentswith 11years o f
education who had failed the second part of the Baccalaureate examination and who
agreed to work as contract teachers at salaries o f about US$58 per month (110,000
Guinean francs) and no benefits. The new approach to teacher education consisted o f a
nine-month practice-based course and a three-month summer intensive course, both
followed by regular supervision. After two years o f supervised work, teachers could be
certified. Five o fthe eight teacher training institutes inthe country participated. To
increase ownership and stability o f teachers, candidates were selected by local
authorities.

28.       Discussions with the Bank on the urgency of training ledto a three-year Leaming
Innovation Loan (LIL)that would train 6,000 teachers (25 percent female). With a

community support, so many are knowledgeable and committed.

project preparation fund, the government team started planning inFebruary 1998 andby
June 1998 they admitted the first cohort of trainees. Ultimately out o f 8,166 trainees,
7,579 (37 percent women), passed final examinations. The teachers trained inthat three-
month summer course helped increase enrollment by 52,000 students in 1998/99.20An
evaluation2' indicated that teacher quality i s about the same as that o f other teachers.22
Parents were also satisfied (p. 14).

29.        Focus group discussions with teachers inteacher training institutes o f Conakry,
Labe, and Kindia (Ecoles Normales d'Instruction, ENI) ascertained that it has been
possible to train large numbers o f studentsineffective teaching techniques, but has been
difficult to supervise them during student-teaching. They maybe placed inlocations that
are not accessible. Also, older teachers may convince them to revert to less effective
techniques. It i s uncertain how many o f the poorly paid contract teachers will continue to
work inthe long run.Because there are no textbooks, most o fthe class time inthe ENIs
i s spent dictating information. Student teachers also lack access to the textbooks they will
use to teach their students. The teacher trainers interviewed expressed concerns about the
teachers' Frenchknowledge. Partly due to such reservations, the government plans to
return to three-year training.


3.         Results

Outcomes

30.        The Bank's humanresource development strategy for Guinea, andthe objectives
of the projects it supported, have beenrelevant to the economic needs o f Guinea.
According to some government officials, the investmentspermittedthe country to make
education available to the masses, so that demandoutstrips supply in2003. After 20 years
o f investments, andUS$94.3 million inIDA credits, what effects have the projects
brought about?

31.       Itappearsthat the country has got goodvalue for the US$94.3 millionborrowedin
IDAcredits. As aresult o fpolitical will anddonor emphasis duringthe PASEIproject, the
education budgethas hovered around 25.5 percent o fthe nationalbudgetsince 1991.
Within this allocation, primaryeducationreceived67.8 percent andhigher education 21
percent in2001. The financing changes initiatedthrough the education sector adjustment
project have been sustainable, and resources have been shiftedconsistently to primary
education. The government has contained some higher education excesses common in
other area countries, such expensive cafeterias. Specifically, results are:

32.       Greatly increased access. Guinea has met and surpassed its Education for All
goal to achieve 53 percent gross enrollment rate for 2000 andhas a good chance o f
achieving universalprimaryeducation, the second Millennium Development Goal.23The
rate increased from 32 percent in 1991to 72 percent in2002, and i s approaching the
average o f sub-SaharanAfrica, which i s about 83.6 percent. Girls' enrollment rose from
19.7 to 63 percent inthe same period (Figure 1),24and their share o fprimary enrollments
reached 44 percent in2002, up from 32 percent inthe first half o fthe 1990s. As a result
o f consciousness raising about equity, the gender gap is closing.25More students stay in
school. Those reaching grade 5 increased from 58 to 89.9 percent between 1990 and
1999.26(Enrollment pressurehas resultedinclasses o f 50-110 studentsinurban areas.)
Access has also increased to teacher traininginstitutes, whose output increasedby nearly
10 times inthree years.

However, the 1998 evaluation28(Table 3) indicates that little i s leamed ineach grade.
Only a small percentage o f students score at a mastery criterion o f 75% set bythe test
developers, and the percentage decreasesby grade. The data suggest that the vast
majority of students arefunctionally illiterate at the end of grade 6. Missionobservations
confirmed that many studentswere unable to read or explain what they read.

34.       Because o f low instructional efficiency, students must go to school for many
years to get basic skills and a working knowledge o fFrench. Since they have not leamed
to read andwrite intheir own languages (unless written inthe Arabic script leamed after-
hours), students may graduate unable to express simpleneeds inwriting. The limited
student skills havemade it difficult to train teacherswithinshort periods o ftime.

35.       Training ofeducators. The many fellowships givenduringEducation I1have had
a long-term impact on the sector, since the ministries and educational institutions
continue to be staffed by persons trained at that time. Authorities considered the school-
based grants program under PASE I1highly satisfactory because teachers organizedtheir
own knowledge needs and might become more effective teachers. Repetition inschools
whose teachers hadparticipatedwas lower than innon-participating schools (18 percent
for the first year and 24 percent for the second, compared to 27 and 32 percent,
respectively), but it i s uncertain whether students performed better or teachers were more
sensitized.     29


36.       Vocational education remains limitedbecause o f the higheducational level
required to enter. The low quality o f general education affects students' ability to benefit
from classes taught exclusively inFrench and without textbooks. Institutions remain
functional 20-30 years after they were built, lack o f cost recovery makes it difficult to
improve their equipment and courses. Though some are inlow-income neighborhoods,
they serve very few o fthe residents.

37.       Sectorpolicies and dialogue. Bank strategy for Guinea has changed repeatedly
over a 25-year period.30The policy dialogue carried out under Education I1had limited
scope. Faced with increasing numbers o f Baccalaureate graduates entering the university
automatically, the project sought to reduce secondary school graduation rates rather than

help the government instituteentrance examination^.^' The outcome was to increase
 dropout insecondary schools, and Baccalaureate candidates declined by 45 percent
between 1978 and 1979. Insistence on cost-recovery o f textbooks (under Education 11)
meant that few students could afford to study from them. DuringPASEI,                                 however, a
 series o f far-reaching reforms were implementedto facilitate schooling for the poor,
which have largely beensustained (Annex A, Table 2). Intensepolicy dialogue took
place duringthe higher education and teacher training projects. However, the Bank had
 little advice to offer with regardto language o f instruction issue inthe 1980s, and later
 efforts o f task managers to mitigate the problems associated with use o f Frenchbore
 limitedresults. Furthermore, long-termoutcomes on the quality o f education are
uncertain. None o f the projects has financed focused and specific actions to improve
instructional delivery and student a~hievement.~~The 2003 County Assistance Strategy
for Guinea continues to emphasize quality, equity, and accessibility o f services. Clear
plans to increase achievement, however, are still not drawn.

4.        Ratings

Project Outcomes

38.       The outcome o f the Second EducationProject i s rated moderately satisfactory;
its quality and planning objectives were not met during its implementation, but the
infrastructure and training it provided has helpedtheir achievement inthe longrun.33                                  The
outcome o f the Education Sector Adjustment Project is rated highly satisfactory because
nearly all policy conditions were met, and their effect was lasting. The Equity and School
Improvement Project outcome i s rated satisfactory. Though it was energetically
implemented, textbook provision failed to have a lasting effect, and the quality o f
education may not have improved. The outcome o f the Higher Education Project i s also
satisfactory because its objectives were met, although they were narrow for the needs o f
the sector. The Pre-Service Teacher EducationProject is rated satisfactory. Its objectives
were largely achieved efficiently and targets were exceeded, but the knowledge level o f
teachers may not meet school requirements, and the government plans to revert to longer
training.


Institutional Development Impact

39.      For the Pre-ServiceTeacher Educationproject, institutional development is rated
substantial. The ProfessionalTraining Ministry as well as the participating teacher
training centers were able to respond to the demand and increase teacher training output
almost tenfold. For the other projects, institutional development is rated modest; the
ability o fthe institutions to provide education to all was cloudedby the governance issues

3 1. Automatic entry to universities is a long-standing issue o f countries that follow the French system in particular, and
the Bank has heldpolicy discussions with many countries (Salmi, J. et al. 2002. Constructingknowledge societies :
new challenges for tertiary education. Washington: World Bank. Directions inDevelopment Series.).
32. Extensive classroom-level work was undertaken by bilateral donors (Canada, Germany, USAID) but it was applied
inlimitedcircumstances.The Bank didnot create sufficient linkages to help ensure that the most promising
developments were taken to scale.
33. The Project Completion Report in 1991 rated outcome as unsatisfactory and institutional development as negligible.

                                                  13


related to civil works and textbooks. Institutional development was considered negligible
for the second education project upon completion, but the fellowships andtraining
provided had a lasting effect on the ability o f institutions to respond to students' needs.


Sustainability

40.       Sustainability for all projects i s rated likely. The training and infrastructure
investments o fthe second education project have been sustained over time, as have many
o fthe sector adjustment policies. Government ownership has been sustained over the
years, but the system's financial sustainability i s questionable givenuniversity
expenditure that i s still disproportionate. To deliver the quantity and quality o f the
educationneeded, the system will requiremore government funding, which the donor
community can only supplement.Inparticular, textbooks are not sustainable without
donor financing. Though the training format usedinthe teacher training project andits
benefits may be sustainable, the sustainability o fthe training policy i s indoubt, because
the government intendsto returnto three-year training.


Bank Performance

41.       Bank performance has greatly improved inthe past 20 years. Performance was
unsatisfactory inthe second education project, which demonstrated poor human resource
development by sanctioning a government policy that forced dropouts. Bank performance
i s rated satisfactory in all subsequent projects. Government staff were highly appreciative
o f its vision, support, donor coordination, and push for quality. Once the Bank committed
to a lendingprogram, it fulfilled its commitments. Nevertheless, some officials
interviewed felt that the Bank didnot respondto needs for more construction or urban
schools, secondary school laboratories, and badly needed universitybuildings.Though
Bank projects contain much training, other donors offer that as well.

42.       The Bank supervisedprojects closely inthe 1990s,but several officials expressed
concernbecause o f staff turnover since 2000. Different task managers came with
different views, and Guineanstaff felt that they had to spendtime briefing them about
previous agreements and policies. Some were generalists with little educational
knowledge and limitedunderstanding o f the rationale for various decisions. Often they
were slow to give approvals, andthe government felt that the Bank was paying no
attention to its needs. For example, Bank decisions were blamed for the erratic
procurement and distribution o f dewormining pills to children.

43.       Inaddition, repeated concerns were expressedabout complex andtime-
consumingprocurement procedures. Inparticular, government staff who were
interviewed felt that procurement o f items inlarge packages preventedthem from doing
their work. For example, ifthe statistics office ran out o fprintertoner, it had to wait for
six months. Computers hadto be procured inlarge lots 2-3 years inadvance, andbythe
timethey arrived, themodels were out o f date. Procurementplanningduringappraisals
appears to have been insufficient. Government procurement practices may have
compoundedproblems.

Borrower Performance

44.       Insome respects, Guineaninstitutions offer strikingcontrasts. Onone hand, there
 are many competent staff andmiddle managers who are stable, have a long institutional
memory, execute agreed activities and readily discuss substantive issues. Inthe mid-
 1990s, inparticular, the Ministryo f Educationpaid much attentionto educational issues.
 On the other hand, the government as a whole has given a limited support to education:
chronic underfinancing, appointing some very weak senior-level managers and
accountants, and demonstrating poor governance. Some persons interviewed argued that
the extensive donor support o fnon-salary expenditurehas made the government
complacent and not as interested inreform. Corruption worries donors, who have become
cautious about investinginthe parts of the education systemthat involve large-scale
procurement, such as textbooks and civil works.

45.       Moreover, the systemhas beenwasteful; the Ministry o f Education split into three
(pre-university,higher, andvocational-technical), eachwith its own staff. The serious
governance problems that have marredproject implementationhave caused much
concern to the Bank over the years, and some task managers have been reluctant to
approve contracts that raise suspicions o f mismanagement and demand a great deal o f
paperwork for them. This reportedly was one reason why the Bank has delayed some
approvals. Poor governance may also be linkedto some difficulties staff report with bulk
procurement.

46.       Borrower performance i s rated unsatisfactory for the Second Educationproject,
highly satisfactory for the Sector Adjustment Project and for the Pre-Service Teacher
EducationProject, and satisfactory for the Higher Education Project and for the Equity
and Schools Improvement Project.

5.        Issues for FutureConsideration

A Need for Improved Textbook Strategy

47.       The government expects that 80 percent o fthe students will read fluentlyin
Frenchat the end o f grade 2 by 2007,34but this objective i s unattainableinthe near
future. To learn the expected information, students need to take books home to read, not
just to readteachers' notes or some books duringclass. To make effective use o f
educational investments, books mightbe substantially subsidized for the next 5-10 years.
According to the Education For All Project Appraisal Document (PAD) estimates, free
distribution o ftextbooks will amount to 2-3 percent o f the sector budget annually.
Through fast-tracking o f the Education for All effort, the country has the opportunity to
get textbooks financed as a recurrent expenditure.

48.       Textbook sustainability inschools a general probleminFrancophone Africa.
Because ofhighprices and scarcity, private book distributorscontracted to deliver
project-financed books invarious countries (e.g., Senegal) can earn more by selling the
books at a nearby market than by delivering them to the schools. Since inGuinea there
were no books available for private sale, those delivered inschools were a valuable
commodity. Makingtextbooks available inthe market at affordable prices and in
                 35
quantities that make their "street value" too low to be worth the effort o f stealing them i s
an obvious solution. This could be achieved invarious ways:36

     0    Thus far, projects haveprintedtextbooks inFrance because the localmarket did
          not have sufficient capacity. Some local capacity does exist, however, notably the
          Patricio Lumumba printingpress of the Ministry o f Information as well as a small
          press inMamou.

     0    Ifsome or allbookscontinue to beimported, thepublishersshouldhaveagentsin
          Guinea to make the textbooks available for sale at the local market.

     0    Primary-and secondary-school textbooks should also be producedby local
          private publishers, even ifonly insmall quantities. Guinean publishers mustbe
          encouraged to print them and receive the films that the government owns. Many
          countries involved intextbook production waive duties on paper andink.

      0   Textbooks deliveredto students byprevious Bank-supportedprojects may have
           beenworn out quickly. Newer editions should be designed to withstand humidity
           and years o fhandling.To minimize wear and tear, students shouldbe directed on
           how to cover them.

      0   National-language textbooks (ifdeveloped for grades 1-2 as planned) will
           probably have a lower `street' value outside the country and mayprove more
           durable.

      0   Central procurement has focused on choosing one series ofbooks and buyingin
           lots large enough to become targets ofpotential corruption. Instead, procurement
           methods could be put inplace to ensure books are available every year, usingthe
           private sector for distribution. Thus, central distribution o fbooks mightbest be
           abandoned. Positive experiences reportedby inspectors on rental fees suggest
           that schools can manage books. They could be allocatedbudgets for book
           purchase (even ifthey do not handle the actual cash). The parent-teacher
           associations could help schools with logistics, including safeguarding books
           duringvacations.

      0   There is aneedconsultationwith parents, schools, publishers, and small market
            vendors o ftextbooks. The financial issues and constraints need to be understood
            more clearly.

49.       The government plans inthe future to control the distribution o ftextbooks better,
deliver them directly to schools, demand multiplesignatures attesting delivery, and ask
parents' associations, teachers, and directors to assume greater responsibility for guarding
and maintainingthe textbooks. These measures are certainly needed. However, inthe
past, textbook procurement has been subject to long delays andconcerns regarding
mismanagement. Calls for bids inthe current project are already facing delays. Student
numbers increase fast, and the next grade 1intake will have about 150,000 students.The
next plannedprocurement o ftexts will already provide too few books. Thus, there will
probably be no sustainable textbooks inthe hands o f the students for the next 3-4 years.
This issue will continue affect student achievement.

50.       Textbooks by themselves are insufficient to alleviate the information constriction
o f the system. Teachers must betrained to abandon the copying and dictation mode. This
poses problems because teachers have been taught without textbooks and may not
necessarily find them indispensable. Furthermore, ifthey do not dictate or copy, they may
have to think o fmore analytical questions to pose, for which they may not be ready.
Copying activities persist even after training, as the experience o f Brazil

51.       Textbooks mustbe provided for the students o f teacher education institutions as
well as for the university.Because the quantities are smaller and the costs o f the
textbooks higher, the books could be rentedto students. Because higher education
studentsinFrancophone countries traditionally study without textbooks, this issue is not
seen as urgentbyuniversity or teacher training authorities. But the students o f these
levels are subject to the same information restrictions as lower-level students.University
classrooms function ineffect, as copying centers.

52.       The ongoing Educationfor All programmay need an educational coordinator who
will search for book-related solutions inthe entire sector. The coordinator shouldbe able
to order examination copies for the entire system and sendthe samples to the various
institutions rather than merely send book descriptions, as i s currently done.


Language of Instruction

53.       Because o f the exclusive use o f French inschools, most students are unable to
write a letter to relatives after schooling o f several years. They also lack the vocabulary to
engage inthe very desirable instructional methods that involve higher levels inthe
cognitive domain (analysis, synthesis, evaluation). Ironically, students may learn to read
and calculate within one or two years through African languages, which are spelled
phonetically (as they become fluent readers invoweled Arabic). Experiences in
neighboring countries (specifically BurkinaFaso and Mali) suggest that students taught

first inlocal languages are likely to learnbasic skills as well as French and to stay in
school.

54.      Guinea has had unsatisfactory experiences with local languages inthe past
because the languages were introduced inthe curriculum without planning or sensitivity
to various ethnic groups and languages to be chosen. The population seems largely
opposed to local-language instruction, partly because o f the political problems linked to it
inthe 1980s. Inprinciple, the government plans to reintroduceinformal instructionin
local languages. However, the bigbenefits are likely to come from learning to read
effortlessly inlocal languages. For this to happen, textbooks inthe main languages would
beneeded. The needfor such textbooks exacerbatesthe current textbook problems, given
the limitedcapacity to print themlocally. Nevertheless, it remains aproblem to resolve if
the average students are to acquire basic skills inschool.

Cost recovery and requirementsinVocational-TechnicalEducation

55.      Policy changes are neededinthe entrance requirementso f vocational institutions.
For better use o f the IDA investments, the Ministryo f Education could encourage
institutions to admit all studentswho are willing to study the trades they offer. As with
primary schools, this strategy may necessitate teaching inlocal languages.

56.      These institutions, which are relatively large andhave much space, could
potentially be usedfor three shifts ifthey have relevant courses to offer to different types
o f clients. However, cost recovery is needed to help institutions become better used.To
introduce courses o f greater demand, investments are neededon teachers and equipment.
These inturn could generate more income. Catering to those who can pay may allow
institutions to better tailor training to the less educated as well.


Lessons

57.      Experiencewith the projects confirms a number o f OED lessons from the
education sector:

    0    Policy dialogue and project activities must stay focused on improving
         instructional effectiveness and providing students with basic skills. Activities
         aimed at strengthening management and procuring educational commodities may
        be necessary but they are not sufficient for the improvement o f learning and
         quality ineducational systems. Providing mass education under clearly inadequate
        instructional conditions may graduate functional illiterates andbenefit only a
        minority o f students.

    0   Textbooks are the crucial providers o f information inschools. Ifthey are
        unavailable or ifstudents cannot study fi-om them sufficiently, the rest o f the
        educational investments lose their effectiveness. Procurement methods and plans
        must aim at making large numberso f textbooks available at an affordable cost
        and free to the poor. Textbook management must take into account the strengths
        o fthe private sector and the community associations.

  Sustained investment inhuman resources can improve implementationcapacity o f
  specific institutions. For example, foreign fellowships for persons who returnand
  devote their career to the agencies they were expected to serve may result ina
  considerable o f trained and competent staff.

0 Inearlier decades, the Bank supported vocational training schools inmany
  countries, which often function with few students, highunit costs, and outdated
  equipment and curricula. Bank investments will bebest usedifpolicy dialogue is
