Uttar Pradesh Basic Education\n            Project (UP BEP II) responds to the government's\n            request to reallocate presently unallocated resources in the\n            Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Project, approved in FY1993\n            and ending in the year 2000, in order to deal with the surge\n            in primary school enrollments that has resulted in large\n            classes and an acute shortage of classrooms. UP BEPII helps\n            the government to a) establish the capacity to enroll all\n            6-10 year old children; b) establishes the capacity to\n            enroll 75 percent of 11-13 year old children; and c)\n            improves student learning achievement and completion rates.\n            The project has two major components: 1) expanding access by\n            opening about 600 primary and 300 upper primary schools, and\n            constructing about 11,000 additional classrooms in the\n            existing institutions; and 2) improving quality and\n            retention, through appointing about 13,000 additional\n            teachers; providing learning materials, including\n            development of new materials for new schools; in-service\n            training to new teachers; and establishing a school\n            improvement fund."}, "docdt": "1997-10-27T00:00:00Z"}
