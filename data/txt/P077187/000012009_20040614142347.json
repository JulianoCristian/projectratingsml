To support the development of IABIN, this\n            Global Environment Facility (GEF) project seeks to develop\n            an Internet-based, decentralized network that provides wider\n            access to scientifically credible, biodiversity information\n            currently existing in individual institutions, and agencies\n            in the Americas, provide tools to draw knowledge from that\n            wealth of resources, and in turn support sound\n            decision-making concerning the conservation, and sustainable\n            use of biodiversity. The project components will: 1) create\n            the information infrastructure necessary to search, and\n            access biodiversity data and information. To this end, IABIN\n            will seek to develop a regional consensus on standards, and,\n            promote interagency operations with other regional and\n            global efforts, especially the Global Biodiversity\n            Information Facility (GBIF). Under this component, the\n            project will seek agreement on the use of standards and\n            protocols to ensure compatibility of diverse data sources\n            within the region. Areas requiring consensus on standards\n            include: communications, taxonomic information, metadata,\n            controlled vocabularies, other authorities, and record\n            structures; 2) develop a formal Content Development Program,\n            so as to support multilingual training, and provide\n            technical leadership to IABIN countries, as they develop\n            critical data and metadata; 3) improve connectivity between\n            biological, and non-biological data, useful to\n            decision-makers in the public and private sectors. The\n            integration of natural, and social science data and\n            information is increasingly recognized as vital to\n            scientific research and societal decision making; 4) provide\n            financial sustainability, but first, sources of recurring\n            funding for the operation of the Secretariat and other\n            periodic activities must be identified. Second,\n            participating agencies and institutions must be assured of\n            continued internal funding for IABIN-related activities that\n            are their in-kind contributions to the development of the\n            project. GEF funds will facilitate the fund-seeking process\n            by identifying potential funding sources, and partners to\n            leverage available resources; and, 5) cover the\n            administrative costs of the Executing Agency, i.e.,\n            contracting, procurement, disbursements, audits, and,\n            monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
