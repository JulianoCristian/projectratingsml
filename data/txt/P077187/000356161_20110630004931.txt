7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN) was officially mandated at the Summit of
the Americas on Sustainable Development, convened in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, in December
1996. To support the development of IABIN, this GEF project seeks to: (i) consolidate the development of
this Internet-based, decentralized network to provide wider access to scientifically credible biodiversity
information currently existing in individual institutions and agencies in the Americas, (ii) provide the tools
necessary to draw knowledge from that wealth of resources, which in turn will support sound decision-
making concerning the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.
