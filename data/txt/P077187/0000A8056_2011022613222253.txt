                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN) was officially mandated at the Summit of the Americas on Sustainable Development, convened in
                         Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, in December 1996. To support the development of IABIN, this GEF project seeks to: (i) consolidate the development of this
                         Internet-based, decentralized network to provide wider access to scientifically credible biodiversity information currently existing in individual institutions and
                         agencies in the Americas, (ii) provide the tools necessary to draw knowledge from that wealth of resources, which in turn will support sound decision-making
                         concerning the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project entered its final semester of implementation. The regional standards and the internet architectures have been established under the five Thematic Networks (TNs) and

                         continue to develop to enable access to biodiversity information spread out in the Americas. However, the IABIN Portal which is the "gateway" to all the information and tools made
                         available through the Network has not been improved to address the recommendations agreed during the mid-term review nor maintained since mid last year. Digitization of
                         biodiversity data to be shared through the IABIN architecture have made progress (54 grants have been completed), but there are still 72 grants to be completed in the short period
                         remained.
                         The project has made progress in developing value-added information tools to support decision-making using the data provided through IABIN by providing six grants. Four of these
                         grants have been completed and two more grants to be completed by the end of project. There is a concern that there will not be enough time to evaluate the effectiveness of these
                         tools, therefore, the contribution of data sharing to supporting sound decision-making concerning the conservation and sustainable development.
                         The final meeting of the IABIN Executive Committee (IEC) is planned in Costa Rica on February 16-18 and will examine the progress, challenges, lessons learned and current status
                         of the network after six years of project implementation. The meeting will be participated by the IEC members, the OAS (Recipient), the IABIN Coordinator, and the representatives of
                         the Coordinating Institution (CI) of five Thematic Networks, and the Bank as observer.
