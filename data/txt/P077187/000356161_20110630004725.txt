Summary
1. This document proposes changes in the expenditure allocations and extension of the
   closing date to September 30, 2011 for the Latin America, Building the INTER-
   AMERICAN BIODIVERSITY INFORMATION NETWORK (IABIN), Grant No.
   TF03526/ P077187 project. These changes have been requested by the executing
   agency OAS in a letter dated June 3rd, 2011.
2. The “Building IABIN Project” (TF053526) GEF Grant Agreement became effective
   on October 4, 2004 with an original closing date of June 30, 2010 and a one year
   extension awarded on March 5th, 2010. The Project supports the Inter-American
   Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN) to: (i) develop an Internet-based,
   decentralized network to provide access to biodiversity information currently
   scattered in individual institutions and agencies in the Americas; and (ii) provide the
   tools necessary to draw knowledge from that wealth of resources, which in turn will
   support sound decision-making concerning the conservation and sustainable use of
   biodiversity. This Project has supported implementation of Article 17 of the
   Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) by promoting technical and scientific
   cooperation, and thus contributes directly to implementation of the CBD Clearing-
   House Mechanism (CHM) as well as other areas critical to development and poverty
   alleviation.
3. Further the Project is helping IABIN to sustain itself by building an important
   hemispheric information network and forging partnerships between Government
   agencies, NGOs, academic institutions, and museums that house biological and
   geospatial information. The implementation of the value added tools for decision
   making under Component 3 is almost complete, with four projects finalized and two
   more in their final stage.



Background
4. In the first year of project implementation, slow disbursement and availability of
   counterpart funding caused significant delays in the completion of planned activities.
   A change in procurement methodologies from contracts-based management of project
   funds to grants-based management of funds also resulted in significant delays for the
   project, preventing the disbursement of Component 1 funds to Coordinating
   Institutions (CI) for several months in early 2006. As a result, a one year extension
   was approved.

                                            4
Project Status
5. The Project Development Objectives have practically been achieved. The IABIN
   Project is building an ambitious and essential hemispheric information network and
   has made tangible progress in all planned components. The IABIN Council has
   undertaken a strong ownership role in assisting with implementation of the project,
   and the Coordinating Institutions (CIs) of IABIN’s Thematic Networks (TNs) have
   developed or adapted a range of important standards and data digitizing tools that, as
   a result of the project, are gaining wide acceptance in the region. Consolidation of the
   development of IABIN is almost completed, thus providing wider access to quality
   biodiversity information currently scattered around the Americas. The tools necessary
   to draw knowledge from that wealth of resources has been developed and
   consolidated. In the last year, the progress and results from the technical components
   have been very positive; all TNs have completed standards development and
   implemented their data digitizing tools, and made great advances in data discovery
   and compilation and cross-walking databases.
6. The project has been making progress toward achieving the Global Environment
   Objectives. Under Component 1, significant progress has been made in establishing
   regional standards and the internet architectures under the five selected Thematic
   Networks (TNs) which has enabled access to biodiversity information spread out in
   the Americas. Metadata are georeferenced and searchable by location. IABIN Data
   Integration and Analysis Gateway (DIAG) has been developed to integrate, overlay,
   and visualize data shared through IABIN. Under Component 2, all training has been
   completed and more than 120 small grants have been awarded to digitize biodiversity
   data to be shared through IABIN architectures. Under Component 3, six value-added
   information tools have been developed to support decision-making using the data
   provided through IABIN. Under Component 4, the IABIN sustainability strategy has
   been developed, which has been put into action by the new Secretariat members led
   by the OAS.
7. In spite of its decentralized nature, the different partnerships under IABIN have
   solidified and IABIN as a network is gaining momentum. The work developed
   independently by each of the 5 Thematic Networks Coordinating Institutions (CI) is
   ready to the point where it can finally be integrated in a geospatial platform. In terms
   of data content creation, over 126 $10,000 sub-grants have been awarded to
   museums, academic institutions, NGOs and herbariums in the Americas. 62 of these
   subprojects have been completed and the quality controlled data is available online
   through each TN, while 67 sub-projects are being completed. The extension requested
   would allow the project not only to finalize the pending sub-projects increasing the
   amount of data available through IABIN, but also to implement the necessary quality
   control measures, index data, assure compatibility between different databases and
   greatly increase the amount of “user-friendly” data available through the DIAG. The
   tools that have been developed thus far can be perused in the DIAG Beta site
   (www.databasin.org/iabin). The extension will also allow for dissemination events
   showcasing the results of the Project in a number of different venues.

8. The project has disbursed US$5,549,369, corresponding to 92.5% of the
   US$6,000,000 grant.



Proposed Changes
                                        Extension of closing date
9. The proposed extension is necessary to allow 67 sub-projects under Component 2 to
   be completed, by ensuring the quality control of data, indexing data, assuring
   compatibility between different databases and to greatly increase the amount of “user-
   friendly” data available through the DIAG. The Borrower has in place an action plan
   to complete the project. The proposed extension of closing date is for three months
   until September 30, 2011. The Recipient had originally requested an extension of six
   months. However, it was determined that three months would be the maximum
   possible.
10. This will be the second extension of the project. The first extension was for one year
    through June 30, 2011. The reason for the initial delay in Component 1 was due to the
    complexity of institutional and procurement arrangements involving 34 countries, 4
    co-executing agencies, and over 100 sub-grantees, which was required before its
    implementation. Because Component 2 and Component 3 had to build upon the
    results of Component 1, the implementation of the subsequent components required
    an additional time to complete.
                                              Reallocation
11. The proposed restructuring will require reallocations of the proceeds of the Grant
    across categories of expenditures as presented in detail in the table below:
                                                         Amount of the      Amount of

                                          Fund Grant     reallocated in        Grant       Expenditures

Justification to extend the closing date
13. To date, IABIN has focused on the development of protocols, tools and standardized
    information and has vastly improved the knowledge of data completeness, quality and
    accessibility across the LAC region through the creation of 5 regional Thematic
    Networks. Through this work, it has supported the significant advancement of
    consortia around TNs, and the integration of regional information that conforms to
    documented standards. Although, IABIN has made great efforts to fill data gaps,
    implement a minimum set of quality standards, and serve the data to the network and
    a broader stakeholder audience, full integration is still under development.
14. Within this framework, the project awarded a grant to the Conservation Biology
    Institute (CBI) to develop a prototype application, the IABIN Data Integration and
    Analysis Gateway (IABIN DIAG), with the purpose of improving the accessibility of
    TN information for important conservation, development, planning and scientific
    applications.
15. The IABIN DIAG allows users to aggregate TN datasets, integrate TN data with other
    available information, and conduct structured data queries. Through it, IABIN can
                                                 7
   demonstrate how these important datasets can be integrated for application to current
   conservation and development challenges by key stakeholders and decision-makers.
   The ability to provide this efficient and effective access to this information will
   ultimately result in the continuing flow of support for the ongoing development and
   maintenance of the data and its supporting network.
16. Given that the sub-grant awarded to CBI to develop the IABIN DIAG was awarded in
    the last Request for Proposals for Value Added Tools, the timeframe to allow full
    integration between the IABIN TNs and the DIAG has been tight. Although, the
    products to be delivered under the Agreement with CBI will be accomplished,
    additional time would allow the project to maximize the level of integration to be
    achieved and improve the accessibility of TN information. This timing issue could
    not have been foreseen and the project has done its best effort to integrate in the
    remaining time. If extra time were provided, the integration capabilities could be
    significantly improved.
17. In terms of data content creation, over 126 $10,000 sub-grants have been awarded to
    museums, academic institutions, NGOs and herbariums in the Americas. 62 of these
    subprojects have been completed and the quality controlled data is available online
    through each TN, while 67 sub-projects are still under execution. The requested
    extension would allow the project not only to finalize the pending sub-projects
    increasing the amount of data available through IABIN, but also to implement the
    necessary quality control measures, index data, assure compatibility between different
    databases and deliver “user-friendly” data.



Recommendation
18. Upon review of the proposed changes we feel confident that with the requested
    extension the project will fully disburse and that the Action Plan laid forward will be
    followed through. The team therefore recommends that the extension be granted in
    order for this difficult and complex project to be able to fully accomplish its objective
    as mandated by the Heads of State at the Summit of the Americas on Sustainable
    Development, held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, in December 1996.
