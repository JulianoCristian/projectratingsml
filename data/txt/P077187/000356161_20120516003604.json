     moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: The flexibility of the Project\n            design was especially critical-for it allowed IABIN to adapt\n            to the rapidly changing information technology over the last\n            decade. The governance of regional projects has inherent\n            challenges. Therefore, institutional roles and\n            responsibilities of such Project which involves multiple\n            institutions in multiple countries should be clearly laid\n            out and understood by all the key players prior to project\n            effectiveness. Country ownership is critical to success.\n            Building the IABIN was an ambitious undertaking, relying on\n            the commitment of 34 governments and the involvement of\n            numerous institutions across the region. Emphasis on\n            capacity building helps sustainability. Clarification of\n            appropriate implementation arrangements for activities can\n            help identify possible incompatibilities in fiduciary\n            processes among agencies.
