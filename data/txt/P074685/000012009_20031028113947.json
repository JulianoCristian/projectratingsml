Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), this First Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Project will support\n            economic growth generation, service delivery improvements,\n            social inclusion promotion, and governance improvements. The\n            PRSC program supports selective key reforms that will\n            directly contribute to pro-poor growth by a) creating fiscal\n            space for, and improving the effectiveness of growth\n            enhancing public investments, and, b) improving the\n            investment climate. The PRSC program also supports\n            Nepal's track record of meaningful reforms in improving\n            service delivery by assisting the government in developing\n            annual benchmarks, consistent with the broad reform\n            objectives, and, by providing the fiscal and technical\n            resources necessary to accelerate the reform momentum. The\n            PRSC process supports the promotion of social inclusion, by\n            improving the effectiveness of targeted programs; improving\n            access to schooling for excluded groups, and, by encouraging\n            civil service diversity. It also supports the\n            government's strategy to improve governance by\n            improving the effectiveness of the civil service,\n            strengthening anti-corruption and accountability\n            institutions, improving the functioning of key agencies,\n            and, improving financial management and procurement\n            practices. The improvements in governance that are supported\n            by the PRSC are designed to bring more accountable,\n            efficient, and a less corrupt government, that will create a\n            more favorable investment climate, and lead to better\n            service delivery. Nonetheless, risks include the potential\n            return to a prolonged period of conflict, that would dampen\n            growth prospects, and the impact of structural reforms on\n            poverty, while the efforts of reform-minded technocrats, may\n            be crowded  by political interference, thus threaten the\n            sustainability of reforms, and in addition, a further\n            worsening of global economic conditions may undermine the\n            impact of growth-enhancing reforms. However, many of the\n            reforms outlined have a wide degree of support across the\n            political spectrum, and from civil society, as they have\n            been based on consensus-building exercises and stakeholder\n            consultations, and, the Bank will provide a loan\n            acceleration clause that would allow the Bank to demand\n            immediate repayment of the proposed loan by the Borrower, in\n            case reforms are reversed, or materially changed."}, "docdt": "2003-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
