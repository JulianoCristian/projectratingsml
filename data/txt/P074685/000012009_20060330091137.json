outcome,\n            sustainability is unlikely, while institutional development\n            impacts were only modest. These ratings are reflected\n            through the lessons learned, as follows. Nepal's image\n            has suffered tremendously due to the political instability,\n            and ensuing polarization between the key political actors.\n            This image has clearly worsened the investment climate,\n            particularly foreign investment, and has dampened growth\n            prospects. An alleged escalation of human rights abuses, by\n            both sides of the military conflict is also a prime concern\n            for development partners, who feel strongly that the current\n            political/military situation in Nepal is not conducive to\n            Bank support. Notwithstanding, the dialogue between the Bank\n            and the borrower needs to be maintained at all levels during\n            this uncertain period. The Bank can play a constructive role\n            by continuing to support the reform-minded technocrats who\n            spearheaded the Poverty Reduction strategy Paper (PRSP). The\n            costs of not remaining engaged would likely be serious as it\n            would leave reformers isolated, while the momentum for\n            certain reforms would be lost. The distinction between\n            technocrat and politician-driven reforms is important. There\n            remain many important reforms that are relatively\n            non-controversial (e.g. reducing transit costs and improving\n            connectivity) and can be spearheaded by committed\n            technocrats. At the same time, there are other reforms that\n            can have a clear short run political cost such as adjusting\n            petroleum prices. Related to this is the fact that if\n            technocrat-driven reforms are to be sustained, there has to\n            be a concerted effort to limit transfers in key\n            secretary-level positions. Further addressed are lessons on\n            the trade-off between the predictability of budget support\n            and the strength of the annual reform program; on the\n            ability to communicate the rationale behind reforms; that\n            reforms in the judiciary system clearly lag behind reforms\n            on other fronts; and, that major policy shifts in service\n            delivery require a detailed implementation plan."}, "docdt": "2006-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
