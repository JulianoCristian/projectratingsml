         of Eastern Caribbean States--Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts\n            and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n            The development objectives of these five Bank operations\n            are: 1) to help safeguard and maintain the productive\n            capacity of the countries' tourism sectors, notably by\n            securing the industry's emergency needs in the\n            aftermath of the September 11 events; 2) to enhance security\n            at key airport and seaport facilities in line with\n            international standards, with the aim of preventing further\n            acts of terrorism and safeguarding the sub-region's\n            image as a safe tourist destination; and 3) to strengthen\n            the countries' institutional capacity to develop and\n            implement security plans, procedures, and measures as\n            mandated by the international civil aviation and marine\n            transport regulatory agencies. There are two main project\n            components. The first finances one critical import, low\n            sulfur diesel fuel for electricity generation, which is\n            critical to the maintenance of economic activity in the\n            tourism industry by ensuring that the energy-intensive\n            tourism facilities are kept operational during the recovery\n            period. The second component finances the physical and\n            technical resources needed for national port and aviation\n            authorities, as well as individual airports and seaports, to\n            upgrade security arrangements at key facilities and meet\n            international regulations."}, "docdt": "2002-02-19T00:00:00Z"}
