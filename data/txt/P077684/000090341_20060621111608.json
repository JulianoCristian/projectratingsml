Lessons\n            learned from the project: The Bank is well positioned to\n            respond to similar emergency events in the future. The Bank\n            can play an active role to assist countries in meeting\n            established and evolving regulatory standards. There can be\n            significant advantages to implementing multi-country\n            programs through a regional entity. Regional procurement can\n            bring important cost-benefits.
