MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) for the equivalent of US$250 million is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan, which would be guaranteed by
the Government of Mexico, would have a term of 17 years, including five
years of grace, with interest at the standard variable rate. NAFIN would
be the borrower and coordinating executing agency. The Government would
bear the foreign exchange risk on peso subloans against a risk premium and
the cross currency risk on US dollar denominated subloans. The loan would
help finance an industrial restructuring project.
2.       Background.  For three decades, Mexico attempted to foster
industrial development by providing high levels of protection and other
incentives to import substitution industries. In the textile subsector, a
combination of tariff and non-tariff barriers resulted in high levels of
protection for most domestically produced outputs. A 1O tariff was levied
on raw wool imports, while all imports of wool tops were barred by
quantitative restrictions (QRs). In synthetic fibers, a combination of
high official reference prices (ORPs), used to calculate tariffs, and a 37?
tariff, discouraged imports. Cotton imports were also prevented by
sanitary barriers, which effectively acted as QRs, and, whenever imports
were allowed to cover local shortages, they were under a state monopoly.
Fi'nished textile production was also protected by QRs. As a result,
effective protection rates ranged from 25Z-352 for most textile products up
to 97? for wool tops. Autoparts producers were also being protected
through a combination of explicit trade restrictions and domestic
regulations. About 402 of domestically produced autoparts were protected
by non-tariff barriers, such as QRs (26.3Z) and ORPs (13.42). The average
tariff for the autoparts sub3ector was 302, and engines, frames,
carburetors, and radiators were especially heavily protected. Domestically
produced autoparts had to (i) account for at least 60? of the sales value
of cars produced for the domestic market, and (ii) have a domestic content
of at least 60Z of their own sales value. In addition, 30 specified
products could only be purchased from Mexican producers.
3.       To reduce the anti-export bias inherent in industrial and trade
policies and to improve industrial efficiency and thereby help expand non-
traditional exports, the Government, with Bank support through a series of
trade policy, export development, and sector loans, introduced far-reaching
measures aiming at liberalizing trade, eliminating subsidies, and
restructuring inefficient enterprises. At the Bank's suggestion during
preparation of the proposed project in 1987-88, the Government developed a
strategy for deregulation of subsectors, which could be carried out in
parallel with liberalization measures, especially in selected subsectors
that (i) were high priority because of their export potential, and (ii)
were being most affected by trade liberalization. To define the required
policy adjustments and determine subsector-specific industrial
restructuring needs, the Government (i) studied, with the support of
external consultants, the impact of trade liberalization, industrial policy
changes and restructuring actions, and the financial and technical
assistance needs of three major subsectors with immediate export potential



-2-
(textiles, autoparts, and agro-industry) which account for about 25Z of
industrial value added and about 302 of non-oil exports; and (ii)
formulated sub-sectoral restructuring programs and longer term strateg,es
for textiles, autoparts and cut flowers. Programs for additional
subsectors (shoes and furniture) have been developed, or are either being
or will soon be developed (additional agro-industrial products and selected
capital goods).
4.       Concurrently, the Government took a series of important upfront
actions for trade liberalization and deregulation measures. In textiles,
the Government removed QRs and ORPs for all products except for some
apparels. In automobiles and autoparts, the Government (i) removed QRs and
ORPs for all parts products, (ii) eliminated the mandatory parts list for
automobile producers, (iii) lifted QRs on some vehicles, (iv) reduced the
domestic content requirement for domestic autoparts, and (v) relaxed
restrictions on the number of lines and models that automobile producers
can bring to the domestic market.
5.       The industrial restructuring programs proposed in para. 8 would
complement the reforms discussed above. In textiles, remaining steps
include less restrictive application of sanitary regulations for cotton
imports, the elimination of the monopoly of a state-owned cotton import
company and its privatization, and changes in the assignment system of
export quotas to emphasize high-value added products. For autoparts, the
Government intends to grant high technology status to specific foreign
investments in the autoparts industry, which means they would not be
restricted to the 402 limitation which normally applies to such
investments. The restructuring programs also include industry-level
investments and technical assistance for a broad variety of purposes.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's country assistance
strategy hinges crucially on successful liberalization and deregulation of
the Mexican economy and an adequate supply response and adjustments by
industry and agriculture. The Bank's involvement in the Government's
industrial restructuring program would reinforce and complement the trade
liberalization and export development efforts, which have been supported
by the Bank through two trade policy and two export development loans.
Bank's involvement in the industrial restructuring program will initiate
development of subsector restructuring policies and instruments, leading to
broad sector-wide industrial deregulation and policy changes to be
undertaken under a proposed Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan which is
currently being negotiated.
7.       Project Objectives.  The project would help the Mexican economy
improve the efficiency of important industrial subsectors and increase non-
oil exports. The project would focus on supporting private sector
restructuring policies and programs in industry, providing financial and
technical assistance to companies that are affected by trade liberalization
but have the potential to compete and export effectively within a more
competitive domestic and international economic environment.
8.       Project Description.  The project would help the Government
implement restructuring programs in important industrial subsectors; it
would establish an industry-wide institutional framework within which
viable, company-specific restructuring plans could be developed and
financed. The project would consist of the following components:



-3-
- A subsector specific loan component (60? of the loan amount)
would provide financing for subsectors/products for which
restructuring strategies have been defined (textiles, autoparts
and cut flowers) or are to be defined during project
implementation (e.g., shoes, furniture, additional agro-
industrial products). Additional subsectors would become
eligible for financing under this component once restructuring
strategies acceptable to the Bank have been developed.
Reallocation of the 60? reserved for investments in these
subsectors could take place after the mid-term review of the
project scheduled for mid-1990, taking into consideration
progress in developing and implementing agreed upon subsector
strategies and developing new ones.
- A non-subsector specific component (342) would provide
investment and working capital financing for economically and
financially sound subprojects in other subsectors affected by
the trade policy reforms of the Government.
- A component to support irdustry level investments (4Z) would
finance an action program to improve quality and design
standards, and information dissemination for the textile
industry, communication infrastructure and warehouses,
commercial promotion programs, and management and worker
training for the autoparts industry; and a training program for
the cut flowers bubsector.
- A technical assistance component (2X) would finance: (i)
additional subsectoral restructuring studies, as necessary;
(ii) consultant assistance in project implementation; (iii)
computer equipment and software for SECOFI and executing
agencies; (iv) training activities, including consultant
assistance, by the executing agencies for their own and
commercial bank staff; (v) and a promotion program by the
executing agencies for the subsector restructuring programs.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$500 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$250 million (50S). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of US$25 million will be granted
for expenditures incurred after January 1, 1988, the date of project
appraisal. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7293-ME dated March 15,
1989, is also attached.
9.       Implementation Arrangements.  NAPIN, BANCOMEXT and Banco de Mexico
as trustee for FONEI, would be executing agencies. WAIN, the borrower,
would also be coordinating agency for all project components. Project
implementation would be supervised by a coordinating policy committee
(expanding the one formed under the Capital Goods Project, Loan No.
2142-ME), composed of senior officials/representatives of SHCP, SECOFI, the
executing agencies, and the banking association. Eligible financial
intermediaries would include commercial banks, securities firms (casas de
bolsa) and investment/venture capital funds.



-4-
10.      Actions Agreed.  During iiegotiations, agreement was reached on
long term strategy statements for the textiles and the automobile and
autoparts industries. Agreement was also reached on the following on-
lending terms and conditions. Subloans would be denominated in Mexican
pesos or US dollars at the option of the subborrower. The General Interest
Rate Agreement (GIRA), as amended, would ensure that the interest rates for
final borrowers would be at least ACF (the average cost of funds of the
banking system which contains an implicit foreign exchange r'sk premium)
plus 5Z p.a. for peso subloans. However, for pollution control subloans,
the rate would be the interest rate specified by GIRA for such investments
(currently 942 of ACF). For dollar subloans, the rate would be at least
LIBOR plus 2? p.a. The Government would bear the foreign exchange and
cross currency risks, respectively. The lending rates for the final
borrowers would be reviewed periodically to ensure that they reflect the
cost of funds and include adequate provisions against exchange risk between
dollars and pesos. The loan ceiling for any single enterprise would be
US$15 million. Subprojects under a free limit of US$7 million would not
require prior Bank approval, except for the first three subloans made under
each of the following categoriest investments with borrowed funds; equity
investments and quasi-equity investments. As a condition of loan
effectiveness, the Bank would receive a satisfactory program to promote
industrial restructuring and support regional implementation of the
project.
11.      Benefits and Risks.  The project would help the industrial sector
to improve efficiency and increase international competitiveness. Thus,
the project would also support Government efforts to revive industrial
growth and increase manufactured exports. Possible risks arise froms (i)
international economic uncertainties which could make Mexico's export
efforts more difficult and have a dampening effect on the domestic
investment climate; (ii) possible difficulties in completing the ongoing
domestic price stabilization program; (iii) possible back-tracking on trade
policy and regulatory reforms which would slow down the industrial
restructuring process; and (iv) inter-agency coordination problems which
could delay the implementation of the project. To address these risks, the
loan has been designed to form part of the trade pnlicy reform program that
the Bank and the Government have agreed to, the proposed loan amount has
been based on a conservative demand estimate for financial resources, and
care has been taken to involve participating Government agencies and the
private sector in the design of the subsector studies and project
preparation.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
