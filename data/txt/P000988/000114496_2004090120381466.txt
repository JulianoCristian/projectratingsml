      Re: GUINEA-BISSAU: Basic Education Development Project -
          Credit 1914-GUB
          Amendment to Development Credit Agreement
     Reference is made to the Development Credit Agreement dated

(the Borrower) and the International Development Association (the
Association).
     Reference is also made to a letter dated March 11, 1993
pursuant to which a request was made by the Borrower to amend the
table set forth in Schedule 1 to the Agreement by amending the
percentage of expenditures to be financed under Category (1) and by
reallocating the credit proceeds between the existing categories.
     The Association hereby agrees with your requests relating to
the percentage of expenditures to be financed under Category (1) and
the reallocation of proceeds and proposes the following amendments
to the Agreement.

"270,000", "80,000", "50,000", "67,322", and "132,678".

Development Credit Agreement is therefore amended to read, in its
entirety, as set forth In the Annex to this letter.

2.1   Part A.3
      Part A.3 is amended to read as follows:

      "2.   Civil Works estimated to cost less than the equivalent
of $50,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the
equivalent of $700,000, may be procured under contracts awarded on
the basis of comparison of price quotations solicited from a list of
at least three contractors eligible under the Guidelines, in
