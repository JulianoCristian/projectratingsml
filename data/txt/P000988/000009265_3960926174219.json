To support the\n            Government's major policy objectives for educational\n            development, the project will upgrade the quality and\n            increase access to education. This will be accomplished in\n            two ways. Firstly, the project will improve the content and\n            relevance of the primary education curriculum and teaching\n            materials and improve pre-service and in-service primary\n            teacher training programs. To the same end, the project will\n            strengthen the teacher inspectorate services, train 3,000\n            primary teachers, and rehabilitate dilapidated primary\n            schools. Secondly, the project will develop the\n            institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Culture\n            and Sports (MECD) by establishing an efficient\n            organizational structure for MECD and providing basic office\n            equipment, materials and improved physical facilities.\n            Finally, the project will introduce budgetary and efficiency\n            measures to reduce costs and link expenditures to\n            educational development priorities."}, "docdt": "1988-05-18T00:00:00Z"}
