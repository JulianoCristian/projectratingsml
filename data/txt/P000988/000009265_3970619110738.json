PDEB had two major objectives: the\n            first was to improve the quality, efficiency, and access of\n            basic education through: (i) teacher training; (ii)\n            inspector training; (iii) improvement of the curriculum and\n            teaching materials; and (iv) rehabilitation and construction\n            of primary schools. The second was to strengthen education\n            management and planning through: (i) reform of the Ministry\n            of Education's (MECD, later MEN) organizational\n            structure, and (ii) establishment of a project coordination\n            unit (PCU). Overall Bank performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Overall, borrower performance was unsatisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were: (a) International Development\n            Association (IDA) overestimated the capacity of the\n            implementing agencies and expected results far too quickly;\n            (b) complex project management arrangements that are put in\n            place and that require a high degree of internal\n            coordination within a ministry, which itself is undergoing\n            institutional restructuring, do not work well; (c) pilot\n            experiments can help reduce the risk of failure in the\n            undertaking of an ambitious educational reform program and\n            can help in designing appropriate solutions to achieve the\n            objectives of the program; (d) pre-appraisal and appraisal\n            missions need to identify and assess more carefully the\n            Borrower's implementation capacity and help design a\n            realistic project that can be implemented; and (e ) borrower\n            commitment is essential to successful project\n            implementation. Borrower commitment in evidence during\n            identification and preparation must continue throughout implementation."}, "docdt": "1996-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
