Within\n            these broad orientations, the PRSP has four pillars: (i)\n            wealth creation through economic reform and private sector\n            development; (ii) capacity building and development of basic\n            social services; (iii) improving living condition of\n            vulnerable groups; and (iv) implementation of the strategy\n            and monitoring of its outcomes. As noted in the joint staff\n            IMF/World Bank assessment (December 2002), the PRSP suffered\n            from some shortcomings, which the authorities intended to\n            address during the first years of strategy implementation.\n            Among them, it was found that the Government's plans to\n            implement the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) were not\n            spelled out in sufficient details, notably with regard to a\n            fiscal decentralization strategy that would assure better\n            public services. The poverty diagnostic did not benefit from\n            a complete analysis of the new household survey data, and\n            the impact of the specific measures on the well-being of the\n            poor was not analyzed in detail."}, "docdt": "2004-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
