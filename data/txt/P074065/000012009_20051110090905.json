Findings and implications for subsequent\n            operations suggest that, overall, the satisfactory progress\n            made since the approval of the project has warranted the\n            move to the subsequent second operation. Although the\n            project was prepared in line with the 2005 budget, it was\n            not included in the Finance Law, because of the\n            uncertainties created by the lack of commitment to reforms\n            in the groundnut sector. The Senegalese authorities have\n            committed to include the second project in the series, in\n            the preparation of the 2006 budget. More attention however,\n            should be paid to vulnerable groups in the subsequent\n            operations, as was emphasized in the first Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper (PRSP) progress report and Joint Staff\n            Assessment Note."}, "docdt": "2005-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
