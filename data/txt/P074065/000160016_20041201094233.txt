             FIRST POVERTYREDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT

                        CreditandProgramSummary

Borrower:        The Republic o f Senegal

Amount:          US$30million

Terms:           StandardIDA terms: 40-year maturity with a 10-year graceperiod

Description:     The Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC I) support the
                                                                         will
                 implementation of Senegal's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). This
                 one-tranche operation would be the first o f a planned series of three
                 PRSCs (US$30 million each). The financial support providedthrough the
                 PRSC will narrow the gap between the cost of implementing key
                 elements of the PRS and resources available from Govemnient's own
                 domestic revenues and other donor support. A policy dialogue and
                 performance assessment framework under PRSC Iwill focus on the
                 following crosscutting and institutional actions, which will facilitate
                 progress towards the PRS objectives.

                 1.        Fiduciary reforms, by strengthening budgetary and financial
                 procedures (including those linkedto remuneration of the public sector),
                 andprocurement;
                 ii. Decentralizationprocess,bysecuringfinancialtransferstolocal
                  governments as well as disseminating and implementing the PRS agenda
                  at the local level; and
                  iii. Healthservices,withafocusonimprovingfinancialandhuman
                 resources management inthe sector as well as accelerating the access to
                 basic health services that have been identified as the most important
                  factors for determining the performance of this sector.
                  The wealth creation pillar of the PRSP will receive marginal attention
                  under PRSC Ibecause it already benefits from the full support of the
                  Bank and other donors. Support to vulnerable groups (thirdpillar of the
                  PRSP) will be sequential and selective over time.

Benefits:         By focusing on economy wide policy and institutional issues, the
                  proposed PRSC i s expected to help Senegal to implement its PRS in
                  three ways:     First, the reforms supported by the operation will help
                  maintain economic growth and improve living conditions for Senegalese.
                  Second, the program associatedwith the Credit will enhance ownership
                  and functionality for the Government in policy planning and budget
                  management and, so, help it make progress towards achieving the
                  MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Third, the reforms associated with the
                  Credit would promote coordination and collaboration within the
                  Government and among donors, and lead toward a comprehensive
                  approachto the delivery o fbasic social services.

Risks:          There are several risks associated with PRSC I:(i) of the reforms
                                                                       some
                 supported by the Credit might encounter resistance from vested interests,
                but Government has in the past shown determination to overcome such
                 special interests; (ii)Government efforts to build broad consensus for
                reforms through consultative processes which may sometimes slow down
                 the pace of reforms, however, the benefits o f this approach clearly
                 outweigh the risk; (iii)
                                       the utilization o f PRSC h d s is determined by the
                 budget process and there is a risk that resource allocation i s not hlly
                 consistent with the PRS; however, Government has adopted an open and
                 participative budget process including an annual PER which helps to
                 align and monitor resource allocation and its consistency with the PRS;
                 (iv) the CFAA andthe CPAR identified significant fiduciary risk, which
                 the proposedreform agenda is meant to address; (v) capacity for program
                 implementation and service delivery at both the central and district level
                 i s weak, however, in key areas programs are in place to strengthen
                 capacity; (vi) Senegal i s in its preparatory phase o f designing strategies
                 in the labor andjustice areas as well as in the protection of vulnerable
                 groups; however, the sequencing approach proposed in the PRSC
                 program should help to mitigate the risk o f indecisiveness; and (vii)
                 Senegal may face exogenous shocks such as climatic changes or locusts
                 invasions.

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit I(PRSC I)to Senegal for SDR20.5
million (US$30 million equivalent) on standard Intemational Development Association (IDA)
terms, is an integral part o f the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)' to support the
implementation o f the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), as laid out in the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)2. The proposed Credit would be the first o f a planned
series o fthree PRSCs inthe amount o fUS$30million each. The general thrust ofthis first series
o f PRSCs is to: (a) improve the effectiveness and transparency o f the national budget process
and expenditure management, including at the decentralization levels, as the main instrument to
achieve national development goals and reduce poverty; (b) support attainment o f PRSP
outcomes for improved living conditions o f the poor within the PRSP time horizon. To the
extent feasible, depending on country performance, these credits will be aligned with the budget
cycle.

2.      PRSC Iwill focus on the following cross-cutting andinstitutional issues:

        0   Fiduciary reforms o f the State, by strengthening budgetary and financial procedures
            (including those linked to remunerationo fthe public sector), andprocurement;


        0   Decentralizationprocess, by securing financial transfers to local Governments as well

3.      The PRS is centered around four pillars: (i) creation; (ii)
                                                             wealth                capacity building and
development o f basic social services; (iii)     improving living conditions o f vulnerable groups; and
(iv) implementation of the strategy andmonitoring o fits outcomes. The wealth creationpillar o f
the PRSP will receive marginal attention under PRSC Ibecause it already benefits from the full
support o f the Bank and other donors. Support to vulnerable groups (third pillar of the PRSP)
will be sequential andselective over time.

                                        ASSESSMENT

4.      Over the past few years, Senegal macroeconomic performance has been encouraging,
with GDP growthaveraging over 5 percent and the absence o f major disequilibrium inits fiscal
and external balances. Sustained and relatively rapid economic growth has reduced the level o f
absolute poverty, from 65 percent in 1994 to 57 percent in 2001, a significant achievement by
both historical and regional standards. However, Senegal remains a dual economy with a high
proportion o f poor living in rural areas. The probability o f being poor in Senegal i s negatively
correlated with the level o f formal education, access to health services, and employment.

               A.      RECENTMACROECONOMIC          DEVELOPMENTOUTLOOKAND

5.      Senegal is located on West Coast o fAfrica and is part o f the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU). With a population estimated at about 10 million, its economy is
dominated by a few strategic sectors, including groundnut, fisheries, and services. The informal
sector accounts for about 60 percent o f its economy. Its rural economy frequently suffers from
drought, and lacks access to basic services and infrastructure, leading to low productivity, high
emigration and higher poverty rates in rural areas. About half o f the population lives in cities,
including 30 percent inDakar.

6.      Over the past years, Senegal has enjoyed a stable political climate, and has remained
largely unaffected by regional instability. Recent progress toward a peace agreement has been
realized in the Casamance, generating the support o f donors for that construction effort,
including the World Bank. InApril 2000, Mr.Abdoulaye Wade, third President o fthe Republic
of Senegal, and the new government assumed office, representing the first transition to another
political party since independence. A new Constitution, approved in January 2001, reduced the
length o f the presidential term from seven to five years and the unlimited number o f terms to
two. Legislative elections were concluded on April 2001; and municipal elections in May 2002
saw a majority o f seatswon bythe President's Party (Senegalese Democratic Party).

7.       Sustaining the relatively strong economic performance over the past decade, Senegal's
performance in 2003 was encouraging with a real GDP growth rate o f 6.5 percent and the
absence o f major macroeconomic imbalances.         The inflation rate remained well below one
percent. Yet, this performance mainly reflects the partial recovery o f agricultural output and
strong growth inthe energy and construction sectors, and might not be sustainable ifthe reform
agenda i s not pursued over time. Meanwhile, the fiscal performance has been satisfactory,
sustained by efforts in tax revenue administration and expenditure restraint. The basic fiscal
balance (including grants) in 2001 shifted to a deficit o f 2.0 percent o f GDP from a surplus o f
0.1 percent in 2000, because o f a large budgetary transfer to cover accumulated losses o f two
para-statals (SONACOS, the groundnut processing company, and SENELEC, the electric
utility). In2002, higher revenues andtight expenditure controls helpednarrow the fiscal deficit
to 0.1 percent o f GDP. In2003, this deficit increased to 1.4 percent o f GDP, still inline with the
IMF program, because o f accelerated (domestically financed) capital spending and a drought-
related emergency program. Over 2000-2003, the Government maintained a prudent external
borrowingpolicy andtight control over domestic financing.

8.       The external current account deficit (including official grants), declined from 6.3 percent
o f GDP in 2000 to a range o f 5-5% percent in 2001-2002, reflecting good export performance
and a surge in private transfers. The deficit is likely to have risen to 6.3 percent in 2003,
reflecting mainly the effect on the trade balance of poor agricultural crops in 2002, and the
weaker than expected export performance on chemical and groundnut products.                       Tourism
receipts and private transfers are estimated to have declined compared to 2002, owing to low
growth inEuropean Union economies (the main origin ofboth flows).

9.       Outlook. Economic prospects for the 2004-2006 period are positive:                      Economic
performance during the first half of 2004 indicates that the economy at strong pace in inflation
was subdued. Over the next three years, GDP growth rate i s expected to average six percent with
an inflation rate under two percent while the current account deficit (excluding grants) is
expected to narrow to about 5.5 percent o f GDP. The temporary factors that accounted for the
poor export performance in 2003 and higher imports (in particular those o f food, petroleum
products, and items for reexports) are expected to reverse themselves in2004. Yet, the recent oil
price boom and the locust invasion could worsen the trade deficit. The main sources o f growth
are expected to be inservices (tourism), construction, and agriculture. The Senegalese economy
remains nonetheless vulnerable to external shocks such as climatic changes and terms o f trade
variations on its main tradable products (oil and groundnuts). Fiscal policy is expected to be
prudent even though the overall fiscal deficit (excluding all grants) may expand due to HIPC
initiative expenditures andnew plans to improve the co~ntry'sphysical infkastructure, notably in
urbanareas.

                                       B.      POVERTYASSESSMENT

10.      Senegal remains a poor country with a GNI per capita o f US$470 in 20023, which is
about the average of the Sub-Saharan African countries. It is also a dual economy with two-
thirds of the poor located in rural areas. Over the past decade, Senegal generated higher real
GDP growth, averaging 4.9 percent per annumduring 1994-2000, which hasresultedina decline
in absolute poverty within the country. Estimates o fpoverty based on the 1994-1995 and 2001
household surveys suggest that growth had a significant impact on poverty.               The share o f the
populationlivinginpoverty decreased from 67.9 percent in 1994 (61.4 percent o fhouseholds) to
57.1 percent in2001 (48.5 percent of households), which represents a significant achievement by
both historical and regional standards. The decrease was larger inDakar and other urbancenters
thaninruralareas.

 11.     Despitethese positive trends, perceptions o fpoverty show a disconnect with these results.
Two-thirds of households identify themselves as poor and one-third o f poor and non-poor alike
feel poverty has substantially increased in their community over the last five years. However,
half o f the Senegalese population is hopeful that poverty will decrease in the next five years.
The ability o f Government policy to ensure that the benefits o f growth reach the widest possible
segment o fpopulationwill help define whether society's expectations are met.

12.     The probability of being poor in Senegal is highly correlated with the access to formal
education, chronic health problems, and living in a remote r e g i ~ n .Another finding is that
                                                                               ~
poverty is associated with unemployment and low quality employment, explaining the high
priority that the population puts on creating jobs.            These factors appear to be the main
determinants of poverty in Senegal and improving them represents the main challenge for the
implementation o fthe Government's medium-term poverty reduction strategy.

                                              REDUCTION

13.     Since poverty is generally reduced when the economy grows, Senegal's past growth
performance has led to a substantial decline in poverty. The optimistic growth outlook should
also lead to future poverty alleviation. Yet, such performance might not be sufficient to attain
the MDGs and reduce inequality -Senegal remains a dual economy with a higher proportion of
poor livinginrural areas. More globally, Senegal faces a series of developmental challenges that
have been identified and addressed inthe Government's medium-term poverty reduction strategy
-as defined inthe PRSP.

14.      Senegal faces a series of challenges to sustain economic growth and achieve poverty
alleviation over the next decade. The emphasis is here given on a series ofbroad issues that have
beenjointly identified by the Government and its development partners as key challenges inthe
PRSP and should not be viewed as an exhaustive list. However, Senegal's ability to respond to
these challenges will greatly shape its economic future and its capacity to reach its MDGs, which
are summarized inTable 3.

15.      Enhancingprivate sector development. The Government has given a clear leading role to
the private sector in its medium-term development strategy on the basis that more productive
private investment should lead to higher economic growth and lower povertyS6 Encouraging
private activities is also a prerequisite to reduce unemployment and under-employment, which
remainimportant, especially inremote rural areas and for young adults inurbanareas, as put into
evidence inthe recent Poverty Assessment. The Government has started to improve the quality
of the investment climate and strengthened structural reforms in strategic sectors, notably in
infi-astr~cture.~Over the next few years, the Government needs to pursue its efforts and achieve
significant improvements in the provision o f infrastructure, in the quality of the investment
climate, and in the gradual diversification         of production away fi-om traditional resources such as

 Recent analytxal work reportedbythe Government inthe PRSPprogress report indicates that an increase o f 1
percent inthe income per capita is likely to induce a reduction innumber o fhouseholds living below the level o f
poverty of 1 percent.

vegetable oil and phosphoric acid.8 Lastly, the lack o f governance and the poor functioning o f
the judiciary system are also perceived as two main obstacles to private sector development, as
reflectedinrecent surveys o fprivate firms operating inSenegak9

16.     Improving transparency and efficiency of budgetary and financial procedures of the
State. The Government does not seem to face serious issues regarding the sustainability of its
fiscal position. The main challenge concems its need to improve the allocative efficiency of its
spending, which is hamperedby complex and centralized budgetaryprocedures within the State.
Today, as recognizedby the authorities, an excessive number ofprocedures remain concentrated
under the sole responsibility of the Minister o f Economy and Finance, thereby leaving little
accountability and ownership to line Ministries and agencies. Such a centralized system reduces
the effectiveness o f public spending and encourages the spread o f corruption throughout the
administration.      The authorities appear committed to improve the budget preparation and
execution as well as to reinforce ex post and independent controls, both at the central and local
Government levels.

17.      Increasing delivery of basic social services in the regions. The main challenge is to
improve the delivery o f basic social services in the regions, outside o f Dakar, since poverty i s
concentrated in rural areas. Greater financial resources are needed at the local level to enable
local Governments to carry out in full the functions (e.g., education, health, culture, and sport)
for which they have been made responsible by law since 1996. Yet, such a decentralization
strategy remains largely unsatisfactory because (i)          the role o f the central administration and that
o f local Govemments in the regions are not clearly defined; (ii)                 transfers o f revenues do not
accompany corresponding transfers o f spending responsibility to local Governments; and (iii)
financial transfers from the central Government remain slow and are based on ad hoc rules,
which makes it difficult for local authorities to plan and execute their actions and programs.
Difficulties in resource transfers have resulted in poor delivery of basic social services at the
local level. For example, in the education sector, in 2001 over 80 percent o f rural households
lived more than an hour away from a secondary school versus seven percent for urban
households. Only 16 percent o f rural households are satisfied with the quality o f primary
education versus 40 percent in urban areas. Similarly, in the health sector, 42 percent o f rural
households have access to medical services versus 80 percent inurbanareas.

 18.     Improving the performance in health and education. As mentioned earlier, access to
these social services or lack thereof, are considered to be two o f the principal determinants o f
poverty in Senegal. The poor quality o f education is principally reflected in the low number of
students who complete primary education, in the weak management of schooling at all levels,
and in the low returns to education."            One way to move towards better education in Senegal
would be to increase both equity and efficiency in public spending, in order to improve access
and quality. To strengthen the sector, the Government has allocated an increasing share o f its
budget toward primary education, up from 40 percent in 1998 to almost 45 percent in 2003;
however, budgetary allocations continue to be biased towards tertiary education compared to
intemational best practices. A significant effort has been made to recruit new teachers for

primary and secondary schools, including outside o f Dakar. The main medium-term challenge
for the Government will be to strengthen educational quality and access through its
deconcentrated structures, with the allocation o f increasing amounts from both Government
budget and donor resources to the regional anddepartmental levels, and directly to the schools.

19.        Although (outcome) health indicators are better in Senegal than the average o f Sub-
Saharan Africa, under current policies and allocated resources, Senegal is unlikely to reach its
health related MDGs, notably in the areas o f infant mortality, maternal mortality and endemic
diseases control such as malaria and tuberculosis (see Box 1). The relatively high levels of
infantandchildmortality andmaternalmortality underline the importance ofpaying attentionto
preventing and curing infectious diseases, malnutrition, perinatal and maternal conditions as well
as to other factors such as the insufficient access to improved water source, the low access to
improved sanitation and the persistence o f behaviors and socio cultural norms which are not
conducive for health. Moreover, large gaps exist in health status, access and health service
utilization between socio economic groups, between rural and urban areas and among the
regions". The Government is well aware o f these issues and intends to tackle them under the
second phase o f the National Health Development Program. The main challenges are now to
ensure that: (i)    increasing amounts o f resources are allocated to the sector since the current level
is not sufficient to reach the long-term PRSP objectives; (ii)              sector spending reaches the poor and
disadvantaged groups so that current inequalities will be reduced; and (iii)                     services respond to
the population's needs and preferences and that these services are delivered efficiently in close
collaboration with communities, local governments andthe private sector, and that these services
take into account environmental and behavioural factors.

20.        Increasingprotection of vulnerable groups. A further development challenge will be to
reduce vulnerability, particularly among those least able to avoid, reduce or cope with shocks to
income, health, employment, production and other potential loss in welfare.                                The poorest
population quintile in Senegal is virtually without effective access to basic social services and
lacks the assetsnecessary to moderate shocks. Moreover, these groups account for an important
fraction o f the Senegalese population, especially inrural areas. UNICEF estimates that over one
million children (ages 6-14) are employed                  -  often in dangerous and onerous jobs.               NGOs
estimates put the number o f children street beggars (ages 2-15) at 100,000. Rural populations
suffer from frequent drought and natural disasters. Poverty is also highly correlated with age,
and elderly people are more likely to be below the poverty line in Senegal.I2 Enhancing the
protection o f vulnerable groups (for example children, women, the handicapped, the elderly,
young people, displaced persons, and refugees) will largely define the extent to which Senegal
reaches the MDGs. To date, the broad sectoral strategies andnational investment programs have
been largely ineffective at addressing the needs o f the vulnerable groups, including children at
risk.




  For instance, in 1997, the poor /rich ratio was 1.88 for infant mortality, 2.60 for under-five mortalityrate, 2.0 for
fertility. Malnutrition is also concentrated among the poorest segments of the population. The rural /urbanratios
were 1.6 for fertility, 1.4 for infant mortality. Access to health services andpatient's satisfaction are lower inrural
areas than that inurbanareas. Inthe poorest regions such as Kaolack, Kolda andTambacounda regions and inrural
areas traditionalbirthsattendants attend more than 50 percent o fbirths.
l2For example, 15 percent o fhouseholds living in poverty are headed by aperson 65 or older.

                      B.     THEPOVERTY      REDUCTIONSTRATEGY (PRSP)

21.     Senegal has a well-articulated set o f strategies and priorities that address the main
development challenges identified above. The finalization o f the PRSP in June 2002 was an
important step forward in launching a comprehensive development strategy focused on poverty
reduction. The PRSP is explicitly defined within the vision o f the New Economic Partnership
for African Development (NEPAD) and includes the following objectives: (i) governance,
                                                                                  good
including peace-building and conflict prevention;           (ii)decentralization and economic
development in rural areas; (iii)  development o f basic infrastructure; (iv) promotion o f human
capital and skills in support of private sector development; (v) capacity buildingthrough the use
of new information technologies; (vi) promotion of regional integration and international
cooperation; (vii) protecting environment and managing durable resources; and (viii) protection
of vulnerable groups by improving their productive capacity and reducing gender disparities.

22.     Within these broad orientations, the PRSP has four pillars: (i) creation through
                                                                           wealth
economic reform and private sector development; (ii)capacity building and development o f
basic social services; (iii)improving living condition of vulnerable groups; and (iv)
implementation of the strategy and monitoring o f its outcomes. As noted in the joint staff
IMFNorld Bank assessment (December 2002), the PRSP suffered from some shortcomings,
which the authorities intended to address during the first years of strategy implementation.
Among them, it was found that the Government's plans to implement the PRS were not spelled
out insufficient details, notably with regardto a fiscal decentralization strategy that would assure
better public services. The poverty diagnostic did not benefit from a complete analysis o f the
new household survey data, and the impact o f the specific measures on the well-being o f the



                                                                                                  9

poor was not analyzed in detail. Successful implementation was to require mastering the
organizational challenges o f monitoring and maintaining progress in structural reforms,
especially cross-cutting reforms such as governance and public financial management. The
strategy was also subject to substantial risks outside o f Government's control, especially external
shocks affecting the rate o f economic growth.

                  c.      RECENTPROGRESSINTHE PRsPIMPLEMENTATION

23.    PRSP Progress Report. The Government prepared its first PRSP Progress Report in
March 2004. The Progress Report acknowledged that implementation o f the PRS has been
uneven which was to be expected given the short period o f time under review. The authorities
have notably improved the diagnostic o f poverty in Senegal by using the new database of the
householdsurvey. As mentioned earlier, the new poverty data indicate a significant reduction in
poverty over the past decade, and identify the determinants o f poverty in Senegal at the macro
and microeconomic levels.       The Government has also developed a new set o f quantitative
indicators that should help monitor progress realized in the implementation o f the PRSP over
time. The selection process for the indicators has been participatory with the inclusion o f donors
andrepresentatives ofboththe private sector andthe civil society.

24.    The Government has realized progress in the implementation o f its first PRS pillar,
wealth creation, with encouraging improvements in the investment climate.            Tax reforms,
including a new investment Code, were implemented at the end o f 2003. Significant reductions
inadministrativebarrierswere realized, notably at the registration andcustom levels. It is now
significantly faster to import and export from and to Senegal than it was in 1999. However,
structural reforms in the groundnut sector has been delayed. Another pillar o f the PRS has
received substantial attention from the authorities, which is improving the capacity o f the State.
The Government approved two action plans, based on the CFAA and the CPAR, which should
lead to substantial fiduciary reforms over time.       All donors operating in the country have
endorsed these action plans.

25.     The authorities have evaluated the allocation o f their budget spending in2003. Although
social sectors, such as education and health, benefit fiom a reasonable level of financial
resources, their internal efficiency appears relatively low. For example, the level o f execution of
budgeted resources inthe health sector reached only 25 percent after six months o f execution of
the Loi de Finance RectiJicative in 2003, which contributed to its mixed performance. In the
education sector, a bias towards tertiary education continues to prevail at the expense ofprimary
and, above all, secondary education. Localcommunities havereceivedincreasingresponsibilities
in delivering social services. However, the transfer o f resources continues to be problematic,
eventhough some progress has beenmade in2003.

26.     The Government has set a list o fpriorityactions for 2004. The main actions should focus
on the implementation o f the fiduciary reforms o f the State, the decentralization process o f the
PRSP, removing constraints in the health sector, and strengthening the institutional framework
surrounding the PRSP, notably inthe regions, with the support o fdonors.

       A.       CONSISTENCY OFTHE PRscWITH THE COUNTRYASSISTANCE               STRATEGY

FYO3-05 CAS

27.     The FY03-05 CAS for Senegal was approved on April 17,2003 (Report No. 25498-SE).
The CAS supports the Government's efforts to achieve sustained growth rates, reduce the
incidence o f poverty and improve access to basic social services, as described in the PRSP. In
the base case scenario, the CAS has proposed a series o f two PRSCs totaling around US$50
million.13

28.      The base case scenario of the CAS calls for a lending program of US$290 million, about
20 percent o f which (US$55 million) is allocated to adjustment operations (PRSC Iunder
preparation and the Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC), presented to the Board in
February, 2004. The relative allocation between adjustment and investment lending reflects
institutional considerations, the assessment of absorptive capacity in Senegal, and the ongoing
investment programs being supported by IDA. These latter represent long-term commitments of
the portfolio currently under supervision as well as a pipeline o f projects, which include
investment in social sectors (education), CDD projects (a number o f APLs), large infrastructure
projects, as well as multi-sector TNinvestment operations (notably in the area of private sector
andrural development).

29.      The strategic choice to start with a relatively focused PRSC reflects the necessity to
ensure sound budgetary processes, good fiduciary mechanisms, and adequate human resources
management at both the central and decentralized levels. It i s expected that the PRSC approach
will demonstrate its effectiveness and that the implementation o fthe proposed PRSC action plan
would result in stronger Government systems. PRSCs would then become an instrument of
choice for delivering a greater part o f IDA support in social sectors and for programs that lend
themselves to the approach. Therefore, PRSCs will become progressively more extensive and
complex over time.

30.      It is thus expected that the share of the PRSCs in the future CAS (FY06-08) would
increase to about one-third o f the base case lending scenario. This ratio may change depending
on two factors: (i) the experience under PRSC-I, and (ii) implementation of the Government
                                                             the
PRS (new PRSP document expected to be available in 2006) especially with respect to the
degree that specific poverty alleviation programs are quantified.

PRSC-Choice of lending instrument

31.      The PRSC is expected to play a central role in Senegal by: (i)providing a more
coordinated approach compared to discrete investment projects; (ii)strengthening sectoral
reforms and the delivery o f basic social services throughout the country; and (iii)   improving
project implementation over time. In short, the PRSC should help increase aid's overall
effectiveness inthe country.

                                                                                               11

32.     The reliance on the PRSC was further justified during discussions with the authorities
and other development partners, who have agreed that the PRSC is a better lending instrument
to:

        0  align with the Government's strategies and institutions for poverty reduction, as
           agreed at the Consultative Group Meeting inJune 2003;


        0  provide predictable support through andto the Government's own functional
           administration and budget systems - as proposed by the PERand CFAA, to help
           consolidate and smooth resource mobilization;


        0  maintain a dialogue between Senegal andthe Bankinareas identified earlier as key
           challenges for economic development;


        0  promote ownership and a better functioning of client's institutions; and


        0  help focus internal andexternal resources andattention onmeetingkey PRSP
            objectives andthe four pillars defined bythe Government.

33.     The move to supporting poverty reduction through the national budget process is
consistent with the Government's decision to align better its budget allocation with
developmental priorities. The PRSC is viewed as the best instrument to support this effort since
it will be directly integrated inthe Government's budgetary process in support o f improvements
in budgetary management aimed at enhancing the effectiveness o f public expenditures.
Furthermore, its multi-sectoral approach should help promote coordination and collaboration
across Government agencies in areas that have suffered from fragmented approaches, including
strengthening the decentralization process and improving Government's delivery o f services to
the poor andvulnerable.

34.     The rationale for the PRSC in Senegal also consists inits ability to address cross-cutting
constraints and issues that affect service delivery, notably inhealth and education, but cannot be
addressed effectively at the sector level, such as issues dealing with recruitment, remuneration
and deployment of personnel. As detailed below, these synergies will be at the center of the
proposed PRSC agenda.

                            B.     KEYANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

35.     Inpreparation for the PRSC, a number of pieces of analytical and fiduciary work have
been undertaken. These pieces have attempted to support the four pillars identified by the
Government in its PRS, with an emphasis on the State's capacity buildingand the promotion of
basic social services. A summary o f the major analytical pieces conducted by the World Bank
andtheir links to the PRSP pillars is contained inTable 4.

36.     Improving the State capacity building has retained the attention of policymakers and
donors in Senegal. Over the past few years, a considerable analytical effort has been conducted
inassessing the effectiveness of public spendinginSenegal, including a CFAA, a CPAR, a PER,
an IMF ROSC, and a study on the decentralization process in the country. These pieces have
identified the main shortcomings in the fiduciary system in the country as well as help the



                                                                                                12

authorities to prepare two actions plan for reforms in both the short and medium terms. The
proposed PRSC program will bebased on these action plans.

37.    Inorder to improve the diagnostic ofpoverty, a poverty assessmentstudy was conducted
inFY03. InJanuary 2004, a report on poverty inSenegal was producedjointly by the Ministry
of Economy and Finance and the World Bank, using the data from the recent household survey.
This report has shown the evolution o f poverty trends in Senegal and provided a better
understanding of poverty determinants. Over the past few years, a number o f sectoral pieces on
health (health services coverage and utilization, health workforce analysis, PER including a
benefit incidence analysis, private sector delivery assessment) and education were conducted,
allowing the identification o f the major constraints in these sectors. A Rural Social Protection
Strategy, initiated inFY04for delivery inFY05 will underpinpolicy dialogue inthis area.

38.     The investment climate and the promotion o f private sector development have also
received considerable attention, including the CEM, two recent FIAS studies, and an on-going
investment climate assessment. As a result, the Government has initiated a substantial effort to
improve the investment climate, notably through tax reforms and the rationalization o f
administrative barriers faced byprivate investors.

39.     The scope and content o f the PRSC in Senegal is the outcome o f a highly intensive
participatory processes between first the World Bank's team and the PRSP Secretariat and
subsequently all development partners. This process was consolidated in a workshop jointly



                                                                                               13

organized by the Government and the World Bank in early November 2003, attended by more
than 60 representatives from Ministries, Governmental agencies, civil society, donors, and the
private sector.

40.     Senegal receives developmental assistance from a large number o f bilateral and
multilateral donors and NGOs. All donors have agreed that the proposed PRSC program should
support the four pillars identified inthe Government's medium-term poverty reduction strategy.
Although the PRSC program has not been developed along one single matrix shared by all
donors, such an approach was adopted for the fiduciary reforms where all donors have endorsed
and organized their support along the implementationo fthe C F M C P A R actions plans. Inthe
health area, all donors are supporting the development o f the new sectoral strategy on which the
actions proposed in the PRSC are based. The authorities are also moving forward to improve
harmonizationamong donors.

41.     Throughout project preparation, coordination with the European Union, the Dutch and

budgetary support operation^.'^ Not only will these operations complement the PRSC, but they
Canadian Governments has received special attention as they are also currently preparing

also send a consistent message to the authorities regarding the priorities agreed by the donor
community by supporting the same priority actions, notably in fiduciary reforms and health. A
close collaboration has also emerged in the definition o f the monitoring indicators to be used to
evaluate the implementation o f the PRS and in the initial focus on the fiduciary reforms of the
State. While the EU support is expected to precede the World Bank operations by 2-3 months,
both operations should be integrated in the 2005 budget and include disbursement conditions
based on progress in the implementation o f the C F M C P A R . The Dutch support will focus on
the environment sector, while the Canadian one will encourage reforms in the education sector.
The choice o f these two sectors will help explain the selectivity o f the PRSC program (see para.
45 for details). The team expects coordination to improve further under PRSC-I1and 111.

42.     The IMF, which is expected to play a crucial role in two areas, has also supported the
proposed PRSC agenda. First, the reform program supported by the PRSC program is based on
the implementation o f the PRGF arrangement. The PRSC program is closely coordinated with
the PRGF according to agreed institutional division o f labor, with the IMF taking the lead on
macroeconomic sector issues and the Bank taking the responsibility on structural and social
issues, In a number o f areas where the mandate o f the two institutions overlap, there is a close
coordination and collaboration to ensure that consistent advice is provided to the authorities.
Maintaining macro-economic and fiscal stability i s part o f the PRGF reviews and will be an
important input into the assessment o f the macroeconomic situation by the Bank. Second, the
implementation o f fiduciary and human resources reforms in the public sector, one o f priority
areas selected under PRSC Iand PRSC 11, enhances successful implementationo fthe PRGF.

43.     The PRSC program has been designed to support the PRS developed by the Government,
and is an integral part of the World Bank's country assistance strategy. In dialogue with the
administration and other stakeholders, the thrust o f the PRSC program is to: (a) improve the

effectiveness and transparency of the national budget process and expenditure management,
including at the decentralization levels, as the main instrument to achieve national development
goals; (b) support PRSP outcomes in terms of improves living conditions, with a special focus
first on health services, and eventually on other critical areas ofPRSP implementation.

44.     Reforms supported by the PRSC program are summarized in Table 5 and can be
described as follows:

        0   PRSC Iwill focus on three priority areas: a) strengthening budgetary and financial
            reforms o f the State, b) enhancing financial decentralization toward local
             Governments, and c) improving health services delivery. These three areas constitute
             the backbone of the PRS and their implementation is already well advanced.
             Simultaneously, but gradually, it is proposed that PRSC Ilay the foundations for
             expanding the role o f PRSC instrument inthe areas of wealth creation and protection
             o fvulnerable groups;


         0   PRSC IIand I11will sustain the reforms initiated under PRSC Iand will strengthen
             the reform agenda inthe fiduciary, decentralization, and health areas. Depending on
             the progress realized under PRSC Iand triggers to be determined, it will selectively
             expand its coverage to promote wealth creation and protect vulnerable groups, which
             are two pillars ofthe PRS. Inso doing, the PRSC agenda should gradually strengthen
             the basic elements of a social protection strategy and poverty alleviation of the
             poorest segments of the population, which is the long-term objective for Senegal.

45.     Selectivity.      Selectivity is crucial to ensure that the proposed PRSC program will
concentrate on areas where it provides the greatest value added to the ongoing effort undertaken
by the Government and its development partners. Specifically, criteria for inclusion o f priority
sectors and themes inthe PRSC included the importance to effective PRSP implementation, the
Bank's comparative advantage inleadingthe policy dialogue, the absence o f significant support
from donors, including IDA, through project lending, and reforms that underpin using the
national budget process to channel assistance. An important feature to the proposed PRSC
program is that it attempts to avoid duplication o f existing or planned programs (see a summary
in Table 6).15 This is most apparent for the education sector, which has and will continue to
receive substantial financial support through alternative lending instruments from the World
Bank and other donors.16 It is nonetheless worth underscoring that a number o f cross-sectoral
constraints faced by the education sector will be addressedthrough the PRSC program, including
the administrative and civil reforms as well as the financial decentralization process that should
help strengthen the delivery andquality o f education services.

46.      This selectivity process also explains why the wealth creation-which is the first pillar o f
the PRS, only benefits from a relative marginal attention in the PRSC program. This pillar
already received the full support o f the World Bank through a series o f programs and lending
operations, notably inthe areas o finvestment climate, agriculture, and infrastructure (see Table 6
and fuller details can be found inBox 1later inthe text). The emphasis is given to two areas-
justice and labor- that have been relatively neglected by the current financial and technical
assistance from donors and are expected to have significant externalities to the current agenda o f
promoting not only wealth creationbut also equity in Senegal.

47.     Insupport o fthe pillar devoted to improving the livingconditions o f vulnerable groups,
the Bank is fundinga number o f community driven development (CDD) type operations, ranging
from a forthcoming emergency project in Casamance to a successfd ongoing nutrition project,
which support long-term programs through a series o f APLs. These projects provide important
safety nets to communities andvulnerable groups. A recent review o f these programs has lead to
the conclusion that their rationalization is both desirable and feasible, which will be one o f the
key objectives of the PRSC program inthis area, as described infuller details inthe next section
(see Box 5 inparticular).

the Government in its effort to monitor its PRSP implementation, others have been identified in

important effort i s underway to strengthen the monitoring capacity within this sector. A general
word o f caution might be useful with regards to PRSC 111since the Government is expected to

produce a new PRSP in 2006. While continuity in the reform process is expected, it has to be
recognized that preserving flexibility is important for the successful implementation o f the PRSC
supported program over time and, thus, the proposed actions should only be indicative o f the
long-term Government's vision.

 Key Issues
 49.    Senegal's PRSP emphasizes the weakness in the Government's fiscal and budgetary
 procedures as one of the constraints to achieving its poverty reduction objectives.            The
 Government has also increasingly recognized severe limitations in its recruiting and
 remuneration policies, preventing public administration to deliver core basic services, especially
 outside ofDakar. The Senegalese Government has given increasing priority to improvements in
 these areas, because ifbudgets are misallocated, the services that people need (and presumably
 desire) may not get adequate levels of finding. And, if funds are misappropriated, both the
 quality and quantity of services that are offered will suffer.

 50.    Ideally, Senegal should promote the attainment o f three broad outcomes, namely,
 aggregate fiscal discipline, allocative efficiency, and operational efficiency. Aggregate fiscal


                                                                                                 18

discipline refers to the systematic alignment o fpublic expenditures with total revenues (domestic
revenues plus a sustainable level o f foreign borrowing). Allocative efficiency on the other hand
refers to the consonance o f budgetary allocations with the strategic priorities o f the country.
And, operational efficiency refers to the provision o fpublic services at a reasonable quality and
cost. It appears that Senegal has been able to meet all but the last o f these outcomes. Over the
past few years, Senegal has beenwell on track with the PRGFprogram-meeting its fiscal targets
since 2000, and has been allocating an increasing share o f spending toward PSRP priority
targets. For example, the share o f education and health in total public expenditures has both
increased significantly over the past few years, up by 0.9 and 0.5 percentage points of GDP
respectively between 2000 and 2004.17 Therefore, the lack o f efficiency in public spending
appears principally rooted in cumbersome and complex administrative procedures as well as
weak financial and human resources management. Weaknesses in financial management also
explain the lack o f information and planning on the allocation o f resources within sectors,
leadingto inefficiencies andcorruption, andultimately to higher costs.

51.     On the basis o f several diagnostic studies, including the CFAA and CPAR conducted by
the World Bank and the IMF ROSC, two detailed action plans were approved by the Prime
Minister inJuly 2003 andwere subsequently endorsed by all donors in Senegal. Several reforms
have been launched and important progress has been made in the following key areas.
Computerization o f budget execution has begun; several successful pilot projects in fiscal
decentralization have been launched; new inter-Governmental information systems have been
designed; good progress was realized in defining the parameters o f the recruiting strategy for
200345.

52.     The PRSC program intends to support the ongoing implementation o f these two action
plans, which is fully consistent with the objectives o f capacity building and good governance
stated inthe PRSP andwill thereby contribute to improving the delivery o f basic social services.
The PRSC program is also fully consistent with the Government's effort to address some o f the
budgetary and procurement issues that have been identified through the recent governmental
spending irregularities, which came to light in June 2004. This spending, o f about 1percent o f
GDP, has not affected fiscal sustainability and were globally consistent with the PRS priorities
but breach budgetary discipline. The PRSC will support the need to improve the procurement
legislation as well as the internalcontrols andexternal audits o fthe State's accounts.

53.     The main activities to be included inthe PRSC program can be summarized as follows:

        0   Improve budgetary planning and preparation with the establishment o f a medium
            term expenditure fkamework indicating budgetary allocations through PRS programs
            and objectives;

        0   Strengthen budgetary execution, including the financial decentralization o f key
            administrative functions andprocurement responsibilitiesto line Ministries;


        0   Increase budgetary controls; with a focus on the role of external and independent
            audits (e.g. Cour des Comptes);


        0   Strengthen procurement rules andpractices.

54.    Beyond budgetary and financial procedures, Senegal has given increasing emphasis to
humanresources management inthe public sector. Poor management contributes to the lack of
transparency and corruption. Moreover, it explains the inadequate distribution o f staff, mostly
apparent through the excessive concentration inDakar, which limits the public sector's capacity
to deliver more and better education andhealth services inremote areas where the needs are the
most pressing. Lastly, civil servants often complain about low and unequal salaries as well as
the absence o f adequate motivations for career development. Good progress was realized by the
Government in defining the parameters o f the recruiting strategy for 2003-05, which has been
accepted by the IMF. Their net recruitment target over three years has been set to 15,000 civil
servants, and the phasing is geared to respect medium-term wage bill targets. Priority social
sectors (education, health), security (army and police), finance, and justice should receive the
bulk o f the new recruitment. As regards civil service wages, the authorities have launched a
review o f compensation policy that should yield recommendations for reforms inthe second half
o f 2004.  The review is expected to recommend structural changes to the civil service pay
regime, particularly the complex benefits system.

55.     Yet, civil service reform is a long-term process that could go on into the next decade for
both the central and decentralized administrations. Therefore, the proposed approach in the
PRSC is sequential and relatively modest in its first phase. PRSC Iwill accompany the
Government's inits effort to implement its recruiting strategy defined with the IMF. Depending
on the result o f this exercise, and in parallel, the PRSC I1will support the implementation o f
reforms for rationalizing remunerationpolicies inthe public sector.

ExpectedResultsof PRSCProgram

56.     By the end o f the PRSC Program (PRSC I,I1and 111) Senegal expects to achieve the
following:

        0   A comprehensive 3-year MTEF; indicating budgetary allocations through PRS
            programs and objectives;


        0   Budget execution closer to the approved appropriation;


        0   Increased decentralizationo f execution inline Ministries;


        0   Operational modernprocurement rules;


        0   Externalaudits andindependent controls o fbudgets;


        0   Implementedrecruiting strategy agreed with the IMF;


        0   Better control o f the wage bill and new set o f financial incentives for civil servants.

ProgressandPriorActions-PRSCI
57.     Progress during PRSCI.To achieve these results, Senegal has completed a first round o f
reforms, including the following actions: (i)decentralization o f financial execution procedures
(dkconcentrution de Z'ordonnancement) from the Ministryo f Finance to four line Ministries, (ii)



                                                                                                     20

reduction inthe use o f exceptional spending procedures to less than 15 percent oftotal expenses,
(iii)adoptionofnew rulefor the Contr6les des Opkrations FinanciBres, (iv) productionof
quarterlyreports indicatingthe financial position o fthe Treasury, (vii) submission o f comptes de
gestion from 1999 to 2001 to the Cour des comptes, (v) initiation of the study that should lead to
the creation o f the unit of coordination and advice to purchasers, (vi) implementation o f the first
phase o f the recruiting strategy agreed with the IMF, and (vii) selection o f the consultant to
perform the financial and technical audit o f the public wage bill. The above actions are expected
to ensure progress toward the implementation o f the C F M C P A R and pave the way toward a
transparent andefficient public finance system Senegal.

58.     Among the above activities, the following reforms are considered as prior actions to be
completed before Boardpresentation o fPRSC I:

            Start    the   decentralization   o f   budgetary    execution    (dkconcentration    de
            1'ordonnancement) inat least four line Ministries, including the Ministry o f Health;

            Beginthe financial andtechnical audit o fthe wage billinthe public sector;

            Adopt legal and regulatory texts organizing the activities of the Contr6le des
            Ope'rationsFinanciBres;

            Submit comptes degestion from 1998 to 2001 to the Cour des comptes;

            Start the legal and strategic analysis for the creation of the Organe de coordination et
            de conseil aux acheteurs inearly 2005.

PossiblemonitorableactionsandtriggersunderPRSCI1andI11

59.     Several actions should be implemented during2005 including the further decentralization
o f execution procedures to line Ministries, the modernization o f the wage and pension
management systems, the approval o f the lois de rzglements by Parliament which have been
delayed over the past few years; the controls o fthe public accounts by the Cour des Comptes,the
implementation o fthe initialphase o f the reform o fthe remunerationinthe public sector, andthe
adoption o f the new revised Procurement Code as well as the publication o f the first audit on
procurement contracts. The proposed triggers for the follow up PRSC 11are: (i)        elaboration o f
the budget law for 2006 on a programmatic basis (MTLF) in four key Ministries, (ii)
implementation o f the recommendations derived from the financial and technical audit o f the
wage bill inthe public sector, (iii) revision o fthe main legal text on procurements on basis o f the
recommendations derived from the evaluation study, (iv) preparation and implementation o f
procurement plans approved by the Commission Nationale des Contrats de I'Administration in six
Ministries; (v)submission o f the 2002 and 2003 comptes de gestion to the Cour des comptes, and
(v) initiation o f the civil reforms in the public sector. These triggers should demonstrate the
Government's commitment to pursue with fiduciary reforms and improve the transparency and
effectiveness ofpublic spending.

60.     The reforms will be pursued during 2006, with two main objectives. The first objective
will be to provide continuity to the reform process, as most actions will take time to be fully
implemented and will require sustained efforts from the authorities. The second objective i s to



                                                                                                   21

evaluate the first series of actions so that the authorities can learn from their experience before
extending their approach to other sectors and activities.

Monitoring indicators

61.      Specific quantitative targets to be reached at the end o f PRSC Iare consistent with those
selectedbythe authorities intheir PRS andinclude (the full list is presented in Schedule 111):

         0   Number        of Ministries        with the       responsibilities      o f budgetary      execution
             (ordonnancement) increases from 0 in2003 to 4 in2004 and6 in2006;


         0   Number ofbenchmarks attained inthe annual AAP report increases from 4 in2001to
             7 in2004,8 in2005, and9 in2006;

         0   Percentage ofbudget execution increases from 91 percent in2003 to up 93 percent in
             2004 and 95 percent in2005.

                      B.       STRENGTHENINGTHE DECENTRALIZATION                     PROCESS

Key issues

62.      In the past few years, the Government has initiated the decentralization of decision-
makingover the management of human and financial resources, including the strengthening of
local Governments capacities and the gradual transfer of a number of responsibilities to local
communities, especially inthe education and health sectors. Such a process is viewed as one of
the key PRSP instruments for targeting vulnerable and poor groups in rural regions, and
improving the delivery of public services.             Senegal's PRSP clearly identifies the strong rural
dimension ofpoverty, butprogress has been unequal inpractice.

63.      For reasons explained below, the PRSC programwill focus on actions and reforms that
would improve the relationships between the central Government and local Governments. This
i s perceived as a key element o f a successful decentralization strategy. First, recent studies"
have put into evidence that the financial transfers from the central Government to local
Governments (i)are not always consistent with current regulations, (ii)                        often arrive with
substantial delays to the local level, (iii)are generally based on ad hoc and discretionary
allocation mechanisms, and (iv) are insufficient in view of the increasing spending
responsibilities devolved to local authorities.             Second, lack o f sufficient information at the
regional level on the PRSP strategy leads to coordination problems and inefficiencies in both
planning and execution. Finally, budgetary responsibilities are not always well defined across
the different levels of Government, leading to confusion at the expense of users. Addressing
these deficiencies will complement activities already undertaken in the context o f other sectoral
operations financed by the World Bank and other donors, which seek to strengthen the
institutional capacity o f local Governments and develop a truly local administration."



18 See inparticular, the recent World Bankreport: Decentralization and Civic Engagement (FY04).
l 9 The following operations aim explicitly at increasingthe local capacity o flocal governments: Public Services
Info-System Modernization (FYOO); UrbanDevelopment and Decentralization I1(FY05); and
National RuralInfrastructure(FYOO).


                                                                                                                 22

64.     The main objectives o fthe PRSC program would be to:

        0   Secure and guarantee an adequate level o f financial transfers from the central State to
            local communities, with a special attention to improving the distribution mechanisms
            used to allocate taxes and financial transfers (FECL and FDD) to and across local
            Governments;


        0   Strengthen the institutional support surrounding the implementation o f the PRS inthe
            region so that objectives and actions are well coordinated across the multiple
            Governmentallevels;

            Improve the diffusion o f information on budgets and responsibilities between the
            central administration inthe regions and the local authorities, especially inthe area of
            financial and fiduciary decentralization;


        0   Strengthen the relationships between central Government representatives in the
            regions andlocal communities.

65.     These objectives are consistent with the global action plansupporting the decentralization
process that has been developed by the Government with the participation o f donors in Senegal
in early 2003.20 They should also enhance the performance of the State indelivering more and
better health services as well as providing support to vulnerable groups -two key areas o f the
proposed PRSC.

ExpectedResultsofthe PRSCProgram

66.     By the end o f the PRSC Program (PRSC I,I1and 111) Senegal expects to achieve the
following:

            Clear and efficient mechanism o f financial transfers from the central to the local
            Governments, andwithin local Governments;


        0   Operating regional committees to help implement and monitor the PRS through
            regional action plans (PZans d `opbrationsregionaux,POR);

            Improved coordination and harmonization o f development activities in the regions,
            includingthose funded by external partners andthe private sector,

            Better use of resources and financial transfers through improved budgetary control
            procedures, including audits.

Progressand PriorActions-PRSCI

67.     To attain these results, Senegal has completed a first round o f reforms, including the
transfer of FECL and FDD to local Governments on time, preparing a set o f actions to mobilize
and collect revenues at the local level, agreeing on a new set ofbudgetary control mechanisms at


2o Ministryof Interior, Pland'action, Dkentralisation,2003-2005.


                                                                                                  23

the regional level, preparing a database o f all development partners operating in each region,
harmonizing regional and sectoral investment plans, and the implementation of the institutional
framework supporting the PRSP at the decentralized level. Prior actions to be completed prior to
Board presentation of PRSC Iinclude the distribution o f transfers (FECL and FDD) to local
governments before June 2004 and the creation o f regional PRS committees in all eleven
regions.

Possiblemonitorable actions and triggers under PRSCI1and 111

68.       Itis expected that duringthe course of 2005, the Government will accelerate the transfers
o f financial resources (FDD and FECL) to local Governments. Concurrently, new rules should
be agreed to secure and guarantee that these transfers will be more automatic and predictable to
local governments. The decentralization o f the consolidated investment program (BCI) should
be initiated at the regional level. The institutional framework surrounding the PRSP should be
operational in the regions by early 2005 through the finalization o f the regional plans (POR),
which will be -consistent with the sectoral investment strategy (POS), and budgetary controls
procedures should be effective at the regional level. Possible triggers for deciding o fwhether the
Bankwillproceed with subsequent operationPSRC 11couldinclude:

          0     Strengthen the activities o fPRS regional committees;


          0     Agree andinitiate the decentralization strategy o f the BCIinpilot local governments;


           0    Integrate inthe Procurement Code standard measures to facilitate the implementation
                o fprocurement rules inthe local governments.

69.       The PRSC I11will continue the reforms initiated duringthe first two years o fthe program
with a focus on implementing the rationalizationo ftransfers from the centralto local
governments as well as on the decentralization o fthe consolidated investmentprograms.

Monitoring Indicators

70.         A list o findicatorswill be usedto assessprogress inthis area, including the evolution o f
the FECL and FDDtransfers that should reach at least US$ xx in 2004 and US$ yy in2005, the
increase in the number o f PRSP committees and meetings organized by regions in 2004 and
2005, the number o f regions (or local governments) responsible for the management o f the
consolidated investment budget, and the number o f audit reports received by the Cow des
comptes on the use o fpublic resources inthe regions (from 4 in2003 to over 25 in2006).

                                       C.       IMPROVING    HEALTH    SERVICES

 Key Issues

 71.       The health sector policy was initially outlined in the Plan National de Dheloppement
Sanitaire 1998-2007-PNDS, which was endorsed by the donors' community, including the
World Bank (see Box 2). Yet, the recent evaluation of its first phase has led to mixed results2'.


  For l l l e r details on the diagnostic, see Senegal's Country Economic Memorandum (FY2003) and Public
 ExpenditureReview (FY2004)


                                                                                                         24

On the positive side, substantial progress was reported in the areas o f health services delivery
(with the increased availability of cost effective interventions and essential drugs at the health
posts) and o f health systems administration particularly with respect to hospital management.
The Government also demonstrated its financial commitment to the health sector, by increasing
its share o f budget and by raising the non-wage portion of the recurrent budget. Despite these
progresses, there remain significant sectoral issues and constraints that are summarized below.

                     Box 3: Health Sector Strategy and the World Bank's Assistance




72.     Insufficient access to health services. Senegal is still below WHO norms in terms of
health post and health center per inhabitants.22 As a result, it is estimated that more than 25
percent of the population (42.1 percent inrural areas) travel more than 5 kilometers to reach the
nearest primary health care facility (PHC). This low accessibility is due to the bias inphysical
investment towards hospitals at the expense of PHC facilities in rural areas. Local initiatives
resulting from the decentralization reforms, contributed to aggravate the existing disparities in
geographical accessibility.

73.     Poor quality and low efficiency of health services. The low availability o f motivated
and skilled health personnel affects severely the quality and efficiency o fhealth care and inturn
the reputation and demand o f public services while hindering the scaling up of priority
interventions. Shortages o f skilled health personnel are exacerbated by imbalances in the skill-
mix, outdated education andtraining, unbalanced geographical deployment especially for nurses
andmidwives, andineffective management as well as supervision. Few incentives exist for staff
to improve their productivity. Existing staff is dissatisfied with their working conditions, their
salaries, and their career development.       Solving the human resource development problems
should be among the priorities defined in the revised health strategy that envisages a more
balanced deployment o f staff to critical geographical areas coupled with a more attractive
package of incentives as well as with improved planning, management andtraining.

74.     Insufficient emphasis on prevention and behavior changes. The low utilizationrate of
health services in Senegal is also explained by the insufficient emphasis on prevention and


22In2002, Senegalreported 1healthpostper 11292 inhabitants and 1healthcenter per 190916 inhabitants whereas
WHOnorms were respectively 1healthpostper 10000inhabitants and 1health center per 50000 inhabitants


                                                                                                        25

behavioral changes. Preventive activities represent only 20 percent o f the cost o f services
provided by the public sector. The current training curriculum along with the introduction o f
cost recovery has contributed to this situationby creating incentives for providing curative rather
thanpreventiveservices.

75.    Weak institutional capacity.          The performance o f the health delivery system is
undermined by the rapid turnover o f staff holding key positions within the Ministry o f Health.
This lack o f stability makes difficult to properly conceive and follow up on reforms or to address
the lack o f accountability and weaknesses infinancial management, execution, procurement and
audit that cause delay and disruption. The overall planningo f activities is not adequately linked
with the objectives to be attained and the implementation o f districts plans often suffer from
substantial delays inthe release of funds. The excessive centralization o fpersonnel management
aggravates the lack o f responsiveness o f the system. Finally, the health information system is
neither capable o f producing relevant and timely information for the management of program
andservices nor to provide full account o fthe resources used.

76.     Insufficient coordination with communities and private sector. Coordination with
other stakeholders in service provision is also limited. Although health committees have been
strengthened by the MOH under the Bamako Initiative, community involvement is weakened by
the absence o f women and the insufficient coordination and harmonization o f the interventions
developed by community based organizations in the areas o f disease control (including
HIV/AIDS,malaria, onchocerciasis), reproductive healthandnutrition as well as to hygieneand
environmental actions. The private sector remains largely unregulated, thereby affecting quality
o f services, efficient resource use and equitable distribution o f resources (see Box 3).     The
private sector regulation will be updated and contractual arrangements implemented so that all
stakeholders could efficiently participate inachieving public health objectives.

                               Box 4: The private health sector in Senegal




                                                                                                 26

77.      Inadequate sector financing and budgetary procedures. The overall public budget
allocated to the public sector has increased over time, in line with the PRSP objective^.^^ but
remains low compared to the cost for reasonably good service provision and for the achievement
o f MDGs. On one hand, the sector was successfbl in shifting resources from the administration
to the operational level and towards priority health programs, on the other handthe allocation o f
public resources inthe health sector was biased towards investment and non-personnel recurrent
spending and did not pay due attention to the motivation o f health personnel nor to the needs of
the poorest regions. Several systemic constraints also reduce the absorptive capacity o fthe health
sector and undermine the efficiency of health expenditures, such as the absence o f link between
spending and population size, poverty or performance, the insuficient capacity in financial
management andprocurement and the centralizationo fbudget execution. Either govemment's or
donor f h d s are not released in a timely manner nor fblly spent. Harmonization o f donors'
procedures is still an issue.

78.      High financial barriers to access and utilisation of health services. High financial
barriers represent another reason for the under utilization o f health services especially by the
poor. The escalation o f user fees proceeds that almost doubled from 1998 to 2002 seems to have
affected the use o f services by the poor and vulnerable groups and service utilization rates.
Users o fpublic health facilities are more and more discontent with the health services mainly as
a consequence of the costs o f consultations and drugs. Poverty generally limits also the demand
for private sector services with 50 percent o f the Senegalese population spending less thanUS$ 3
on health per year. There is no effective exemption system to protect the access o f the poorest
segments o f the population.              Mutual Health Insurance Associations (MHIA), Health
Maintenance Funds and other forms o f health insurance are expanding.                       However, they are
located inurbanareas excludingpoor peoplethat cannot afford premiums.

PlannedreformsandPRSCsupport

79.      Over the next three years, the PRSC program will support the Government inits effort to
(i) accessandutilizationofbetterqualityhealthservices, and(ii)strengthenhealth
    improve
sectors' financing and management. These two objectives are consistent with the Government's
PRS and should help it achieve the MDGs in this sector.                          The PRSC will support the
implementation o f the sector policyby consideringboth supply and demand sides, by addressing
its various dimensions such as accessibility, effectiveness, efficiency, quality and sustainability.
These objectives o f the PRSC are in line with the proposed budgetary support by EU and will
complement other investment projects inthis sector by donors, including the World Bank.24As
many o f the problems inthe health sector relate to crosscutting issues (procurement, personnel
management, financial accountability, decentralization), the PRSC is viewed as the most
appropriate instrument.




23Over the five-year period 1998 to 2002, total health costs have increased fromUS$63.3 millionto US$127.1
million. The biggest increase was reported inthe salary recurrent expenditures (+52.3 percent. In2002, total health
costs were estimated at about $12 per capita or 2.1 percent of GDP.

24The implementation o fthe PRSC will be realized inclose coordination with existing World Bank's projects such
as the HIV/AIDS prevention and control projects, the nutrition enhancement program, water and sanitation project
andthe private sector investment projects, notably inthe area of social protection.


                                                                                                                  27

80.     The first priority area supported by the PRSC program is to improve the provision o f
health services, by bringing them closer to the population in needs especially in remote areas,
andbymakingservices provided technically and socially acceptable with the full involvement o f
the beneficiaries. The program will emphasize the following reforms:

    Increasing andpromoting equity in access: The program will support: (i) implementation
                                                                                   the
o f a health map and an infrastructure development plan to better reflect the institutional setup
created by the 1996 decentralization reform and to more adequately address the needs o f
underserved areas; (ii)  the development o f community based outreach activities encouraging
communities to participate in the provision o f essential basic services including infectious
disease control, IMCI, reproductive health, nutrition and hygiene and sanitation with the support
o flocal govemments under the technical guidance o fdistricts health teams; (iii) reform ofthe
                                                                                     the
legal, judicial framework that will enhance foreign and local financing to the private health
sector, and (iv) the implementation o f the contracting policy where the Government will be able
to provide coverage for selected private health services.

    Increasing the availability and utilization of prevention and behavior changes interventions:
The government has expressed strong political commitment in favor o f prevention and behavior
changes interventions.     The PRSC program will assist the scaling-up o f a set o f essential
preventative and curative services adjusted to women and children's health needs including the
control o f HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, andthe diseases andhealthproblems which can be prevented
by means o f the immunization, IMCI, nutrition and reproductive health programs. The various
programs that oversee these activities will be reinforced and their integration at the operational
level made stronger. As regard to specific health programs and interventions, improvements o f
health outcomes will imply to: (i)revise and implement the immunization policy and the
immunization financial sustainability plan; (ii)     extend I M C I in all districts; (iii)
                                                                                          increase the
number o f health personnel competent in obstetric in rural districts and extend the network o f
emergency obstetric care management facilities; (iv) apply bed net targeting and pricing policy
andto design andtest new malaria epidemic early warningsystem; (v) strengthen the partnership
on essential generic drugs builtwith the private sector focusing on improvements inprocurement
and distribution o f generic drugs especially in health facilities and the rationalization o f their
utilization; (vi) expand quality improvements and quality monitoring activities undertaken in all
health care facilities; and (vii) implement a behaviors change communication plan and social
marketing services by means o f public and private media and community relays to reach
individuals and families.

     Increasing the availability of skilled and motivated health personnel: Solving the human
resource development problems are among the priority thrusts o f the new health strategy. The
PRSC will provide support to the design o f a comprehensive human resource development
policy regardingrecruitment, training, utilization (for instance as regard to gender issues and the
availability o f female staff) and loyalty o f health personnel with the view to increase the number
of skilled personnel in medical regions and health districts. The recruitment o f 1,740 new staff
over three years 2003-2005 will allow to alleviate critical shortages o f staff especially in rural
areas and poorest regions. The revision o f the medical and nursingtraining cumculum will be
moved forward and new innovative ways will be found out to improving in-service training
activities and supervision. The program will also help build up the MOH central and regional
capacity to effectively design and manage a more attractive package o f incentives, both financial
and non-financial inview to motivate staff serving inde-concentrated services while increasing

their productivity. Measures to be taken will include: (i) revision o f the compensation policy;
                                                                      the

implementation of providers behavior change activities in view to promote their adherence to
guidelines, increase their attention to patient needs and enhance the ethical and cultural
acceptability o f health care; (v) increased quality monitoring activities and better supervision.
Civil society, local governments, unions and professional organizations will be involved in
setting the rules o f the game and procedures, developing guidelines and monitoring their
implementation.

    Reducingfinancial barriers to access by thepoor and vulnerable groups to health services:
The PRSC will support the implementationo freforms aimingat developing pooling systems and
mitigating the effects of the cost recovery system on the poor and vulnerable groups. This
double objectives will be achieved inter-alia through: (i)               the application o f an harmonized fee
system for drugs and cost recovery; (ii)           the implementation o f an exemption policy along with
better management o f government (and donors) subsidies allocated to drugs and their extension
to other services and interventions used by the poor, by pregnant women and children under 5
year old.25 Concurrently the PRSC will support the development o f mutual health insurance
associations by improving the legal framework, establishing management and technical capacity
inthe healthinsurance system andbyenablingthe government to paypremiums for the poor and
guaranty funds for their sustainability.

81.      Strengthening health sector's financing andmanagement is crucial for the successo fthe
Government's strategy. For this reason, the PRSC program will aim at supporting the following
actions:
    Improving/Rationalizing the internal organization of the Ministry of Health: The program
will assist the authorities intheir effort to improve the managing and administrative capacity in
the MOH. It will help reorganize the MOH andredefine the mandates o f its various units both at
central and decentralized levels. The new organizational chart will provide for the creation o f a
new directorate o f human resource management, the establishment o f an information
management unit, the reorganization o f the directorate in charge o f finances and administration
(DAGE), and the creation o f units in regional offices responsible for disease control and
immunization. Continued efforts will be made to improve the staffing, training and equipping o f
health districts and to reinforce their capacity to manage, implement and monitor the priority
health programs.

    Increasingpublic health expendituresand strengthening the link between resources used and
results: The PRSC will support: (i)           the development o f a MTEF and an output-based budgeting
system to setting the level o f public hnds needed, enhancing efficiency and the pro-poor
emphasis o f public health spending in line with PRSP priorities; (ii)                 the clarification o f budget
planningand execution modalities at regional and district levels allowing for more transparency
in budget management, speedy execution, regular monitoring and frequent assessments of the
impact o fthe actions taken; (iii)       the development o f a formula guidingthe allocation o fresources


25Including: (i)protection o fpregnancies and childbirths: iron and folic acid, Vitamin A; Contraceptives; Caesarean
procedures; delivery kits; (ii)preventionand treatment o fmalaria: Impregnatedmosquito nets and sulfadoxin-
pyrimethamin; (iii) prevention andtreatment o fHIV/AIDS: condoms, ARV; Nevirapin; (iv) Treatment o f diarrhoea:
oral rehydratation salt; (v) Treatment o f tuberculosis andleprosies; (vi) mass treatment o f schistosomiasis and
onchocerchiasis; (vii) treatment o f epidemics; (viii) vaccines and immunization materials.


                                                                                                                  29

among regions and among different levels o f care; (iv) the implementation o f a contractual
approach that will be applied to central directorates, regional and districts teams, autonomous
hospitals, NGOs and private sector providers and insurers in view to better connect resources
used to results and to increase the absorptive capacity at operational level; and (vi) the
identification o f an agency that will assist the MOH inaccreditation, purchasing and monitoring
contracts with NGOs andprivate sector providers.

     Improving decentralization, accountability, and greater partnerships with communities as
well as local governments: The program will support: (i)                  the implementation o f the new legal
framework governing community participation with the objectives to broaden their role beyond
cost recovery and make them functional; (ii) creation o f health management committees (set
                                                          the
up by the 1996 decentralization law) that are supposed to coordinate budgetary allocations and
service delivery in health districts; (iii) promotion o f social accountability measures, in
                                                      the
particular through participatory planning and budgeting and mandatory mechanisms for
disclosure of information regarding resources transfened from the central government; (iv) the
strengthening o f local governments capacity, in particular with respect to the recruitment and
management o f technical staff and the subsequent allocation o f financial resources; (v) the
strengthening o f mechanisms enhancing the multi-sectoral policy dialogue such as water,
sanitation, nutrition or actions to control infectious diseases and improve maternal and child
health; and (vi) the reinforcement o f operational financial management, procurement and human
resources management units that are responsible for preparing, monitoring and evaluating
expenditures.

     Strengthening the monitoring system of the health sector: The PRSC will help build the
national statistical capacity especially at lower tiers of the health system. It will ensure that the
health information management system becomes hlly operational26and that it integrates the
different networks (hospital information system, financial and personnel information system,
etc.) at district, regional and national levels. It should collect timely data (on resources, outputs
and outcomes but also on policies andinstitutional performance) so that the sector performance
can be monitored and analyzed over time. The PRSC program will also provide support to
conducting participatory semi annual monitoring exercises o f budget andperformance notably in
health districts and to increase collaboration with the national statistical agency that will be
responsible for the carrying-out o f targeted surveys (DHS, Public Expenditure Tracking Survey,
 etc.).

 ExpectedResultsof the PRSCProgram

 82.       By the end o f PRSC program (PRSC I,PRSC I1andPRSC 111) Senegal expects to pave
 the way towards the achievement o f PRSP and MDGs targets through increased utilization of a
package o fbasic healthservices including the following:

           0    Better coverage of immunization, infectious diseases control and nutrition activities,
                notably o f children andwomen;


            0   Increasedutilization o freproductivehealth services;

 all districts and at central level andtrained indata collection and analysis


                                                                                                               30

          0    Increased PHC services utilization rate;


          0    Reallocation of expenditures to pro-poor and cost effective interventions and
               underserved areas;


          0    Increasednumber ofhealth districts fully functioning ina decentralized manner.

Progress and Prior Actions -PRSC I

83.       To attain these results, Senegal has already implemented a first round o f reforms. The
sequencing approach supported by the PRSC program has privileged an initial focus on the
institutional and strategic fiamework. The Government has appointed a multisectoral committee
to develop the second phase of the health sector strategy that was presented to the mainpartners
operating in this sector.           Concurrently, as a first step towards improved human resources
management, the Government has started to revise the norms of allocation of health personnel,
and launch the design of a medium-term recruitment plan. The human resource management
directorate and the health information management system unit recently created will be made
operational and staff in key positions, both at central and regional levels, will be selected or
confirmed and that the decree organizing health districts will be published. An assessment of
outreach activities currently implemented has been carried-out and an action plan drafted for
strengthening this strategy. In order to enhance the role o f the private sector in health service
delivery inurbanand rural areas, a diagnostic study has been conducted to assess the strengths of
the current market elaborating on the size o f institutions, ownerships, projected growth rates,
financial     status, as well as to identify areas for development of more effective public/ private
partnership. A contracting policy has been designed by the authorities. The reproductive health
policy has been revised putting greater emphasis on the availability o f skilled birth attendants,
access to emergency obstetric care including improved referral mechanisms, the improvement of
family planning, and support to youth and adolescent health services. A joint immunization
coverage survey has been conducted and an action plan adopted in order to sustain the
improvements noticed in the past two years. Such actions have been completed by a series of
analytical work and action plans that should pave the way for fuller reforms inthe PRSC I1and
PRSC-111.


84.        A selectedset o fthe above activities are consideredprior actions ofPRSC I:

           0    Prepare the second phase of the health sector policy PNDS 2004-2008;

        0  Achieve the implementation o f the health information management system in all
           sanitary districts.

Possible monitoring actions and triggers underPRSC I1and 111

85.     During, the course o f 2005, the Government will continue to improve access and
utilization o f basic health services through the strengthening o f outreach activities, the
implementation of its infrastructure development plan, and the implementation o f the regulatory
and legal framework for private health service provision and fimding in the sector. Continuous
actions will be undertaken to ensure additional progress inthe prevention o f infectious diseases
and in the utilization o f reproductive health services. On the institutional front, a new strategy
will be identified to re deploy staff inregions where the needs are the most severe, and health
committees as well as health management committees will be created or strengthened in
accordance with the regulations governing their mandates and composition.            The financial
management andprocurement capacity will be reinforcedwith the creation o f specialized units at
the decentralized levels. Lastly, the authorities will continue their efforts to improve the quality
o f monitoring o f the health sector performance, including in collecting data as well as in
measuring the quality o fhealth services throughout the country.

86.      The following triggers could be considered for PRSC 11:

         0 Initiate the implementation o f an incentive package to attract health personnel in
           underserved andisolated areas;


         0 Increase the DTC3 immunization coverage to at least 80 percent in2005.

         0 Adopt and implement the MTEF aiming at improving coverage o f underserved areas
           with essential healthservices;

         0 Produce statistical reports for years 2003 and 2004 as well as for the first semester o f
            2005 on the basis o f the data collected from the health information management
            system (SIG).

87.      The PRSC I11is expected to strengthen the Government's efforts aimed at improving
healthinfrastructure andthe allocation o fhuman and financial resources toward the regions.

Monitoring Indicators

 88.     For consistency, the PSRC proposes to use most o f the indicators that have been selected
by the Government (and partners) for assessing the implementation o f the PRSP. These
indicators attempt to capture progress in basic health indicators as well as the Government's
commitment in the allocation o f its spending toward this sector. They principally focus on
processes and outputs, rather than outcomes, because o f the short-term horizon o f the proposed
PRSC program. However, they should be viewed as leading indicators for outcome indicators,
including those defined inthe MDGs. For example, an increase inthe immunization coverage o f
children (output) should be closely correlated to subsequent improvements inthe child mortality
rate (outcome). They include:




                                                                                                  32

       0   Increase the DTC3 immunization coverage from 70 percent in 2003 to at least 75
           percent in2004 and at least 80 percent in2005 and2006;

       0   Increase the proportion of births assisted delivery by skilled health personnel
           increases from 54 percent in2003 to 65 percent in2006;

       0   Increase the rate of visits inprimary heath post from 46 percent in 2003 to 50 percent
           in2004, topercent in2005 andto 54percent in2006;

       0   Increase the execution rate of budget allocated to the health sector from 83 percent in
           2003 to 87 percent in2004 and 90 percent in2005.

        D.      AREAS FOCUSTOBEGRADUALLY
                        OF                              INTRODUCEDINPRsc PROGRAM

PromotingWealth Creation

89.    Wealth creation is the first pillar of the PRSP and, already benefits from the full support
of the World Bank's through a series of programs and operations. As summarized in Box 5,
most (but not all) areas defined by the Government's PRS are already well covered by donors'
assistance. For this reason, this pillarwill only receive marginal attention inPRSC I.

                          Box5: World Bank's Assistanceto Wealth Creation




                                                                                                33

90.      Yet, most stakeholders, including the Government, feel that it is important not to preempt
PRSC support in favor of this pillar by excluding it upfront from the agenda. The PRSC can
complement the existing efforts in two ways. First, it could provide support by focusing o n
specific areas that have not been adequately covered by donors. Second, the PRSC can act as a
catalyst and help deepen andcoordinate efforts inprivate sector development, notably throughits
cross-sectional agenda. Based on these criteria, two areas were identified for PRSC support,
which are described above.

91.      Improving the justice system. As emphasized in the PRSP, a better environment for
justice will not only promote economic growth but also favor the development of a more
equitable distribution of wealth within the country. Aware of the deficiencies in the current
system,*' the Government has been preparing a sectoral strategy that calls for a long-term
capacity building program that would be implemented through a sector expenditure program,
based on qualitative and quantitative targets, financed by the national budget. The objectives o f
this program would include improved performance of commercial courts, accelerated processing
of cases and availingjudgments to the general public to enhance consistency and transparency.
This programwould also expand access to courts andthus greater empowerment ofthe poor.

 92.     Strengthening thefunctioning of the labor market. Employment creation i s an essential
trait of the Senegalese growth strategy. The poor h c t i o n i n g o f the labor market is source of
 concern for policy makers because it contributes to hinder private sector growth as well as to
maintain unemployment and under-employment at relatively highlevels. Also, as emphasized in
 the recent Poverty Assessment, poverty is associated with unemployment and low quality
 employment, hence the high priority that the population puts on creating employment
 opportunities. The issue of competitive labor costs was also raised prominently in the recent
 Integrated Trade framework studyg and in the recent investment climate investment survey of
 about 300 firms operating in Senegal. It emerged from these studies that average labor earnings
 inSenegal are among the highest inSub-Saharan Africa, about 2-3 times higher than inUganda,
 Zambia and Eritrea for low skilled labor. The Government has initiated a strategy with the
 objective to improve the functioning of the labor market. The PRSC can support this strategy by
 focusing on three aspects:

          0   The PRSC can promote changes inthe legal environment, which remains problematic
              for many firms operating in Senegal, especially lay off procedures and the costs of
              retren~hment.~'The Government has prepared a series of Decrees that should help
              make the labor market more flexible in specific activities such as tourism and call
              centers. Concurrently, a new draft Labor Code is being prepared under the auspice of
              the OHADA;



 28Recent surveys have indicated that only a marginal fraction ofprivate firms trust the Senegalesejudicial system,
 and several recent diagnostics have emphasized the lack ofresources, bothfinancial andhuman, allocatedto this
 sector. Inthe 2004 budget, less than 1.5 percent oftotal government expenditures have beenallocatedto the
 MinistryofJustice.
 29See inparticular, chapter 2.
 30Infirms' survey conductedbyFIASin2002, issuesrelatedto the labor legislation appearto beaissuefor about
 50percent of firms, which about the same levelthan for the financial sector legislation, less than for the land legal
 framework but more than for importiexport rules.


                                                                                                                     34

          0      The PRSC can help promote labor skills in Senegal as comparatively to other African
                 countries the share of employees with no education i s high and the share of workers
                 with technical training is            The recent RPED survey reveals that vocational
                 training is systematically underused in Senegal, principally by employees of small
                 andmedium firms. The Government has beenmovingtoward addressingthese issues
                 byproducinga sectoral strategy for professionaltraininginSenegal;

          0      It can facilitate access to labor opportunities, especially inrural areas, through better
                 information and partnerships withthe private sector. Informational deficiencies inthe
                 workingofthe labor market inSenegal is mostly apparent throughthe relativelyhigh
                 number of days that a private firm has to spend to find a production worker, on
                 average up to 8 weeks. A s a result, most firms have to rely on informal networks
                 such as fiiends and relatives, which are not always the most transparent channels and
                 are   sources of asymmetries between firms -foreign                      firms being clearly
                 di~advantaged.~~The lack o f efficacy o f public and private placement offices has
                 been raised by a majority of employers and employees operating inthe country.

93.       For both areas of the wealth creation pillar described above, the support provided by the
PRSC will be sequential. First, the Government's commitment, while genuine, still needs to be
defined in terms o f specific policy reforms. Second, these areas are politically sensitive and
reforms might be delayed by vested interests. Lastly, their rapid inclusion might make more
difficult the task of monitoringover PRSC progress in other priority areas. For these reasons,
PRSC Iwill only accompany the Government in defining and agreeing o n action plans. Then,
and only if substantial progress will have occurred, subsequent PRSCs will broaden their
coverage to include policy actions inthe areas of labor andjustice.

94.       Expected Results. Throughthe sequencing approach described above, the PRSC program
can be expected to achieve the following:

           0     Consolidate consensus aroundlabor reforms;

           0     Increase fimding and coverage of labor training, notably through public-private
                 partnerships, leading to higher skilled workers;

           0     Provide more flexibility to labor markets ina few strategic areas;

           0     Speed up processing of cases inthejudicial system;

           0     Increase access and the quality ofthe judicial system by strengthening the capacity o f
                 the Ministry of Justice andtribunals byrecruiting additional staff.

95.        Focus during PRSC I. In these two areas, PRSC Ionly seeks to support on going
analytical work and the establishment o f comprehensive action plans. In the labor area, the

31 For example, the share o f employees with no education equals 8 percent inSenegal against percent inUganda.
Workers with techcal training represent about 14percent of the total workforce inSenegal against more than 25
   ercent inUganda andKenya (Source: WED surveys).
   According to the latest investment climate survey, more than 60 percent o f employees report to find theirjob
through friends andrelatives.


                                                                                                                 35

authorities are expected to develop new strategies for the promotion o f labor in rural areas as
well as the reform o f professional training. On justice, the recently proposed sectoral strategy
should be validated and translated into a concrete action plans for the short to medium terms.
The recruitment strategy defined over the period 2003-05 endorsed by the IMF should be
pursued with the recruitment of magistrates, clerks and administrative staff in the Ministry o f
Justice.
96.      Possible actions to be undertaken under PSRC11and III. Senegal has completed the first
round o freforms inthe labor market, which should be considered as triggers for inclusion o f this
pillar inthe PRSC program. These triggers should include the approval and implementation o f
the sectoral strategy for vocational training, and the development o f training activities through
the Fund for vocational Training (FONDES). Inthe justice area, the triggers should emphasize
the validation and the initial implementation o f the sectoral strategy, the creation o f a
coordinating policy unit within the Ministry o f Justice, and the strengthening o f the Commission
Nationale contre la Corruption that should become fully operational.

97.       Monitoring indicators. The following indicators could be used to monitor progress over
time inlabor andjustice areas:33

          0   Unemployment would be reduced from 16percent in2001 to 15 percent in2006;

          0    Share o fpublic fundingallocatedto training programs will increase (to be defined);

          0   The share o f Government resources allocated to the Ministry o f Justice will increase
               from 1percent in2003 to 1.3 percent in2004 and2.0 percent in2005 and2006;

          0   Number o f new recruitment in the Ministry o f Justice reached at least 550 in 2004
               and2005.

ProtectingVulnerableGroups

98.       Vulnerable groups are numerous anddiverse inSenegal, including children, handicapped,
elderly, and r e h g e e ~ .The   ~ ~ PRSP emphasized the need o f improving the lives o f vulnerable
groups and prescribes actions to ensure that these groups are effectively able to benefit from
wealth creation and access to social services. The broad PRSP strategy in this area is to: (a)
improve the social status o f vulnerable and marginalized groups; (b) facilitate the access o f
indigent populations to basic services, infrastructure and facilities, (c) implement wealth-creating
programs adapted to the situation of these target groups; and (d) promote community
development.

communities


                                                                                                                 36

99.    Given the importance of protecting vulnerable groups in the medium-term poverty
reduction strategy, several donors have begun to give more attention to this area.          As
summarized in Box 6, the World Bank has carried out several activities that target explicitly
vulnerable groups in Senegal. There should also be positive impacts on vulnerable groups of
general improvements in other areas supported by the PSRC, such as health service delivery and
deconcentratiod decentralization ofresources to local levels. However, the latest PRSPprogress
report concludes that the existing supports remain inadequate. The biggest gaps in the support
provided to vulnerable groups are in (a) developing a coherent and integrated social protection
strategy targeting, including targeting methodology and monitoring and evaluation; (b)
development o f demand-side programs ad policies to ensure access andutilization o fbasic social
services by the poorest; (c) mechanisms to plan and evaluate the transfer o f Government
resources to vulnerable groups and to rationalize public expenditure in these areas; (d) design
and application ofriskmanagement measures; and (e) definition o f an adequate legal framework
to protect vulnerable groups.

100. The PRSC program is expected to provide support to the Government's objective of
improving the protection of vulnerable groups. However, this support will be sequential and
selective over time. The rationale for such a gradual approach is that the Government is still in
the process o f making its strategy toward vulnerable groups operational, by defining coherent
national strategies, developing structures and capacities at the local levels, and piloting new
approaches.




                                                                                              37

101.    Expected Results. Through the sequencing approach described above, the PRSC program
can be expected to achieve the following:

        0  Increase access to risk management instruments and social protection measures;

        0  Improve the identification, targeting and monitoring and evaluation of actions to
           improve the lives o fvulnerable groups, bothinrural andurbanareas;

        0  Facilitate access of vulnerable groups to basic services (in complement to broad
            sectoral strategies);

        0   Ensure equitable access and adequate legal framework for vulnerable groups;

        0   Reinforce efficient mechanisms to provide resources to vulnerable groups.

102.    Focus during PRSC I. Inthe first phase, PRSC Iwill mainly support the development of
strategies and instruments needed to improve the coherence and effectiveness o f the actions and
programs proposed for vulnerable groups in the PRSP.             The Govemment will develop an
updated profile of vulnerability and targeting methodologies needed to reach vulnerable groups,
designed selected demand-side programs to facilitate access to basic social services, draft
proposals to revise the legal framework of protections for vulnerable groups, and identified best
practice approaches in transferring resources to vulnerable groups.         Since there are several
activities already underway, PRSC Iwill also help ensure that incremental HIPC funds support
some o f the activities prescribed inthe vulnerable groups pillars o fthe PRSP.

103.    Possible actions to be undertuken under PRSC 11and III. Senegal will have realized a
number of actions that will be considered as triggers for inclusion of this area in the PRSC
program. At this stage, several key activities have been identified from the set of measures
included in the PRSP but final design of triggers will rely on finalization o f the analytical and
preparatory work carried out in PRSC I.It is however proposed that the following triggers be
included:

        0   Adopt a coherent and integrated social protection strategy towardthe most vulnerable
            groups identified inthe PRSP;

        0   Develop a list o f quantitative indicators to be included inthe annual monitoringof the
            PRSP;

        0   Finalize the public expenditure review with an emphasis on vulnerable groups and
            agree on a set of priority actions designed to improve the efficiency of public
            spending on vulnerable groups.

104.    Monitoring Indicators. Based on the indicators developed by the PRSP and others, the
following indicators could be used to evaluate progress over time:

        0   Increase in the composite index measuring access to basic social services by poorest
            deciles households (as defined inthe PSRP);

        0   Percentage o f working children between 5-15 years will be reduced (to be
            determined);



                                                                                                 38

            Severe underweight among children will be reduced from 19.1 percent in 2001 to 17
            percent in2005, and 15 percent in2006;

            Increase in the share HIPC resources allocated to rural areas andor vulnerable
            groups;

        0   Increased coverage o fpublic programs reachingvulnerable groups.

                        VI.     IMPLEMENTATIONOF THE PRSC

105.    The series o f PRSCs is intended to be synchronized with Government's budget cycle.
PRSC-I is put in place and disbursed on the basis o f the up-front completion o f a set o f prior
actions that demonstrate satisfactory progress o f the country's social and structural reform
agenda in support o f its poverty reduction strategy. Then, as part o f the rolling medium-term
program framework, each subsequent operation will build on the previous one; its prior actions
will be formulated and agreed upon drawing on the progress towards benchmarks laid out at the
outset. Within this framework, this section highlights a series o f triggers that could be used
against PRSC-11. It also provided a description o f the institutional framework as well as a
summaryo fthe mainbenefits andrisks associated with the PSRC approach inSenegal.



106.    As noted inthe previous chapter, Senegal has achieved before presentation o f PRSC Ito
the Board, several key program benchmarks in the areas o f fiduciary reforms, decentralization,
and the delivery o f health services. The decision as to whether IDA will proceed with PRSC I1
will be contingent on satisfactory progress inthe implementationo fthe PRS, as documented by a
review by stakeholders reviewed o f the PRS progress report in 2005.              Progress in the
implementation o f the PRS includes implementation and continuation o f reforms spelled out in
the letter o f development policy, Schedule 1. Inaddition, actions satisfactory to IDA inthe three
priority areas will serve as triggers for proceeding with PRSC 11. The triggers presented below
are indicative andtheir compliance will form the basis o f whether the Bankwill proceedwith the
subsequent operation. Inthe case that these actions are not met, the Bank could either delay the
operation, or reduce the amount or modify the program, where justified. In accordance with the
sequential approach proposed earlier, IDA support under PRSC I1could be broaden to cover two
additional areas o f the PRS --wealth creation and vulnerable groups-- depending on satisfactory
progress. While triggers for deciding whether the Bank will be involved inthese two areas will
be identifiedlater duringthe preparationo fthe PSRC, anindicative list is summarized inBox 7.

                       B.     INSTITUTIONALAND COORDINATIONASPECTS

107.    The Government's strategy has emphasized the need to obtain visible results over time.
Evaluating and monitoring the performance realized in key sectors is at the center o f the PRSP,
and was identified as its fourth pillar.       With this objective in mind, the Government has
established an institutional framework, including the inter-ministerial Committee chaired by the
PrimeMinister, a steering Committee chaired by the Minister o f Finance and Economy, and the
CelZule de Suivi (CSPLP), which is used simultaneously as a coordinating body and as the
Secretariat. The CSPLP is linked to line Ministries and Governmental agencies through focal
points or institutions that havebeen identifiedinaccordance with the PRSPpriority areas. At the
regional level, several committees (headed by the Governor) have been created and are
supervised by the CSPLP. This institutional framework has been enactedby an inter-ministerial
decree and has been h c t i o n i n g for over one year, with the support o f the main development
partners inthe country.

108.    The implementation o f the PRSC program (PRSC Iand PRSC 11)will rely on the above
institutional framework, with only one exception, which consists inthe creation o f five working
groups. These groups have already been constituted and are consistent with the main areas
defined in the PRSC program: (i)         budgetary and human reforms; (ii) services, (iii)
                                                                                   health
decentralization; (iv) vulnerable groups; and (v) wealth creation (with two sub-groups articulated
around the labor reforms andthejustice). For each o f these working groups, three representatives
have been designed: one for the main technical Ministry or agency; one for the Ministry o f
Economy and Finance, one for the World Bank's team. Each group is responsible, under the
supervision of the CSPLP, to finalize the action plan in terms o f objectives/measures/indicators
that will be included in the PRSC Iand PRSC II.They will also be in charge to monitor and
supervise implementation over time.

109. Using the PRSP institutional framework offers three main advantages for the
implementation o f the PRSC program. First, it provides a monitoring system that has already
been explicitly integrated into the Government planning and budgeting exercises on an annual



                                                                                                    41

basis. Second, it already counts on the participation o f main development partners, including the
private sector, NGOs, and donors. Last but not least, it avoids creating new institutions, which
are already numerous in Senegal.

110.    PRSC X and PRSC X I should be aligned to the budgetary cycle in Senegal, facilitating
therefore their integration within the State budget preparation andexecution.

               C.      CREDITADMINISTRATION,MONITORINGEVALUATION AND

111.    Credit Administration. The borrower is the Republic o f Senegal. A single tranche credit
of SDR20.5 million (US$30 million equivalent) would be made available upon credit
effectiveness, anticipated for January 2005.       The closing date o f the operation would be
December 31, 2005. It is envisaged that PRSC I1will support the implementation of the PRS in
FY06.

112.    The credit will follow IDA'S simplified disbursement procedures for adjustment
operations. Disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases, and no procurement
requirements are needed Credit proceeds will be made available for disbursement upon
effectiveness. The Government will open an account in local currency with the regional central
bank BCEAO. Uponnotification ofrelease of the tranche, IDAwill deposit the proceeds inthis
account in CFA francs when requested to do so by the government. If, once deposited with the
central bank, withdrawals are used for ineligible purposes (i.e., to finance goods or services on
the standard negative list), IDA will require the government to refund the amount to the credit
account or directly to IDA. The Minister o f Finance ensures that withdrawals from the account
are only made for budgeted expenditure excluding those on the negative list. Status reports on
the account are available throughtreasury account statements.

 113.   The following summarizes the external audits:

        0   Deposit account: At IDA'S request and within six months of credit and grant
            disbursement, the deposit account will be independently audited on terms o f reference
            acceptable to IDA;


        0   Public (Government) accounts: The General Audit Office (Cow des comptes) is
            required by law to produce his annual report on the public accounts to parliament
            with the loi des r2glements by the end of the year following the execution of the
            budget. A copy of this report andthe public accounts attached should be submitted to
            IDA;

         0  BCEAO: The annual entity financial statements of the BCEAO, audited in
            accordance with International Auditing Standards promulgated by the International
            FederationofAccountants, are publicly available.

 114.    These controls are intended to provide assurance that IDA funds have arrived at their
 intended destination and are being used for their intended purpose o f funding budgeted public
 expenditures, subject to the borrower's rules andregulations.

 115.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The quality of Senegal's monitoringand evaluation system
 in the Ministry of Economy and Finance is relatively good even though line Ministries are



                                                                                                42

handicapped by outdated information system and weak management structures. Improving the
monitoring o f public spending is one o f the key objectives o f the PRSC and has been placed at
the center o f the CFAA action plan. Output indicators for the PRSC are currently tracked
through the national statistics system coordinated by the Minister o f Economy andFinance, and
many will appear in the PRSC. But, reporting is inconsistent across ministries and overtime.
Another source o f information consists o f the recent household survey.                  It will be used to
establish a baseline for key outcome indicators for the PRSP progress report and the PRSC. It
will be updated by smaller surveys every two years. The specific monitoring and evaluation
activities under the proposed PRSC will be based on, andreinforce, the mechanisms, which have
been designed for the PRSP. The proposed institutional framework to monitor the
implementation o fthe actions proposed within the PRSC is described inChart-1.

                                  D.     ENVIRONMENT       SUSTAINABILITY

116.    The proposed PRSC Ihas been classified by the PRSC working group as structural
adjustment credit (SAC) governed under the Operational Directive 8.60, and does not require an
environmental assessment rating. In view o f the current donors' assistance, and for selectivity
purposes, the first series o fPSRCs will not include specific support to environment.

117.     The World Bank has a long history o f supporting the Government in its effort to protect
the environment (Box 8).           Senegal is confronted with two main environmental issues: (i)
degradation o f its natural capital (soil, forest cover, fisheries, biodiversity), and (ii)          pollution
from poorly regulated industries, mainly around Dakar. Both these issues have direct linkages
with poverty since the degradation o f natural reduces undermines rural livelihoods, while
pollution from unregulated industries affects the health o f neighboring communities, andinsome
instances directly degrades the resource base. To addressthese issues, the Government prepared
a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in 1993-1997, which provided a conceptual
framework for environmental management and the creation o f an inter-ministerial council for
environmental issues (CONSERE)35. Senegal also passed a new Environmental Act on January
 15, 2001, including provisions for the use of Environmental Impact Assessments (EUI).~~ The
PRSP has given significant attention to environmental issues, especially by requiring additional
support to: (i)  the protection and development o f forests and watersheds, (ii)           implementation o f
development and agro-forestry programs.




35 The Bank hadprepared a CountryEnvironment Strategy Paper in 1994. An IDF grant from the World Bank
 supportedthe preparation o f the NEAP. However, preparationo f a follow-up project was hampered by a perceived
lack of conlmitment by Government to provide counterpart resources required to implement the NEAP.
 36The Bank supported the dissemination ofthe new environmental Act through a consultant Trust Fundin2001-
 2002.



                                                                                                             43

                         Box 8: Donors' Assistance to the Environment Sector




                                      E.      BENEFITSAND RISKS

118.   Expected benefits o f the PRSCs are: (i)     improved living conditions for Senegalese; (ii)
enhanced ownership and hctionality for the Government in policy planning and budget
management; and (iii)    a more efficient and effective form of development assistance.           In
addition, a multi-sectoral approach would promote coordination and collaboration within the
Government and among donors, and lead toward a comprehensive approach to the delivery of
basic social services.

119.   The main risks to this credit and the reform program it supports can be summarized as
follows. While the risk of macroeconomic collapse, through unsustainable inflation or through
sustained negative growth, i s minimal, there is the more insidious risk of stalled growth and/or
vulnerability to extemal shocks, such the 2002 drought when GDP growth declined to 1.1
percent or the recent locust invasion. By contrast, there is a diminishing risk of escalation of the
conflict in Southem Casamance region as shown by recent progress, including the planned
support o f several donors. There is also the possibility that some of the reforms supported by the
credit might encounter resistance from vested interests andor political indecisiveness, especially
given the political cycle in Senegal with legislative elections in 2006 and presidential ones in
2007. Such risks became apparent with some governmental spending irregularities in 2003 (but
came to light in June 2004), which were subsequently remedied by a series of actions by the
authorities. Since these actions are at the center of the PRSC program, they should help mitigate
these risks by focusing from the start on budgetary and financial reforms and lead to
improvements in transparency and accountability of national budget systems. Such an emphasis
benefits from the support of the donor community,                increasing leverage toward the
implementation o f these reforms.      Furthermore, the Government has tried to build broad
consensus for reforms throughconsultative processes, including the civil society anddonors.



                                                                                                  44

120.   There is also the risk that progress in the capacity of local Government fails to
materialize as fast as anticipated even though the authorities have been allocating increasing
resources to this objective, especially in their PRS. The relatively mixed performance of the
health sector over the past few years justifies its inclusion inthe PRSC approach as, based on the
lessons learnt, it will attempt to address cross-cutting issues such as financial and human
resources management. However, this approach also lies on the implementation o f the new
sectoral strategy, which is currently designed with the support o fthe donors' community.

121.   Lastly, as mentioned earlier, Senegal is inits preparatory phase of designing its strategies
inthe labor andjustice areas aswell asinthe protection ofvulnerable groups. While momentum
has been created, notably throughthe implementation of the PRS, challenges remain. The PRSC
approach attempts to account for these challenges by proposing a sequencing approach inPRSC
IandaselectionoftriggersfortheeventualinclusionoftheseareasinsubsequentPRSCs.

1.0     Etat de mise en ceuvre du document de strategie de reduction de la pauvretk

L e DSRP initiee par le Gouvemement repose sur 4 piliers: (i)          crkation de la richesse; (ii)
renforcement des capacites et promotion des services de base; (iii)     amelioration des conditions
de vie des groupes vulnkrables; et (iv) suivi de la mise en ceuvre et kvaluation. Cette section
rappelle les dkveloppements dans chacun de ces piliers en 2003, sur la base du demier rapport
d'avancement du DSRP, et indique l'kvolution en matikre de financement des principales
activitks ainsi que les principaux rksultats obtenus en termes d'indicateurs socio-kconomiques.

1.1     CrCation de la richessedans un cadre macroeconomiquesain

Secteurpublic

1.      Comme il a kte soulignk dans le DSRP, la stabilitk macroeconomique constitue un
element essentiel pour toute strategie visant  a favoriser une croissance kconomique durable. Pour
rendre efficace l'intervention de l'Etat, les actions du gouvemement se concentrent sur les
domaines suivants: (a) le cadre juridique et judiciaire; (b) le financement; (c) l a simplification
des prockdures bureaucratiques et l'augmentation de la transparence; (d) l a libtralisation du
commerce et des prix et la promotion de la concurrence; (e) la privatisation; (0 l a lkgislation du
travail; (g) la reforme de I'administration publique; (h) la politique fiscale et la gestion des
ressourcespubliques.

2.      L e budget 2003 a ete execute dans l'ensemble de manikre satisfaisante. L a budgktisation
de 2003 s'est dkroulee dans un contexte de reformes sectorielles et structurelles pour les besoins
de la mise en m v r e du DSRP. En matike de depenses publiques, le taux d'execution a ktk
relativement satisfaisant, avoisinant 70%. L a pression fiscale enregistrke a atteint 18,3% avec
une collecte des ressources fiscales qui s'est rkvklte supkrieure aux attentes.        Elle a permis
d'atteindre le niveau de recettes fiscales envisage dans le scenario optimiste, en depit d'une
mobilisation des ressources du DSRP, pourtant moins forte que prevue. Cependant, le
financement des d6penses d'investissement public sur ressources internes, par rapport aux
recettes fiscales, a dkpassk les efforts attendus dans le scknario moyen (24,4% contre 22,6%). Ce
ratio ne tient pas compte des dkpenses likes a I'initiative PPTE. L a masse salariale a et6
contenue a 30,1% des recettes fiscales, soit unpoint de plus que le scenario optimiste duDSFW.

Promotion du SecteurPrive`

3.      L e gouvernement du Sknegal, ayant identifie le secteur privk comme moteur de la
croissance et de la crkation d'emplois, entend promouvoir celui-ci.             Pour une meilleure
promotion de ce secteur, 1'Agence de Promotion des Investissements et des grands travaux
(APIX) veille, outre les deux fonctions d'assistance        la creation d'entreprise et de gestion de
l'octroi des avantages fiscaux et douaniers du Guichet Unique actuel (en attendant l'adoption du
droit commun incitatif), sur les activitks de promotion du Sknegal dans les marchks kmetteurs de
capitaux, d'organisation de rencontres au Sknkgal et a I'etranger, entre investisseurs residents et
nonrksidents, ainsi que pour lapromotiondes exportations.

4.      Dans le domaine du commerce, le gouvernement poursuit la libkralisation des kchanges
commerciaux, le renforcement des capacites de nkgociations commerciales internationales, la
promotion des exportations et le respect des rkgles de la concurrence. Les organes responsables
de la mise en valeur du secteur sont: 1'Office de Promotion des Exportations, 1'Agence de
Rkgulation des Marchks, la Commission Nationale de la Concurrence et I'Equipement du
Laboratoire de la Direction du Commerce Intkrieur.

5.      Au cours de I'annke 2003, diverses actions ont ktk conduites afin d'amkliorer
l'environnement des affaires et la competitivitk de l'economie sknkgalaise. L e gouvemement
s'est rksolument engage Q accklerer les rkformes de la filikre arachidikre et des secteurs des
tklkcommunications et de l'knergie, ainsi que la privatisation des entreprises publiques de son
portefeuille rksiduel. L a politique du gouvernement dans la filikre arachidike a et6 dkfinie dans
la Lettre de Politique de Dkveloppement de la Filiere Arachide (LPDFA) adoptee en mai 2003.
Cette politique poursuit 1'approfondissement et la consolidation de la politique de libkralisation
mise en oeuvre. L e processus de privatisation de la SONACOS qui s'inscrit dans ce cadre a
dkmarrk l e 31 juillet 2003 par une demande de manifestation d'intkret lancke a travers la presse
nationale et internationale.

6.      Dans le cadre de l'amklioration du climat des affaires, le Sknkgal         l'instar des pays
membres de I'OHADA (1'Organisation pour 1'Harmonisation en Afiique du Droit des Affaires),
poursuit les rkformes et approuve les actes pour le renforcement de la dkmocratie, de 1'Etat de
droit et de la gouvernance en vue d'activer la diffusion des textes de I'Organisation. Egalement,
l'allegement des formalitks de crkation d'entreprises a bknkficik des efforts de concertation
permanente avec les partenaires. Outre l'objectif d'harmonisation du droit des affaires, le
Sknkgal, A travers le Comitk de Rkforme juridique (CRJ, 1998), entend promouvoir les
prockdures d'arbitrage pour rksoudre les conflits, et amkliorer la formation des juges et leurs
auxiliaires. Par ailleurs,     les initiatives du gouvemement pour allkger les lourdeurs
administratives et fiscales, larentabilitk et la stabilitk du systkme bancaire senkgalais, etc. sont de
nature  a amkliorer l'environnement des affaires. Enmatikre fiscale, les autoritks ont poursuivi la
mise en oeuvre des rkformes initikes en 2000 avec l'adoption d'un nouveau Code des
Investissements, une rkduction du taux de l'impbt sur les sociktks, et la rationalisationdu rkgime
fiscal des petites et moyennes entreprises. L a crkation d'un imp& synthktique pour les PME,
libkratoire de l'impbt sur le revenu, la TVA et lapatente, aura unimpact positif important pour la
promotion du secteur privk.

7.      Notons qu'a la faveur des initiatives nees de l'alternance politique du 19 mars 2000, le
Gouvemement du Sknkgal a formellement sollicitk Standard & Poor's par la signature d'une
lettre d'agrkment pour initier le processus de notation rkgulikre de la qualite durisque souverain.
L e premier rksultat est disponible depuis le mois de dkcembre 2000. L'agence a attribuk sur la
pkriode 2000-2004, la note a B+/Stable/B       B.L a notation a court terme est <(BD. Lanote long
terme  (<B+)) signifie que lepayspeut faire face a ses engagements.

8.       Ence qui conceme le secteur des tklkcommunications, aprks la libkralisation du segment
de la tklkphonie mobile qui a induit une baisse sensible des coots de communication et favorisk
le dkveloppement de l'accks au tklkphone, les efforts se sont concentrks sur la finalisation du
processus de privatisation de I'opkrateur historique, en l'occurrence la SONATEL, avec la
libkralisation du tklkphone fixe, aprks une filialisation de son activitk portant sur la tklkphonie
cellulaire.

9.      Quantau processusde mise en auvre de larkforme du secteur de I'knergie, une nouvelle
etape vient d'etre fianchie avec l'adoption par le gouvemement des options de structuration du
secteur, ouvrant la voie pour de nouvelles avancees, en particulier le dkmarrage des travaux de
renforcement des capacitks de production thermique de la SENELEC et la selection d'un
producteur indkpendant en vue d'augmenter de 60 MW la capacitk de production d'electricitk a
partir de septembre 2005.

1.2     Renforcement des capacitCset promotion des services sociaux de base

10.     L e dkveloppement des ressources humaines est indispensable pour soutenir un
dkveloppement kconomique durable. C'est conscient de la faiblesse du Sknkgal dans ce domaine
que le gouvernement a krige au rangdes premikres prioritks les secteurs de l'kducation de base et
de la santk, et klabork des programmes pour promouvoir leur dkveloppement coherent.             Les
niveaux et les kvolutions des indicateurs de dkpenses de 1'Etat dans ces secteurs, tout en ktant
conformes A la poursuite des efforts pour atteindre les nonnes intemationales (OMS, UNESCO,
etc.), montrent l a volontk manifeste du gouvemement de rkaliser les Objectifs du DSRP et ceux
duMillknaire pour leDkveloppement.

11.     Dans le secteur de l'kducation, l'action du gouvemement est centrke sur les diffkrents
axes dkfinis dans le Programme Dkcennal de 1'Education et de la Formation (PDEF). En effet,
ce programme est un cadre dans lequel1'Etat s'engage Ei developper        ((la composante accbs))de
l'kducation, B amkliorer   <(la composante qualitk de l'enseignement et A prendre des politiques
sectorielles adkquates pour l'atteinte de l'kducation pour tous d'ici a 2015. Ainsi, dans le cadre
de l'accbs a l'kducation de base, les objectifs spkcifiques affichks par le gouvemement sont: (i)
construire suffisamment d'kcoles et salles de classe pour pennettre 9 tous les enfants en Pge
d'aller a l'kcole; (ii)appuyer l'equipement des kcoles klkmentaires existantes en latrines et puits,
et la rkhabilitation des salles de classe dklabrees.

12.     Dans le secteur de la santk, le gouvemement a dkfini des objectifs et des stratkgies basks
sur trois axes prioritaires.     I1 s'agit d'abord de dkvelopper les services de santk A base
communautaire par l a crkation et le renforcement de ces services en zone rurale et pkriurbaine
pour uncoot de 800 millions de FCFA. Parmi ces objectifs, figurent kgalement en bonne place
l'amklioration de l aprkvention et de la lutte contre le V W S I D A et le paludisme, pour uncoot de
33,3 milliards de FCFA. Enfinilest question d'amkliorer la qualitt et l'offie de service de santk
pour un coot de 1,5 milliards de FCFA. Les principaux projets sont: le Plan stratkgique de lutte
contre le SIDA et le Programme de Dkveloppement Intkgrk de l a Santk (PDIS).

13.     L a rkpartition du BCI exprime les efforts consentis A travers les ressources intemes et
extemes pour financer les investissements dans le secteur de l'eau, de l'assainissement et de
l'agriculture qui sont des prioritks de premier ordre du DSRP dans le cadre du renforcement des
capacitks. Ainsi, (a) Pour le secteur de l'eau, ilest envisage d'augmenter la qualitk et le taux
d'accbs a ce service. Les projets phares de ce secteur sont: le Programme Sectoriel de 1'Eau
(PSE), L e Programme de Realisation de Basins de Rktention, le Projet Eau Potable pour Tous et
le Projet d'Appui a la Petite Irrigation Localiske; (b) Dans le domaine de l'assainissement, le
gouvemement poursuit ses actions pour l'amklioration des conditions sanitaires, du cadre de vie
des populations urbaines vivant en zones non assainies par l'accks a des systbmes adkquats; (c)
L e secteur de I'agriculture constitue une prioritk de la politique socio-kconomique du
gouvemement. Celle-ci consiste en l'amklioration de la skcuritk alimentaire, a l a rkalisation

                                                                                      Page4 of 16

d'une croissance kconomique forte, pourvoyeuse d'emplois dkcents et de revenus surtout en
milieurural, principal niddepopulationspauvres.

14.     L e gouvemement, conscient du poids de la population active dans le secteur primaire
(agriculture, klevage et pCche) et de la liaison entre pauvretk et milieu rural (essentiellement
agricole), fait de ce demier une prioritk de toutes ses politiques de dkveloppement. L e budget de
l'agriculture et de l'klevage reprksente une part non nkgligeable du budget de 1'Etat (6% en
moyenne sur la pkriode 2000-2004).         Ainsi, (1) dans le sous secteur agricole, les principaux
projets selon le volume de l'investissement, dkveloppks sont le Programme de Services
Agricoles aux Organisations Paysannes (PSAOP) et le Programme National d'Infiastructures
Rurales (PNIR); (2) dans le sous secteur de l'klevage, on peut dknombrer le Projet d'Appui a
1'Elevage (PAPEL 11), le Projet d'Am6nagement et de Dkveloppement Villageois (PADV), le
Projet d'Appui au Dkveloppement de 1'Apiculture (PADA) et les projets d'amklioration de la
race bovine et de dkveloppement de l'klevage equin; (3) dans le domaine de la pCche, les actions
du gouvemement sont articulkes autour du Programme d'Appui au Secteur de la PCche, le
Programmede Chaine de Froidet le Programmed'Acquisition de 6 vedettes.

Promotion de la bonnegouvernance

15.     Dans le domaine de la gouvemance, le renforcement de la dkmocratie et de 1'Etat de droit,
et l'amklioration des mkcanismes de gestion des finances publiques ont et6 au centre des
prkoccupations des pouvoirs publics tout au long de l'annke 2003. Ainsi, le gouvemement veille
a lapromotion de labonne gouvemance dkmocratique et economique.

16.     L a crkation de la Cour des Comptes en 1999, marque une &ape majeure dans la
promotion du principe de bonne gouvemance et de transparence dans la gestion des affaires
publiques. Elle effectue un contrale efficace comme l'exige les instances de 1'UEMOA. Au
Sknkgal, le r6le d'institution supkrieure de contr6le des finances publiques a $tk dCvolu de 1960 a
1999 a la Cour supreme, puis en 1992 au Conseil d'Etat. L a rkforme constitutionnelle de 1999 a
crkk l'actuelle Cour des comptes qui devient ainsi la quatrikme composante dupouvoirjudiciaire
aux catks du Conseil constitutionnel, du Conseil d'Etat et de la Cour de Cassation.

17.     L a consolidation de la gouvemance Cconomique est un dkfi permanent pour le
gouvemement du Sknkgal dans le contexte de mise en Oeuvre du DSRP, que bon nombre de ses
partenaires ont dkcidk de soutenir a travers des appuis budgktaires, laissant ainsi au
gouvemement la responsabilitk de l'affectation des ressources en fonction de ses prioritks
affichkes.   Cela a comme exigence une obligation de rendre compte beaucoup plus forte, qui
impose la mise en place d'outils et de mkcanismes de gestion budgktaire garantissant la
transparence dans l'utilisation des ressources. Par ailleurs, le gouvemement veille a ces les
critkres de convergence Cconomique de I'UEMOA soient respectks. Ainsi, le Sknkgal arrive a
remplir l'essentiel des huit critkres fixks. Toutefois, en 2004, le critkre sur le solde budgktaire de
base a subi une lkgkre dkgradation. Cette situation est due au report de credits sur les ressources
PPTE affectkes aux secteurs sociaux. Au niveau des critkres de second rang, le dkficit extkrieur
courant hors dons officiel est le seul critere quine pourrait pas stre respect6 en 2005.


adopt6 en 2002, le gouvemement tient a ameliorer durablement la transparence, la fiabilitk et
18.     Dans le cadre du Plan d'action pour le renforcement de la gestion budgktaire (PRGB)

l'efficacitk  de la gestion budgktaire, conformkment aux objectifs du DSRP.                    Aussi,
conformkment aux plans d'action CFAA-CPAR (adoptks en 2003)' au Rapport sur l'Observation

                                                                                      Page5 o f 16

des Normes et Codes (RONC du FMI) et du PRGB, ilmet l'accent sur l a problkmatique de
I'absorption des ressources afin qu'il ait une adkquation entre la reduction de la pauvretk et
I'investissement mis iicet effet.

1.3     AmCliorationdes conditionsdevie des groupes vulnkrables

19.     L'axe stratkgique du DSRP visant B ameliorer les conditions de vie des groupes
vulnkrables n'a pas bknkficik d'activitks substantielles contribuant directement a sa rkalisation.
Cependant, d'importants efforts sont faits pour la prise en compte du financement des activitks
prioritaires.   La pkriode triennale 2003-2005 plus de 10% du financement du programme
d'action prioritaire sont orientks vers ce secteur. Des dispositions prioritaires sont mises en
faveur des << nouveaux vulnkrables        ))issus du naufrage. Des programmes communautaires en
destination des f m i l l e s victimes de la guerre et du naufiage sont en train d'etre mis en place.
Pour la mise en Oeuvre de ce volet du DSRP, des programmes sont en cours et d'importantes
mesures sont prises pour renforcer le soutien aux groupes vulnkrables, et porter le financement B
plus de 1%duPIE3 contre moins de 0,5% en 2003.

1.4      Suivide la miseen oeuvredu DSRP

20.      L a revue du DSRP, rkaliske avec une large participation de l'ensemble des acteurs
(administrations,   partenaires au dkveloppement et sociktk civile),               a permis l'adoption
consensuelle des Plans d'Opkration Rkgionaux (POR) et des Plansd'Op6ration Sectoriels (POS).
Leur mise en Oeuvre suivie interpelle, notamment les partenaires techniques et financiers, pour l a
mise en place des ressourcesnkcessaires au relkvement programme des indicateurs sociaux.

21.      Des obstacles restent a lever pour une meilleure absorption des ressources. I1 s'agit pour
l'essentiel: (i) manque de coordination dans leurs actions et d'une certaine incohkrence, voire
                du
des doubles emplois dans le choix des actions A realiser; (ii)       de la faible capacitk technique des
ministkres A klaborer et B mettre en Oeuvre des projets, et (iii)      de la multiplicitk des prockdures
lourdes et complexes des bailleurs de fonds qui utilisent des circuits diffkrents de celui de 1'Etat.
Ainsi, dans le cadre des plans d'actions du CFAA et du CPAR, des recommandations ont ete
faites pour une concertation entre les bailleurs de fonds afin de parvenir a une harmonisation et
une convergence de leurs aides.

22.      Dans le cadre du suivi de la SRP et des OMD, le Gouvemement Oeuvre, de maniere
consensuelle avec l'ensemble des partenaires intervenant au SCnBgal, pour l a mise en place d'une
liste restreinte d'indicateurs        dans les domaines suivants:         <(secteur rkel D,   (<routes s,
(< environnement D, )>eau et assainissement         B,  << dkcentralisationD,  <(bonne gouvemance D,

(< agriculture/developpementrural        D. En effet, ce tableau, ri travers des indicateurs, imprimera
une base chiffrBe des objectifs du gouvemement dans les domaines ci-dessus cites pour les
annkes a venir.

1.5      Financementde la SRP

23.      L e gouvemement a accentuk les efforts de rkformes budgktaires et la mise en Oeuvre des
programmes sectoriels en cours soutenus par les partenaires au dkveloppement, notamment la
Banque Mondiale. Ce << Crkdit de Soutien P la Rkduction de la Pauvrete           ))devra appuyer l a SRP

24.     Ence qui conceme le financement du programme de reduction de la pauvrett, en 2003,
l'ecart entre les economies rkaliskes et celles attendues est variable selon les bailleurs de fonds.
L e taux de recouvrement de l'ensemble des economies attendues s'Clkve        67%. I1est plus eleve
dans le cas des institutions de Bretton-Woods, soit 78'8% pour le FMI et 64,2% pour I'IDA
contre environ 65% pour les autres bailleurs de fonds.           Quant au taux d'utilisation des
ressources, ils'est beaucoup amClior6 au cours de I'annke 2003. L e taux de realisation a kt6 de
l'ordre de 57,7% depuis l'adoption de la Loi de Finances Rectificatives (LFR) pour 2003.

25.      Atteignant le point d'achkvement de l'hitiative PPTEen avril2004, le ShCgal attend, au
titre de l'allkgement de la dette, 488 millions de dollars en valeur actualisee nette, soit 800
millions de dollars courants sur une pkriode de 10 ans. Ainsi, en 2003, l a LFR a autorisk des
dkpenses additionnelles PPTE de 42'4 milliards de FCFA. Ces ressources ont kt6 r6servCes en
priorite aux depenses d'investissement a caractkre social.       L a rkpartition de l'enveloppe des
ressources tides de l'initiative PPTE a ttt orientee A hauteur de 80% au monde rural.

1.6      PrincipauxrCsultatsau plansocio-Cconomique

26.      L'evaluation de l a premikre annCe de mise en ceuvre du DSRP fait ressortir des progrks
dans la mise en Oeuvre des reformes dans les secteurs prioritaires, mais souligne l'importance des
efforts restant B accomplir pour atteindre les objectifs du millenaire pour le dkveloppement
l'horizon 2015. Par rapport aux axes stratkgiques du DSRP, des performances sont rkalisees,
permettant d'orienter davantage les actions de la mise en ceuvre de la SRP.

27.      En2003, l'activitt kconomique a enregistre unrythme de croissance d'un cran supkrieur
a la moyenne annuelle des anntes 1995-2001 un plus soutenu dks le second trimestre. L e PIB
reel a affiche une croissance de 6'5% en 2003 dans un contexte de maitrise de l'inflation et de
consolidation des autres fondamentaux de l'economie. L e deficit du compte courant avec dons de
la balance des paiements s'est Ctabli a 6'3% du PIB en 2003, c'est-&dire        unniveau infkrieur   a
celui qui est pr6vu dans le scenario le plus pessimiste du DSRP (8,2%).       L e solde de base (hors
ressources PPTE et coots des rkfonnes structurelles) s'est ktabli A 1'4% du PIB alors que le
 deficit global sera contenu A 4,1% malgr6 les mesures exceptionnelles de soutien au monde rural.
L e secteur primaire, tire par le sous-secteur agricole avec une progression de 19,8%, et une
politique hardie de diversification des cultures et des programmes spkcifiques (mais, manioc et
 sesame) a rattrap6 son recul de 2002. Les activitks du secteur secondaire ont pu absorber les
 contrecoups de la mauvaise campagne agricole de 2002 au point de connaitre une croissance
 Cconomique relativement significative de 6'5%.

 28.     L a gestion des ressources humaines a vise l a dotation des regions et districts sanitaires en
personnel qualifiC pour assurer leur fonctionnement, dans le cadre de l'affectation des sortants
 des ecoles de formation. Un effort d'accroissement des moyens allou6s aux structures

30.     L'acces A l'eau potable et la nutrition constituent les deux autres secteurs prioritaires
degagks par le DSRP. Les donnees de la SONES prksentent un bon profil de realisations en
matiere d'hydraulique urbaine. Ainsi, dans le cadre du programme de branchements sociaux en
faveur des quartiers periurbains, 14 569 menages ont eu A bknkficier d'un raccordement au
reseau en 2002. Des efforts ont et6 faits pour porter ce chiffre a 15 279 menages en 2003. L e
taux d'acces des menages a l'eau potable (moins de 15 minutes) pourrait atteindre 83% en 2004
dans les zones urbaines et plus de 58% en milieurural.

31.     Par ailleurs, dans le meme ordre durenforcement de base A longterme de developpement,
le gouvemement poursuitses actions pour amCliorer la couverture et la qualite des infi-astructures
physiques. Car, les investissements publics dans l'infrastructure ont des effets extemes
importants et une rentabilitk elevee. Ainsi, le gouvernement du Senegal et les bailleurs de fonds,
tenant compte du r6le crucial des coiits de transports dans la competitivite Cconomique, ont lance
le programme d'ajustement structure1des transports (PAST, 1991). L e gouvernement poursuit la
mise en ceuvre du Programme Sectoriel des Transports (PST) pour completer et consolider les
acquis du PAST. Les autres projets en cours et programmes sont: l a voirie urbaine, l'entretien
routier et le programme d'appui a la mobilitk urbaine. A la situation actuelle, le pourcentage du
reseau routier rev&    class6 en bon et moyen Ctats a tt6 de 66% en 2003 et pourrait atteindre les
72% en 2004. Cependant, le pourcentage du reseau routier en terre en bon et moyen Ctats reste
faible et a atteint 19% en 2003 et atteindrait 25% en 2004. L e gouvemement envisage de revetir
300 kmde route par an et construire 1000kmde route en terre par an.

Indicateurs des secteurssociaux: kducation et sante`

32.     L'Cvolution de la part relative aux secteurs sociaux (education et sante) dans les depenses
publiques de fonctionnement indique clairement que ces secteurs constituent une prioritt pour les
autorites sknkgalaises. L a part de l'Cducation, pour ces types de dkpenses a augment6 de plus de
3 points entre 2002 et 2004 en passant de 32% a 37%. Celle de l a santk, pour cette pkriode a
Cgalement augment& mais a un rythme moins important en passant de 9,2% en 2002 a 9,5% et
9,8%, respectivement en 2003 et 2004. Par ailleurs, on note que par rapport        la dkpense totale
de 1'Etat (fonctionnement et investissement), la part de l'kducation est passke de plus de 19% en
2003 a 21.8% en 2004, soit une progression de plus de 2'8%.       Tandis que pour le secteur de l a
sante, la part dans la dCpense totale de 1'Etat a connu une lCgkrebaisse relative (moins de 1point
de baisse) entre 2003 et 2004 (7.2% et 6.4% respectivement).

de depenses atteints dans les secteurs sociaux ont CtC largement au-dessus de ceux du DSRP. En
2002, les d6penses de fonctionnement dans le domaine de l'kducation de base ont represent6
46,33% du budget de ce secteur. Ce taux a kt6 de 47,9% en 2003, pour unobjectif de 44% dans

developpement du prescolaire. Par ailleurs, a travers son PDEF, le Gouvemement entend
poursuivre son objectif de scolarisation universellepar la construction d'environ 2000 classespar
an et le recrutement d'enseignement ennombre suffisant, et la gratuite des manuels scolaires.

35.     En outre, le gouvemement a fait un effort de 16,38% du budget total de 1'Etat
(fonctionnement+investissement) dans l'education et la formation. L e taux de scolarisation
primaire est passe de 75'8% en 2003 A 79,9% en 2004. Au mCme moment, le taux d'admission
au Cours d'Initiation a augment6 de prks de 5 points en pourcentage entre 2003 et 2004. L e taux

ressources budgetaires. L a part du budget total de 1'Etat dans ce secteur a augmente a peine de
1'43% entre 2003 et 2004 passant de 7,70% en 2003 a 7'82% en 2004. Les engagements du
gouvemement ont permis de porter le taux de couverture vaccinale DTC3 chez les enfants de 0      a
11 mois A un rythme annuel de I'ordre de 5% (65% en 2002 contre 70% en 2003). Les
accouchements assistes par du personnel forme connaitraient une progression de 5 points en
pourcentage entre 2003 et 2004 (54% et 59% respectivement). Cependant, la prevalence du
VWSIDA, bien que faible, a relativement augmente de 0,3 points en pourcentage entre 2002 et
2003 soit respectivement 1'2% et 1'5%.

2.0      Perspectives pour la pCriode 2004-2007

2.1.     CrCation de la richesse dans un cadre macroCconomique sain

37.      Selon les projections, la situation kconomique du Senegal devrait connaitre une forte
croissance en 2004. En effet, les objectifs de cadrage macrokconomique visent a consolider les
acquis de 2003 et relever les contraintes pour une croissance Cconomique accC1Cree. Ces objectifs
sont en coherence avec les preoccupations de reduction de la pauvretk qui exigent la realisation
de taux de croissance eleves dans uncontexte de maitrise de l'inflation A travers notamment une
gestion financikre et monktaire vertueuse. Ainsi, le gouvemement entend porter le niveau de
croissance du PIB reel en 2004 A 6%, contenir le deficit budgetaire et le deficit du compte
courant de labalance des paiements a des niveaux respectifs de 2'6% et 5'6%.

38.      L e gouvernement s'engage   a finaliser, avec les services du FMI, la deuxikme revue du
programme de FacilitCpour la Reductionde la Pauvrete et la Croissance (FRPC) dans des delais
rapproches, d'ici 2i fin novembre 2004. Cette revue aura A examiner une politique de
remuneration A moyen terme dans la fonction publique et un plan d'action pour renforcer le
secteur financier sur la base des recommandations de la mise ajour du Programme d'Evaluation
du Secteur Financier (PESF), avec une optique de developpement. I1est           noter que le retard
pris dans la realisation de cette deuxikme revue, s'explique par la prise d'un certain nombre de
mesures par le gouvernement, pour renforcer l'application des procedures budgetaires et de
passation de marche. L a troisikme revue du programme, qui sera conclue au plus tard avant la
findupremier semestre2005, comprendra l'elaboration d'un planpour une augmentation accrue
dur6le du secteur privedans le secteur de l'knergie, et l'adoption d'un agenda pour renforcer la
bonne gouvemance dans le secteur public et ameliorer la qualit6 du systkme judiciaire.

39.      En ce qui conceme les d@enses, le Gouvernement, malgre la volonte de lutter
efficacement contre la pauvrete, adoptera une demarche prudente de programmation des

allocations budgktaires et mettra en Oeuvre les rkfonnes necessairesa l'elimination des risques de
desequilibres financiers majeurs d'origine         parapublique. L e gouvernement fait de la
consolidation de l'assainissement des finances publiques une priorite. A ce titre, le deficit
budgetaire sera maintenu A un niveau soutenable par l'amklioration du rendement fiscal et une
programmation prudente des d6penses publiques. Pour accroitre les recettes, les rkfonnes seront
poursuivies en vue de renforcer les administrations fiscales, simplifier la fiscalite, rationaliser et
elargir progressivement l'assiette et lutter plus efficacement contre la fraude fiscale.

40.     L a gestion budgktaire prudente du gouvernement a pour objectif le maintien du solde
budgktaire B unniveau stable et l'efficacite accrue dans l'allocation des depenses publiques vers
les secteurs prioritaires definis dans le DSRP, notamment I'agriculture, I'education, la santk,
l'hydraulique et l'assainissement. A cet effet, la loi de finances pour l'annke 2004 est marquke
par la mise en oeuvre du Document de Strategie de Reduction de la Pauvretk (DSRP) qui
constitue le cadre global du programme de croissance accelkrke et de reduction de la pauvretk. I1
est b5ti apartir du cadrage macrokconomique 2003-2005 qui sous-tend le programme triennal de
politiques kconomiques et financibres. Les recettes doivent progresser de 7'2% par rapport Zi la
gestion 2003. Une orientation similaire, en faveur des secteurs strategique du DSRP, est prevue
dans le projet de budget 2005.

41.     Conformkment aux engagements pris par le Gouvernement, les secteurs sociaux
notamment la sante et l'education resteront les prioritks dans l'allocation des ressources
budgetaires. Les budgets 2004-05 prevoient le recrutement special de prks de 5000 agents pour
ces secteurs sociaux dans le recrutement de la fonction publique.

42.     L a politique monktaire continuera A viser la stabilite des prix et la consolidation des
reserves de change, au moyen d'instruments axes sur les mkcanismes du marche. A cet effet, le
gouvemement mettra un accent particulier sur la creation d'un environnement propice a la
mobilisation de l'epargne sans recours direct A la BCEAO et au financement du secteur prive,
moteur de la croissance.

43.     L a stratkgie de croissance accelCrCe vise A faire du secteur prive le moteur du
dkveloppement economique. Ce premier levier du gouvernement dans le combat de lutte contre
lapauvretC s'articule autour de trois principales caracttsristiques: (i)avoir une bonne progression
imoyenetlongterme,c'est-&dire avoirunfortpotentieldecroissance;(ii)Ctreaforten
creation d'emplois et (iii)Ctre compktitif au plan international de sorte a augmenter les
exportations dupays.

44.     Cette strattgie de croissance acckleree que le gouvemement entend mettre en oeuvre vise
la realisation, A moyen et long termes, d'un taux de croissance reel du PIE! a plus de 7% en
moyenne annuelle.       Elle devrait bknkficier        des effets   positifs d'un environnement
macroeconomique rendu favorable par l'atteinte par le Senegal du point d'achbvement
intervenue en avril2004, I'CligibilitC au Millenium Challenge Account
                                           G                                 ))et la mise en place du
Programme National de Bonne Gouvemance (PNBG) avec notamment des refonnes du systkme
de gestion des finances publiques et des marchks publics (CFAA et CPAR).

45.     Le secteur de I'agriculture demeure un axe prioritaire du gouvernement. En effet, ilest
vise entre autres objectifs, la promotion des canaux de distribution des produits agricoles A
travers des politiques de developpement du commerce intkrieur par l'amelioration du systkme
d'information sur les marches et de constitution de stocks de skcuritk alimentaire sur la pkriode

                                                                                     Page10 o f 16

2004-2006. Les ressources forestikres seront valorisees dans les rkgions de Tambacounda et de
Kolda avec le projet de valorisation des produits forestiers alimentaires qui permettra de lutter
significativement contre lapauvretk et la malnutrition.

46.     L a poursuite de la mise en place des bases de la diversification des cultures constitue un
autre axe prioritaire pour les prochaines annees, avec le debut de la mise en oeuvre des plans
d'actions des filikres ckrkalihes, notamment le mai`s, les olkagineux et le manioc. I1 est inscrit
kgalement, la crkation de p6les industriels regionaux orientks vers la transformation de produits
agricole. Dans ce cadre, ilest aussi envisage de dkvelopper le secteur de l'industrie artisanale
par lamise enplace de plateformes multifonctionnelles.

47.     L e Gouvernement a kgalement lanck un nouveau volet de sa stratkgie qui consiste a
ameliorer les conditions de vie et d'infrastructure dans l'agglomeration de Dakar. L'exode rural
et la forte concentration de la population ont rkduit l'attractivitk des investissements et entrain6
un engorgement qui aboutit A des coixts kconomiques sans precedents pour le Sknegal. En
consequence, les chances de realiser une forte croissance economique sont compromises. A ce
titre, le Gouvernement a decide d'initier un programme de developpement qui vise
simultanement A moderniser la ville de Dakar et a dkconcentrer un certain nombre d'activites
vers d'autres villes. Unvaste programme de dkveloppement des villes secondaires est en cours
de prkparationpour soutenir cette initiative. Cette stratkgie est supportee dans le budget 2005 et
paruncertainnombre d'initiatives avec lesbailleurs de fonds, dont laBanquemondiale.

48.     Par ailleurs, la promotion de l'emploi indkpendant en milieu rural et urbain constitue un
objectif majeur du DSRP. Dans ce cadre, une activite sera dkmarrke dans la region de
Tambacounda.       De meme, la promotion de Micro entreprises de femmes en milieu rural
benkficiera d'un soutien consistant sur la periode 2004-2005 en vue de contribuer a
l'amklioration de la situation kconomique et sociale des femmes. Enconcordance avec le Crkdit
d'Appui de la Banque mondiale, les autoritks ont initie un renforcement de la formation
professionnelle, notamment avec l'elaboration d'une nouvelle stratkgie et l'etablissement d'un
nouveau fonds (FONDES) avec l'appui du secteur prive. Au plan de la legislation du travail,
plusieurs dkcrets seront adopt& dans le but d'offiir un cadre plus securisant tant pour les
investisseurs que pour les travailleurs dans des secteurs spkcifiques de l'kconomie senkgalaise.

49.     L'amklioration du fonctionnement de la justice est une revendication du secteur privk
opkrant au Sknkgal. C'est aussi undes objectifs majeurs du Gouvemement, qui sera soutenu par
le crkdit d'Appui de la Banque mondiale.           Aprbs avoir developpe une nouvelle strategic
sectorielle en collaboration avec l'ensemble de la communaute, le Gouvemement s'engage A
accroitre les ressources budgktaires allou6es vers ce secteur, a lancer un programme de
renforcement des ressources humaines et une automatisation des tribunaux qui devraient mener A
une meilleure efficacite de l'appareil judiciaire au Sknkgal.

50.     Pour ce qui est du secteur d'appui a la production, le developpement de l'knergie
constitue la prioritk du gouvemement. I1 est vis6 a ce titre le renforcement de l'electrification
rurale et la diversification des sources d'knergies par un vaste programme de 1'Agence
Sknegalaise d'Electrification Rurale (ASER). Ce programme passe par la mise en oeuvre de la
concession d'klectrification m a l e de Foundiougne, la promotion des energies nouvelles et
renouvelables, et l'electrification des villages chefs lieu de communautk male.

51.      L a poursuite des reformes dans le secteur de l'energie conduira au transfert des actifs de
la SENELEC tel que prkvudans le schema de privatisation. L e cadre reglementaire et legal sera
actualise conform6ment aux strategies d'evolution retenue par le Gouvernement pour l'kvolution
des sous secteurs de I'klectricitk et des hydrocarbures. L a participation du secteur prive dans l a
gestion du secteur de l'knergie sera ainsi mieux precis6e.

2.2      Renforcement des capacitks et promotiondes servicessociaux de base

Secteur de la Sante`

52.      Pour le secteur de la santt, l'objectif triennal 2005-2007 serait de porter son niveau de
6,5% a 7'5%. I1atteindrait 9% en 2010 et 13% en 2015, afin de rkaliser les objectifs fixes dans le
secteur de la santk, a savoir: porter le taux de couverture vaccinale (DTCP3) a plus de 80%, la
proportiond'accouchements assist&        a 75%   et le taux de consultation primaire curative a plus de
60% en 2010. D e meme, la proportion d'enfants malnutris devrait 6tre ramenee en dessous de
11%et le taux de prevalence duVIH, limite a 1%sur l'horizon 2015.

53.      L e Programme National de Developpement Sanitaire (PNDS) continuera A orienter les
actions majeures dans le secteur de la santk.           L a determination des besoins en ressources
financikres   nkcessaires a l'atteinte des Objectifs du Millhaire pour le Dkveloppement (OMD)
dans le secteur pourra &e assurke dans le cadre de l'elaboration d'un Cadrage Sectoriel des
Dkpenses a Moyen Terme (CSDMT). Les actions ayant produit des rksultats probants comme l a
vaccination gratuite et l a distribution gratuite de vitamine A, seront poursuivies et les voies et
moyens de renforcer les programmes de nutrition seront recherches.

54.      L areflexion va 6tre menke pour concevoir unsystkme de subvention des soins d'urgences
obstetricales en ligne avec l'objectif d'accroitre les accouchements assist& grgce A une reduction
des cofits pour les femmes. L a lutte contre le paludisme dans son volet prdvention connaitra un
approfondissement avec la subvention des moustiquaires imprkgnees et des frais de traitement.

55.      L e Gouvernement a saisi l'opportunite de l a revision du DSRP pour Ctendre l'axe 2 de l a
strategie initiale 21 l a protection sociale. En droite ligne avec ce souci de mieux proteger les
groupes vulnkrables confrontks        la prkcaritk, deux cadres stratkgiques de prise en charge, l'un,
des orphelins et autres enfants vulnerables, l'autre, des cas sociaux scolaires, seront mis en
chantier. 11s seront suivis par l'ktude nationale sur les personnes BgCes, qui pennettra de mieux
cibler la politique des ainks au Senegal.

56.      L e soutien de la Banque mondiale A travers ce credit d'Appui prend toute son importance
dans ce contexte ou des progrks majeurs devront 6tre realises dans le secteur de la santt au
Senegal. Les actions identifikes dans le Crkdit d'Appui mettent l'accent sur l'ktablissement du
cadre strategique et institutionnel et sur la mise en euvre d'un programme de vaccination qui
devraient permettre d'atteindre les objectifs definis dans le cadre de l'initiative duMillknium.

Education etformation

57.      L a part des d6penses dans le secteur de 1'6ducation par rapport aux dkpenses totales de
1'Etat 6voluerait de plus 3% dans la programmation 2004-2006 (2 1'8% et 24'2% respectivement
en 2004 et 2006). Par ailleurs, l'objectif est de porter son niveau a plus de 25% a partir de 2010
en perspective d'une scolarisation universelle.

58.     Les actions multiformes deployees dans le cadre du Programme DCcennal pour
1'Education et la Formation (PDEF) qui poursuit l'objectif de 70% de taux de scolarisation et de
40% de taux d'alphabetisation seront intensifites en 2004 afin de rattraper le retard accuse dans
la mise en ceuvre du programme. I1 s'agira notamment de finaliser le CDMT sectoriel de
l'kducation (y compris les enseignements secondaires, scientifiqueet de la recherche scientifique)
pour permettre de mieux apprecier le niveau des ressources et le profil de leur allocation intra
sectorielle le plus apte a assurer l'atteinte des objectifs du millenaire. Dans l'optique d'amkliorer
l'accks a 1'Ccole en zone rurale, la politique des subventions scolaires dans les regions les moins
scolarisees sera poursuivie et des mesures seront prises pour ameliorer la qualit6 de
l'enseignement .

59.      L'actualisation du PDEF en 2005 sera effectuee pour tenir compte de la necessitt de
l'klargissement du concept d'tducation de base conformement aux orientations de la lettre de
politiques kducatives et des nouvelles initiatives (Education pour tous, Objectifs du Milltnaire
pour le Developpement, etc.).

60.      L e gouvemement accordera l'attention requise aux recommandations issues des diverses
revues du PDEF, organides semestriellement avec l'ensemble des bailleurs de fonds du
programme et des partenaires de l'education de base. Cette mobilisation devrait permettre de
relever sensiblement les indicateurs de l'education de base A l'horizon 2005, notamment dans les
zones rurales.

61.      Pour une meilleure articulation du PDEF, le gouvemement envisage: (i) poursuivre la
                                                                                      de

programme de construction des salles de classe; (v) de rkaliser le programme de constructions de
salles de classe par les services dkconcentres (LA, IDEN); (vi) de construire environ 10000 salles
de classe dans l'elkmentaire et 6000 dans le moyen; et (vii) de renforcer la capacite du Moyen et
du Secondaire.

62.      Par ailleurs, l'objectif d'eradiquer l'analphabetisme et de promouvoir l'tducation
 qualifiante desjeunes et adolescents sera poursuivi par, d'une part, le renforcement du dispositif
 de pilotage et de suivi evaluation en vue de mieux agir sur ces groupes, et, d'autre part, unvaste
programme de trois ans sera enclench6 pour contribuer davantage           a l'eradication de ce fleau.
Aussi, la rehabilitation et l'extension des centres d'tducation de base et de formation
professionnelle pour les filles et garqons analphabbtes ou exclus du systeme kducatif
prkmaturement et hges de 14 ans au plus seront-elles soutenues au cours de la periode.
 L'elargissement de l'education de base sera renforce par l'introduction du trilinguisme et la

Amklioration du cadre de vie

 63.     L'accbs a l'eau potable et a un systkme d'assainissement adequat constitue une des
 grandes prioritks du Senegal au cours des trois prochaines annkes. Dans le domaine de
 l'hydraulique, une importance particulibre sera accordbe aux activites visant a accroitre le taux
 d'acces a l'eau potable par la construction de forages et points d'eau. L a Politique Sectorielle
 pour 1'Eau (PSE) envisage de porter a 100% le taux d'accbs (moins de 15 minutes) a l'eau
 potable d'ici 2010, taux qui se situe actuellement a 87,9%           a travers la construction et la

Programme Sectoriel pour 1'Eau de Long Terme, l'objectif vis6 est de rksorber le deficit d'eau
dans la ville de Dakar.

64.     Dans le secteur de l'assainissement, l'objectif vise est I'amklioration de l'acces A des
systemes adequats d'evacuation des excreta, d'une part, a travers unplan d'assainissement rural
et de promotion de l'hygiene sanitaire dans les collectivites locales, et, d'autre part, par un
programme pilote d'assainissement rural et de promotion de l'hygiene sanitaire dans la region de
Thiks.

65.     Enmatiere d'eau potable et d'assainissement, le document cadre adopt6 en 2000 sera relu
pour prendre en compte les evolutions institutionnelles et les decrets d'application seront pris en
conskquence. Sur la base des rbultats des phases pilotes, les cahiers de charge des concessions
et le plan d'action du partenanat public/privk seront rkdigks. L'klaboration d'un plan
d'assainissement urbainpermettra de mieux adresser le probleme d'hygiene induit par le faible
taux de latrinisation
        G               D.

66.     Dans le domaine de l'environnement, le Senkgal s'engage a sauvegarder l'environnement
et lutter contre la dksertification.      Manifestement, il est envisage de mettre en place un
programme de restructuration des systemes ago-sylvopastoraux dans le littoral centre.

Promotion de la bonnegouvernance et renforcement des capacitksde I'Etat

67.     Au planpolitique, l'annee 2004 sera consacree A la preparation des prochaines kchkances
electorales,   savoir les klections legislatives et prksidentielles respectivement 2006 et 2007.

68.     En matiere de gouvemance locale, le Gouvemement est attache a l'approfondissement
effectif de la dkcentralisation, mais ilentend conduire le processus avec toute la skrenite requise
et en prenant les mesures d'accompagnement prkalables, notamment l'adoption du cadre
juridique de la dbconcentration, pour favoriser des avanckes veritables et irreversibles du
processus de misse en oeuvre de la region et des sectoriels comme entites deconcentrkes. Ainsi,
a travers une Lettre de Politique du Developpement Rural Dkcentralise (LPDRD), le
gouvemement entend contibuer a amkliorer la qualite de vie et l'acces aux services essentiels de
base en milieurural, en permettant aux communautks de prendre en charge les affaires locales et
en creant un cadre permettant aux divers acteurs que sont les populations, les collectivitks
locales, l'etat et ses services deconcentrkes, les ONGs, le secteur prive et les partenaires au
developpement d'utiliser au mieux leurs competences respectives.

69.     L a decentralisation des operations de 1'Etat vers les collectivitks locales constitue un des
elkments strategiques du Gouvernement sur la base du cadre juridique adopte en 1996. Les
autorites vont continuer l a mise en Oeuvre de cette strategie en accklerant les transferts financiers
de 1'Etat central vers les collectivites locales. En vue d'amkliorer l a rkalisation des projets
d'investissement dans les regions, la gestion du Budget consolide d'Investissement (BCI) devrait
etre graduellement dkconcentrke vers les collectivitks locales.          Enfin, le Gouvemement va
poursuivre la mise en oeuvre du cadre institutionnel supportant le DSRP dans les regions et
l'harmonisation des stratbgies de dkveloppement rkgionales avec celles envisagees au niveau
sectoriel.

70.     L'amelioration des prockdures budgktaires et financikres au sein de 1'Etat continue d'etre
un des objectifs principaux du Gouvemement qui s'engage a poursuivre             mettre en ceuvre les
plans d'actions CFMCPAR selon le calendrier dkfinit avec l'ensemble des bailleurs de fonds.
Au plan de l'execution budgktaire, ilest prkvu un important programme de deconcentration de
l'ordonnancement qui demarre en 2005 pour quatre ministtires cles (education, sante, justice,
environnement) avant de se gknkraliser vers les rkgions.           Les contrbles independants des
operations de 1'Etat vont continuer d'etre renforcks, en poursuivant la mise Ajour des comptes de
1'Etat et des lois de rkglements, en coordination avec la Cour des comptes. Au niveau des
procedures de passation de marchk, le Gouvernement va continuer de chercher a amkliorer le
cadre juridique et institutionnel. Une attention particulikre sera donnke au besoin de restreindre
l'utilisation de prockdures spkciales (entente directe, grk A grk, mesures d'urgence) en amkliorant
la planification des contrats au sein des principaux ministeres dbensiers et en imposant des
limites quantitatives sur l'utilisation de ces pratiques.

71.      L e Gouvemement va kgalement continuer son action qui vise a amkliorer la productivitk
des fonctionnaires. L a politique d'embauche accordke avec le FMI et la Banque mondiale va
5tre poursuivie, en privilkgiant les secteurs prioritaires du DSRP. En outre, une nouvelle
politique de rkmunkration va &re engagke et qui cherchera

performance et A aboutir a une meilleure rkpartition gkographique de la fonction publique au
Sknkgal.

2.3      Amelioration des conditions de vie des groupes vulnerables

72.      L'attention particulikre pretke aux groupes vulnkrables sera materialiske par un
programme de promotion des villes secondaires et de petites villes rurales en vue d'assurer un
meilleur accks aux parcelles viabiliskes aux pauvres, de renforcer les infrastructures de soutien.
Dans ce secteur kgalement, le Sknkgal envisage, entre autres, de promouvoir des territoires
compktitifs et de restructurer et rkgulariser le foncier dans certaines zones pkriurbaines et rurales.
Avec le soutien de la Banque mondiale, le Gouvernement va klaborer une strategie de soutien
aux groupes vulnkrables qui aura comme objectif principal de coordonner les actions en cours, y
compris celles supportkes par lesbailleurs de fonds, et de dkfinir les axes prioritaires. Une revue
des dkpenses publiques a ktk initike qui devrait permettre de mieux cerner les programmes en
cours ainsi que les meilleures pratiques pour protkger les groupes vulnkrables.            Au niveau
institutionnel, en raison de l'aspect multi-sectoriel de l'action, un comitk sera crke sous l'kgide
duMinistkre duTravail et de celui des Familles et de laPrkventionsociale.

73.      Pour appuyer la contribution des jeunes a la croissance kconomiques, le programme de
mobilisation de ce groupe dans l'agriculture sera poursuivi avec un accent particulier sur le
genre. Pour dkvelopper une stratkgie de prise en charge des enfants en milieu semi ouvert, un
projet de cinq ans sera lanck en vue d'assurer la formation et l'insertion professionnelle des
talibes des << daaras  B.

Re: Strategic DirectionsNote

 Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,

My purpose in writing you this letter is to request, on behalf of the Government of the Republic o f
Senegal, a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) in the amount o f US$30 million, in order to
support the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)' that we presented to the World Bank's Board o f
Directors in December 2002. The Progress Report submitted to you in March 2004 highlights the
progress made inimplementingthis strategy, which i s also supported by all the development partners
active in Senegal.

This letter on Strategic Directions describes the policies and interventions planned in improving
political, economic and social governance over the next 18 months, with a view to achieving the
2003-2005 goals set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approved in 2002. These
policies take into consideration not only the progress made in 2003-2004 in terms o f the orientation
o f the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), but also the shortcomings observed, so that these might be
corrected and a steady course maintained in pursuing the basic PRSP goals. Thus, this letter first
details activities that have been completed, then reviews the results obtained, and finally concludes
with a strategic outlook. It also puts into perspective the economic policy matrix developed with the
World Bank's team and in coordination with other donors and representatives of civil society
operating inSenegal.




' The percentage of the population living below the poverty threshold remains relatively high. It was estimated at 55.8
percent nationally in2003 and remains higher inrural areas.

I. StatusofimplementationofthePovertyReductionStrategyPaper

 The PRSP initiated by the Government i s built on four pillars:             (i)the creation of wealth;
 (ii)capacity-building and promotion o f basic services; (iii)improved living conditions for vulnerable
 groups; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation o f its implementation.               This section describes
 developments in each o f these categories during 2003, based on the most recent PRSP progress
 report, and indicates trends interms o f funding priority activities as well as the main results obtained
 interms o fsocio-economic indicators.

 1.1.    Creation of wealthwithin a soundmacro-economicframework

Public Sector

 1.      As was emphasized in the PRSP, macro-economic stability is an essential ingredient o f any
 strategy aimed at fostering sustainable economic growth.          In order to make State intervention
effective, the Government's interventions are focused on the following areas: (a) the legal and
judicial framework; (b) financing; (c) streamlining o f bureaucracy and greater transparency; (d) trade
and price liberalization and promotion o f competition; (e) privatization; (f) labor legislation; (g)
public administration reform; and (h) tax policy and public resources management.

 2.     Implementation o f the 2003 budget was satisfactory overall. The 2003 budget exercise was
conducted in line with the sectoral and structural reforms defined inthe PRSP. Inthe area o f public
expenditures, the budget execution rate, at nearly 70 percent, was acceptable. The tax/GDP ratio
reached 18.3 percent, with tax collection actually surpassing prior expectations. This result made it
possible to achieve the tax revenue levels envisaged under the high-case scenario, despite a weaker
than expected mobilization o f PRSP resources.         However, the financing o f public investment
expenditures out o f internal resources, relative to tax revenues, exceeded the efforts expected under
the medium-case scenario (Le., 24.4 percent vs. 22.6 percent). This ratio does not take into account
expenditures associated with the HIPC Initiative. The wage bill was restricted to 30.1 percent, Le.,
one percentage point higher than the PRSP best-case scenario.

Private Sector Promotion

 3.     The Government o f Senegal has identified the private sector as the engine o f growth and job
creation, and therefore intends to promote it. In order to better promote this sector, the investment
promotion agency APIX (Agence de promotion des investissements et des grands travaux), apart
from its dual functions o f assisting business creation and managing tax and customs incentives under
the current One-Stop Shop, coordinates activities promoting Senegal in industrial capital markets,
organizes meetings, both in Senegal and abroad, between local and foreign investors, and promotes
exports.

4.      Inthe area o f trade, the Government has continued to liberalize trade relations, enhanced its
capacity for international trade negotiations, and promoted exports with the respect o f competition
rules. The agencies charged with developing this sector are: the export promotion agency OPE
(Office de promotion des exportations), the market regulation agency ARM (Agence de rbgulation
des mavchbs), the national competition commission CNC (Commission nationale de la concurrence)
and the laboratory o f the Domestic Trade Directorate (Direction du commerce intbrieur).



                                                                                           Schedule 1
                                                                                               Page 2

 5.     During 2003, various measures were taken to improve the business climate and the
competitiveness o f the Senegalese economy. The Government applied itself resolutely to the task o f
 accelerating reform in the groundnut sub-sector, telecommunication and energy sectors, and to the
privatization o f public enterprises in its residual portfolio. The Government policy in the groundnut
sub-sector was articulated in the Letter o f Groundnut Industry Development Policy (Lettre de
politique de dheloppement de la JiliBre arachide, LPDFA) approved in M a y 2003. This policy is
aimed at deepening and consolidating the existing liberalization policy. The process o f privatizing
 SONACOS, which i s part o f this effort, was launched on July 31, 2003 and was published in the
national and international press, with a request for expressions o f interest.

 6.     With regard to improving the business climate, Senegal, like other members o f the
Organization for the Harmonization o f Business Law in Africa (OHADA), is pursuing reform and
enacting legislation aimed at strengthening democracy, the rule o f law, and good governance, with a
view to activating the dissemination o f OHADA regulations.             In addition, the streamlining of
procedures involved inbusiness creation i s supported by our development partners. Apart from the
goal o f harmonizing business law, Senegal, through its Judicial Reform Committee (ComitL de
rLj7exion SUI la justice, CRJ) (1998), i s expected to promote arbitration proceedings to resolve
disputes and to improve the training o f magistrates and their auxiliaries.              Moreover, the
Government's initiatives to streamline administrative and fiscal procedures and to enhance the
profitability and stability o f the Senegalese banking system should lead to further improvement inthe
business environment.      In the area o f taxation, the authorities have continued to implement the
reforms initiated in 2000 with the adoption o f a new Investment Code, the reduction o f the business
tax rate, and the rationalization o f the tax regime for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The creation o f a unified tax for SMEs, which supplants the income tax, VAT and business license
fee, should enhance the private sector's development.

 7.    It is worth underscoring that, in connection with the recent initiatives launched by the new
Government in place since March 19, 2000, the authorities formally approached the company
Standard & Poor's to initiate the process o f rating Senegal's sovereign risk. The initial result has
been available since December 2000. This agency provided a rating o f B+/Stable/B for the 2000-
2004 period. The short-term grade is B. The long-term grade o fB+indicates that the country is able
to honor its financial commitments.

8.     In the telecommunications sector, after liberalizing the mobile telephone market segment,
which reduced communications costs considerably and helped expand telephone access, efforts have
concentrated on completing the process o f privatizing the historic operator, SONATEL. This effort
should reinforce the deregulation o f the landline telephone segment, and the separation o f its cellular
telephone activities into a new subsidiary.

9.     As for the implementation o f reforms in the energy sector, a new milestone has just been
reached with the Government's approval o f options for the restructuring o f this sector, paving the
way for new improvements, especially in the thermal production capacity o f SENELEC and the
selection o f an independent producer that i s expected to increase electricity production by 60
megawatts as o f September 2005.




                                                                                         Schedule 1
                                                                                             Page 3

 1.2.    Capacity-buildingandpromotionof basic social services

 10.     Human     resource   development      i s  essential  to    sustained economic     development.
Acknowledging Senegal's shortcomings inthis area, the Government has focused on basic education
 and health by designing and developing specific programs to promote their coherent development.
The levels and trends in the Government's expenditure indicators in these sectors reflect ongoing
 efforts to meet international standards (e.g., those of the WHO, UNESCO, etc.) and also clearly
demonstrate the Government's willingness to attain its PRSP objectives and the Millennium
Development Goals.

 11.     Inthe education sector, the Government's action is consistent with the various themes defined
in the Ten-Year Education and Training Program (Programme dkcennal de l'kducation et de la
formation, PDEF). Indeed, this program defined the framework through which the State is
committed to the development o f the "access component" o f education, to improvement o f the
"instructional quality component" and to the adoption o f sectoral policies that can help meet the goal
o f Education for All by the year 2015. Within the framework o f access to basic education, the
Government has selected two specific objectives that are: (i)     to build enough schools and classrooms
for all eligible children to attend school; (ii)  to equip existing elementary schools with latrines and
wells, inaddition to refurbishing dilapidated classrooms.

 12.     Inthe health sector, the Government has defined its objectives and strategies based on three
priorities. The first priority consists o f developing community-based health services through the
creation and strengthening o f these services inrural and periurban areas at a cost estimated at CFAF
800 million. Among these priorities, a prominent place i s also reserved for improvedHIV/AIDS and
malaria treatment and prevention efforts, at a cost o f CFAF 33.3 billion. Finally, an improvement in
the quality and supply o f health services i s planned, at a cost o f CFAF 1.5 billion. The main projects
in this sector are: the National AIDS Action Plan and the Integrated Health Development Program
(PDIS)  .

13.     The breakdown o f the Consolidated Investment Budget (CIB) reflects the efforts made,
through intemal and extemal resources, to finance investment in the water, sanitation and agriculture
sectors, which are top PRSP priorities interms o f capacity-building. Thus, (a) for the water sector, an
increase in quality and rate o f access is planned. The `flagship' projects inthis sector are: the Water
Supply Project (Programme sectoriel de 1'eau, PSE), the Retention Basin Construction Program, the
Safe Water for All Project, and the Small-scale Irrigation Project; (b) in the area o f sanitation, the
Government is continuing its efforts to improve sanitary and living conditions o f urban populations in
unequipped areas through access to adequate systems; and (c) the agriculture sector i s a priority
within the Government's socio-economic policy and consists o f improving food security, and
ensuring strong economic growth that will generate decent jobs and incomes, especially inrural areas
where most o f the poor live.

14.     The Government, aware o f the large numbers o f people working in the primary sector (Le.,
agriculture, livestock, and fisheries) and o f the linkage between poverty and the rural area (which i s
essentially agricultural), has made the promotion o f agricultural activities a priority in all o f its
development policies. The budget for agriculture and livestock represents a considerable share o f the
State budget (6 percent on average over the 2000-2004 period.) Thus, (1) in the agriculture sub-
sector, the main projects developed, in terms o f volume o f investment, are the Agricultural Services
and Producer Organizations Program (Programme de services agricoles aux organisations

                                                                                          Schedule 1
                                                                                              Page 4

paysannes, PSAOP) and the national Rural Infrastructure Program (NRIP); (2) the livestock sub-
 sector can point to a second phase o f the Livestock Support Project (PAPEL 11); the Village Planning
 and Development Project (Projet d 'amknagement et de dkveloppement villageois, PADV); the
 Apiculture Development Project (Projet d 'appui au dkveloppement de 1'apiculture, PADA) and
projects involving selective breeding o f improved cattle and the development o f horse breeding; (3)
 in the area o f fisheries, Government interventions are focused on the Fisheries Sector Support
 Project, the Cold Chain Development Project, andthe Motor Launch Procurement Project.

Promotion of Good Governance

 15.    In the area of governance, the strengtheningof democracy and the rule of law, as well as
improvedmechanisms for public financial management, were two central concerns for the authorities
throughout 2003. The Government is strongly committed to promote good democratic and economic
governance.

 16.    The creation o f the General Audit Office in 1999 was a major milestone in the promotion of
the principle o f good governance and transparency inpublic affairs. It has exerted effective control,
as required by WAEMU authorities. In Senegal, the function o f external control o f public account
was performed, from 1960 to 1999, by the Supreme Court, and from 1992 by the State Council. The
constitutional reform o f 1999 created the current General Audit Office, which thus now constitutes
the fourth component o f the judiciary, alongside the Constitutional Council, the State Council and the
Supreme Court o f Appeal.

 17.    Consolidation o f economic governance i s an ongoing challenge for the Government o f
Senegal in the context o f PRSP implementation, and so has received the support o f many partners
through budgetary assistance, thus leaving it up to the Government to allocate funds according to its
stated priorities. This process entails a much greater degree o f accountability, which intum requires
the establishment o f budget management tools and mechanisms that ensure transparency inthe use o f
resources. Inaddition, the Government i s taking care to ensure that WAEMU economic convergence
criteria are respected, fulfilling the eight stated criteria.   During 2004, however, the criterion
involving the basic fiscal balance deteriorated slightly due to a credit carry-over out o f HIPC funds
allocated to the social sectors. Regarding the secondary criteria, only the one concerning the current
external account deficit may not be met in2005.

18.     In the context o f the Budget Management Improvement Program (Plan d'action pour le
renforcement de la gestion budgktaire, PRGB) adopted in 2002, the Government i s committed to
produce sustainable improvement in the transparency, reliability and efficiency o f budget
management, in line with the PRSP objectives. In accordance with the CFAA-CPAR action plans
(approved in 2003), the IMF's Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) and the
PRGB, the Government have given more attention to the issue o f resource absorption as well as o f
the adequacy between priority investments and budgetary allocation and execution.

1.3.    Improvementof livingconditionsfor vulnerable groups

19.     The PRSP pillar linked to the improvement o f the living conditions o f vulnerable groups has
not yet generated many programs directly targeted to this activity. Considerable efforts, however, are
being made to finance priority activities in this area. For the three-year period from 2003 to 2005,
over 10 percent o f funding for the overall PRSP priority action plan are devoted to this area. Priority


                                                                                        Schedule 1
                                                                                             Page 5

interventions are aimed at those who suffered from the ferry disaster in 2003. Community programs
to help families affected by warfare in Casamance and the ferry sinking are currently being set up.
For the future implementation o f this PRSP pillar, programs are underway and important measures
are being taken to enhance support to vulnerable groups, and boost funding to a level exceeding one
(1) percent o f GDP, compared to less than 0.5 percent in2003.

 1.4     Monitoringof PRSPimplementation

20.      The initiation o f the PRSP implementation, which was carried out with broad participation o f
all actors (administration, development partners and civil society), resulted in the consensus-based
approval o f the Regional Operational Plans (ROPs) and Sectoral Operational Plans (SOPS). Their
implementation will require support from technical and financial partners, including for provision o f
the funds necessary for the planned increase insocial indicators.

21.      Obstacles to improved resource absorption still need to be addressed. Foremost among these
are: (i) uncoordinated interventions and a certain incoherence, or even redundancy, in the choice o f
actions to be carried out; (ii)  the weak technical capacity o f line ministries to design and implement
projects; and (iii)the numerous cumbersome and complex procedures o f donors, which proceed
along circuits different from those o f the State. For these reasons, the CFAA and CPAR action plans
include a series o f recommendations aimed at improving donors' coordination among themselves and
with the Government.

22.      In connection with the monitoring o f the PRS (Poverty Reduction Strategy) and the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Government is in the process o f finalizing through a
consensual approach with all development partners active in Senegal, a short list o f indicators in the
following      areas:   "real   sector",  "transports",   "environment",      "water    and   sanitation",
"decentralization",   "good govemance", "healtldnutrition",       "education",  "village infrastructures",
"children",   "poverty",   and "agriculture/rural development".      Indeed, this list will, through the
evolution o f the selected indicators, provide a numerical basis for the Government's objectives inthe
aforementioned areas for the upcoming years.

1.5.     Financingof the PRS

23.      The Government has stepped up its efforts to implement budget reforms and sectoral
programs supported by its development partners and, notably, the World Bank.                This Poverty
Reduction Support Credit is expected to support the PRS through a series o f actions aimed at
facilitating its implementation.

24.     Regarding the financing o f the Poverty Reduction Program (PRF'), the discrepancy between
actual and anticipated savings varies depending on the donor. The rate o f recovery of all anticipated
savings is 67 percent. It is higher in the case o f the Bretton Woods institutions: 78.8 percent for the
IMF and 64.2 percent for IDA, compared to about 65 percent for other donors. Resource utilization
also improved considerably with the resource utilizationrate reaching 57.7 percent since the adoption
o f the Amended Budget L a w (Loi de Finances Rectzjkatives,LFR) for 2003.

25.     Having reached the completion point under the HIPC initiative inApril 2004, Senegal should
benefit from debt-relief o f US$488 million innet present value, or US$800 million in current dollars
over a ten-year period. In 2003, the LFR authorized additional HIPC expenditures o f CFAF 42.4


                                                                                          Schedule 1
                                                                                               Page 6

billion that were earmarked for priority use in social sectors. Eighty percent o f the funds derived
from the HIPC Initiative have beenallocated inprograms located inrural areas.

1.6.    M a i n socio-economic results

26.     The assessment o f the first year o f PRSP implementation indicates that progress has been
achieved in key priority sectors, but that greater efforts are still required if the Millennium
Development Goals are to be met by the year 2015. The evaluation o f the performance attained in
the PRSP strategic priorities should help us improve the PRS implementation over the next few years.

27.     In2003 economic activity increased at a rate somewhat above the average for the 1995-2001
period, and this increase was even higher from the second quarter onward. Real GDP grew by 6.5
percent in 2003 in an environment o f low inflation and o f consolidation o f other basic economic
variables. The current account deficit, including grants, o f the balance o f payments remained at 6.3
percent o f GDP in 2003, a figure lower than the PRSP worst-case forecast (Le., 8.2 percent), The
primary fiscal balance (excluding HIPC funds and costs o f structural reforms) amounted to 1.4
percent o f GDP, while the global deficit was held at 4.1 percent, despite exceptional measures taken
to support rural areas. The primary sector, driven by a 19.8 percent expansion inthe agricultural sub-
sector, as well as a bold policy o f diversification and ambitious crop-specific programs (e.g., maize,
manioc and sesame), compensated for its setbacks in2002. Activity inthe secondary sector was able
to absorb the negative impact o f the poor crop year in 2002, leading to a relatively significant
economic growth o f 6.5 percent.

28.     Human resource management was aimed at equipping health care regions and districts with
qualified personnel to operate them, notably by assigning recent graduates o f training establishments.
An effort was also made to increase the resources allocated to decentralized services operating inthis
sector delegating more credits (up 10 percent) to health care districts.

29.     Vocational training, inclose liaison with the policy on capacity-building, has made it possible
to train annually over 600 young people as automobile mechanics, electricians, ironworkers, masons,
and leather workers, thus creating opportunities for their entry into working life through skilled
employment or self-employment.

30.     Access to safe water and nutrition constitute two additional priority sectors emphasized by the
PRSP.     Data gathered by the national water company, SONES, paint a positive picture o f
achievements in the area o f urban hydraulics.      Thus, in the context o f the program o f low-cost
connections inperi-urban neighborhoods, 14,569 households were able to obtain a connection to the
network in 2002. Efforts were made to boost this figure to 15,279 households in 2003. The rate o f
household access to safe water (Le., access to a source less than 15 minutes away) is expected to
reach 83 percent in2004 inurban areas and over 58 percent inrural areas.

31.     Along the same long-term objective, the Government has continued to improve the coverage
and quality o f physical infrastructure. Public investment in infrastructure is expected to produce
significant external effects and high profitability. The Government o f Senegal and the donors, in
acknowledgment o f the crucial role o f transport costs in economic competitiveness, launched the
Transport Sector Adjustment Credit (Program d 'ajustement structure1 des transport, PAST, 1991).
The Government continues to implement the Transport Sector Program (TSP) in order to complete
and consolidate the achievements o f the PAST. Other projects underway and planned include: urban


                                                                                        Schedule 1
                                                                                            Page 7

 roads, road maintenance, and the Urban Mobility Support Project. As o f 2003, 66 percent o f the
 paved and classified road network was in good or average condition, and this figure could reach 72
 percent in2004. However, the percentage o f the unpaved road network in good or average condition
 remains low: it was 19 percent in 2003 and is expected to increase marginally to 25 percent in 2004.
 The Government is planning to pave 300 kilometers of roadway and to construct 1,000 km o f
 unpaved roads each year.

 Social Sector Indicators: Education and Health

 32.    Increasing trends in the relative share o f the social sectors (education and health) in public
 current expenditures clearly indicate that these sectors are a priority for the Senegalese authorities.
 The share o f education in this type o f expenditure increased by over three points between 2002 and
 2004, from 32 to 37 percent. The health sector's share also increased over the same period, but at a
 slower pace, rising from 9.2 percent in 2002 to 9.5 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively, in 2003 and
 2004. It should also be pointed out that, relative to total public expenditures (current and capital
 spending), the education sector's share rose from over 19 percent in2003 to 21.8 percent in2004--an
 increase o f over 2.8 percent. The health sector, on the other hand, experienced a slight relative
 decline (of less than one point) in its share o f total public expenditures between 2003 and 2004 (7.2
percent and 6.4 percent, respectively).

33.     The share o f the consolidated investment budget devoted to the water sector, although below
the PRSP target (21.6 percent), rose from 6.8 percent in 2002 to 14.6 percent in 2003. In terms o f
current expenditure levels, the shares o f the social sectors surpassed PRSP targets by a wide margin.
In2002, current expenditures inprimary education represented 46.33 percent of the budget for that
sector. The figure for 2003 was 47.9 percent, compared to a PRSP target o f 44 percent. Inthe health
sector, the expenditure ratio was 17.5 percent in2002, compared to 18.7 percent in2003 and a PRSP
target o f 10percent.

34.     In the context o f ongoing capacity-building in the education sector, 2,543 classrooms were
built between 2000 and 2002; 65,800 school desks were distributed; 26 educational establishments
were entirely rehrbished; 31 administrative blocs were built; 29 health care blocs were built; 3 new
high schools were built; 13 departmental education inspectorates (Inspections Dkpartementales de
Z'Education Nationale, IDEN) were built and 10 refurbished; 4 middle schools were built in the
suburbs o fDakar; and structures were constructed for the development o fpreschool education. Inthe
near term, through its Ten-Year Education and Training Program (PDEF), the Government will
pursue its objective o f universal school enrollment by building about 2,000 classrooms per year,
hiringan adequate number o fteachers, anddistributing cost-free school textbooks.

35.     The Government has also devoted 16.38 percent o f the total public budget (current and
capital) to education and training. As a result, the primary enrolment rate rose from 75.8 percent in
2003 to 79.9 percent in 2004. At the same time, kindergarten admissions increased by nearly 5
percent between 2003 and 2004. The completion rate for the elementary level went from 44 percent
in2003 to 48.3 percent, for arelative increase ofnearly 10percent.

36.     In the area of health, much effort is still required in improving the allocation o f budget
resources. This sector's share o f the total public budget increased by only 1.43 percent between 2003
and 2004, from 7.70 percent in 2003 to 7.82 percent in 2004. The Government's commitments made
it possible to boost the rate o f DTC3 vaccination coverage for children aged from 0 to 11years by

                                                                                        Schedule 1
                                                                                             Page 8

 about 5 percent per year (65 percent in 2002 compared to 70 percent in 2003). Births assisted by
 trained personnel are believed to have increased by 5 percentage points between 2003 and 2004 (54
 percent and 59 percent, respectively).         However, the prevalence o f HIV/AIDS, although low,
 underwent a relative increase o f 0.3 percent between 2002 and 2003 (1.2 percent and 1.5 percent,
 respectively).



 11. Outlookfor the 2004-2007 period

 2.1.    Creationofwealth in a soundmacro-economicenvironment

 37.     37.    According to projections, Senegal's economy should experience strong growth in
 2004. Indeed, macro-economic objectives are to consolidate the achievements o f 2003 and reduce
 existing constraints. These objectives are consistent with the goal o f poverty reduction that require
higher growth rates accompanied by inflation control, particularly through the adoption o f sound
monetary and fiscal policies. The Government estimates real GDP growth at 6 percent in 2004, and
stable fiscal and current balance o fpayments deficits at 2.6 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively.

38.     The Government i s committed, with the IMF's assistance, to finalizing the second program
review o f the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) within a short timeframe, i.e., by the
end o f November 2004. This review will examine the new medium-tenn salary policy for the civil
service and the action plan to strengthen the financial sector derived from the update o f the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). It should be noted that the delay in carrying out this second
review was explained by the fact that the Government has taken a number o f steps to strengthen fiscal
transparency and procurement procedures. The third program review, to be completed by the end o f
the first quarter o f 2005 at the latest, will include the articulation o f a plan for greater private sector
involvement in the energy sector, and the adoption o f an agenda for strengthening good govemance
inthe public sector and improvingthe quality o fthejudicial system.

39.     Regarding public expenditures, the Government, despite its commitment to combat poverty
effectively, will adopt a prudent approach to the programming o f budget allocations and will
implement the reforms needed to eliminate the risk o f major financial imbalances originating from
the para-public sector.      The Government has assigned priority to improving public finance
management. Inthis connection, the budget deficit will be maintained at a sustainable level through
improved tax collection and prudent planning o f public expenditures. In order to boost revenues,
reforms will be pursued in order to strengthen tax administration, simplify the tax regime, rationalize
and progressively broaden the tax base and to combat tax fraud more effectively.

40.     The Government's prudent budget management i s aimed at maintaining the budget balance at
a stable level and to improve the efficiency o f public expenditure toward the priority sectors
identified in the PRSP, particularly agriculture, education, health, hydraulics, and sanitation. To this
end, the Budget Law for 2004 integrates the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which
constitutes the overall framework for the accelerated growth and poverty reduction program. It i s
based on the macro-economic forecast for 2003-2005, which underpins the three-year economic and
financial policy program. Revenues are expected to increase by 7.2 percent between 2003 and 2004.
A similar approach infavor o fPRSP prioritysectors is planned inthe draft budget for 2005.



                                                                                             Schedule 1
                                                                                                  Page 9

41.     In accordance with commitments made by the Government, the social sectors--particularly
health and education--will remain priorities in the allocation of budget resources. The 2004-05
budgets include the special hiring o f nearly 5,000 agents for these two social sectors under the
heading o f civil service recruitment.

42.     Monetary policy will continue to be aimed at stabilizing prices and consolidating foreign
exchange reserves, through the use o f market oriented mechanisms. The Government will place
particular emphasis on the creation o f an environment conducive to the mobilization o f savings
without direct recourse to the BCEAO, as well as to the financing o f the private sector, which i s the
engine o f growth.

43.     The accelerated growth strategy aims to make the private sector the engine of economic
growth. This primary instrument o f the Government in the fight against poverty depends on three
main factors: (i)satisfactory economic expansion over the medium and long term, i.e., a strong
potential for growth; (ii) strong job creation; and (iii)
                                                       international competitiveness so as to increase
the country's exports.

44.     The Government's accelerated growth strategy should achieve, over the medium and long
term, average GDP growth rates exceeding 7 percent per annum. It should benefit from the positive
macro-economic environment rendered possible by Senegal's attainment o f the HIPC completion
point inApril 2004, its eligibility for the "Millennium Challenge Account", and the establishment o f
the National Program o f Good Government (NPGG), which provides the basis for reforms o f the
public finance management (CFAA) andpublic procurement (CPAR) systems.

45.    Agriculture remains a priority sector for the Government. Indeed, its objectives include the
promotion o f alternative distribution channels for agricultural products through the development o f
domestic trade development policies that would improve the market information system and o f the
constitution o f food security stocks over the 2004-2006 period. Forestry resources will be developed
in the regions of Tambacounda and Kolda under the Forest Food Product Development Product,
which will make a significant contributionto the fight against poverty and malnutrition.

46.    Another priority i s the ongoing establishment o f the groundwork for crop diversificationover
the upcoming years, during which action plans will commence for cereal production, and in
particularly for maize, oilseeds, and manioc. Also planned are regional industrial hubs for the
processing o f agricultural products. In this connection, there i s also a plan to develop the artisanal
product-processing sector through the establishment o f multipurposeplatforms.

47.    The Government has also launched a new component of its strategy to improve living
conditions and infrastructures in the agglomeration o f Dakar. Rural immigration and a heavy
population concentration have reduced the attractiveness o f investmentsand generated unprecedented
economic costs for Senegal.       As a result, opportunities to foster strong economic growth are
compromised. The Government has therefore decided to initiate a development program that should
simultaneously help modernizethe city o f Dakar and relocate a number o f activities to other cities. A
vast development program for secondary cities i s under preparation. This strategy i s supported inthe
2005 budget and by a number o f donors' initiatives, including the World Bank.




                                                                                        Schedule 1
                                                                                           Page 10

48.     The promotion o f independent employment in rural and urban areas i s also a major PRSP
objective. To this end, specific activities will begininthe region o f Tambacounda. The promotion o f
women's micro-enterprises in rural areas will receive substantial support over the 2004-2005 period
in order to help enhance the economic and social status of women. In connection with the World
Bank's PRSC, the authorities have begun to strengthen vocational training, particularly through the
development o f a new strategy and the establishment of a new fund (FONDES) with private sector
support. Inthe area o f labor legislation, several decrees will be enacted in order to provide a more
secure framework for investors as well as for workers inspecific sectors o f the Senegalese economy.

49.     The private sector operating in Senegal is demanding a better-functioning judicial system.
This is also one o f the Government's major objectives, which will be supported by the World Bank
Support Credit. Having developed a new sectoral strategy in collaboration with the community as a
whole, the Government is now committed to allocating greater budgetary resources to this sector, to
launching a human resource development program, and to proceeding with the computerization of
courts inorder to enhance the efficiency o f Senegal's judicial apparatus.

50.     Regarding the development o f basic support to productive activities, the Government's
priority is energy development.          In this connection, expanded rural electrification and a
diversification o f energy sources are planned through a vast program to be carried out by the
Senegalese agency for rural electrification, ASER (Agence se`ne`galaised 'dectrfication rurale). This
program involves the implementation o f the rural electrification concession o f Foundiougne, the
promotion o f new and renewable energies, and the electrification o f villages that serve as the main
centers o f rural communities.

51.     Continued reforms inthe energy sector should result in the transfer o f SENELEC's assets as
planned under the privatization scheme. The regulatory and legal framework will be updated in
accordance with the Government's strategy for developing the electricity and hydrocarbons
subsectors. Private sector participation inthe energy sector will thus be better defined.

2.2.    Capacity-buildingandpromotionof basic social services

Health Sector

52.     Inthe health sector, the three-year (2005-2007) objective is an expansion of its budget share
from 6.5 to 7.5 percent. This figure would reach 9 percent in2010 and 13 percent in2015 so that the
objectives set for this sector will be achieved, namely: vaccination (DTCP3) coverage exceeding
80 percent, a 75 percent rate o f assisted births, and a rate o f primary curative medical consultation
exceeding 60 percent by 2010. Likewise, the proportion o f malnourished children is to be reduced
below 11percent and the seroprevalence o f HIV limited to 1 percent by the year 2015.

53.     The National Health Development Plan (Programme National de De`veloppement Sanitaire,
PNDS) will continue to guide policies in the health sector. Funding requirements to achieve the
sector's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be determined in the context o f the
development of a Sectoral Medium-Term Expenditure Forecast (Cadrage sectoriel des dkpenses b
moyen terme, CSDMT).        Recent actions that have produced conclusive results, such as free
vaccinations and free distribution o f vitamin A, will continue and options to enhance existing
nutritionprograms will be sought.



                                                                                         Schedule 1
                                                                                           Page 11

 54.     The design o f a system for subsidizing urgent obstetrical care, with the objective o f increasing
 the number of assistedbirthsbyreducingthe costs incurredbywomen, will be carried forward bythe
 Government. The prevention component of the anti-malaria effort will be expanded through the
 distribution o f subsidized chemically treated mosquito nets and treatments.

 55.     The Government has seized the opportunity provided by the PRSP progress report to broaden
 its initial PRSP strategy to include social protection.       In line with this concern of improving
 protection for vulnerable groups facing precarious circumstances, two strategic frameworks--one
 dealing with orphans and other vulnerable children and the other with underprivileged school
 enrollees-will be set inmotion. They will be followed by a national study of the elderly, which will
 helpto define Senegal's policywithrespect to its senior citizens.

 56.     World Bank assistance will be o f major importance in improving the overall performance o f
 the health sector.      The set of actions identified under the proposed PRSC emphasizes the
 establishment o f a strategic and institutional framework as well as the implementation o f a
 vaccination program that should make it possible to attain the objectives identified under the
 Millennium Initiative.

Education and Training

 57.     The education sector's share o f expenditures relative to total public expenditures is expected
to increase by over 3 percent, according to the 2004-2006 programs (21.8 percent and 24.2 percent,
respectively, in 2004 and 2006). The medium-termgoal i s to boost its share to over 25 percent by
2010, with a view to achieving universal enrollment.

58.      A variety o f actions defined under the Ten-Year Education and Training Program (PDEF),
which i s pursuing the goal o f a 70 percent enrollment rate and a 40 percent literacy rate, will be
strengthened in 2004.      This renewed effort is expected to make up for past delays incurred in
implementing the program.        The task will consist of finalizing the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) for the education sector (including secondary and scientific instruction and
scientific research) and, thus, optimize the intra-sectoral allocation o fresources toward the attainment
of the Millennium Development Goals. Inorder to improve school access inrural areas, the policy o f
school subsidies inregions with the lowest enrollment rates will be continued and measures will be
taken to improve the quality o f instruction.

59.      The updating of the Education and Training Program in 2005 will account for the need to
broaden the concept o f basic education. This need was identifiedin the letter o f educational policy
and inrecent initiatives (e.g., Education for All, MillenniumDevelopment Goals, etc.).

60.      The Government will give full attention to the recommendations emerging from the quarterly
reviews of the multiple Education and Training programs that are conducted with all donors and
partners in basic education. This mobilization should make it possible to boost basic education
indicators substantially by 2005, particularly inrural areas.

61.     For improving the coordination o f the Education and Training Program (PDEF), the
Government plans: (i) continue the construction and rehabilitation o f school infrastructures; (ii)
                         to                                                                              to
expand the Integrated Early Childhood Development Program (Programme de Dbveloppement
Intbgrk de la Petite Enfance, DIPE) to all regions; (iii)to build an average o f 2,000 elementary school


                                                                                           Schedule 1
                                                                                             Page 12

 classrooms each year; (iv) to decentralize the planning of the classroom constructionprogram; (v) to
 have the classroom construction program carried out by regionalized departments (e.g., IA, IDEN) ;
 (vi) to build about 10,000 elementary school classrooms and 6,000 middle school classrooms; and
 (vii) to enhance capacity at the middle andhighschool levels.

 62.     In addition, the Government will continue to pursue the goal of eradicating illiteracy and
 promoting vocational credentials for adolescents and young people by strengthening the existing
 monitoring/evaluationmechanisms with a view to interveningmore effectively with these groups and
 by implementing a vast three-year program to further address these issues. Also, the refurbishment
 and expansion o f basic education centers and o f vocational training for girls and boys aged 14 and
 older who are illiterate or excluded prematurely from the educational system will be supported during
 this period. Basic education will be broadened through the introduction of trilingual instruction and
 the provisionofvocationaltraining inKoranic schools (known as "daaras").

Improved Living Conditions

 63.     Access to safe water and adequate sanitation constitutes one o f Senegal's top priorities over
 the next three years. In the area o f hydraulics, particular importance will be attached to activities
 aimed at increasing the rate o f access to safe water through the construction o f boreholes and water
points. The Sectoral Policy on Water (Politique sectorielle pour I 'eau, PSE) plans to increase the
rate o f access to safe water (Le., the availability o f water no more than 15 minutes away), which
 currently stands at 87.9 percent, to 100 percent by 2010, through the construction and rehabilitation
 o f motorizedboreholes, and greater mobilization o f runoff for agricultural and livestock purposes. In
 addition, through measures planned under the Long-Term Sectoral Program for Water, efforts are
underwayto overcome the scarcity o fwater inthe city o fDakar.

64.      Inthe sanitationsector, thegoalisto improveaccessto adequateseweragesystems,througha
plan for rural sanitation and healtldhygiene promotion in local communities, as well as through a
pilot programo f rural sanitation and heatldhygiene promotion inthe region o f Thiks.

65.      In the area of safe water and sanitation,.the framework document adopted in 2000 will be
reviewed in order to account for new institutional developments, and the required enabling decrees
will be enacted. Based on the results of the pilot phases, specifications for the concessions and the
action plan for public/private partnership will be drawn up. The development o f an urban sanitation
planwill help addressthe hygieneproblem causedbythe shortage ofpublic latrines.

66.      Regarding the environment, Senegal i s committed to environmental protection and to anti-
desertification efforts. A program to restructure agro-sylvo-pastoral systems in the central coastal
area i s envisaged.

Promotion of Good Governance and Strengthening of the Capacities of the State

67.      From a political standpoint, 2004 will be devoted to preparation o f the next elections, i.e., the
legislative and presidential contests in2006 and 2007, respectively.

68.      With regard to local governance, the Government is committed to decentralization, but it
intends to conduct this process with all due deliberateness, taking the preliminary accompanying
measures, and particularly the adoption o f the legal framework for regionalization, in order to


                                                                                         Schedule 1
                                                                                             Page 13

 encourage real and irreversible progress toward the establishment o f effective decentralized services
 in the region.     Thus, through its Letter o f Decentralized Rural Development Policy (Lettre de
politique du de'veloppementrural de'centralise',LPDRD), the Government intends to help improve the
 quality o f life and access to essential basic services inrural areas, by allowing communities to assume
 responsibility for local affairs and by creating a framework enabling the various actors--Le., local
 populations and governments, the State and its regionalized departments, NGOs, the private sector
 and the development partners--to best deploy their respective skills.

 69.     The transfer o f State operations to local governments constitutes one o f the Government's
 strategic objectives o f the legal framework adopted in 1996. The authorities will continue to pursue
 this objective by accelerating funds transfers from the centralized State to local governments. In
 order to improve the implementation o f investment projects at the regional level, the management o f
 the consolidated investment budget (CIB) should be gradually devolved to local governments.
 Finally, the Government will continue to implement the institutional framework supporting the PRSP
 inthe regions andto ensure the harmonization ofregional development strategies with those planned
 at the sectoral level.

 70.     The improvement o f budgeting and financial procedures at the State level continues to be a
primary objective o f the Government, which is committed to ongoing implementation o f the
 C F M C P A R action plans according to the timetable defined with all donors. With regard to budget
execution, an important program o f decentralization i s planned for four key ministries (Le.,
education, health, justice and environment) beginning in 2005, after which it will be expanded to
additional ministries.      Independent external controls o f State accounts will continue to be
strengthened, in coordination with the General Audit Office. Inthe area o f procurement procedures,
the Government will continue its efforts to improve the legal and institutional framework. Particular
attention will be paid to the need to restrict the utilization o f special procedures (e.g., private treaty,
negotiated contracts, emergency procedures) by improving procurement planning within the main
spending ministries and by imposing quantitative limits on the utilization o f such practices.

71.      The Government will also continue its effort to increase civil servants' productivity. The
hiringpolicy agreed uponwith the IMFandthe WorldBankwill beimplemented, with a focus on the
priority PRSP sectors. In addition, a new salary policy will be put in place that will seek to reduce
the salary disparities with the private sector, to rationalize procedures and introduce performance
incentives, as well as to achieve a more uniform geographical distribution o f civil servants in
Senegal.

2.3.    Improvementof livingconditionsof vulnerable groups

72.     The particular attention paid to vulnerable groups will manifest itself through a program in
secondary cities and small rural towns that will ensure greater access for the poor to developed land
parcels and to strengthening support infrastructures. Inthis sector, Senegal i s planning, among other
things, to promote competitive territories and to restructure and regularize the land tenure regime in
certain peri-urban and rural zones. With World Bank assistance, the Government will develop an
overall strategy for supporting vulnerable groups; its primary goals will be to coordinate ongoing
interventions, including donor-supported activities, and to define priorities for the short and longer
run. A public expenditure review has been initiated that should make it possible to better define
ongoing programs and identify the best practices to protect vulnerable groups. At the institutional


                                                                                            Schedule 1
                                                                                               Page 14

level, an inter-ministerial committee will be created under the aegis o f the Ministry o f Labor and the
Ministry o f Family and Social Protection.

73.     Inorder to encourage the contribution of young people to economic growth, the program to
mobilize this age group in agriculture will be pursued, with particular emphasis on gender issues. In
order to develop an outreach strategy for semi-abandoned children, a five-year project will be
launched to handle the training and vocational insertion of young mendicants (talibks) in informal
Koranic schools.

74.     Continued efforts to improve the living conditions o f young people will include the following:
        -- the creation o f pedagogical training enterprises for young people inthe tertiary sector;
           the establishment o f a project to support and defend the interests o f adolescents;
        -   efforts to combat substance abuse.

75.     The Government has taken various measures to protect vulnerable groups. These include
(i)improved targeting o f poor areas and o f beneficiary groups through the creation o f the Social
Development Observatory; (ii)    protection o f children who are at risk and in trouble with the law,
through outreach to youngsters inprecarious circumstances and efforts to improve the economic and
social situation o f women through a program to promote their socio-economic interests; (iii)     better
status and enhanced mobility for handicapped persons, through the National Program for
Rehabilitation o f the Handicapped, and the promotion o f social awareness o f the living conditions o f
taZibks indaavas, and interventions to improve their situation.

76.     Mr.Wolfensohn,the Government of Senegal is convinced that its poverty reduction strategy
is coherent and relevant. The progress made, as has been described in this document, attests to the
will and commitment of the authorities to implement the Priority Program and Action Matrix of the
PRSP. The fact remains, however, that the attainment o f these ambitious, but realistic, goals that the
Government has set for itself, will require sustained effort at the financial and technical levels. The
interventions backed by the Poverty Reduction Support Credit developed with the help o f the World
Bankare part o fthis effort.



       Please accept, Sir, the assurance o f myhighest consideration.

                                     (As of November 3,2004)

Contact person: Mr.Reza Vaez-Zadeh (rvaezzadeh~,i,im.cprg,623 7107)

Background

The governmento f Senegal adopted its PovertyReduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) inJuly 2002.
Senegal's PRSP isbased on four pillars: (i)  wealthcreation; (ii) capacity buildingand the
provision o fbasic social services; (iii)
                                        improving the living conditions o fvulnerable groups; and
(iv) monitoring andevaluation. The IMFsupports this strategyby a three-year arrangement
underthe PovertyReductionandGrowth Facility (PRGF).

Staff Assessment of MacroeconomicDevelopmentsand Structural Reform

Economic developments were satisfactory in2003, with strong output growth (real GDP growth
of 6 Yi percent), almost no inflation, and a sizeable current account deficit (about 6 Yi percent o f
GDP) financed byforeign direct investmentand concessional financing, includingdebt relief
underthe enhancedHIPC Initiative.

In2004-05, the macroeconomic outlook is expectedtobe generally favorable, withcontinued
strongreal GDP growth (inspite o fthe adverse impact o fthe locust plague on agricultural
production in2004), low inflation, andrelatively low domestic and external debt (projected to
amount to about 7 percent and 32 percent of GDP respectivelyin2005). However, the current
account deficit is projectedto widen slightly (to about 7 percent of GDP), reflectingmainlythe
rise inoil prices.

Macroeconomic policyperformance has been sound. Fiscal policywas prudent in2003, with
low budgetdeficits (overall fiscal deficit of 1.4percent o fGDP in2003), growing revenues, and
tight control oncurrent expenditure, allowingmeasured increases incapitalandpro-poor
spending. The fiscal outcome for the first halfof2004 was betterthanexpected. Inan effort to
stimulate credit supply, the BCEAO loweredits key lendingrates by a further 0.5 percentage
points inMarch2004 (following a reduction of 1.5 percentage points in2003).

The structural reform agenda underthe PRGFemphasizes strengthening the efficiency and
transparency o fthe public sector andremoving impediments to private sector development.
Progress inthe structural areahas beenmixed, however, with important steps taken inthe
electricity sector but delays insome keypublic finance reforms and the privatization o f the
groundnut company.

Status of FundRelations

Senegal's three-year PRGFarrangement inthe amount o f SDR 24.27 million (15 percent of
quota) was approved on April 28,2003 and expires on April 27,2006. The first review under the
PRGFarrangementwas completedonFebruary 13,2004 and Senegal reached its completion
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative on April 19,2004. The last Article IV consultations
were concluded inApril 2003.

                                                                                          Page 1of 2

Inconcludingthese sessions, ExecutiveDirectorsurgedthe authorities to continuetobuildon
their prudent fiscal management ofrecent years, to strengthen the transparency or the
expenditure process, andto implement the structural reform agenda, especially inthe groundnut
andenergy sectors, with greater determinationand urgency to enhancethe efficiency o fthe
economy and eliminate recourse bypublic enterprises to budgetary support.

ExecutiveBoard consideration o fthe second review, the first PRSP progress report, and the Joint
Staff Assessment (JSA), originally scheduled for endJune, 2004, was delayed because o f a
serious breach o f fiscal discipline andtransparency that came to light inlate June 2004. In2003
the government signed contracts-and      thus de-facto-committed public resources-for
infrastructureprojects amounting to 1percent o f GDPwithout the requiredbudget allocations,
revealingimportant deficiencies infiscal discipline and transparency, as well as inprocurement
practices and laws. Contracts were signed with firms in2003 with the promise ofpayment with
resources from 2004 and2005 budgets. These projects are compatible with overall fiscal
sustainability but were not included inthe list o fpriority projects o fthe PRSP. They mainly
consist o froad infrastructurework andrenovation o f administrativebuildings inThies, the
second largest city of the country, which the authorities havejustified as part o ftheir policy to
create new regional focal points o fdevelopment insecondary cities inlinewith the wealth
creation pillaro f the PRSP.

Inorder to addressthese shortcomings, the authorities havestartedto implement the following
remedial actions: (i) this spending has been fully incorporatedinthe 2004 budget; (ii)   the
authorities will clearly identifybudget lines for all plannedinfrastructureworks intheir next
annual andthree-year public investmentprograms; (iii)     the authorities have committed to refrain
from signingany contract before the requiredbudget allocations are approved byparliament; and
(iv) the authorities will, inconsultationwith the World Bank and the IMF, adopt a series o f
measures aimed at improvingprocurement practices, anda revision o fprocurement laws with a
view to removingloopholeswhich facilitated these spending irregularities.

The staffwill visit Dakar inNovember to review program performance in2004, including the
implementation o fthese remedial actions, agree on the program for 2005, and hold the 2004
Article consultation discussions. It is expected that the second review andthe Article IV
consultation will be taken bythe IMF Boardinlate February2005. A staffreport will be
circulated indue course.
