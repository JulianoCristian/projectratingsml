3. Program Description

3.a. Overall program

1.      A series of three PRSCs was designed in 2004 in line with the policy framework of the
PRSP to cover the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. It would focus on five broad areas: (i) financial,
budgetary and administrative reforms within the state; (ii) strengthening the decentralization
process; (iii) improving health service delivery performance; (iv) promoting wealth creation; and
(v) protecting vulnerable groups. The focus on budgetary reforms was justified by the nature of
the IDA instrument (budget support) and was well aligned with Government priorities
established in the CFAA/CPAR action plans. Within this context, the actions that are supported
by the program aim to (a) help harmonize PRSP objectives with budgetary allocations; (b)
increase the degree of responsibility for budget execution in line ministries; (c) improve
transparency of the management system of the wage bill and the pension scheme in the public
sector; (d) improve internal controls and rationalize administrative expenditure procedures within
the Ministry of Economy and Finance; (e) improve the quality of the existing procurement
system; (f) rationalize administrative controls and external accounts; (g) strengthen management
instruments; and (h) improve human resources management within the public sector. The PRSC
program was designed to support the decentralization process, which was identified as a top
priority by the authorities and its main partners in the PRSP. It incorporated measures clarifying
responsibilities between central and local governments, especially in terms of revenues and
expenditures and their alignment with the PSRP objectives. The PRSC focus on health was to
help improve the performance of the health sector, so Senegal would be on the right track
towards the MDGs. The promotion of wealth creation was included in the PRSC program to
complement several other assistance projects from the World Bank in this area, and it therefore
justified a selective approach on improving the efficiency of the judiciary and on developing the
labor market, which would lead to productivity gains and lower unemployment. Finally, the
protection of the most vulnerable was perceived by the Senegalese authorities as a key pillar of
their Poverty Reduction Strategy. The PRSC program was aimed at improving the capacity of

vulnerable groups to benefit from social and economic services, including risk management
instruments, as well as protecting them against external risks that could potentially reduce their
living standards.

3.b. PRSC-1 description

2.      PRSC-I ­ approved in December 2004 for a total amount of US$30 million ­ was the first
operation in the series of three PRSCs. As noted above, the sequential operations aim to support
the following objectives based on selected policy measures drawn from the PRSP agenda: (i)
accelerate growth; (ii) improve living conditions of vulnerable groups; (ii) improve transparency
and capacity building within the state; (iii) accelerate the decentralization process; and (iv)
promote delivery of health services, especially in favor of maternal and infant care. PRSC-I gave
special attention to the last three areas by identifying a list of prior actions that needed to be met
by the Government before negotiations in early November 2004.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

3.      Prior to Board presentation of PRSC-I, the Government completed all planned prior
actions in the areas of (i) budgetary reforms; (ii) decentralization; and (iii) heath. Overall,
PRSC-I was successful in supporting the Government's effort in achieving reforms and results in
these three main areas supported by the program, as reported in Table 1 in the Annex. While
many actions focused on strategic and institutional reforms, other concrete results were obtained
by the authorities as noted by the positive evolution of a series of monitoring indicators. For
example, in the health sector, the commitment to improve the implementation of immunization
programs led to an increase in DTC3 coverage from 59 percent in 2003 to over 75 percent in
2004. More efficient budgetary procedures allowed the authorities to significantly improve the
execution rate of the investment budget, up from 67 percent in 2003 to 83 percent in 2004.
Progress was not only achieved in these first three areas, but also in the area of wealth creation
and the protection of vulnerable groups. Strategies were finalized in justice and in vocational
training, while an Interministerial Committee was created with the mandate to harmonize the
National Social Protection Strategy and monitor its implementation over time. Given the time lag
between policy actions and outcomes, the latter will be discussed in the programmatic ICR at the
completion of PRSC-III.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

4.      The four main factors that affected the implementation and outcomes of PRSC-I were:
(i) vested interests; (ii) vulnerability to external shocks; (iii) weak capacity; and (iv) slow
progress in internalizing the PRSC instrument.

5.      Vested interests can represent important obstacles to any reform, notably in view of the
forthcoming elections in Senegal. Influential groups may challenge PRSC-I-supported policies,
notably in the decentralization process and labor reforms, resulting in a slowdown of the reform
process, and policies may be subject to reversal after their implementation. Under the PRSC
program, these different risks arising from vested interests were mitigated by the fact that: (i) all
policy measures were implemented before credit approval; (ii) each operation was embedded in a



                                                  4

medium-term policy framework; and (iii) the Government was committed to programmatic
support through PRSCs. Yet, public spending irregularities in June 2004 and the lack of
commitment the Government to liberalize the groundnut sector (an effectiveness condition of the
Bank's Private Sector Adjustment Credit) had to be overcome before Board presentation of
PRSC-I in December 2004.

6.     While the risk of macroeconomic collapse, through unsustainable inflation or through
sustained negative growth, has been minimal in Senegal, there was the more insidious risk of
stalled growth and/or vulnerability to external shocks, such as the 2002 drought when GDP
growth declined to 1.1 percent. Over the past year, Senegal has been affected by two major
external shocks. First, it suffered from a locust invasion in 2004. Second, the recent increase in
oil prices has started to negatively affect the Senegalese economy, as evidenced by recent
estimates provided by the IMF and the BCEAO. Not only is Senegal largely dependent on oil
imports, but important sectors of activity, such as the electricity sector and the chemical industry
are also highly energy intensive.

7.     Achieving the program objectives could become more difficult over time as a result of
weak administrative capacity in Senegal and slow implementation. This risk is the highest at the
sectoral level (health) and in local governments. To mitigate this risk, the Bank and other donors
have provided increasing technical and financial support to enhance capacity at the local level,
and the Government has consolidated its strategy towards local communities in a new CDD
approach to be delivered in FY06.

8.     Slow progress in internalizing the PRSC instrument was manifest, notably in sectoral
ministries which are used to getting their funding through investment projects. This situation was
exacerbated by the unexpected delays in the IMF-sponsored PRGF and in the effectiveness of the
Bank's Private Sector Adjustment Credit, which prevented the inclusion of PRSC-I in the 2005
budget. These delays generated a great deal of uncertainty about the predictability of PRSC
support over time. The Senegalese authorities have committed to include PRSC-II in the
preparation of the 2006 budget.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

9.     Overall Bank performance was satisfactory. PRSC-I was an integral part of the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board on April 17, 2003 (Report IDA/R 2003-0044),
and its objectives were well aligned with the Government's development agenda, priorities and
policies set out in its December 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.

10.    Overall, Borrower performance was satisfactory. The good policy implementation record
in PRSC-I is an indicator of strong Borrower ownership and commitment to the PRSC program.
Five working groups were formed and followed up daily on the implementation of the reforms
under the supervision of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, via the PRSP Secretariat.

7. Quality at Entry Assessment by QAG of PRSC-I

11.   There was no QAG panel for PRSC-I.

8. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in the Series

12.   Overall, the satisfactory progress made since the approval of PRSC-I has warranted the
move to PRSC-II.

13.   Although PRSC-I was prepared in line with the 2005 budget, it was not included in the
Finance Law because of the uncertainties created by the lack of commitment to reforms in the
groundnut sector. The Senegalese authorities have committed to include PRSC-II in the
preparation of the 2006 budget.

14.   More attention should be paid to vulnerable groups in the subsequent operations, starting
with PRSC-II, as was emphasized in the first PRSP progress report and the Joint Staff
Assessment Note.
