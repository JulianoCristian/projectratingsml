Major actions will include : 1) creation of a\n            regulatory authority ( Office du Cafe ) to replace the\n            present OCIBU; 2) establishment of 5 autonomous companies (\n            SOGESTALs ) specialized in the management of coffee washing\n            stations and 1 autonomous company ( SODECO ) to operate the\n            existing two hulling factories; these companies as well as\n            the washing stations, will be open to private ownership; 3)\n            establishment of an Assets Management Facility to centralize\n            the administration of Government owned physical assets in\n            the industry; 4) establishment of an incentive based payment\n            system for producers and intermediaries and, for the\n            Government, establishment of a direct export tax; and 5)\n            establishment of a parallel export marketing facility for\n            private exporters to compete with the state owned BCC."}, "docdt": "1990-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
