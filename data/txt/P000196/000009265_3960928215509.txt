MEMORANDUM AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A COFFEE SECTOR PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recomendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for SDR 21.3 million (USS
28.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
vill be on standard IDA terms and 40 years maturity and will help finance
institutional restructuring and investments in the coffee sector.  Parallel
financing will be provided by France (USS 8.0 million equivalent) und
Belgium (US$ 1.0 million equivalent).
2.        Background.  The Burundi Government's strategy for growth and
foreign exchange earnings is critically dependent on its agricultural
sector. Agriculture, which accounts for about 502 of GDP, also generates
about 88% of the country's export earnings, 801 of which is from coffee.
The Government's agricultural strategy, while focusing on strengthening
services and increasing fooderop proAuction, also includes measures to
develop promising export crops. Coi-_-e, however, is likely to remain the
country's most important economic activity, at least for the next decade.
Because of its favorable agro-climatic conditions sad relatively low costs
of production, Burundi has a strong comparative advaitage to produce high
quality arasica coffee. Recognizing this potential, the Government has,
with the assistance of IDA and other donors, invested substantial sums in
modernizing its processing capacity to enhance the quality and export value
of its coffee. These measures have had encouraging results at-the
marketing end, where buyers are willing to pay premium prices for Burundi's
fully washed coffee, and at the production end where farmers have responded
positively to washing station discipline. About one-third of the country's
production is now fully washed. The Government intends to continue
developing this potential while, at the same time, improving the efficiency
and competitiveness of the industry by opening it to private sector
participation and implementing important struc:ural reforms.
3.        Coffee Policy and Strategy.  The objective of the Government's
coffee policy is to maximize earnings from the sector by exploiting the
country's comparative advantage as a relatively low cost producer of high
quality coffee and to improve the efficiency of the sector by opening it to
the private sector. The Government's strategy to do so starts with the
break-up of the de facto monopoly of BCC on exports. It remains
constrained by the politically justifiable decision to maintain a floor
producer price. The rationale is that quality premiums obtained by private
exporters of fully washed coffee should allow them to offer more
competitive prices to washing stations, which in turn would compete for
higher quality coffee by offering premiums to farmers over the Government
guaranteed floor price. This introduction of economic incentives will
increase the return on investment in coffee stations and other processing
facilities and make them attractive to private investors, which they are
not under the present administered pricing system.
4.        The major elements of the Government's strategy compriset (a)
investing in the technology and the facilities which ensure this quality;
(b) improving the efficiency at processing level through greater



2
specialization, private investor involvement, competition and market-based
prices; (c) introducing quality incentives at producer level; (d) improving
the efficiency at marketing level through the introduction of competition
by means of an auction facility for private exporters; and (e)
rationalizing the regulatory function through the establishment of the
Office du Cali, whose membership would include representatives of all
participants in the industry as well a Governmont, and by so doing
reducing the latter's direct involvement at the operational level of the
industry.
S.        Rationale for Bank Group Su§oMrt   The scope and content of the
Government's coffee policy and strategy conform with its broader economic
and structural adjustment objectives. They also conform with IDA's
strategy to assist the country In its macroeconomic and sectoral adjustment
efforts including that of supporting increases in the share of fully washed
coffee in the country's total coffee output, since such investments are
demonstrably viable and are justified maco-economically. The Coffee Sector
Project will help implement the country's coffee strategy and, by giving
special emphasis to opening en othorwise public sector monopoly to
competition and private investment, will open new opportunities in Burundi.
The experience thus gained will serve as basis for the design of future
interventions.
6.        Proiect Objectives.  The fundamental objective of the project
will be to improve the earning ability of Burundi coffee, the country's
principal export crop. To achieve this, the project will implements (Q) a
package of policy end institutional reforms to improve the efficiency of
the industry, to open it up to private investors end to attract private
capital; and (b) investments in coffee washing stations, coffee research
and training so as to increase the share of wet processed coffee, leading
to higher value exports.
7.        Project Description.  The project, which will be Implemented
over a period of five years, will support institutional and yoliv
reforms aimed at a more rational and more efficient organization of the
industry. Major actions will includes (a) the creation of a regulatory
authority (Office du Cafe) to replace the present OCIBU (a multiple
function parastatal which currently both regulates the industry and
participates at operational level). OCIBU will divest Its production
related facilities; (b) the establishment of 5 autonomous companies
(SOGESTALs) open to private Investors and specialized in the management of
coffee washing stations. They will take over the management of existing
stations from OCIBU and RDCs as well as manage new stations; (c) the
establishment of one autonomous company (SODECO), open to private
investors, to take over operations of the country's two hulling factories
from OCIBU; (d) tho replacement of the current administered pricing system
by market based prices for intermediaries, quality incentives for producers
and, for the Government, the establishment of a direct export tax to
replace the current levy on the margin; and (e) the establishment of an
auction facility for private exporters to compete with the state-owned BCC.
The major investments to be financed by the project will include: (a) the
phased construction of about 100 additional coffee washing stations, to be
built concurrently by both the public and the private sectors; (b) support



3
to coffee research with emphasis on solving marLAt related problems; and
(c) on industry-wide training program.
8.        Atreed Actions. Assurances with regard to the execution of the
reform measures have been included In a letter on coffee strategy which was
agreed with Government at negotiations. The detailed financial,
administrative and legal work leading to the rostructuring of the industry
will be completed during the project's first year and implementation of the
key measures will start in the project', second year. These measures
includet (a) Implementation of a new pricinglpayment system; (b) creation
of the Office du Cafe, SOGESTALs and SODECO; (c) launching of the auction
system; and (d) opening of the industry to private sector participation.
Credit resources to construct washing stations will be made available to
private investors through a line of credit substantially identical to that
of the on-going Apex Credit (Credit 1889-BU) which is expected to be fully
committed by the time private entrepreneurs will start borrowing for
vashing stations. Assurances have also been obtained con-cerning the
monitoring and review of the progress of the reforms as well as agreements
between the Government and IDA on the measures needed to modify the course
of the reform to ensure their implementation. A mid-term review (1992)
will be held to review progress and take corrective action. The project
will also include important measures to control the risk of washing station
pollution.
9.        Benefits.  Sector performance will benefit from increasee in
efficiency, competition and trassparence at all levels resulting from the
institutional reforms, increased competition, market based prices, and
greater private investor participation. The measurable benefits of the
project will result from: (a) quantifiable improvements in processing
coefficients; and (b) the incremental value of coffee sales as a result of
the shift from washed to fully washed coffee and from avoiding a likely
discount of the price of semi-washed coffee associated with Inadequate
quality control. Other benefits will result from the lowering of
production costs at farm level resulting from the suppression of hand
pulping which will free women's time, and the employment generated by the
additional washing stStions.
10.       Risks.  One of the main domestic risks of the project would be
delays by Government in ensuring the effective implementatlon of the
proposed reforms. However, the Government has shown willingness to work on
the basis of clear objectives and orderly steps to achieve them and, as
demonstrated during project preparation, has already given its agreement to
the major sector reforms so that most can be implemented early in the
project. Another element of internal risk concerns the skepticism on the
part of many in the industry as to when private investors would begin to
show interest. The general view is that the process will be gradual and
will depend to a large extent on (overnment commitment, the success of the
new payment system and the ability of the new entities and the washing
stations to demonstrate their viability. The review in 1992 will provide a
timely opportunity to assess the situation and amend the process as
necessary. A last element of risk would be the interest shown by private
exporters in participating in the coffee auctions. The success of the
latter will depend on their regularity and consistency and the degree of
collaboration of Burundi authorities at removing any remaining export



4
constraints.  Once a good reputation of the Burundi auctionS is established
there should be no problem in attracting buyers and increasing the
quantities marketed.
10.       Recommendation. I um satified thaet the proposed Credit will
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
