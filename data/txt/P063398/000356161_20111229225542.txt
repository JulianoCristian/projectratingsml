                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A.     Summary

1.     This restructuring paper (1) extends the closing date of Armenia Additional Financing for
Municipal Water and Wastewater Project by two months, from December 31, 2011 to February
28, 2012; (2) reallocates remaining proceeds for the original Project (P063398) and the
Additional Financing (P107614). This is the first extension of the Additional Financing Project.

2.    The Project Development Objective is to improve (i) the quality of services provided to
customers in AWSC's service area; and (ii) the sustainability of AWSC. The overall
implementation of the Projects is satisfactory.

B.     Status of the Projects

3.      All activities of the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project were completed by the
original credit closing date of February 28, 2009. As the closing date for the Additional
Financing for Municipal Water and Wastewater Project was set for December 31, 2011, the
closing date of the original Project was extended from February 28, 2009, to December 31, 2011.
The total amount of the credit was SDR 15,400,000, and the Project was fully disbursed. The
Bank team assessed the Project as satisfactory.

4.      Overall implementation of the Additional Financing is also satisfactory. The Project is
making good progress, and the performance of the management contractor (SAUR) is assessed
as satisfactory. Disbursements as of December 12, 2011 amounted to US$18.14 million, out of
the US$ 20 million Additional Financing, which represented 91% of the credit amount. The
credit is almost fully committed. Major performance indicators reveal continued progress
towards meeting the Project Development Objectives. The financial management and safeguards
compliance are satisfactory. There are no pending audits under the Project, and the client is in
full compliance with audit requirements.

C.     Proposed Changes

5.     The proposed reallocation of the original Project is also necessary to allow utilization of
savings generated from SDR/USD currency exchange. This amount will be used to cover the
management fee for the operator (SAUR) for the period from October 19, 2011 to December 31,
2011. The management contract with SAUR was extended effective October 19, 2011 to
December 31, 2013. A follow on Project, under preparation, is expected to pay the management
fee from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013.

6.      The proposed extension and reallocation of the Additional Financing is necessary to use
cost savings accumulated under the Project to prepare feasibility studies and designs for the civil
works in the town of Masis and the village of Ayintap. This will be the first and the final
extension of the Additional Financing.
