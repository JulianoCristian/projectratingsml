                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. Overall implementation has been satisfactory. Disbursements as of February 7, 2012 amounted to US$19.84 million, out of the US$ 20 million Additional Financing, or 99.2% of the
                         credit. All investments have been completed on-time. Ongoing activities to be financed by the Project are management fees for the months of January and February, 2012; and the
                         technical and financial audits of the Project.

                         2. Key performance indicators have met or exceeded their end-project targets:

                         - The average duration of water supply increased from 6h/day at the baseline to 15.02 h/day (target: 15h/day).
                         - Bacteriological safety compliance increased from 93% (baseline) to 98.2 % now (target 98.1%).
                         - Billing on the basis of metered consumption increased from 40% (baseline) to 82.2% now (target: 77.8%).

                         3. The management contract included 22 indicators that are being monitored. During the life of the Project these indicators have been showing good progress. According to the
                         Quarterly Report issued by the Operator, as of December 31, 2011, all performance indicators met or exceeded their end-of-Project target values. The PDO indicators and
                         Management report offer strong evidence that the PDO will be met by the closing date.

                         4. The independent technical auditor will assesses the operator's annual performance upon completion of the contract year. The independent review is in progress, and the
                         Government and the Bank expect to receive the report by end-February 2012. This assessment will enable the counterparts and the Bank to track the performance of the
                         management contractor during the seventh year of the contract.

                         5. In December 2011 the Government requested, and the team processed, a second level restructuring to extend the closing date for the Additional Financing by two months and to
                         reallocate the credit proceeds. Additional resources were allocated to the consulting services category from savings generated from SDR/USD currency exchange. The intention was
                         to cover the management fee for the operator, SAUR, (for October-December 2011), and to prepare a feasibility study for the rehabilitation of the water networks in Masis and
                         Ayintap. The latter is the first civil works package to be financed under the proposed Municipal Water Project, a repeater Project under preparation. The Bank provided its no-
                         objection to the Request of Expression of Interest to prepare the detailed design for Masis. Furthermore, the counterparts informed the team that in the interest of time and to prepare
                         a good quality design acceptable to the Bank, the Government would fund this activity using retroactive financing. Hence, savings from the Project would be used to pay the
                         management fee to the operator for the months of January-February, 2012.

                         6. Improving infrastructure service delivery has been a central theme in each of the past CASs throughout the life of the Project, including the current CPS for FY2009-2012. The
                         Project objective was relevant to and consistent with the development priorities of the Government as reflected in the PRSP (2005) and Sustainable Development Program (2008).
                         The Project objective was consistent with the Armenia CAS (2001), a main goal of which was financial and technical rehabilitation of Armenia's water and wastewater systems
                         through (i) improving utility financial discipline with better cash generation and expenditure management, (ii) improving water and wastewater services and rehabilitation of sector
                         infrastructure and (iii) increasing efficiency of water distribution and use.

                         7. Project activities were carried out according to Government and Bank priorities for the sector. Bank safeguards policies and technical, economic, financial, social, and institutional
                         considerations were adequately addressed during Project preparation and appraisal. The design of the Project reflected lessons learned from implementation of another Bank-
                         financed project in Yerevan water utility, enrolling public private partnership in managing the water resources. Private sector participation was determined to provide the most feasible
                         solution and proved successful. The performance based management contract introduced sound technical solutions under the Project which led to increased efficiency of the system.
                         Considering the significant progress that has been made under the AWSC management contract from 2004 until December 2011, a more advanced PPP arrangement, Enhanced
                         Management Contract, is planned under the new repeater project with an international private operator, with increased sector performance.

                         8. Project relied on reliable baseline data, diligent monitoring by the Project Monitoring Unit and by independent Public Services Regulatory Commission for collecting and reporting

                         data on outcome indicators. During supervision, the task team closely coordinated with other donors involved in the sector. The implementation issues were discussed with the
                         Government counterparts in a constructive manner and appropriate action plans were developed and agreed with the Government. During the life of the Project Government
                         demonstrated strong commitment to achieving development objectives and provided substantial support during preparation and implementation. There has been close coordination
                         and dialogue between Government counterparts and the Bank at all times.

                         9. The Bank continues preparation of the Project Implementation Completion Report (ICR), the objective of which is to assess (a) the degree to which the project achieved its
                         development objective and outputs as set out in the project documents; (b) other significant outcomes and impacts; (c) prospects for the project's sustainability; and (d) Bank and
                         Borrower performance, including compliance with relevant Bank safeguard and business policies. Furthermore, the Borrower confirmed that it initiated its evaluation of the
                         implementation of the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project, a cost benefit analysis, an assessment of the Bank and the Borrower's performance, and the extent to which the
                         purposes of the credit were achieved.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Despite an abundance of water resources in the country, water was only available a few hours a day in most cities and villages and at low pressure. With IDA support over the past
                         decade, Armenia has succeeded in improving access, reliability and quality of drinking water service with increased use of public-private partnerships (PPP), which has brought about
                         higher efficiency and improvements in quality of service to customers.

                         The Project is making a good progress. Overall implementation is satisfactory. Major investments under the Project are for improvements in the water supply and wastewater
                         collection/disposal system in Hrazdan city. All works in the city of Hrazdan have been completed on time. The Project is scheduled to close on February 28, 2012.
