                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The Project has made a good progress during the recent six months. The overall implementation of the Project is assessed by the team as satisfactory. Disbursements as of
                         December 9, 2011 amounted to US$18.14 million, out of the US$ 20 million Additional Financing, which represented 91% of the credit amount. All activities are expected to be
                         completed on-time. The ongoing activities and the remaining amounts to be paid under the contracts are presented below.

                         Total amount to be paid: $1.86million
                         -       Improvement of the Water Supply and Wastewater Removal Systems of Hrazdan town - $1,065,824

                         2. Major performance indicators reveal continued progress. In particular, most of the key performance indicators have met the end-project target, some have exceeded the target.
                         - The average duration of water supply increased from 6h at the baseline to 14.96 h (with the end of project target: 15h).
                         - Bacteriological safety compliance increased from 93% (baseline) to 98.2 % now (which has already met the target value).
                         - Billing on the basis of metered consumption increased from 40% (baseline) to 81.2% now (with the end of project target: 77%).
                         - Percentage of cities with minimal daily hours of water supply service increased from 68% (baseline) to 94% now (with the end of project target: 90%).

                         3. There are 22 indicators in total in the management contract that are being monitored. During the life of the Project these indicators have been showing good progress. According to
                         the Quarterly Report issued by the Operator, as of September 30, 2011, all performance indicators met the end-of-Project target values; moreover, most of them have exceeded the
                         targets. This progress indicates that the Project Development Objective will be met by the closing date.

                         4. The independent technical auditor assesses the operator's annual performance upon completion of the contract year (October 2011). The independent review is in progress, and
                         the Government and the Bank expect to receive the independent technical auditor's report in end-December 2011. This assessment will enable the counterparts and the Bank to track
                         the performance of the management contractor during the seventh year of the contract.

                         5. There are some unallocated funds under the Municipal Water & Wastewater Project (Credit No. 3893 AM) and its Additional Financing (Credit No. 4514 AM), and the counterparts
                         have requested reallocation of funds to provide more resources mainly to the consultant services category to allow for: (i) preparation of the feasibility study and designs for the
                         rehabilitation of water networks in the town of Masis and the village of Ayintap. This will be the first civil works package to be financed under the proposed Municipal Water Project, a
                         repeater Project under preparation; and (ii) utilization of savings generated from SDR/USD currency exchange to cover the management fee for the operator (SAUR) for the period of
                         October 19, 2011 through December 31, 2011. Furthermore, the counterparts have requested a two-months extension of the closing date of the Additional Financing (Credit No. 4514
                         AM) to allow completion of the feasibility study and detailed designs, as highlighted above. The team has conceded to this request and is currently processing a second level
                         restructuring of the Project.

                         reallocating funds among the categories, to allow for an effective utilization of unallocated funds.
