                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is making a good progress. The project will close in December 2011, and hence timely completion of all project activities is important, including the major investments for
                         improvements in the water supply and wastewater collection/disposal system in Hrazdan city. These on-going activities are being closely monitored by the Project Management Unit
                         (PMU) and the Bank team.
