"Ratings for the Municipal Water and\n            Wastewater Project for Armenia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            last supervision aide-memoire also noted that a key element\n            of the successful Public-Private Partnership (PPP) has been\n            the autonomy and independence granted by the Government of\n            Armenia (GOA) to the manager, even if monitoring and control\n            functions still have to be strengthened to cause the latter\n            meet its contract obligations. This manager was able to: (i)\n            implement an independently designed investment plan; (ii)\n            take some commercial risk; and (iii) properly manage\n            financial resources available and even to contribute some\n            working capital. Economic justification of projects that\n            mostly focus on rehabilitation of existing facilities and\n            operations is always difficult without reliable data before\n            and at the completion of the project. If energy savings are\n            usually easy to identify, time savings, reduction of coping\n            costs, health improvements and environmental improvements\n            are much more difficult to document. Future projects should\n            consider establishing good baseline information for better\n            supporting estimates of economic benefits in an environment\n            where the competition for financing is likely to remain strong."}, "docdt": "2012-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
