The purpose of the\n            investigation was to allow the WBG to determine if the WBG\u2019s\n            framework regarding anti-corruption has been violated. The\n            PIU published bidding documents for a contract financed by\n            the project (the contract). Evidence indicates that\n            following the bid submission, Company B informed the PIU\n            that: (i) it did not issue the manufacturer\u2019s authorization\n            form (MAF); (ii) it did not authorize Company A to offer its\n            goods for the contract; and (iii) the signature on the MAF\n            was not authentic, and the title of the signatory on the MAF\n            was incorrect. The WBG imposed a sanction of debarment with\n            conditional release on Company A, which extends to any legal\n            entity Company A directly or indirectly controls."}, "docdt": "2016-02-01T00:08:04Z"}
