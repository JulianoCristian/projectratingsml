                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Building on the successful experience of the PCF-funded CDD pilot, the proposed project would scale-up the direct transfer of public resources to local
                         community organizations in poor rural and peri-urban communities, by: (i) improving their access to basic social and economic infrastructure and support
                         income-generating activities by financing small-scale investments proposed, implemented and managed by community organizations; and (ii) improving
                         governance and building social capital of communities by increasing citizen participation and transparency in open decision-making processes.
                          Key indicators for the project would be (i) total resources transferred to OCBs over the life of the project; (ii) change in access to basic services as a function of
                         subprojects implemented by OCBs; (iii) cost-effectiveness of infrastructure investments, compared with traditional service delivery mechanisms, and (iv) cost-
                         benefit of productive subprojects.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         social sectors implemented by Community Based Organizations in 59 municipalities. Some 440 subprojects are still to be implemented, of which 400 are to be financed under the
                         recently approved second Additional Financing. The project is estimated to have an impact on 1.2 million people and disbursed US$24 million directly to the Community Based
                         Organizations. The subprojects are selected through a democratic process by the community organizations. The project also provides technical and management training and
                         capacity building to community organizations and their second-tier organizations. Because of its successful implementation, the project has received additional financing from IDA
                         and the total grant amount has increased to SDR40.9 million.
