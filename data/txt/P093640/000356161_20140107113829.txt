F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
Building on the successful experience of the PCF-funded CDD pilot, the objectives of the
Project were to scale-up the direct transfer of public resources to local community
organizations in poor rural and peri-urban communities, by: (i) improving their access to
basic social and economic infrastructure and support income-generating activities by
financing small-scale investments proposed, implemented and managed by community
organizations; and (ii) improving governance and building social capital of communities
by increasing citizen participation and transparency in open decision-making processes..

  Key indicators for the project were: (i) Number of communes (municipalities)
successfully managing direct transfers to community-based organizations (CBOs) for
community subprojects (SPs); (ii) Cost effectiveness/efficiency of direct transfers to
CBOs vis a vis traditional service provision; (iii) Percentage rural/peri-urban poor with
access to basic social and economic infrastructure (water supply, feeder roads, schools,
health posts); (iv) Percentage change in household assets, per capita incomes among
project beneficiaries; (v) Number of CBOs officially constituted and participating in
project development councils (COPRODEPs); (vi) Number of households expressing
awareness of PRODEP (participatory community development project) and its
objectives/activities/means of access; and (vii) Percentage change in Social Capital
Indices reflecting greater citizen participation in resource allocation decisions.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The statement of PDO was not revised but Key Performance Indicators were changed
and/or adjusted by two Board-approved Additional Financing operations. For the sake of
clarity and consistency with the ICR Guidelines, Appendix B as well as Section 3.2 of the
Main Text, Section (a) below presents results of the original PDO indicators as per the
PAD Results Framework in the third column. This is followed separately by the revised
indicators from the Restructuring in January 26, 2009 (1st Additional Financing, AF1)
further revised by the 2nd Additional Financing approved in May 2010 (AF2) as shown
in "Formally-Revised Target Values" (fourth) column. Final actual values achieved for
the original project use the AF1 Board approval date of January 26, 2009 (actual results
data are from March 31, 2009, the closest data set available at that time). Assessment of
outcome for the post-Restructuring period uses the AF2 revisions as the final version of
indicators/targets. Annex 2, Appendix 1 shows the evolution of the Results Framework
from 2005 to 2013.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 Country and Sector Background. For several decades, Haiti struggled to emerge from
a cycle of chronic political instability and internal conflicts that devastated its economy,
weakened state and local institutions, exacerbated social tension and polarization, multiplied poor
governance practices and maintained or deepened poverty. By 2003, Haiti’s political and
financial situation had become very uncertain. There was political upheaval and the security
situation was severely deteriorating in urban and rural areas. Because of declining economic
governance, external aid dried up and the economy went into a downturn. The World Bank and
many other donor agencies withdrew their support. Armed opposition forces entered from the
Dominican Republic to remove President Aristide from power. He left the country on February
29, 2004 and a transitional government took office in a fragile state environment that prompted
the mobilization of a UN peace-keeping force that is still operating in the country until this date.
1.1.2 Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF). The Transitional Government (TGOH) led
the donor community in putting together an Interim Cooperation Framework seeking to increase
political and social stability and jump-start the economy. The ICF presented the broad themes of
TGOH’s strategy: (i) strengthening political governance and promoting national dialogue;
(ii) strengthening economic governance and contributing to institutional development;
(iii) promoting economic recovery; and (iv) improving access to basic services.
1.1.3 Rationale for Bank Involvement. In order to provide some assistance to Haiti, the
World Bank (WB) financed in 2003 a USD1.0 million Post-Conflict Fund (PCF) grant for a rural
Community Driven Development (CDD) pilot project contracted to the Pan-American
Development Foundation (PADF) 1 in two rural border areas. The grant enabled the Bank to
maintain minimal activities in Haiti, while preparing for an eventual reengagement. The grant
also tested the CDD methodology developed in northeast Brazil.
1.1.4 In 2004, the Bank renewed its official relations with Haiti. To initiate activities rapidly
on the ground, the Bank provided a USD1.0 million Low-Income Countries under Stress
(LICUS) grant in 2005 to finance a Labor-Intensive and Basic Infrastructure Rehabilitation Pilot
Project. This grant strengthened the national capacity (government and community-based
organizations-CBO) to manage and implement 23 community-driven small-scale infrastructure
subprojects (SPs) in six rural municipalities and to provide short-term income generation
opportunities.
1.1.5 The successful PCF grant demonstrated that CBOs could manage public funds and
implement small SPs and prompted the Bank to propose a scaled-up USD38.0 million CDD
project (PRODEP). The intention was to use CDD mechanisms to repair the social fabric,
strengthen local organizations and provide the poor with the means/funds to address pressing
local investment needs, thereby breaking the cycle of their exclusion. The CDD approach was
expected to increase transparency in the allocation of investment resources and the likelihood that
these resources would respond to local demand. The democratic selection of SPs was aimed at
re-generating social cohesion within a population that was strongly divided politically. The goal
was to promote community empowerment and social trust and “restore hope” in a fragile country
that had gone through significant political and economic crises.

    PADF is an offshoot of the Organization of American States. The WB provided the PCF grant directly to PADF.

1.1.6 The Project would contribute to three of the four ICF pillars by: (i) improving local
economic governance through sound management of common resources and establish transparent
processes for selecting SPs and the suppliers of goods and services; (ii) creating local economic
opportunities; and (iii) financing SPs that created or improved basic services such as education,
health and sanitation.
1.1.7 PRODEP’s linkage to the Bank’s IDA Transitional Support Strategy (TSS). In
January 2005, the Bank’s Board of Directors endorsed a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for
Haiti, which included up to USD150 million in credit commitments (grants) over a two-year
period. A key feature of the TSS was poverty alleviation through improved access of
communities to basic services and infrastructure. PRODEP was closely aligned to the TSS whose
two-year strategy supported: (i) basic services provision; (ii) job creation; (iii) rehabilitation of
areas devastated by floods in 2004; and (iv) community initiatives in local development. The
TSS was also intended to strengthen governance and institutions, thereby improving
transparency, and promoting inclusion and consensus building on development priorities.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
1.2.1 Building on the successful experience of the PCF-funded CDD pilot, the objectives of the
project were to scale-up the direct transfer of public resources to local community organizations
in poor rural and peri-urban communities, by: (i) improving their access to basic social and
economic infrastructure and support income-generating activities by financing small-scale
investments proposed, implemented and managed by community organizations; and
(ii) improving governance and building social capital of communities by increasing citizen
participation and transparency in open decision-making processes.
1.2.2 The Project (PRODEP) represented the first stage of a planned ten to fifteen-year
engagement with Haiti on CDD, the end-goal of which would be to mainstream CDD as a
mechanism for the transfer of public resources to the local level within government budgetary and
planning processes. The proposed project was a significant first step in fostering critical elements
that, over time, could evolve into a decentralized approach for funding local CDD initiatives.
1.2.3 Original Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for the project were as follows: (i) 60
communes (municipalities) successfully managing direct transfers to community-based
organizations (CBOs) for community SPs; (ii) cost-effectiveness/efficiency of direct transfers to
CBOs vis-à-vis traditional service provision; (iii) percentage of rural/peri-urban poor with access
to basic social and economic infrastructure (e.g., water supply, feeder roads, school, health posts);
(iv) 20% change in household assets, per-capita incomes among project beneficiaries; (v) 20%
change in Social Capital Indices reflecting greater citizen participation in resource allocation
decisions; (vi) 2,000 CBOs officially constituted and participating in COPRODEPs; and (vii) 300
households expressing awareness of PRODEP and its objectives/ activities/means of access.2
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
1.3.1 The PDO were not changed. Several original PDO indicators (KPI), however, were
dropped or revised at approval of both the first and second Additional Financing grants (AF1 and
AF2) because they were unclear, not relevant or impossible to measure. The second indicator
intended to compare the efficiency/effectiveness of the CDD approach with traditional
government services was dropped at Board approval of AF1 because similar government services
were not provided in Haiti. The fourth indicator was dropped at AF1 - most SPs were unlikely to

have any direct impact on household monetary income or assets – and substituted by an indicator
of productive SP sustainability. The fifth indicator was revised at AF1 then reintroduced at AF2
in its original form. Other minor adjustments were made including to targets. Annex 2, Appendix
1 shows the evolution of the results framework over time.
1.3.2 AF2 Board approval saw further changes to KPIs. The following became the final
versions to be measured at closing: (i) in 59 municipalities, CBOs have successfully managed
direct transfers for community SPs; (ii) 1.2 million residents in 59 Municipalities of the Project
area improved their access to basic social and economic infrastructure and/or benefits of
productive SPs;(iii) 75% of productive/income generating SPs within the 59 Municipalities are
operational and are being maintained 12 months after completion; (iv) 3500 CBOs in the 59
Municipalities are officially constituted and participating in CADECs; (v) 60% of the adult
population in the 59 Municipalities express awareness of PRODEP and its objectives/means of
access; and (vi) 20-point change in Social Capital Indices, reflecting greater citizen participation
in resource allocation decisions.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 Targeted beneficiaries were 195,000 poor residents of 59 municipalities (of the 140) in all
Departments of Haiti. The municipalities were selected based on poverty criteria contained in the
GOH 2004 poverty map and geographical and operational criteria (such as proximity to other
communes, road access). The project’s baseline study estimated an average annual household
income of USD750 equivalent and only 18.5% of the residents in the selected municipalities were
estimated to have easy access to quality water supply, health facilities and schools.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
1.5.1 Component 1: Community SP funds, management and support (USD34.0 million –
IDA USD 31.7 million) was to finance in 55-65 communes of rural and peri-urban Haiti an
estimated 1,816 demand-driven SPs costing on average not more than USD 20,000 (of which the
project would provide some USD17,500 and direct beneficiaries the rest, mostly in kind). The
SPs would be identified by CBOs and later prioritized in representative Project Development
Councils (COPRODEPs). SPs included basic socio-economic, small-scale infrastructure,
productive and social investments covering a wide spectrum: roads, water supply, energy, soil
conservation, public amenities, livestock, grain mills, community stores, agro-processing,
markets, irrigation, schools, health facilities, community centers, cyber cafes, community radio
broadcasting and other investments (see Annex 2).
1.5.2 The component also financed non-governmental service providers (Maitres D´Ouvrage
Délégués – MDODs) mobilizing CBOs to participate in the project, and providing training and
technical assistance to CBOs and COPRODEPs to fulfill their roles in financing, implementing,
operating and maintaining the SPs. It also financed a campaign to inform potential project
beneficiaries of the project’s objectives and avenues for participation.
1.5.3 Component 2: Capacity-building and technical assistance (USD3.6 million – IDA 3.6
million) was to be implemented by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The component
included training for COPRODEPs, municipal governments and regional representatives of
central government ministries, MDOD staff, BMPAD staff and consultant services.
1.5.3 Component 3: Project administration, supervision, monitoring and evaluation (USD
2.7 million – IDA 2.7 million) financed the incremental costs associated with project
implementation by the PCU including the establishment of a Management Information System
(MIS), technical and financial audits and impact evaluation studies.

1.6 Revised Components (N/A)
1.7 Other significant changes
1.7.1 Natural disasters and Additional Financing grants: Four hurricanes and tropical
storms devastated the country in 2008. As part of the recovery efforts, Haiti received in 2009 a
first IDA Additional Financing grant of USD 8.0 million (AF1)3. The additional funding was to
finance investments in 32 municipalities many of which had suffered severe flood damage.
1.7.2 Following the January 2010 earthquake, Haiti received a second AF of USD15.0 million
(AF2) to help cope with the return of thousands of residents from earthquake struck Port-au-
Prince to rural areas. Parallel grants from other programs included: (i) the Japan Social
Development Fund’s “Cash for Work” grant of USD3.0 million in urban areas; and (ii) the
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) approved in 2011 a USD10 million grant to finance 180
SPs in 32 municipalities, using the PRODEP methodology.
1.7.3 Implementation changes: AF2 (approved in May 2010) introduced implementation
changes based on lessons learned from the preceding implementation period: (i) COPRODEPs
were converted into CADECs (Community Development Councils) to reflect a broader civil
society role in the municipality; (ii) productive SPs were subjected to a more rigorous screening
and follow-up methodology; (iii) more attention was paid to SP quality and maintenance; and
(iv) municipal SPs became eligible for financing of up to USD55,000 per SP.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
2.1.1 Background analysis. The Bank prepared the project in the short period of four months
(from February to June 2005), driven by emergency post-conflict needs. The preparation team
focused on the institutional arrangements and the operational project implementation mechanisms
included in the project manual. The social analysis was based on the PCF pilot project
experience and beneficiary assessments. The Government conducted an environmental
assessment with public consultation and the Bank did a cost-benefit analysis of four productive
SPs, a procurement assessment and a financial management review. The preparation team relied
on the experience of the PCF grant pilot operation which had developed the SP selection and
implementation methodology as well as the financial management procedures. The project also
benefited from Bank experience gained in the long-standing engagement in the northeast Brazil
and several members of the Bank’s Brazil team participated in project preparation.
2.1.2 The initial goal was to have a swift implementation start-up and provide the rural areas
with “hope”, as stated explicitly in the Bank’s TSS. Project preparation had weaknesses in two
key aspects: (i) design of the capacity-building component 2 was left to be developed during
project implementation; and (ii) the financial analysis might have emphasized the complexity and
riskiness of productive SPs, as well as the conditions needed for their success.
2.1.3 Project Objectives and Indicators: The PDOs were realistic and reachable, important
for the country, and aligned with the ICF and TSS. They responded to the country’s
circumstances and development priorities, and focused on the outcomes for which the operation
could reasonably be held accountable. The Project’s end goal could have been better-formulated
so as to ensure a participatory role for civil society in decisions affecting local development. The

  In June 2008, the World Bank approved a USD16.0 million grant for PRODEPUR, a similar operation in urban areas.
In 2010 PRODEPUR also received USD30.0 million in additional financing.

                                                       4
results framework presented some weaknesses: several monitoring indicators were not SMART
(specific, measurable, achievable, results-based and time-bound), while others had no quantitative
targets. Since the project was demand driven, the project team struggled estimating targets.
2.1.4 Institutional arrangements: Finding the Project’s appropriate institutional location was
challenging. At the time, FAES (the Haitian Social Investment Fund) was over-burdened and
going through its own leadership and institutional crisis as was the case for most state and local
institutions. No government Ministry was set up to house a multi-sector project focusing on civil
society community organizations, and local institutions, some of which had still to be created.
The Project came to be located in the PL-480 Management Office under the Ministry of Planning
and External Cooperation. The office was an autonomous public institution to: (i) receive and
monetize food aid from international donors; and, (ii) identify and fund government development
projects with relevant institutions and/or agencies in areas such as road construction, agriculture,
education, health and commerce. It was converted in 2007 into the Bureau de Monétisation de
l’Aide au Développement – BMPAD – Office for the Monetization of Development Aid, under
the Ministry of Finance. A small PRODEP PCU was established. Because of BMPAD’s lack of
experience in managing small-scale rural investments, field operations were contracted to NGOs.
2.1.5 Project design: The basic project design was solid and no major changes or project
design restructurings were needed during implementation, apart from incorporating lessons
learned. The design incorporated the PCF pilot experience, lessons learned from the Northeast
Brazil program and widely-accepted CDD methodologies. The decision to delegate project field
implementation to two prominent NGOs was influenced by the general weakness of public
institutions in Haiti. To garner greater government ownership, it would have been prudent to get
input from local (albeit weak) agencies of line Ministries, and to assign more weight to municipal
priorities. A project Steering Committee that included relevant line ministries (e.g., Public
Works, Agriculture) was proposed for preparation and implementation, but was not operational.
To encourage more municipal buy-in, AF2 included financing for larger SPs backed by
municipalities. This improved the relationship between COPRODEPs/CADECs and local
authorities and increased the chances of longer-term SP sustainability.
2.1.6 Project design faced a trade-off on two issues: (i) Subproject size – and resulting impact –
was limited by both the ceiling of USD20,000 (of which USD17,500 project support), and weak
capacity of inexperienced CBOs to efficiently manage SPs at greater scale. Demonstrating
burgeoning social capital, CBOs quickly circumvented the size problem by banding together to
implement larger SPs, i.e., the combination of joint collaboration between several CBOs, a higher
aggregate investment budget and increasing SP scale, strengthened impact. Subprojects amenable
to this approach were primarily infrastructure – road rehabilitation and buildings (e.g.,
community centers and classrooms); and, (ii) As with CDD projects in many countries and for
similar reasons – weak ministries, lack of a decentralization policy framework and thus few
viable alternatives for channeling funds to poor communities - the Project supported a civil
society structure (COPRODEPs) parallel to local authorities, a conscious choice to make the
project responsive to urgent community needs, but challenging to sustain in the long run.
2.1.7 Adequacy of Government commitment: GOH authorities focused heavily on restoring
political democracy and social stability after the upheavals of 2003/4 and relied on Bank
experience in CDD to prepare the project. The Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation
and the Office of PL-480 strongly supported the project but did not have the resources to
participate fully in preparation.




                                                 5
2.1.8 Risk assessment: The preparation team identified the project’s main risks. The project
was qualified as a high risk-high reward project with adequate risk mitigation measures. Many of
the identified risks never materialized. Instead, natural disasters disrupted project implementation.
2.1.9     Quality at Entry: No Quality at Entry evaluation was carried out.
2.2       Factors which influenced project implementation:
2.2.1 External factors: Public sector weakness, lack of a decentralization framework,
political instability, hurricanes and the 2010 earthquake in and around Port-au-Prince had
important external impacts on the project.
         Public sector weakness: Haiti has a weak public sector management capacity. Many
          public sector institutions depend on external assistance to carry out basic functions.
          Institutional capacity is increasingly concentrated in the NGO service sector attracting
          more qualified staff and paying higher salaries. As a result, the Project contracted two
          NGOs that successfully carried out all fieldwork.
         The lack of an adequate legal framework for decentralization: This negatively affected
          the sustainability of PRODEP’s institutional objectives. TGOH created decentralization
          decrees that would have allowed the project to flourish under municipal governments
          with some authority and budgets, but never published them. As a result, the project
          lacked the financial partnership/dialogue with municipal governments that constitutes an
          important factor in the longer-term sustainability of CDD mechanisms.
         Political and climatic instability: The period from 2004 to the elections of 2006 was
          politically unstable with important security problems. The food price riots of 2008 with
          the corresponding fuel shortages was another difficult period. On top of this, Haiti had to
          cope with the floods from hurricane Noel (2007) and four hurricanes in 2008. The floods
          diverted the focus of GOH, BMPAD, PRODEP and MDOD to support for short-term
          disaster solutions in project areas. The Bank reacted with AF1 which was allocated to 32
          municipalities many of which showed flood damage. Many AF1 SPs involved
          rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility
          of CDD for decentralized post-disaster recovery.
         Disruptions and delays caused by the 2010 earthquake: Government operations almost
          completely collapsed but BMPAD and MDOD provided substantial support. The Bank
          entrusted BMPAD with AF2-USD15.0 million and additional programs (such as housing
          reconstruction–USD29.0 million). BMPAD struggled to absorb these additional funds
          and its sudden business growth made an organizational restructuring necessary.
2.2.2 Internal factors. MDOD performance, PRODEP’s initial focus, BMPAD organization
and management and the fiduciary procurement and financial management requirements were
four important internal factors which influenced project execution.
         MDOD capacity: PRODEP’s strong achievements are mainly the result of the MDODs’
          performance and delivery capacity: Both MDODs are responsible entities with long-
          standing experience in Haiti and in this type of SP design and implementation. The
          MDODs carried out their contract in a professional and competent manner without close
          field supervision from BMPAD. PRODEP’s initial focus was on democratic and
          transparent SP selection and speedy implementation: The audits and evaluation studies
          were adamant that this was successful and one of the Project’s strongest points.



                                                  6
       BMPAD’s limited experience with rural projects: BMPAD was created to convert in-
        kind development aid into cash for the Treasury and had limited understanding of
        PRODEP’s supervision and monitoring needs. Initial misunderstandings about project
        management functions created tensions between the PCU and BMPAD’s general
        management, which were reduced after the 2011 management restructuring.

       The Bank’s fiduciary procurement and financial management requirements were applied
        to communities with little or no experience in administrative matters: MDOD’s focus
        and resources were partially absorbed into administrative matters4 assisting the CBOs in
        complying with the Bank’s procedures, and away from SPs’ technical implementation,
        sustainability and organizational skills development. However, once the systems were in
        place they could be relied on to deliver at the local level what very few others could in
        Haiti.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
2.3.1 Design: The monitoring arrangements as described in the PAD were in accordance with
generally accepted practices. They included the establishment and operation of a Management
Information System (MIS), technical audits, monitoring and evaluation reports. Design of the
Results Framework was weak and confusing. As noted earlier, not all indicators were SMART,
while some had no target numbers. During the design of AF1 and AF2 the preparation teams
adjusted some indicators to improve SMART factors and include targets.
2.3.2 Implementation: M&E development was complicated due to lack of capacity.
Reporting depended almost entirely on data collection by the MDODs. BMPAD invested in a
MIS, but internet data transmission problems between MDOD field agencies and BMPAD
limited its use. A new MIS became operational only in 2012 and is now used for the Bank’s
PRODEPUR-Habitat grant and the PRODEP-Caribbean Development Bank follow-up project.
2.3.3 Mid-term Review (MTR): The MTR mission report provided inputs to the redesign of
the Results Framework for AF1. The MTR evaluation report, combined with a BMPAD project
evaluation workshop (December 2009) presented important recommendations. They were
incorporated into AF2 implementation, including inter alia: increased focus on SP technical
quality and sustainability, development of a productive SP strategy, improving relations with
municipalities, and launching of a training and institutional development program.
2.3.4. Impact Evaluation: The quality of the Project’s impact evaluation report was mixed.
The report prepared in 2012 by a French/Haitian consortium includes a good social impact
analysis which was a quasi-experimental evaluation conducted through 480 individual surveys of
randomly-selected participants, including a comparison group. Other sections of the report reflect
the opinions of consultants on 60 randomly-selected SPs. Social aspects of the final evaluation
were strong but the end-product was - at least in part - a series of anecdotal opinions. This
reflects the difficulties the project had in selecting a good consulting firm.
2.3.5. Utilization: Most conclusions and recommendations of the audits, MTR report and
BMPAD’s December 2009 workshop were incorporated into AF2. The 2012 technical audits
resulted in a program to upgrade the operational status of some 150 weaker SPs.

 Although the CBOs received the funds in their account, the Bank and BMPAD held the MDOD responsible for the
use of the funds and possible mismanagement by the CBOs, including mis-procurement.

                                                     7
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
2.4.1 Safeguards: Safeguard policies applicable to the Project were Environmental
Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01), Pest Management (OP/BP 4.09), and Cultural Property (OP 4.11).
The potential adverse impacts from PRODEP investments were generally minimal. BMPAD
focused on: (i) upstream screening of all SPs to weed out those with serious environmental
impacts, and (ii) awareness-raising among the communities and MDODs. Given the large
portfolio of SPs and the small size of BMPAD’s safeguards team, supervision was challenging.
BMPAD sought to alleviate this supervision gap by employing interns to audit impacts and
safeguards implications across the portfolio, an activity that led to a more targeted oversight. No
pest management issues arose as few SPs concerned agriculture involving pesticides. No cultural
property issues were identified.
2.4.2 The supervision missions rated Safeguards as Satisfactory in 17 of the 20 ISRs. In 2010,
Bank supervision identified some potential environmental issues in a limited number of SPs and a
Bank environmental specialist visited Haiti in 2011, recommending a strengthening of BMPAD’s
environmental unit. BMPAD added staff to the unit and introduced stricter screening procedures.
Due to issues raised above the rating dipped to MU in 2012 but was upgraded to MS by the final
supervision based on BMPAD’s improved performance with regard to staffing and screening.
2.4.3 Procurement: The six ex-post procurement reviews did not identify any significant
procurement issues, only some teething problems at the outset. BMPAD employed a
procurement specialist and BMPAD and the CBOs complied with the procurement requirements
of the Operational Manual. The first MDOD contracts covering 32 municipalities were awarded
on a sole source basis; the second MDOD contracts for 27 municipalities were awarded through
an 18 months-long quality and cost-based selection procedure. Further contracts for AF1 and
AF2 were considered extensions of the second contracts. The CBO procured all items through
price comparison procedures (shopping) after training by MDOD and under MDOD supervision.
Procurement is rated Satisfactory.
2.4.4 Financial Management (FM) and audit: From 2009 through 2013, FM showed some
strains. Submission of financial audits was late and action plans addressing audit conclusions
were slow to be developed and implemented. Financial management is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory primarily because of: (i) delays in the submission of financial audit reports; and
(ii) misunderstandings in the Ministry of Finance about requesting a reallocation of funds (Level
2 restructuring) in the final project stages.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.5.1 The Bank’s original objective was to finance a sequence of follow-up projects that would
make CDD a major development policy instrument in Haiti. CDD is very appropriate for a
fragile country like Haiti; the success of PRODEP in rural and PRODEPUR in urban areas
(particularly after the earthquake) shows the potential and effectiveness of the CDD methodology
in such contexts.
2.5.2. A follow-up CDD operation in rural areas is not in the current Interim Strategy Note.
The reasons for this discontinuation lie in: (i) changed Government priorities after the 2010
earthquake focusing on reconstruction ; (ii) lack of a clear vision on how to proceed with
decentralization (or de-concentration) within the Government as well as an absence of policy
dialogue on decentralization and on the integration of CDD into local development policies
between Government and partners which hampers; and (iii) BMPAD did not proactively
communicate the project’s achievements to the new Government. Further analytical work is
being launched out to take stock of local development policies and underpin their integration with

                                                8
potential new CDD operations. The absence of an immediate follow-up operation does not
preclude a long-term Bank engagement with rural CDD in Haiti. CDB is taking over a part of the
program (US$10 million) in more limited geographical area, successfully applying many of the
lessons learned from PRODEP. On the basis of these same lessons, preparation is also ongoing to
channel additional resources to urban communities through PRODEPUR (PRODEP’s urban
equivalent), including for cities outside of Port au Prince.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
3.1.1 Relevance of PDO. Transferring public resources to CBOs to improve their access to
basic social and economic infrastructure and support income-generating activities (while
improving governance and building social capital) was relevant from the onset of the Project and
remains relevant to date. At the time of appraisal, the public sector was disorganized due to acute
governance problems and an impending rebellion. The Bank recommends CDD approaches in
post-conflict and fragile situations5 because they have the potential to address urgent community
needs and to serve as a catalyst for building healthier social and political dynamics. Moreover,
the Project supported three pillars of the TGOH’s Interim Cooperation Framework. As explained
below, the PDO remain relevant because of the lack of decentralization in Haiti.
3.1.2 Relevance of design and implementation: CDD remains a relevant instrument for
regional development and for the implementation of the current IDA strategy. The earthquake
imposed new government priorities reflected in the 2010 Action Plan for National Recovery and
Development of Haiti with emphasis on reconstruction. More recently, the government of
President Martelly developed the “Five E's” strategy: economy and employment; environment;
energy; and, improvements in education, human & social development. IDA’s Interim Strategy
Note 2 states (para. 43) that GOH’s approach consists of providing planned infrastructure and
related investments combined with locally identified and community-managed investments.
3.1.3 The project’s methodology remains relevant. As GOH has still not published the
decentralization decrees, developed in 2006 by TGOH, there are de facto few alternative ways to
channel resources to rural areas for this type of community investment while guaranteeing strong
community participation. Municipalities still do not have the authority and budget to finance or
operate local investments and thus CDD remains the primary, tested instrument.
3.1.4 The design and its adaptation from the northeast Brazil experience (in particular the SP
selection process) have provided positive results reflected in the number of SPs as well as in
greater community participation, transparency and accountability. The parts of the design and
implementation open to discussion are: (i) the employment of international NGOs as primary
project operators; and (ii) the creation of a parallel structure (COPRODEP/CADEC) to the
municipal authorities.
3.1.5 Although the capacity of central government institutions has improved somewhat the
contracting of private service providers for project implementation remains relevant. The central
Government is not set up to implement development programs in rural areas, and municipalities
have neither the authority nor funding. Contracting international NGOs, however, is onerous:
they need to establish offices and employ staff, and they incur significant overheads. Other donor
projects contract local (but institutionally weaker) NGOs or set up agencies closely linked to the

municipalities. In 2008, PRODEP required MDOD to associate with local NGOs, but the
resulting associations brought little value-added to the project and created some FM challenges.
3.1.6 The project’s parallel institutional/implementation structure fulfilled certain urgent local
needs and remains relevant as a strategic response to community needs and a valuable instrument
for strengthening local governance, when integrated within local government or national
programs. Initially, there was insufficient coordination with local and central government
agencies and line ministries, but AF2 required increased cooperation with the municipalities and
relevant government agencies. Some municipal priorities were project-financed through a
specific selection process and ensured that all investments were incorporated into the local
programs of the central agencies.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 The Project achievement of its PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory. This
assessment is based on (i) an analysis of the achievement of original PDO indicators (KPI) before
the AF1 restructuring in the first quarter of 2009 - the data for this analysis (March 31, 2009) are
available in the Project’s June 29, 2009 MTR evaluation report 6 ; and (ii) an analysis of the
revised PDO indicators after the AF1 and AF2 restructurings - the data for this second analysis
are from technical audits, the impact evaluation, MDOD and BMPAD reports as well as the ICR
mission. The AF1 restructuring did not imply any changes in the project’s stated objectives,
approach nor methodology. Only the grant amount and key performance indicators were changed
because of measurement difficulties and relevance issues. AF2 introduced several changes based
on lessons learned: municipal SPs became eligible, productive SPs underwent tougher screening
and received more training and technical assistance, COPRODEPs were transformed into
CADECs (civil society representative organizations) and a USD2.0 million training program for
CBOs and CADECs was introduced. Certain KPIs were also adjusted.
PDO achievement in the period before AF1 restructuring (2005-2009)
3.2.2 Over-riding Development Objective was to scale-up the direct transfer of public
resources to local community organizations in poor rural and peri-urban communities. The PAD
estimated this would involve between 55 and 65 municipalities7. This indicator measures the
degree to which the direct transfer of funds to CBOs resulted in the implementation of SPs
prioritized through a democratic and transparent process.
3.2.3 Results: (i) by March 31, 2009, BMPAD through the MDODs had already transferred
USD9.8 million (or 50% of the amount allocated) to 728 CBOs for 728 SPs (56% of the project
target) in 59 municipalities. The portfolio was composed of 47% infrastructure SPs, 19%
productive and 34% social SPs. Another 131 SPs were in the design phase; (ii) the four initial
technical audits and the MTR evaluation report indicate that the democratic selection and
implementation process worked extremely well, with important spill-over effects on the
restoration of the local social fabric after a divisive period of civil unrest; (iii) CBOs implemented
the funded SPs and there was no evidence of funds mismanagement or mis-procurement. Hence,
the over-riding PDO was already demonstrating significant and satisfactory achievement at the
time of Restructuring and is rated Satisfactory.
3.2.4 PDO Objective 2: To improve the access of communities to basic social and economic
infrastructure and support income-generating activities by financing small-scale investments

 For a summary of the MTR conclusions see Annex 5, para 29-38

 The indicator is not precisely-worded as the municipalities were not supposed to transfer the funds to CBOs; the
central government (BMPAD through the MDODs) was to do the transfer to CBOs

                                                      10
proposed, implemented and managed by said community organizations. This objective had three
indicators: (i) cost-effectiveness/efficiency of direct transfers to CBO vis-à-vis traditional service
provision measuring the Project’s cost effectiveness compared to “traditional central Government
service provision”; (ii) percentage of rural/peri-urban poor with access to basic social and
economic infrastructure was to measure the increase in access to basic services; and, (iii) percent
change in household assets, per-capita incomes among project beneficiaries sought to measure
such changes resulting from the Project (target of 20%).
3.2.5. Results: (i) the first indicator was not measurable because “traditional services”
comparable to the subprojects financed under the Project were not provided by central or local
government at that time. This indicator was subsequently dropped at AF1 approval; (ii) the
second indicator had no quantitative target in the PAD. The baseline study (2006-7) concluded
that barely 18.5% of residents in the targeted municipalities had easy access to good quality
water, health services and schools. The MTR developed a methodology to estimate project
beneficiaries and concluded that by March 31, 2009 already 763,000 residents (or about 32% of
the population in those municipalities-Annex 2) had improved their access to infrastructure,
productive and social services, such as: increased availability of agricultural inputs and basic
necessities, increases in livestock herds, water supply, better transport communication between
villages, increased access to electricity, renovated class rooms, internet access and rehabilitated
health clinics. The beneficiaries of infrastructure improvements were estimated at 556,000, those
of revenue generating SPs at 55,000 and of social SPs at 152,000. In a MTR beneficiary
assessment exercise, however, participants expressed some doubts about the sustainability of
some SPs and complained about the short duration of the training provided; (iii) the third
indicator could not achieve its 20% increase in asset/income-generation target as only 19% of the
SPs implemented were income-generating or productive SPs. Moreover, an MTR study revealed
that about 75 percent of productive SPs were under financial stress. The indicator was
subsequently dropped and replaced with a sustainability indicator of productive SPs. Although
quantitatively the second PDO may have been reached, the project focused insufficiently on the
quality and sustainability of the SPs and the achievement of the second PDO by Restructuring is
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.
3.2.6 PDO Objective 3: The third Project Objective was to improve governance and build
social capital in the communities. This objective had three indicators: (i) 2000 CBOs officially
constituted and participating in COPRODEPs; (ii) number of households expressing awareness of
PRODEP and its objectives/ activities and means of access; and (iii) percentage change in Social
Capital Indices reflecting greater citizen participation in resource allocation decisions.
3.2.7 Results: (i) by March 31, 2009, BMPAD estimated that more than 4,000 CBOs were
participating in SP prioritization processes, many of them officially constituted in previous years;
(ii) the MTR evaluation estimated the number of households aware of PRODEP at 240,0008. This
indicator does, however, not capture changes in social capital or governance; (iii) the intended
Social Capital Index had not yet been defined. Nevertheless, the 2009 MTR beneficiary
assessment9 looked at the impact of the Project in communities during its first year, comparing
them to non-beneficiary communities. Much higher indicators of social capital were evident
among households in those municipalities that benefitted from the first year of the project,
compared to households in municipalities that did not benefit (see Annex 5, para 5.4). Other
important beneficiary assessment findings on conflict reduction, inclusion of women and youth,

and improved dialogue with community leaders also indicated a strengthening of social capital
(see also Annex 5). These findings show that good progress towards the social capital objective
had been made and the third objective is rated Satisfactory.

PDO achievement in the period after AF1 restructuring (2009-2013)
3.2.9 Over-riding PDO: Progress on this PDO continued as planned. At the end of the
project, some USD30.6 million had been transferred to CBOs for 1,687 SPs (765 infrastructure,
552 productive and 370 social SPs) in 59 municipalities. The indicator target of 2,010 SPs was
an acknowledged mathematical error; total SPs to be financed, based on PAD objectives should
have been 1,816 (original project: 1,300 + AF1 300 + AF2: 216). Hence, the target was 93%
achieved and the over-riding PDO is rated Satisfactory.
3.2.10 PDO Objective 2: The second objective in this period was measured by two indicators:
(i) 1.2 million residents in the project area with access to basic social and economic infrastructure
(transportation, health, education, energy and other services) – the AF2 target number was based
on the methodology in Appendix 2, Annex 2; and (ii) 75% of productive/income generating SPs
still operational 12 months after completion.
3.2.11 Results: Both revised targets were exceeded. Applying the MTR measurement
methodology, the estimated number of residents benefiting from additional access to basic
services increased to 1.35 million (for a detailed calculation see Annex 2), while 82% of
productive SPs were operational one year after completion. SP quality also improved. To
increase SP quality and sustainability (including of those financed pre-restructuring) PRODEP
introduced: (i) a productive SP strategy (business plans, management training and MDOD
accounting assistance). This confirmed the need in CDD to separate the processing tracks of
public and private SPs as the latter require different expertise and selection criteria, entail
different risks re sustainability and governance, and have different “owners” responsible for their
sustainability; (ii) additional funding for some 150 SPs, making them fully operational; and (iii)
recruitment of MDOD engineers to enhance SP quality. Nevertheless not all quality enhancement
measures were implemented evenly. The project grappled with a backlog of SPs that had failed
(17%) or needed more assistance (and/or funding) to become sustainable (15%). See also Section
4.1. The achievement of the second PDO is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
3.2.12 PDO Objective 3: The achievement of the social capital development and governance
objective had three revised indicators: (i) 3,500 CBOs officially constituted and participating in
COPRODEPs; (ii) 60% of population in project area express awareness of PRODEP and its
objectives, activities and means of access; and (iii) 80% of CBO members express a positive

                                                 12
change in terms of their organizational capacity and ability to work together constructively,
subsequently revised at AF2 to be a “20-point change in Social Capital Indices (SCI) reflecting
greater citizen participation in resource allocation decisions”.
3.2.13 Results: The first indicator was already exceeded by mid-term. The second indicator was
not measured at the end of the project because of its lack of relevance to and inability to capture,
the social capital objective. Ideally, the third indicator would have been measured as a change
index using baseline and ex-post assessments. However, this approach lacked baseline data.
Instead, a version of the SCI was measured as part of the final beneficiary survey in the impact
evaluation document. Results are as follows: (i) three of the five social capital sub-index targets
for greater citizen participation were exceeded, while a fourth was 96% reached (Annex 5). A
fifth was not measured correctly in the study; (ii) a common theme during beneficiary
consultation workshops was how the project introduced a fundamentally new approach to
working collaboratively for the benefit of the entire community, as opposed to the individual and
specialized interests of community-based organizations, thus expanding the pool of people
involved in taking development decisions and improving relations between CBOs; (iii) the
transformation of COPRODEPs (as entities entirely linked to PRODEP) and CADECs
(organizations grouping CBOs and representative of civil society within the municipalities) was
successful; and, (iv) the CADECs succeeded in supporting the municipalities and establishing
lines of cooperation promising for the future if a similar PRODEP operation were to be
developed. Lack of a follow-up project, however, put a damper on the success of this recent
transformation and the CADECs have not been able to obtain financing from other sources. The
training program of CADECs and CBOs (2011-2012) also contributed to the development of
social capital and organizational/management skills. However, no evaluations of the acquisition
and permanence of these skills have been done.
3.2.14 Considering/balancing the findings of the beneficiary assessment workshops (see also
3.6.2), the results of the impact evaluation’s quasi-experimental survey with comparison groups,
the conclusions of the technical audits and the ICR mission field visits, and results as per
indicators above, the social capital/governance objective is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
3.2.15 Based on Table 3 below the post-Restructuring period is rated Moderately Satisfactory
for efficacy.

3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 Considering subproject quality, the relatively high management costs and inconclusive
economic returns, PRODEP’s efficiency is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Efficiency refers to
the Project’s efficient use of resources and cost effectiveness. The analysis is based on three core
questions. First, could the resources transferred to the CBO have been used more efficiently and
was there any waste? Second, were the administrative costs reasonable? Third, what would the
economic costs and benefits of the SPs be, are the SPs worthwhile in the economic sense and do
they provide value for money?
3.3.2 Use of resources by CBOs. Through the democratic and competitive SP selection
process amongst CBOs, the wide diversity of SPs addressed community needs. Did the selected
SPs reached their objectives of improving the living conditions (water, roads, schools, clinics,
community centers) or their income generation objectives? To answer this question there are two
sources of information: two technical audits of 2011/2012 analyzing 60 randomly-selected SPs
and the 2012 impact evaluation that evaluated another 60 randomly-selected SPs. The three
studies evaluated SP performance as a function of their technical implementation, usefulness to
the community, and social and environmental criteria. Table 5 shows the following: 58 percent
of the SPs in the samples performed in an acceptable or better way, 25 percent needed additional
support and 17 percent were no longer operating or maintained. Further details are in Annex 5.

3.3.3 In response to these conclusions, the project launched a Rehabilitation Plan in 2012 (Plan
de Redressement) providing complementary funding to 150 SPs to upgrade their operational level.
MDODs claim that most of these 150 SPs are now operating adequately. If confirmed, this would
bring the good/acceptable/fair group of SPs to approximately 67% of SPs.10
3.3.4 Data on SPs’ operational efficiency, sustainability and usefulness from comparable CDD
programs in other fragile states are hard to come by. The WB Operations Evaluation Department
(OED 2005) evaluation of the effectiveness of community-based and community driven
development states that: “More success has been achieved with quantitative than qualitative
goals11”. However, the report does not examine whether CDD’s physical investments were of
good quality, sustainable and value for money (although they were generally more cost-effective
than similar sector investments).
3.3.5 PRODEP financed some SPs that were likely to fail from the outset. Experience in Haiti
showed that “community-run” businesses are hard to sustain. In addition, contracting NGOs to
assist with SP implementation does not guarantee their long-term commitment to follow-up on
the SP operations beyond their contract period. Hence, livestock SPs without post-SP technical
assistance and community retail stores or cybercafés without adequate business training and long-
term technical assistance were likely to fail. To succeed, productive SPs should follow another
screening procedure and support system that guarantees business-oriented practices and
performance measurement. This was not the case in PRODEP. Reducing the wide diversity of
eligible SPs, however, could also have enhanced SP quality. No Haitian development agency has
the skills to promote such a wide variety of SPs and the availability of private technical assistance
of such diversity is equally scarce.
3.3.6 At the outset, project management (both BMPAD and Bank) was more concerned with
ensuring transparency, empowerment, social cohesion and democratic selection of SPs and with
introducing a smooth fund transfer mechanism than with SP feasibility. Later on, when the first
problem SPs were illustrated in an MTR study12, SP quality gained importance. MDODs have
since made substantial efforts to rehabilitate many SPs (under AF2 and the Rehabilitation Plan)
and the SPs financed under AF2 and CDB financing show significant quality improvements.
3.3.7 Administrative Costs: PRODEP’s cost structure is presented in Table 6. Roughly, the
administrative costs are estimated at 29.3 percent of the total project costs, while 17 percent of the
project costs went to MDOD for SP preparation, training, follow-up and assistance to CBOs. The
structural costs are high because Haitian development programs require a strong support structure
(local offices, technical staff and equipment) as local institutional capacity is weak.

3.3.8 The PAD estimated that 60% of project funds would go to the CBOs, while in fact only
50% of project funds financed SPs. The mid-term review concluded that for every dollar
transferred to the CBOs, the intermediary costs were as high as USD1.06. MDOD spent 55 cents
in technical training and follow-up and 51 cents was spent on management costs (MDOD and
BMPAD). At the end of the project, the overall intermediary costs were reduced from USD 1.06
to 92 cents per USD transferred to CBOs: MDOD spent 34 cents per dollar transferred in
technical training and follow-up while 58 cents was spent on management costs (MDOD
+BMPAD). The increase of the management costs per dollar transferred from 51 to 58 cents is
due to: (i) the stop-and-go nature of AF2 requiring MDODs to remobilize and reorganize with
negative cost consequences; (ii) the higher weight of the fixed office and staff costs in relation to
a relatively smaller SP investment amount; and (iii) BMPAD costs increased by an annual 12%
over the life of the project, mainly through the increase in the number of consultants (staff) and
remuneration (25% growth per year) as well as a 17% annual growth in operational costs.
3.3.9 The MDODs contracted under the project were international NGOs: the Pan American
Development Foundation (PADF) - a member of the Organization of American States (OAS) -
and the Canadian Center for International Studies and Cooperation (CECI). These NGOs had
significant overhead costs (13-15% of the contract amount), increasing their overall costs far
ahead of local NGOs. Working through local NGOs would have been more economical in
nominal terms but - depending on their financial and implementation capacity - the administrative
cost per dollar invested in SPs is likely to have been even higher. Similarly, the alternative of
BMPAD running regional offices might have shown costs similar to the MDODs.
3.3.10 A comparable IFAD-financed Project to Support Productive Initiatives (PAIP -USD28.5
million) carried out by FAES has a similar cost structure: 35% of the funds were invested in
productive SPs, 15% in training and 50% were intermediary costs, a mixture of institutional
strengthening and management costs (of which 23% were FAES administration and overhead).
This means that for every dollar in productive investment and training another dollar went to

                                                  16
institutional and administrative support. Although both projects are hard to compare, PRODEP
could be considered a little more efficient.
3.3.11 There was room to reduce costs and increase the efficiency of the operation. The
opportunities were: (i) concentrating PRODEP in fewer regions; (ii) delegating some technical
assistance and training to local NGOs; (iii) financing SPs on the basis of results instead of
expenditures; (iv) limiting the menu of eligible SPs to reduce technical supervision costs; and
(v) capping BMPAD consultants’ remunerations. The Bank considered several of these measures,
but some had also drawbacks and risks that could have increased costs or reduced impact.
3.3.12 Implementation delays: There were some implementation delays at the beginning of the
project caused by: the insecure situation (2006), hurricane Noel (2007), the food price riots of
2008, the four hurricanes Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike (2008), fuel shortages (2008-9) and the
customary delays in procurement (in particular an 18-month MDOD procurement and contracting
procedure) and project funds transfers. Also at the onset of each AF administrative delays arose
from the need to re-contract the MDODs.
3.3.13 Economic Evaluation: FAO/CP carried out an economic evaluation of ten SPs chosen
randomly from the most representative type of SPs. The evaluation was to provide some idea of
the SPs’ economic and financial benefits. The sample is not representative of the SP universe but
the analysis gives a sense of the SP’s possible economic and financial benefits (Annex 3). While
it is difficult to draw general economic or financial conclusions from this study, it shows however
that with the proper design and management, most of the ten reviewed SPs are, or could become,
sustainable and financially viable.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
The overall outcome rating of Moderately Satisfactory is justified based on the following:
       Relevance: The PDO, design and implementation remain relevant and are rated
        Satisfactory.
       Efficacy: The PDOs, as measured by the original and revised indicators, show
        Moderately Satisfactory levels of achievement. The overriding objective of transferring
        funds to CBOs has been achieved; some 50% of the population in the municipalities
        covered by PRODEP benefited from increased access to some services; social capital
        improved through strengthened CBOs, CADECs and greater transparency.
       Efficiency. PRODEP could have been more efficient if more attention had been paid to
        SP quality from the outset. In spite of significant improvements during later
        implementation phases, efficiency is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1 Poverty Impact: The project’s aim was to increase access of poor residents to services
and productive assets, which could have a positive effect on income. While most SPs had no
direct impact on monetary income, they are likely to have had an impact on the living conditions
and wellbeing of the poor.
3.5.2 Gender Aspects: PRODEP can be considered as an operation which promoted gender
equality. MDODs made a serious effort to promote gender-friendly SPs, and to include women
in the management of CBOs and in the COPRODEP/CADECs. Some 39% of CBO members and
18% of the COPRODEP (CADEC) members are women. The 2010 gender assessment is
positive that PRODEP promoted women’s empowerment and involvement in de cision-making

                                                17
(Annex 6). The last technical audit analyzed the project’s gender aspects. Even so, in spite of
strong participation of women in the CADECs, no woman leads a CADEC. However, while only
10% of the SPs are managed by women’s groups, women are the main beneficiaries of at least
half of all SPs.
3.5.3 Social Development: The main social development achievements are included in the
analysis of the social capital objectives (Section 3.2). This includes CBO strengthening and
capacity building. Moreover, the project introduced a new approach to working collaboratively
for the benefit of the entire community. PRODEP gave a voice to the project participants and
aided in conflict resolution.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.4 Strengthening of local institutions such as CBOs, COPRODEPs/CADECs and municipal
authorities was an important objective and, as stated before, the Project had a discernible impact
on social capital and institution building in rural areas. But it missed a chance to do better. There
was originally an amount of USD3.6 million foreseen for training, capacity building and
institutional strengthening. Up to 2010, almost no activity took place under this component,
although the MDOD provided SP-related technical and management training. From 2011
onwards, PRODEP initiated a USD2.0 million training and capacity-building program for CBOs,
CADECs and municipal authorities and the CADECs were strengthened with office and transport
equipment. The program came a little too late. The 2012 technical audit reviewed 20 courses
and concluded that they were short, did not provide materials to the trainees to share with other
CBO members and that there was no follow-up to reinforce and repeat what was learned.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
3.5.5. The PRODEP experience demonstrated that CDD can be an effective instrument for post-
disaster reconstruction. PRODEP and its sister, urban operation PRODEPUR had the
institutional structure and procedures in place to easily absorb additional funding to assist
damaged areas. AF1 provided additional funding for 32 municipalities affected by the flooding,
while AF2 supported rural areas trying to cope with the influx of urban residents returning home
from disaster stricken Port-au-Prince. CDD also provided communities with skills to establish
priorities, manage funding and deal with external assistance agencies’ procedures.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1 Beneficiary assessments took place at each stage of the project, and informed project
design, early implementation, the MTR and completion. These beneficiary assessments
employed a variety of methodologies including: interviews with beneficiaries and stakeholders of
the pilot project, a social survey of a random sample of households in the intervention zones,
participatory evaluation workshops with beneficiary community stakeholders, and a social survey
of members of CBOs (beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, i.e., treatment and control groups).
3.6.2 The main beneficiary survey took place in 2012 through interviews of 480 randomly-
selected project beneficiaries and a control group of non-beneficiaries. The principal conclusions
are: (i) 66% of participants in CADECs had a positive perception of CADEC decision making;
(ii) 82% of CBO members surveyed had a positive perception of decision making within the
CADEC; (iii) 83% of CBO management committees stated that they better- understood their role
in committees; (iv) 46% of this group considered that CADECs contributed positively to CBO
capacity building; (v) 86% of CBO members surveyed believe that in the case of major problems
being presented by the CADECs, that they would receive help from the community; (vi) 90% of
the respondents perceived a reduction of conflicts in the community, and (vii) more than 65%
perceived a better dialogue with community leaders. Where the SP was considered good, 84% of

                                                 18
respondents had a favorable opinion about the COPRODEP/CADEC decision-making process,
but where it failed expectations, only 39% of CBO members had a favorable opinion.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
4.1.1    Without a follow-up project and technical assistance from MDODs or other NGOs, an
estimated 15% of the SPs risk not operating properly, may not be maintained or could lose
direction. The challenge will need to be taken up by other ministerial agencies or NGOs. CDD
projects worldwide struggle with the same issues 13 . PRODEP gave the CBOs a working
experience that increased their skills and improved their performance. Some social capital
enhancements, however, are likely to survive: transparency in decision-making, community
participation in the selection of local investments (depending on the decentralization laws),
procurement methods and financial accountability. The parallel structures, established following
the Brazil model, may not survive, although some CADECs are dynamic and will be able to raise
funds from other sources and continue to play a role in the community. As a local development
learning vehicle, PRODEP is likely to leave behind institutional capacity.
4.1.2 The operation and maintenance (O&M) of many infrastructure and social investments
(road rehabilitation, electricity, clinics, schools, water supply) is no longer in the hands of the
CBOs that promoted these investments. The owners of many infrastructure investments are the
local or central authorities (municipalities, Ministries, Haitian Power Company) and some
community investments were handed over to the authorities that are now responsible for O&M. 14
4.1.3 The operation of productive SPs, however, remains with the CBOs or individual CBO
members. Certain types of earlier productive SPs (such as community and input stores and cyber
cafes) have failed or are dormant. The sustainability of livestock and other agricultural SPs
depends mostly on the care of individuals. Some grain mills and other agro-processing
investments, mainly if managed by women’s groups, remain operational and their sustainability
depends on management skills, the quality of the equipment and its maintenance. The few
productive SPs launched during AF2 are likely to be more sustainable as MDODs paid more
attention to SP feasibility, business management training and CBO support.
4.1.4 The operation of the Community Development Councils (CADECs) is guaranteed for
another year beyond closing in the Departments where the CDB is financing a follow-up project.
The fate of the southern CADECs is less defined as no other financing is available. These
CADECs have established a federation and are following training in fund raising. Some
CADECs will continue operations because of strong and creative leadership.
5. Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry -- Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.1.1 The Bank responded rapidly to acute post-conflict needs and in the interests of
expediency, acted as the project’s main promoter. Project design was sound and based on the
Bank’s longstanding CDD experience in northeast Brazil, and benefited from the first PCF pilot
operation. The project objectives were attainable and addressed the country’s needs. The results

14
  Although AF2 included USD2,500 per SP for maintenance costs, when financial budgets were established in MDOD
contracts, the choice was between maintenance provisions or more SPs. All went for the latter.

                                                     19
framework was weak and M&E indicators could have been more SMART. The CDD
methodology was robust: implemented as designed and no implementation restructurings were
needed. The insertion of international MDODs as main project operators had a very positive
impact on field implementation including speed and fiduciary management. The establishment of
a parallel structure to the municipalities was justified at the time but the local authorities should
have been more directly involved in the interests of sustainability15.
(b) Quality of Supervision -- Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.1.2 The supervision team conducted 21 supervision missions over an eight-year project.
There were also six procurement ex-post reviews and regular financial management reviews.
Bank environmental specialists conducted two full environmental reviews. Supervision focused
on: (i) ensuring a steady implementation rhythm; (ii) reviewing the quality of the SPs in the field;
(iii) preparing two additional financing operations; (iv) incorporating lessons learned into the two
AFs; and (v) promoting the development of an MIS and monitoring system as well as the
implementation of training and productive SP strategies. It carried out a timely Mid-term Review
and financed an MTR report by an independent consultant. The Bank’s reporting was candid but
had limited impact on project implementation quality, as BMPAD was not very responsive to
Bank recommendations. The supervision team was also actively (but not always successfully)
involved in upgrading the quality of the 2012 impact evaluation, the promotion of timely
technical audits and the simplification of administrative procedures.
5.1.3. The Board approval of the two AFs gave the Bank team the opportunity to revise the
results framework however this could have been done more forcefully, for instance making the
definition of “access to services” more specific. Neither the impact evaluation nor a special
commissioned study were able to define access in more detail than the general notions included in
the 2009 MTR report (see Annex 2, Appendix 2).
5.1.4 During the final years, the Bank could have put more effort into engaging the
Government more consistently in a policy dialogue and strategic conversations on local
development in Haiti. The Bank’s focus, however, was primarily on optimal project
implementation in a difficult environment and less on building dialogue with Government and
other development partners on decentralization policies.16
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance -- Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.1.5 Considering the short preparation time, project design was solid with exception of the
monitoring and evaluation system and indicators. The design worked and delivered close to
1,700 SPs. Projects that work from the outset with timely disbursements are rare in Haiti. Project
supervision was intense and pushed for the inclusion of lessons learned into project
implementation on a rolling basis. Supervision impact was hampered by the weakness of the
implementing agency. The Bank needed to be more consistently involved in local development
policy issues/dialogue at a higher level.




15
   The municipalities had officially, some 20% of the votes in COPRODEP meetings, but they were not entitled to be
allocated 20% of SP funds
16
   The European Union and USAID were financing operations preparing municipalities for decentralization and more
consistent Bank dialogue building was needed to strengthen the framework at higher levels.

5.2 Recipient Performance
(a) Government Performance - Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.2.1 The Government supported the Project during preparation and implementation. The
Ministry of Planning and External Cooperation was strongly behind project preparation but did
not have the human resources to participate in preparation. During implementation, different
administrations provided different levels of support. PRODEP was mainly a Bank effort,
introduced during the short transitional government period. GOH delegated the management of
the project to BMPAD with the corresponding advantage that there was no political pressure to
favor specific SPs.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance -- Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
5.2.2   The performance of the implementing agencies was characterized by the following:
       BMPAD: BMPAD’s role was to coordinate project implementation: (i) procurement and
        financial management; (ii) managing the MDOD contract; (iii) supervising field
        implementation; and (iv) monitoring the project through a management information
        system, quarterly reports, bi-annual technical audits and evaluations. BMPAD performed
        tasks (i) and (ii) in a moderately satisfactory manner. One of the key strengths of
        BMPAD was its ability to disburse fast since it was relatively independent, yet it did not
        have the breadth of technical specialties to deliver the range of support for a CDD project.
        Procurement reviews were satisfactory but financial management was moderately
        unsatisfactory mainly because of audit delays and lack of budgetary planning. Task (iii)
        was hampered by BMPAD’s reluctance to allow field supervision by staff. For task (iv)
        BMPAD did not introduce an operating MIS until very late in the project. Hence, the
        monitoring was exclusively based on information provided by the MDODs. The initial
        technical audits were late; from 2009 to 2011 BMPAD did not select qualified technical
        auditors and no audits were completed. There were two technical audits in 2012, which
        were of high quality. BMPAD employed specialist staff to design and coordinate a
        strategy to improve productive SP performance, to oversee training and monitor
        environmental issues. BMPAD’s performance was rather weak, but acceptable
        considering the country context. Little was done to implement the agreements contained
        in Bank mission aide-memoires. Nevertheless, the Bank provided BMPAD with large
        amounts of additional funds for several projects (including for PRODEPUR and for post-
        earthquake reconstruction and housing).
       MDODs: The MDODs carried out the project’s field activities. As subcontractors, they
        performed with great competence considering the difficult field conditions and the many
        natural disasters during the project period. The MDODs moved the program forward,
        guided the democratic and transparent selection process of SPs, supervised SP
        implementation, provided technical assistance and advice, monitored the field operations
        and supervised financial management by the CBOs and COPRODEPs (CADECs).
        Changes in management at the level of PADF, however, caused implementation delays of
        several months in 2009-2010, and CECI was slow in finishing some SPs. Both MDODs
        took financial responsibility for those delays
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance -- Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory
5.2.3 Taking into account Haiti’s general weak institutional capacity, and the context of the
multiple natural disasters that confronted the project during implementation, the performance of
GOH, BMPAD and the MDODs combined is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Through its hands-

                                                21
off approach, the central GOH allowed the project to deliver its outputs on time. The MDODs, as
subcontractors, performed professionally within their terms of reference.
6. Lessons Learned
6.1     The following are among the more important lessons from this operation:
6.1.1 Project structures which run parallel to municipal governments to promote local
development are a common feature of CDD projects but efforts are needed from the start to
link them to municipal government and build cooperation, joint planning and development
synergies. The goal should be a strong civil society, community engagement and more
transparency in local government over the long run. An imbalance of power between well-
funded CDD entities and under-funded municipalities should be avoided. Similar projects should
include a strong municipal strengthening component to ensure that municipal institutional
capacity develops simultaneously with the capacity of civil society, and that consistent efforts are
made throughout project implementation to build dialogue and foster joint policy and planning.
6.1.2 To ensure SP and institutional development sustainability, SP selection should be
aligned to the extent possible with central government and local government priorities and
plans. This is more likely to increase government ownership of the project as well as cooperation
and participation in the maintenance and follow-up of the SPs. Indeed, linkages to and
cooperation with line ministries and local authorities increased substantially during project
implementation and in particular during AF2.
6.1.3 The quality and size of SPs are important for the sustainability and credibility of the
whole program. The need for speedy implementation and small SP size cannot excuse poor SP
preparation. SPs should be prepared working with the CBOs, and include plans and budgets.
Productive SPs need a simple business plan showing financial sustainability. Infrastructure SPs
should present an O&M strategy, including training. In a fragile state, small SP size may be
better for early-stage CDD, even if the direct impact is not immediately visible. Depending on
performance, flexibility can be introduced later on.
6.1.4 The menu of eligible SPs should reflect national and international development
experience and not finance SPs with high probable failure rates (such as community stores).
A very diverse SP menu may respond better to community needs, but quality control and
appropriate technical assistance are difficult to ensure. Therefore, a constant regular review of
field experience may result in the removal of certain SPs from the eligibility menu.
6.1.5 PRODEP’s experience with productive SPs highlighted the lesson to be learned on
public vs. private good CDD models. There is a need for separate “streams” of analysis and
activity given that they require different expertise and selection/feasibility criteria, and entail
different risks re sustainability and governance. The institutional “end-points” also differ: public
goods may be taken over from community management by local authorities while private
enterprises need invested CBOs to thrive.
6.1.6. Leadership training for women in preparation for community leadership roles
should be part of the gender strategy. Although the project did not develop a full-fledged
gender strategy, it contributed to women’s empowerment through the SP selection system
(ensuring female CBOs’ access to project funds) and the requirement that women be part of
COPRODEP/CADEC membership. The additional advantages for women included periodic
business training and capacity building. However, many women lack the leadership skills
training needed to access decision-making positions in such entities and this needs much closer
attention.


                                                22
6.1.7 The Bank’s fiduciary procurement and financial management requirements applied
to communities moved the focus away from sound technical implementation and
organizational skills development. MDOD’s focus and resources were partially diverted to
administrative matters17 assisting the CBOs in complying with the Bank’s procedures, whereas
greater focus on the SPs’ technical implementation, sustainability and organizational skills
development could have borne more fruit in higher quality SPs. A more results-oriented
procurement and financial management system would be more efficient.
6.1.8. CDD is arguably the best instrument in a centralized state where working through the
ministries is difficult and the decentralization agenda has stalled. A second-phase operation
empowering local governance to scale up the delivery of socio-economic services and facilities
should be a priority in the Bank’s next round of programs with GOH. Further, CDD’s proven,
practical utility on the ground - institutionally and physically - for channeling post-disaster
reconstruction services, should be a key factor in this decision. PRODEP and PRODEPUR are
cases in point.

     Box 1: PRODEP Lessons incorporated in the CDB Project
     -SPs are generally twice as large (USD40,000)
     - SP selection considers past experience, municipal development plans or sector strategies where available
     -SPs have detailed preparation documents with clear identification of beneficiaries, engineering designs and
     budgets – sample of preparation documents reviewed by CDB staff for quality control
     -Productive SPs require business plan and financial feasibility estimates to be submitted to CDB
     - Quality control of infrastructure SPs done through civil engineers contracted by BMPAD
     - Greater importance of gender strategy



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Recipient/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Recipient/implementing agencies
7.1     The draft ICR was provided to the Recipient for comment and subsequently discussed
directly with key GOH counterparts during a Bank mission. Adjustments suggested by the
Recipient were incorporated in the text. However, the Recipient did not send the Bank the
requested letter.

2.2     Types of SPs financed under PRODEP are as shown in the table below. Project support
for each SPs is initially USD 17, 500 but several SPs have (with funds from AF1 and the gains on
currency exchange) received additional financial support of about USD 6,000 to get them
operating properly. For instance, some community centers, schools and health clinics have
received extra funding to construct lavatories, fences or for some equipment and furniture.

2.3.     The MDOD estimated the number of rural residents benefitting from better access to
infrastructure, productive and social services following the methodology described in Appendix 2
as follows:

Since this calculation is based on 1,687 subprojects and an estimated 17% of subprojects have
been discontinued, one can reasonably adjust the total number of residents with increased access
to some 1.35 million (83% of 1.645 million).

2.12     A first version of Management Information System (MIS) software was developed in
2007 but was not used for technical reasons. A second version MIS software was developed in
2012 and contains most of the PRODEP information. Nevertheless, the second MIS arrived too
late to be useful.

2.13  One communication folder and quarterly reports were prepared. No supervision reports
by DCP/BMPAD are available.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)
3.1      The original PAD included a financial analysis of four SPs financed under the PCF grant
as an illustration of the possible financial gains that productive SPs could generate. Since those
four SPs were into the first year of implementation, the results were only indicative.

3.2     A financial analysis of 16 productive SPs was carried out in 2009. This analysis was a
wake-up call that productive SPs had a sustainability problem as many of them showed signs of
financial strain or were on the verge of failure.

3.3     As part of the ICR the Bank invited FAO/CP to carry out a financial and economic
analysis of 10 SPs to indicate whether those SPs were economically and/or financially viable
propositions. The SPs were chosen on the basis of the following criteria:

            a. The SPs were to belong to the category of SPs most financed;
            b. The SPs were to be financed in 2011-2012 (although there are 2 exceptions in the
               sample);
            c. Half of the SPs were to be accompanied by CECI and half by PADF; and,
            d. The SPs were to be close to a traveling route allowing the FAO/CP staff member
               to cover the SPs in a short time.
3.4     Hence, the SPs were not chosen at random and are not a representative sample. Their
treatment is somewhat superficial and the conclusions are an attempt to estimate whether the SPs
presented “value for money”. The diversity of SPs and the social and public nature of many
make it difficult to carry out an economic analysis without introducing assumptions that forfeit
the quality and purpose of the analysis.

3.5     The following table provides a summary of the conclusions of the analysis. The IRR of
each SP is a rough estimate of the potential economic return and should not be used as a reference
for other documents. Nevertheless, the analysis shows the following:

        a. Education and health SPs need to fit within the strategies of the respective Ministries
           and this should occur before the investment is undertaken.
        b. Management and leadership are necessary ingredients for viability and sustainability;
           even community centers can become financially viable if the CBO applies proper
           management.
        c. Apart from the solar street lighting SP which lacks proper management and resources
           for maintenance, all SPs represent value for money and will be viable and sustainable
           under certain conditions the project can no longer control. Of course, most of these
           SPs came on board in 2011 and 2012 and benefit from past experience.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results and Summary of Findings: Technical Audits,
Impact Evaluation Study and Gender Assessment and Mid-Term Review

5.1    This Annex has an initial focus on PRODEP beneficiary assessments per se, then
summarizes key finding and recommendations of the Impact Evaluation Study (AGILIS-IKESOL,
2012), Technical Audits (ECOSOF, 2007-09 and Berut, 2012), the Gender Assessment
(Nadelman, 2010) and the Mid-term Review (2009).

Beneficiary Assessments:

5.2     Beneficiary assessments took place at each stage of the project, and informed project
design, early implementation, mid-term review, and completion. These beneficiary assessments
employed a variety of methodologies including interviews with beneficiaries and stakeholders of
the pilot project, a social survey of a random sample of households in the intervention zones,
participatory evaluation workshops with beneficiary community stakeholders, and a social survey
of members of CBOs (who both benefited and did not benefit from the project). While the
preparation of the project did not include a formal social analysis or stakeholder consultation, it
did benefit from the evaluation of the pilot project financed by the Peace and Conflict Fund. This
evaluation was prepared in 2004, and included many of the characteristics of a preparatory stage
social analysis and stakeholder consultation, including a social survey of 350 beneficiary
households, and consultative focus groups with CBO members in each of the pilot communes. In
comparison to a formal social assessment, this evaluation had the added advantage of identifying
lessons learned from practical experience of applying the project methodology on a pilot basis.
This was especially relevant to the participatory approach adopted by the project, which was
found to be especially applicable and relevant to the Haitian context.

5.3     While the project was approved in 2005, it was not possible to recruit a firm to conduct a
baseline study until 2007. This study involved a social survey of 2400 randomly selected
households among the 32 communes chosen for the first phase of project intervention, the 28
communes selected for the future intervention, as well as 20 communes that would not benefit,
who were chosen as a control group. The delay in initiating the baseline study provided an
opportunity to assess the early effectiveness of PRODEP, with important differences being
observed in key social capital indicators between phase one communes that received support,
control communes that received no support and those identified for future support in the second
phase.

5.4     For example, the percentage households participating in agricultural organizations was
much higher in phase one communes (27%), than in control (12%) or second phase communes
(14%); while the percent participating in other organizations and solidarity networks was
somewhat higher in phase one communes (15%) than control communes (12%) or second phase
communes. In addition, the percent of households aware of the municipality’s role in the
commune was much higher in phase one communes (68%) than in control (52%) or second phase
communes (62%). Furthermore, the percent of households that regularly participate in
community affairs was much higher in phase one communes (26%) compared to control (19%)
and second phase for intervention (16%). Other indicators of social capital measured as part of
this survey include household awareness of community social and economic activities, their



                                                43
engagement in these activities, their awareness of key community assets, their access to these
assets, along with awareness of community problems and community leadership. In terms of
household awareness of community activities, at least 10% more households in phase one
communes were aware, than in control or second phase communes. The same differences were
true for household engagement in these activities, and the use and access of community resources.
There was little difference between phase one, control and second phase in terms of their
awareness of community problems and knowledge of community leadership. Even though there
was no baseline for comparison, the fact that stronger outcomes of social capital indicators were
evident at such an early stage in communities that benefited from the project, compared to those
that did not, is indicative of the important role of the project in strengthening this critical
community asset.

5.5     Subsequently, the same firm responsible for the first beneficiary assessment was recruited
to conduct a follow-up mid-term assessment in 2009. This exercise involved a social survey of
1,500 hundred households randomly selected from the zones of intervention for PRODEP.
Theobjective of the study was to measure public awareness of PRODEP and the SPs. The study
concluded that the project had been effectively established in the zone of intervention with high
levels of public awareness. There was also evidence that indicators of community organizational
development, knowledge of community affairs, participation in community decision-making, and
access to information was higher in communities where PRODEP was in operation longer.

5.6      Another assessment completed in 2009, was the participatory evaluation of the project.
This evaluation involved stakeholder consultations (with BMPAD and MDODs), and stakeholder
workshops conducted in six different communes that had benefitted from the project. The key
issues addressed in these meetings included the project intervention model and its results, its role
in building organizational capacity and community confidence, the perception of women involved
in the project, the impact of the project on transparency and governance within beneficiary
organizations.

5.7     A final beneficiary assessment was conducted in 2012, which covered the 2005 – 2010
period of project implementation. The objective of this assessment was to identify the results of
the project along with potential lessons learned for future projects. The methodology used
included a review of project and SP files, interviews with project stakeholders (BMPAD, MDOD),
as well as semi-structured interviews with 480 CADEC and CBO members (including a sub-
group of those belonging to CBOs that did not implement projects). The primary focus of the
CBO member interviews was to assess the success of the project in strengthening social capital
within the CBOs and the CADECs using an index constructed by the Bank task team and the
client as part of the second additional finance. This measure was originally conceived as a
change-index requiring a baseline and ex-post measurement, which proved impossible to
implement due to time constraints. Instead, the following table summarizes the results of the
final beneficiary survey’s attempt to measure the components of this index in the final years of
the project. The table below shows that three of the five indicators measured surpassed targets
specified in the AF.

*The results are not exactly comparable to the index indicator.


5.8      Other important indicators of the project’s impact on building social capital included the
finding that 90 percent of the respondents perceived a reduction of conflicts in the community,
and more than 65 percent perceived a better dialogue with the community leaders. Positive
perceptions of improvements in social capital and community decision making were strongly
related to the performance of SPs. For example, where the SP was considered good, 84 percent
of the respondents had a favorable opinion about the decision making process, but where they did
not reach the expectations, only 39 percent of the CBO members had a favorable opinion.
5.9      One additional specialized assessment conducted in 2010 focused on the success of the
project in incorporating gender equity. This study was designed to assess lessons learned during
PRODEP’s implementation related to (a) strategies to facilitate women’s inclusion (b) women’s
participation and leadership in SP decision-making, design and execution and (c) structural
obstacles to women’s participation. This assessment included beneficiary consultations with 90
community-based organizations participating in the project.
5.10    Some of the recommendations coming out of this assessment included the need to: (i)
adapt a gender equity strategy (ii) develop new indicators to track the qualitative aspects of
women’s participation (iii) incorporate gender sensitization training workshops into the capacity
building program (iv) provide additional training and coaching support to women leaders, and
(v) support networking among women groups.

Summary of Findings: Technical Audits, Impact Evaluation Study and Gender
Assessment

Technical audits:

5.11   The Project financed six technical audits, a financial analysis of 16 productive SPs at
mid-term, an impact evaluation study, a gender assessment, and a beneficiary assessment
conducted for the Mid-term Review.

5.12    The technical audits are divided into two parts: (i) audits conducted before the Mid-term
Review which were constantly late but contain important information on the quality of the
process; and (ii) technical audits of 2012 that are more focused on technical quality of the SPs
and training.

5.13    Conclusions of the technical audits 2007-2009: The technical audits concluded that
PCU and MDOD followed the established procedures and that the project was reaching its
objectives of social capital building, participation in decision-making and transparency.
The audits suggested improvement was needed in the technical quality of the SP preparation
studies and to increase the involvement of community members in those studies. At the
management level, the auditors recommended improving BMDAP’s data collection and
monitoring system. The audits provided only scant information on SP technical quality.

5.14   Conclusions of the technical audits 2012. The first technical audit of 2012 analyzed 40
SPs of the period 2008-2010 and a second technical audit covered 20 SPs and 20 training
programs over the period 2011-2012. The audits showed:

       Confirmation of PRODEP’s social acceptance, transparency and other social capital
        achievements;
       Ample female participation at the SP level but little at the decision-making level;
       Much stronger coordination with local authorities;
       Confirmation of sustainability issues in productive and additionally some social SPs;
       Need to address SP maintenance and some environmental issues; and,
       Confirmation of important weaknesses in training and capacity building programs.

5.15    The ICR team classified the SPs as a function of their performance evaluated by the last
two technical audits. The table below shows that about 15% of the SPs have failed and that 30%
need additional support to enhance their performance. After the first of these audits, BMPAD,
the Bank and the MDOD drew up rehabilitation plans for those 30 percent to bring their
performance up to standard. There was however, not enough funding for all those SPs and only
150 SPs received additional funding for performance upgrading.

5.18     The technical and financial evaluation of sixteen productive SPs at mid-term such as
input stores, grain mills, livestock SPs, irrigation and internet points of presence showed the
challenges in keeping productive SPs operating in a sustainable manner. To various degrees,
most productive SPs experienced technical difficulties, struggled with market-related issues
(prices, marketing), had a very high cost structure and would not be financially sustainable
without radical management changes, technical assistance and close follow-up. To preserve its
social capital gains and to achieve sustainable income opportunities, PRODEP needed to increase
its support to the operations of the productive SPs.

5.19     The Mid-term Review report by an external consultant concluded that the sustainability
issues at the institutional and the SP level need to be addressed up front and some in the very
short term. This meant, in practice, that:

      BMPAD needed to carry out an independent evaluation of the technical and maintenance
       aspects of the infrastructure and social investments and implement its recommendations;
      BMPAD and MDOD should develop new strategies to improve the sustainability of
       existing and new productive projects (such as introducing specific conditions for their
       financing and/or higher community participation levels);
      BMDAP needed to set up a technical assistance, training and follow-up program for
       productive and other maintenance-sensitive SPs with the help of qualified technicians and
       business-oriented staff or consultants; and,
      There was room for a larger involvement of women in the Project. This could be done
       through promoting specific female-oriented SPs such as incentives for collective and
       individual “savings” programs; and,
      GOH through BMPAD and with the assistance of the World Bank should obtain funds
       for a follow-up project that would incorporate the sustainability of the model (in
       particular COPRODEPs/CADECs?) and its SP investments as one of its main project
       objectives.

5.20    General conclusions of the impact evaluation study in 2012. The report reflects the
opinions of a team of consultants who had visited 60 SPs and carried out a survey of 480
members of CBOs and CADECs.

5.21     The conclusions of the visits to 60 SPs of the period 2007-2009 are the following:

        The 60 SPs were evaluated based on several criteria such as their present use, ability to
         be used, benefits to the community, sustainability, socio-economic impact, member
         participation, and environmental care. The consultants evaluated 37 SPs (62 %) to be
         "very good, good or fair" and 23 (38%) were not well implemented (insufficient) or did
         not have any positive impact (bad)24.

        The report mentions the following positive results: much improved road accessibility of
         communities, improved access to potable water and electricity and very positive
         evaluation of the soil conservation SPs. As far as the productive SPs are concerned:
         cattle breeding SPs have been fruitful and grain mills have had a positive impact on
         women’s lives. Community radios and (to a more modest extent) the community centers
         have a social impact. The report mentions negative points: lack of community
         maintenance capacity in the electrical power sector; the operation of grain mills depends
         on the CBO’s management capacity which in half of the cases is insufficient; loss of
         direction in many productive SPs such as ruminant raising; community stores (input and
         other) and fruit processing have failed; and educational and cultural SPs have only been
         partially effective and are under-utilized.
Social Impact Survey:
5.22    The social impact survey of 480 members of CBO and COPRODEP showed the
following results:
        Among CBO and COPRODEP members, 83% believed that COPRODEPs had
         contributed positively to the CBO organization and understanding of their role. Some
         46% of this group considered that they contributed positively to the formation of capacity
         within the CBO.


24
   The consultants expressed some reservations about these figures and the evaluation reflects the opinion
of the consultants who visited the SP. The report does not contain any reliable data on how the evaluation
criteria are applied and the conclusions cannot withstand close scrutiny. The first 2012 technical audit by a
team of two auditors visiting the SPs comes up with about the same relationship: 60% of the SPs were
working while 20 % were no longer operating, and 20% needed additional assistance.



                                                    48
       In 86% of cases, this same group of respondents considered that if there were a problem
        in the community, COPRODEP would provide and receive support.
       With regard to CBO management, a majority of the members thought that decision-
        making was participatory. Some 82% of COPRODEP members had a favorable opinion
        of the decision-making process at the COPRODEP level while only 65% of the CBO
        members thought likewise.
       Local authorities were implicated in the decision-making process at the COPRODEP
        level. According to 72% of the CBO members, the local authorities were in favor of the
        CBO activities and in 67% of the cases they actively participated in SP implementation.
       About 75% of the people surveyed found that the community had positively evolved in
        the fields of local authority dialogue, neighborhood relationships and the involvement of
        the middle-class in CBO. The sample showed increased involvement of women and
        their leadership in SP management. In the COPRODEPs surveyed: 18% of the members
        of the SP executive committees were/are women.
5.23 Sustainability of the SPs. The report stated that the sustainability of the SPs and
PRODEP depended on two factors:
       The capacity of the CBOs and CADECs to attract capable people acting in the interest of
        the common good.
       The willingness of the local authorities and in particular of the Mayor to support the SPs;
        this willingness is particularly present when the infrastructure SPs fit within a local
        development plan. The development of such plans would be very favorable to
        PRODEP’s impact.
5.24 Poverty focus. The report concluded that the CBO member beneficiaries? of the
PRODEP SPs were generally poorer than the members of the control group.
5.25    Environment. The impact study mentioned that the long-term effects of some SPs were
not favorable to the environment. They included the storage of agro-chemicals in input stores, air
pollution through power generation, water supply systems without water source protection and
solid waste management at community leisure centers and cyber cafes. 5.26. The main
recommendations of the impact evaluation were:
       The participatory approach must remain the pillar of any new phase of PRODEP.
        Participation had shown its potential and had not led to a duplication of the competencies
        of local authorities. At the same time, there should be greater involvement of elected
        official (s) and local authorities;
       The intervention strategy must be based on development opportunities and promising
        value chains and less on the artificial classification of infrastructure, productive and
        social SPs. During preparation, more emphasis should be put on the post implementation
        phase including the challenge how to make the SPs profitable in the social and financial
        sense and the introduction of a follow-up mechanism;
       The preparation of the SPs should be more realistic, avoiding over-sized SPs that remain
        unfinished and works that are not used.
       There is an urgent need to introduce a follow-up of the SPs and their maintenance;
       Several types of SPs should be avoided: (i) the cybercafés have not shown their
        usefulness; (ii) electric power generation SPs are not recommended for reasons of
        maintenance problems and cost recovery – instead, SPs introducing renewable energy
        and energy savings should be promoted; (iii) animal production SPs should be tested first
        to avoid high animal mortality; (iv) community stores pose serious management
        problems as well as grain mills in remote areas with difficult access to spare parts and
        repair technicians;


                                               49
      Preparation and selection of SPs should include a feasibility test including a
       demonstrated capacity of the CBO in business management;
      For infrastructure SPs, there should be an agreement between the promoters and those in
       charge of SP maintenance;
      The MDOD have to commit to a more effective SP follow-up in particular for the more
       remote CBOs. Moreover, they have to provide more information to help CBOs make the
       right choices in SP selection;
      PRODEP should encourage the CADEC-COPRODEPs to carry out evaluations of their
       own SPs so that they learn from past experience about what works and what doesn’t ;
      The CBOs and CADECs-COPRODEPs need training in (i) simple bookkeeping with
       financial statements; (ii) business management; and (iii) the correct implementation of
       the functions of the CBO and management committees;
      An ombudsperson should be introduced to mediate in conflicts; and
      The overall project budget should be adjusted to reflect the need for additional follow-up
       after SP implementation.
Gender Assessment (2010):
5.27   This assessment found the following:
      PRODEP’s inclusion of gender-based performance indicators and a gender -
       disaggregated M&E system supported an operational structure through which women’s
       participation could be/was tracked and progress could be/was monitored.
      The Project did not provide an explicit guiding gender strategy or operational
       procedures/guidelines. MDOD follow their own principles for engaging women, which
       resulted in divergent programs and results.
      Women’s participation in COPRODEP assemblies and executive committees varied
       significantly across communities. There was a correlation between communities for
       whom PRODEP was implemented with gender inclusion approaches and higher
       participation results.
      There was found to be a correlation between the ratio of women to men in PRODEP
       decision-making structures and women participants’ satisfaction with and confidence in
       these mechanisms.
      Support for the strengthening of existing women’s organizations and the creation of new
       women-only CBOs had directly contributed to women’s representation in PRODEP’s
       decision-making bodies.
      Representing women and women’s SP priorities through women-only CBOs can ensure
       greater project responsiveness to women’s needs, but may marginalize women in mixed -
       group processes.
      There is a correlation between communities for which PRODEP was carried out with
       specific gender inclusion requirements and higher proportions of women-only CBOs
       selected to manage community development SPs.
      When disaggregated by women-only and mixed CBOs there are noteworthy differences
       in the proportions of productive, infrastructure and social SPs. This divergence between
       the categories of SPs implemented by women-only and mixed CBOs may reveal that
       women’s community development priorities are not well represented through mixed
       CBO-managed SPs.
      PRODEP is providing benefits that have supported women to overcome fundamental
       structural obstacles that hinder their political, economic and social participation.
      PRODEP has contributed to women’s empowerment and changing their social status at
       the household and societal levels.


                                              50
5.28 The recommendations of the gender assessment are:
         Adapt a gender equity strategy to promote women’s inclusion as the Project level;
         Develop new indicators to track the quality in addition to quantity of women’s
          participation;
         Agree upon a strategy upstream:
         Consider adopting inclusion of gender sensitization training workshops as a core part of
          capacity building programming.
         Include additional support and training for potential women leaders to build their
          confidence and increase their leadership capacity.
         Design support for women with awareness of the different vehicles through which they
          participate – women-only and mixed CBOs.
         Support women’s groups to federate and create local networks.
         Female facilitators are role models, especially for women, and can give women the
          confidence to follow in their footsteps and take on challenging positions.
         Local innovation in the inclusion of women should be encouraged and rewarded.

Mid-Term Review Evaluation of the Project Achievements

5.29    The project financed several evaluation studies including three technical audits, a mid-
term beneficiary assessment and an analysis of sixteen income generating subprojects. The audits
and beneficiary assessment provide in general positive feedback on the project and contain series
of recommendations to improve project performance. The analysis of the income generating
(productive) subprojects shows the tremendous challenges of programs financing income
generating community-sponsored subprojects.

5.30     The technical audits concluded that PRODEP management and MDOD followed the
established procedures and that the project reached its objectives of social capital building,
participation in decision-making and transparency. The audits suggested improvements were
needed in the technical quality of the subproject preparation studies and to increase the
involvement of community members in the subproject preparation studies. At the management
level, the auditors recommended improving BMDAP’s data collection and monitoring system.
The audits provided only scant information on the subproject technical quality.

5.31    The beneficiary assessments also showed very positive feedback to the project25. The
participants in the six assessment workshops were unanimous that PRODEP’s objectives and
methodology remained pertinent. They stated that: (i) the decisions of resource allocation in
COPRODEP were being taken democratically with great transparency; (ii) the CBOs had
increased their membership and their management capacity; and (iii) the project had also
generated more cohesion within the population as well as a large degree of self-confidence within
communities. Hence, the project had generated a considerable amount of social capital.




25
  It is unfortunate that the participants in the beneficiary assessment workshops were not selected at random as was
requested under the consultant’s terms of reference.


                                                          51
5.32    The participants considered the amount of PRODEP’s contribution (US$17,500 per
subproject) to be insufficient. The training and capacity building given to the OCB was
considered useful, but participants found this type of training was too short.
5.33     The technical and financial evaluation of sixteen productive subprojects such as input
stores, grain mills, livestock subprojects, irrigation and internet points of presence showed the
challenges in keeping productive subprojects operating in a sustainable manner. To various
degrees, most productive subprojects experienced technical difficulties, struggled with market-
related issues (prices, marketing), had a very high cost structure and were not likely to be
financially sustainable without radical management changes, technical assistance and close
follow-up. To preserve its social capital gains and to achieve income durable income
opportunities, PRODEP needed to increase its support to the operations of the productive
subprojects. (Footnote 26)
5.34    Efficiency. Project efficiency was measured in terms of the cost of transferring funds to
communities. To transfer one US dollar to the communities, PRODEP spent 55 cents in
subproject preparation, technical assistance and field monitoring, as well as 51 cents in
management support (MDOD and BMDAP). Hence, the management costs remained within 25
percent of total project costs. This percentage was/is quite high but still within international
norms.
5.35     Impact on Rural Institutions. PRODEP’s main institutional innovation was the
creation of a COPRODEP in each municipality. This council was in charge of allocating project
funds to communities in a participative and transparent manner. A long-term goal was to
mainstream COPRODEP as a mechanism for transferring public funds to local communities. A
re-activation of some CBOs and a general increase in their membership was another positive
institutional impact of the project.
5.36    Sustainability. Project sustainability has been evaluated at the institutional and the
subproject levels. The main conclusion is that there are considerable risks that many project
achievements will not be sustainable over time if the PRODEP experience would end with this
particular project. CDD projects need follow-on operations sustaining a culture of participative
fund allocation and increasing the sustainability of their community investments through specific
management and maintenance schemes as well as technical assistance.
5.37    Although operational sustainability of the subprojects was not an explicit, primary project
objective, the project was intended to be evaluated on whether it has made a sustainable impact
and has increased income generating opportunities for the poor in a sustainable manner.
(Footnote 27.)
5.38      Recommendations for the Second Half of the Project


         The sustainability issues at the institutional and the subproject level mentioned in the
          report needed to be addressed up front and some in the very short term.


26
   As the evaluation studies did not cover the maintenance of the infrastructure and social investments, and the
technical audits are silent on this matter, it would be worthwhile to carry out a similar evaluation of the sustainability of
the infrastructure and social subprojects.
27
   A parallel can be made with a previous Haiti Employment Generation Project in the 1990’s which had as its only
objective to create temporary employment after a crisis situation. During the final ex-post project evaluation workshop
in Port-au-Prince, the main topic was not the number of jobs created but the probable lack of sustainability of some
works constructed by temporary workers.


                                                            52
   This meant, in practice, that:
   BMPAD needed to carry out an independent evaluation of the technical and maintenance
    aspects of the infrastructure and social investments and implements its recommendations;
   BMPAD and MDOD needed to develop new strategies to improve the sustainability of
    existing and new productive projects (such as introducing specific conditions for their
    financing and/or higher community participation levels (paragraphs 106-108);
   BMDAP (with funds from the existing IDA grant or other source) needed to set up a
    technical assistance, training and follow-up program for productive and other
    maintenance-sensitive subprojects with the help of qualified technicians and business
    oriented staff or consultants;
   GOH through BMPAD and with the assistance of World Bank needed to obtain funds for
    a follow-up project that would incorporate the sustainability of the model (in particular
    COPRODEP) and its subproject investments as one of the main project objectives.
   There was room for a larger involvement of women in the project. It was suggested that
    this could be done through promoting specific female-oriented subprojects such as
    incentives for collective and individual “savings” programs.
   Last but not least, considering the delays the project had incurred and the subproject
    quality issues that had arisen, it was considered useful for the Government to request a
    project extension.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

6.1     A participatory evaluation of the project in 2009 involved stakeholder consultations (with
BMPAD and MDODs), and stakeholder workshops conducted in six different communes that had
benefitted from the project. The key issues addressed in these meetings included the project
intervention model and its results, its role in building organizational capacity and community
confidence, the perception of women involved in the project, and the project’s impact on
transparency and governance within beneficiary organizations.
6.2     Beneficiary assessment workshops conducted during the Mid-term Review showed very
positive feedback to the Project 28 . The participants in the six assessment workshops were
unanimous that PRODEP’s objectives and methodology remained pertinent. They stated that: (i)
the decisions regarding resource allocation in COPRODEPs were being taken democratically
with great transparency; (ii) the CBOs had increased their membership and their management
capacity; and (iii) the Project had also generated more cohesion within the population as well as a
large degree of self-confidence within communities. Hence, the Project had generated a
considerable amount of social capital.
6.3     The participants also considered that the amount of PRODEP’s contribution (USD 17,500
per SP) was insufficient. Further, the training and capacity building given to the CBOs was
believed useful, but participants were finding that this type of training was too short.




28
  Contra to the Bank’s request under the consultant’s terms of reference, the participants in the beneficiary
assessment workshops were not randomly- selected.

Annex 7. Summary of Recipient's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A: Summary of Recipient’s Completion Report:

7.1      Financé à hauteur de dons de l'IDA de soixante deux millions de dollars environ, le projet
PRODEP visait d’augmenter les transferts directs des ressources publiques aux Organisations
Communautaires de Base (OCB) dans les communautés pauvres rurales et périurbaines du pays
dans le but (i) d’améliorer l’accès de ces populations aux infrastructures économiques et sociales
de base et de promouvoir les activités génératrices de revenus en finançant des investissements à
petite échelle proposés, mis en œuvre et gérés par les OCB ; (ii) de renforcer la cohésion sociale
et le capital social des communautés locales bénéficiaires afin qu’elles s’organisent pour mieux
répondre à leurs besoins propres ; (iii) d’améliorer la gouvernance locale par le biais d’une plus
grande participation citoyenne à un processus décisionnel transparent, démocratique et inclusif.
Démarré officiellement en novembre 2005, le PRODEP est arrivé à terme au 30 juin 2013. Ce
rapport présente, le bilan des activités réalisées, les résultats atteints, les principales contraintes
rencontrées et des solutions apportées, l'approche méthodologique les différentes parties
prenantes du PRODEP, enfin les leçons apprises et des recommandations pour un nouveau
PRODEP.
7.2      Au total, le PRODEP a financé 1687 sous-projets répartis en 765 projets d'infrastructure,
370 sous-projets à caractère social et 532 de type productif. Ces sous-projets sont distribués dans
238 sections communales et 59 villes/bourg du projet. Les sous-projets sont des investissements
de l'ordre de USD17,500 en moyenne identifiés, mis en œuvre et gérés par les OCB.
7.3     A part les bénéficiaires directs (membres d’OCB), les sous -projets ont contribué à
l’amélioration des conditions de vie de près d'un million et demi (1.5 millions) de personnes dont
environ 48% de femmes touchées dans les communautés les plus pauvres par un meilleur accès à
l’eau potable, la proximité actuelle des intrants agricoles et des services de transformation de
produits agricoles, l’amélioration des conditions d’apprentissage dans des salles de classes
devenues plus adéquates, à des centres de santé devenus modernes et fonctionnels et à des
espaces de loisirs. Le PRODEP introduit une certaine décentralisation des fonds publics au profit
des communautés rurales les plus reculées et les plus nécessiteuses.
7.4     Grâce au PRODEP, on peut affirmer qu’il existe maintenant une meilleure cohésion
sociale dans les communautés, manifestée par une meilleure capacité de vivre et de faire
ensemble à la fois des citoyens et des citoyennes et des organisations locales.
7.5      Le PRODEP a apporté une contribution non négligeable à la gouvernance locale par
l’introduction et l’appropriation par les acteurs et actrices de meilleures pratiques de participation,
de négociation, de concertation, de dialogue et de reddition des comptes dans les communautés et
entre les communautés, de reddition de compte et l’application du principe de subsidiarité. On a
dénoté une meilleure relation entre les communautés et les autorités locales. Dans certains cas,
les autorités recherchaient activement et obtenaient des financements additionnels pour les sous
projets communautaires.
7.6     Les trois objectifs du PRODEP n’auraient pu être approchés ou atteints sans un effort
constant et important en matière de renforcement des capacités des individus et un effort de
structuration des organisations – OCB et COPRODEP confondus.              Le renforcement des
capacités locales n’était pas un objectif en soi mais un des résultats recherchés au niveau du
PRODEP pour en maximiser l’impact sur les communautés et assurer la durabilité des résultats.
7.7     Le PRODEP a permis le renforcement de la participation effective des femmes dans les
instances décisionnelles et de leur pouvoir de négociation dans les foyers, mais il reste des efforts
considérables à déployer pour consolider et étendre ce résultat à un plus grand nombre de femmes.

                                                  55
7.8      Au-delà de la réalisation de sous-projets, le projet a considérablement contribué à la
construction du capital social caractérisée par le réseautage communautaire et la mise en commun
des ressources tant financières qu’intellectuelles pour solutionner collectivement des problèmes
communs. Le regroupement des OCB en fédération de COPRODEP, puis CADEC (FECADEC
par la suite) au niveau départemental et en confédération (regroupant plusieurs départements) en
est un exemple frappant. Le PRODEP a contribué à mettre en place le plus grand mouvement de
société civile au niveau du pays grâce notamment à l'accompagnement fourni dans la
transformation des COPRODEP en CADEC. Les CADEC se sont regroupés par département en
fédération (FECADEC) puis au niveau régionale en Confédération de FECADEC.
7.9      La mise en œuvre du PRODEP s'est articulée sur un processus ouvert, transparent,
démocratique, et participatif. La stratégie s’est appuyée sur une vision globale et a prévu une
démarche participative, inclusive et transparente d’une part; la responsabilisation des acteurs et la
collaboration inter-acteurs, d’autre part. Le renforcement de capacités a été le corollaire de la
participation des partenaires (OCB,COPRODEP). Après une campagne intensive de formation et
d'information, les OCB étaient appelés à identifier leurs besoins au niveau de la section
communale et à faire un travail de pré-priorisation. Au niveau communal les COPRODEP
assuraient la priorisation des sous-projets dans un processus démocratique et transparent. Les
collectivités locales faisaient aussi parti du processus. Puis la non objection une fois obtenue, les
fonds des sous-projets étaient directement transférés aux OCB qui en firent la gestion et
préparèrent, selon le cas, un plan de maintenance et d'entretien. Les OCB ont apporté une
contribution , en nature, supérieure dans la majorité des cas à $2,000 américains.
7.10     Différents acteurs étaient impliqués dans la mise en œuvre du PRODEP; la Banque
Mondiale (IDA) qui a fait le don au gouvernement d'Haïti, a supervisé la gestion des fonds et
renforcé les capacités de l'unité de coordination du projet. L'Etat haïtien a choisi le BMPAD qui
s'est doté d'une Unité de coordination du Projet. L'UCP a assuré le bon fonctionnement du
système de suivi et évaluation, notamment le fonctionnement des outils installés, la mise à jour
cohérente et régulière des données de suivi, le transfert correct des données entre les
responsables des projets et des Système d’information de suivi. L'UCP a géré directement les
composantes 2 et 3 du projet. Très efficiente lors du tremblement de terre le BMPAD a procédé à
la réformation de l'UCP en DPC. Des Maitres d'ouvrages délégués (MDOD) ont été choisis en
fonction de leurs capacités et de leurs expériences pour la mise en œuvre de la composante 1 du
PRODEP liées aux sous-projets et au renforcement des capacités. Les COPRODEP qui ont
regroupé au niveau de la commune des représentants des OCB (pour un minimum de 80 % de la
composition totale), ainsi que de l’administration locale et de la société civile (20 % des
membres) étaient les principales entités chargées de cibler les OCB et d’allouer les fonds au
niveau communal. Ils ont joué un rôle fondamental dans la mobilisation des communautés et
dans la promotion de leur participation aux décisions locales. Les OCB ont été la fondation de
toutes les opérations du projet et ont été aussi les représentants légitimes des bénéficiaires avant
les COPRODEP, l’Etat et tout autre type d’organisation.
7.11    Des contraintes majeures ont significativement touché la marche et la gestion du
PRODEP durant ces sept (7) années d’exécution. Elles étaient liées à la conception du projet, à
l’environnement sociopolitique assez turbulent au cours des dernières années, aux différentes
catastrophes naturelles qui avaient frappé le pays, et à la stratégie d’implantation. Mais des
solutions correctes ont été apportées en temps et lieu par les différentes parties prenantes.
7.12     Le PRODEP a eu 17 indicateurs et sur les 17 indicateurs 15 ont été atteints ou dépassés.
Pour les deux indicateurs qui n'ont pas été atteints voire même rapprochés selon l'évaluation à mi-
parcours, l'un a été que l'indicateur a été largement sous-estimé lors de l'étude de base. Quant à
l'autre, c'est dû d'une part à un manque de capacité de gestion financière des leaders d’OCB,
capacité qui certes a suivi un processus de renforcement, cependant graduel dans le temps mais

                                                 56
aussi à la dispersion des structures de gestion du PRODEP, en l’occurrence les OCB, dans des
zones très difficile d'accès rendant la tâche de contrôle énorme et exténuant.
7.13   Recommandations: En tenant compte des leçons apprises, nous formulons un ensemble
de recommandations qui doivent être prises en compte dans le nouveau PRODEP.
I. Par rapport à l'approche CDD
   a) L’approche participative a été à la base du succès du projet. Elle doit rester le pilier de
      toute nouvelle phase du PRODEP. Elle a contribué à la cohésion sociale, la
      conscientisation des OCB de leurs capacités à prendre en charge leur propre
      développement. La prise en charge du développement local, le renforcement des
      capacités des OCB et leurs structures doivent être présents dans toutes les activités du
      PRODEP. En même temps, il faudrait assurer une plus grande implication des élu(e)s et
      autorités locales dans le PRODEP. La participation des collectivités locales dès le départ
      peut faciliter une meilleure prise en charge des sous-projets une fois leur mise en œuvre
      terminée.

   b) La société civile doit rester le partenaire principal du PRODEP. Toutefois, le PRODEP
      doit être plus proactif pour rechercher les consensus nécessaires et pour clarifier le
      partage des rôles et des responsabilités entre les autorités locales qui ont le rôle d’animer
      le processus de développement local et les structures émergentes de cette société civile
      telles les COPRODEP ou les CADEC.
II. Par rapport à la priorisation des sous-projets
   a) être plus flexible à une meilleure orientation des choix de sous-projets sur la base
      d’opportunités de développement et l’identification de filières porteuses.
   b) Définir et accorder un quota aux OCB de femmes
   c) Promouvoir la participation active des élus locaux (Députés, Maires, DV, ASEC,
      CASEC,) et des délégués des conseils municipaux) aux activités de priorisation des sous-
      projets.
   d) Prévoir un montant plus élevé que 17,500 dollars américains pour des sous-projets
      d'envergure communale.
III. Par rapport à la mise en œuvre des sous-projets
   a) Diminuer le nombre de sous-projets à livrer et augmenter la durée des sous-projets à 5 ou
      6 mois.
   b) Prévoir un montant équivalant à 15% des sous-projets pour la maintenance et
      l'atténuation des effets sur l'environnement.
   c) Bien fixer les rôles et les responsabilités respectives des OCB, des COPRODEP-CADEC
      et des BTC dans la préparation des projets
   d) Renforcer, augmenter les bilans internes des comités de gestion des sous-projets aux
      membres réguliers des OCB et aux autres OCB des unités d’intervention.
   e) Faire fonctionner les forums au-delà de la priorisation des sous-projets et encourager les
      échanges entre les CADEC et FECADEC
   f) Augmenter des sous-projets d’envergure communale nécessitant des ressources
      financières plus importantes
   g) Aider fortement les OCB à utiliser les COPRODEP/CADEC comme structure effective
      pour développer de sous-projets avec d’autres bailleurs de fonds.
IV. Par rapport au renforcement des capacités



                                               57
   a) Les besoins en matière de renforcement des capacités sont importants ; la durabilité des
      résultats de l’intervention du PRODEP en est tributaire. Nous recommandons que toute
      phase future du PRODEP considère le volet renforcement des capacités comme un
      élément-clé du succès du projet et non comme une activité d’accompagnement. En effet
      le renforcement des capacités permet non seulement de stimuler et de soutenir le
      développement durable et la prospérité des communautés mais encore et surtout de
      soutenir l’engagement des citoyens et citoyennes au développement de leur communauté.
   b) Le renforcement des capacités devra être mieux adapté aux spécificités locales et aux
      besoins des communautés et soumis à une procédure d'évaluation et de suivi.
   c) Le BMPAD et les MDOD ont le devoir, en tant qu’agents du développement, d’appuyer
      la transformation des communautés pour en faire des sociétés plus démocratiques et plus
      équitables. A ce titre l'Équité Femmes-Hommes doit faire partie intégrante du
      renforcement des capacités tout en prévoyant toutes les ressources nécessaires à
      l'accroissement des capacités des femmes dans les domaines économiques pour une
      meilleure participation à la prise de décision.
   d) La nécessité de poursuivre le renforcement des capacités de l’ensemble des acteurs au -
      delà de la durée du projet en vue rendre possible et effective la mise en œuvre et garantir
      des résultats durables du PRODEP.
V. Par rapport à la gestion des sous-projets
   a) La préparation et sélection des sous-projets par les OCB et validés par les CADEC
      devraient comprendre un test de faisabilité, que l’OCB intéressée ne peut passer qu’en
      montrant ses engagements et capacités pour gérer la structure dans la phase
      opérationnelle, bien sûr avec l’appui du MDOD.
   b) La continuité des services mis en place par un sous-projet doit être une préoccupation
      dès la phase d'identification/ priorisation.
   c) Renforcer les relations de partenariat entre les CADEC et les Mairies non seulement dans
      le cadre de la construction du capital social, mais aussi dans la perspective d’une gestion
      administrative plus efficiente du PRODEP ;
VI. Par rapport à la durabilité des sous-projets
     a) Les sous-projets de type productif visaient surtout à créer dans les communautés des
        services qui n'existaient pas. En tenant compte des spécificités propres à la culture
        haïtienne, il est recommandé à ce que le PRODEP cofinance des investisseurs locaux
        potentiels et intéressés à vendre et à rendre disponibles les services au lieu de laisser ces
        types de projet à des OCB. Les sous-projets productifs auraient dans ce cas une gestion
        individuelle garante de la durabilité du service à la communauté. Le mode de
        cofinancement doit être, dans ce cas, bien défini.
     b) Les sous-projets d'infrastructure doivent être exécutés avec l'aval et la pleine
        participation des élus locaux qui se chargeront, comme élus, de veiller à leur entretien et
        à leur maintenance.
VII. Appropriation du PRODEP par l'État Haïtien
   a) Il est de toute importance que l'État s'approprie le projet qui pourra donc inclure des
      activités de renforcement au bénéfice des élus locaux (Maires, Délégués de ville, CASEC,
      ASEC, Assemblée municipale) qui en ont un grand besoin. Ceci est de nature à conduire
      vers un certain équilibre en termes de capacités et faciliterait un meilleur atterrissage du
      PRODEP dans l'ensemble du pays.
   b) Il est recommandé d'avoir une agence technique locale (ATL) liée directement aux
      mairies en lieu et place des BTC. Une telle structure présenterait l'avantage d'être plus
      proche de la population que les BTC et continuerait d’exister au-delà du projet.

                                                58
    c) Il est recommandé une concertation entre la banque et l'Etat afin de favoriser
       l’appropriation de ce projet de développement communautaire participatif si important en
       se rappelant qu'un projet partagé vaut mieux qu’un projet décrété aussi performant soit-il.
Conclusions
7.14    En conclusion, le PRODEP est devenu à fur et à mesure de sa mise en œuvre un grand
projet qui a fait ses preuves, mais il y a encore du travail à faire. Un PRODEP II est plus que
souhaitable et souhaité par les différents bénéficiaires et surtout par les différentes structures
mises en place, (les OCB, les CADEC, leur fédération et confédération surtout), car leur futur et
devenir en dépendent grandement.
