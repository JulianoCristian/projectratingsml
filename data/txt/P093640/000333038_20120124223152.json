          PROJECT ON WOMEN", "versiontyp": "Buff cover", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objectives of the Community-Driven\n            Development Project (PRODEP) are to assist the Government of\n            Haiti (GoH) in implementing the direct transfer of public\n            resources to local community organizations in poor rural and\n            peri-urban communities: (i) to improve their access to basic\n            and economic infrastructure and support income-generating\n            activities by financing small-scale investments proposed,\n            implemented, and managed by the community organizations\n            themselves; and (ii) to improve governance and build social\n            capital of communities through an increase in citizen\n            participation and transparency in open decision-making\n            processes. The project has already completed the\n            implementation of the original grant and first additional\n            financing with a total of 1,471 small subprojects in the\n            infrastructure, productive and social sectors implemented by\n            Community Based Organizations (CBOs) in 59 municipalities.\n            The project is estimated to have an impact on 1.2 million\n            people and disbursed US$24 million directly to the CBOs, who\n            selected priority subprojects through a democratic process.\n            The project also provides technical and management training\n            and capacity building to community organizations and their\n            second-tier organizations. The reallocation is deemed\n            necessary to reflect the revised technical needs of the\n            remaining project phase, including higher focus on capacity\n            building efforts linked to the subproject implementation.\n            The operational costs reflected in this reallocation reflect\n            additional staffing under training, communication and\n            productive subproject strengthening. It also represent the\n            total operational cost for running the overall project\n            (original grant and second additional financing),\n            representing about 6 percent of the total financing. The\n            operational costs under the second additional financing\n            grant H 5850 HT of US$ 0.235 million will be reallocated in\n            2012 to reflect the increased costs under the categories of\n            subprojects and their related capacity building activities\n            in that final phase. Finally, it reflects the current needs\n            of this institutionalization phase and the close\n            coordination with the local development structures."}, "docdt": "2012-01-04T00:00:00Z"}
