2.      The Haiti Community Driven Development project is under implementation since
2006. The project has already completed the implementation of the original grant and
first additional financing with a total of 1,471 small subprojects in the infrastructure,
productive and social sectors implemented by Community Based Organizations in 59
municipalities. Another 213 subprojects are to be financed under the second Additional
Financing approved in 2010. The project is estimated to have an impact on 1.2 million
people and disbursed US$24 million directly to the Community Based Organizations,
who selected priority subprojects through a democratic process. The project also provides
technical and management training and capacity building to community organizations
and their second-tier organizations. Because of its successful implementation, the project
has received additional financing from IDA and the total grant amount has increased to
SDR40.9 million. The focus of the current phase is on closer collaboration with
municipalities, through the implementation of 85 communal subprojects, a transition of
the community representative committee (COPRODEP) to a community local
development committee (CADEC) to enhance the sustainability of the created structures,
and finally an enhanced focus on assisting productive off -farm and piloting small
agricultural production subprojects.
3.      The proposed reallocation has been requested by the client in a letter from the
Minister of Economy and Finance dated July 7, 2011. The proposed reallocation is
deemed necessary to reflect the revised technical needs of the remaining project phase,
including higher focus on capacity building efforts linked to the subproject
implementation. The operational costs reflected in this reallocation reflect additional
staffing under training, communication and productive subproject strengthening. It also
represent the total operational cost for running the overall project (original grant and
second additional financing), representing about 6% of the total financing. The
operational costs (category 4) under the second additional financing grant H 5850 HT of
US$ 0.235 million will be reallocated in 2012 to reflect the increased costs under the
categories of subprojects and their related capacity building activities in that final phase.
Finally, it reflects the current needs of this institutionalization phase and the close
coordination with the local development structures.

4.      The proposed reallocation is based on a revised work plan and procurement plan
that have been prepared by the client for the remaining period of the project (2011-2013)
and reviewed by IDA.
