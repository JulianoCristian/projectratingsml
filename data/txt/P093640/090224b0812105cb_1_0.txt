Project Development Objectives
Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
Building on the successful experience of the PCF-funded CDD pilot, the proposed project would scale-up the direct transfer of public resources to local
community organizations in poor rural and peri-urban communities, by: (i) improving their access to basic social and economic infrastructure and support
income-generating activities by financing small-scale investments proposed, implemented and managed by community organizations; and (ii) improving
governance and building social capital of communities by increasing citizen participation and transparency in open decision-making processes.
Key indicators for the project would be (i) total resources transferred to OCBs over the life of the project; (ii) change in access to basic services as a function of
subprojects implemented by OCBs; (iii) cost-effectiveness of infrastructure investments, compared with traditional service delivery mechanisms, and (iv) cost-
benefit of productive subprojects.

Implementation Status Overview
The Haiti Community Driven Development project is under implementation since 2006. The project has already completed the implementation of the original grant and first additional
financing with a total of 1,471 small subprojects in the infrastructure, productive and social sectors implemented by Community Based Organizations in 59 municipalities. Another 213
>   subprojects are to be financed under the second Additional Financing approved in 2010. The project is estimated to have an impact on 1.2 million people and disbursed US$24
o   million directly to the Community Based Organizations, who selected priority subprojects through a democratic selection process. The project also provides technical and
U   management training and capacity building to community organizations and their second-tier organizations. Because of its successful implementation, the project has received
:   additional financing from IDA and the total grant amount has increased to SDR40.9 million. The focus of the current phase is on closer collaboration with municipalities, through the
o   implementation of 85 communal subprojects, a transition of the community representative committee (COPRODEP) to a community local development committee (CADEC) to
0   enhance the sustainability of the created structures, and finally an enhanced focus on assisting productive off -farm and piloting small agricultural production subprojects.
