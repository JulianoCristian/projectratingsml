7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Building on the successful experience of the PCF-funded CDD pilot, the proposed project would scale-up
the direct transfer of public resources to local community organizations in poor rural and peri-urban
communities, by: (i) improving their access to basic social and economic infrastructure and support
income-generating activities by financing small-scale investments proposed, implemented and managed by
community organizations; and (ii) improving governance and building social capital of communities by
increasing citizen participation and transparency in open decision-making processes. Key indicators for the
project would be (i) total resources transferred to OCBs over the life of the project; (ii) change in access to
basic services as a function of subprojects implemented by OCBs; (iii) cost-effectiveness of infrastructure
investments, compared with traditional service delivery mechanisms, and (iv) cost-benefit of productive
subprojects.
