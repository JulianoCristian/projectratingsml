                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         Building on the successful experience of the PCF-funded CDD pilot, the proposed project would scale-up the direct transfer of public resources to local community
                         organizations in poor rural and peri-urban communities, by: (i) improving their access to basic social and economic infrastructure and support income-generating
                         activities by financing small-scale investments proposed, implemented and managed by community organizations; and (ii) improving governance and building social
                         capital of communities by increasing citizen participation and transparency in open decision-making processes.
                          Key indicators for the project would be (i) total resources transferred to OCBs over the life of the project; (ii) change in access to basic services as a function of
                         subprojects implemented by OCBs; (iii) cost-effectiveness of infrastructure investments, compared with traditional service delivery mechanisms, and (iv) cost-benefit of
                         productive subprojects.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is based on the findings of the last supervision mission which took place between April 11-18, 2013 and which visited subprojects in the South (Aquin, Chantal, Torbeck,
                         Port Salut and Maniche), the North (Pilate and Ennery), and the Artibonite Region (Desdunes).

                         The Haiti Community Driven Development project is under implementation since 2006. The project has almost completed the implementation of the original grant and its two
                         additional financing. 1,683 of the financed 1,685 small subprojects in the infrastructure, productive and social sectors have been implemented by Community Based Organizations in
                         59 municipalities. The project is estimated to have had an impact on 1.2 million people and disbursed US$29 million directly to the Community Based Organizations, who selected
                         priority subprojects through a democratic selection process. The project also provided technical and management training and capacity building to community organizations and their
                         second-tier organizations. The last few years have seen closer collaboration with municipalities, through the implementation of 85 communal subprojects, a transition of the
                         community representative committee (COPRODEP) to a community local development committee (CADEC) to enhance the sustainability of the created structures, and finally an
                         enhanced focus on assisting productive off -farm and piloting small agricultural production subprojects. The focus of the last year has been to support 200 subprojects that needed
                         additional support to be fully operational. A series of events are currently being organized in the framework of the project closing.
