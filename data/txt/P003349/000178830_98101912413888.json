By creating an effective and well-trained staff\n            competent in all aspects of rubber development and by\n            establishing high-yielding plant material suitable for\n            Burmese conditions, this project will contribute to the\n            rehabilitation and expansion of the rubber industry in\n            Burma. The major direct benefits will be the incremental\n            production from Government estates which will total about\n            28,000 long tons over 15 years (valued at US$25 million) and\n            the incremental employment totalling about 3,200 man-years\n            during the four-year implementation phase. The project is\n            well within the implementation capacity of the agencies\n            concerned and involves no substantial risks beyond those\n            normally associated with tree crop projects involving\n            introduction of new technologies."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
