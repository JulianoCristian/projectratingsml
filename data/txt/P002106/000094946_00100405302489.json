satisfactory,\n            with a likely sustainability, and high institutional\n            development impacts. Although satisfactory, both\n            performances were uneven, due to the difficult political\n            climate which hindered implementation governance, and\n            endangered staff livelihoods. Key lessons highlight the\n            correct decision to appoint well-qualified sector, and\n            procurement specialists, who strengthened the Resident\n            Mission efforts in supporting, and organizing implementation\n            clinics on procurement, and financial matters for the\n            project implementation units (PIUs), greatly facilitating\n            the success of the project. This technical know-how also\n            provided a close working relationship with the client,\n            essential for building capacities, and project\n            restructuring. A possible supervision strategy is thus\n            suggested, i.e., to contract local firms to train, and\n            deploy supervision support teams, who would provide\n            technical assistance to the state PIUs, and carry out site\n            supervision as well, likely to ease budget constraints.\n            Recommendations suggest that project design should ensure\n            monitoring, and evaluation methods early on, so that\n            measurable indicators may identify potential project\n            adjustments. Additionally, complex arrangements, such as\n            retailing project financing through participating financial\n            intermediaries can be mitigated, preferably under the\n            Project Preparation Facility, or grant financing."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
