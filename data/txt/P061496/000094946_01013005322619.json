As a result,\n            the power grid was down and related power infrastructure\n            severely damaged, water supply, sewage systems, and\n            telecommunications were not working, and as a result, many\n            schools, hospitals, and businesses were unable to operate.\n            An emergency response means up-front costs to the Government\n            for Moldova for which they are re-channeling current\n            revenues, a lowering of revenues available for expenditures\n            in the 2001 budget. Supplemental resources will be disbursed\n            throgh a Special Fund for National Calamities. And will\n            partly finance import components (cables, tpwers, diesel\n            fuel, etc.), some labor costs, and other domestic\n            components. Any funds not directly and immediately used for\n            emergency relief will constitute general external financing,\n            and thus will be available to fund priority needs that\n            earlier were delayed in order to re-channel funds to address\n            ice storm damages. This supplement is crucial for\n            maintaining momentum for the reform program described in the\n            Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and the\n            Country Assistance Strategy, and supported by the Structural\n            Adjustment Credit."}, "docdt": "2001-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
