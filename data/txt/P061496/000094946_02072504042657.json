institutional development impact\n            as modest, Bank performance as satisfactory, as Borrower\n            performance as satisfactory. Key lessons learned from the\n            implementation include: It is important to adequately take\n            into account the political economy of the evolving\n            situation. Delays in implementing certain of the agreed\n            measures did lead to some reduction in effectiveness of the\n            program supported under the SAC. Improved public expenditure\n            management requires fundamental change in the\n            Government's range of commitments. Post-privatization\n            market development and support are needed to help contribute\n            more quickly to an upswing in agricultural production and\n            the development of rural wealth. For energy, as in the past\n            the priority must be to bring in more competent private\n            operators who have the technical know-how and financial\n            resources to restore sector efficiency. Delays in\n            privatization of attractive state enterprises, even in the\n            fact of strong political opposition, should be avoided if at\n            all possible."}, "docdt": "2002-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
