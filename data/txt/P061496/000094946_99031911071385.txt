Country and Sector Background
1.      Since 1993, Moldova has rapidly stabilized its economy, and has started
structural reforms. Financial stabilization, supported by the IMF (through an
STF, two stand-by arrangements and an EFF), had, until 1998, been Moldova's
most visible economic policy success. A new currency was introduced in 1993,
and monetary and fiscal policy tightened. Inflation fell to an annual rate of
around 15 percent in 1996, then one of the lowest rates in the FSU.
2.      The initial round of these reforms, in 1997, saw some results, as GDP
rose by 1.3 percent, the first positive growth since independence. This as
spurred by a strong rebound in the agriculture sector, which grew by 11
percent in 1997, recovering from a 12 percent drop in 1996. The continuation
of a disciplined monetary policy (supported by the IMF's EFF program) also
ensured that CPI inflation fell to 11 percent and the exchange rate was
stable. However, the energy sector's external arrears accumulated rapidly.
Fiscal deficit targets were missed by a large margin. The pressures emerging
from large fiscal and energy sector expenditures were reflected in a current
account deficit of 17 percent of GDP. 1998, however, saw two distinct phases
in Moldova's economic development. The first half of 1998 was dominated by
reform inertia, leading up to the critical Parliamentary elections held in
March. These watershed elections resulted in a strongly pro-reform ruling
Parliamentary coalition and Government. Accordingly, the second half of the
year was marked both by important legislative and Governmental milestones
promoting structural change, while the macroeconomy was being battered by the
regional financial crisis.
The Country's Adjustment Program
3.      The government's initial round of structural reforms, supported by a
Rehabilitation Loan and then by a first Structural Adjustment Loan, focused on
three areas: (a) privatizing, restructuring, and demonopolizing enterprises;
(b) strengthening the legal and regulatory framework in the financial sector;
and (c) liberalizing prices and trade. However, the pace of structural
reforms and the results lagged, and GDP continued declining--by about 3



percent in 1995 and 7.5 percent in 1996.
4.      The Government's next round of structural reforms, supported by the first
two tranches of the Second Structural Adjustment Credit and Loan (SAL II),
have been more successful, although much of the progress in implementation
came in two spurts - in mid-1997 and the second half of 1998. The reforms
supported by SAL II aimed to: (a) restore viability to the PAYG pension system
through a comprehensive reform; (b) demonopolize and privatize the energy
sector - gas and electricity - and improve its financial viability; (c) spur
the development of private agriculture through farm restructuring, land
titling and the development of a market in land; (d) complete the process of
enterprise privatization by moving from mass privatization to systematic
privatization for cash. Under this operation, a much-needed (and much-
delayed) reform to the PAYG pension system was adopted in 1998, as was the
privatization of the gas sector and numerous enterprises and associated
"objects". At the same time, reduced demand in Russia, along with the
inability of the Russian banks to service Moldovan exporters, led to a
significant reduction of trade flows with Russia, the dominant market for
Moldovan exports. Consequently, exports dropped 23 percent and imports 8
percent in the first eleven months of 1998. As a result, GDP is estimated to
have fallen by over 5 percent in 1998.
The Proposed Loan/Credit
5.      The proposed SAC would extend the agenda of SAL II, by supporting the
implementation of the Government's program in the areas of (i) Controlling
Budgetary Arrears; (ii) De-Monopolizing and Privatizing the Energy Sector;
and (iii) Creating a Flexible and Competitive Private Sector, including in
Agriculture.
