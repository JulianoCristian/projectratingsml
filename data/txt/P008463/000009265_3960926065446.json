It also supports the program for reform\n            in Hungary and development of the telecommunications sector\n            by (a) increasing the financial and administrative autonomy,\n            flexibility and efficiency of MP's telecommunications\n            activities; (b) rehabilitating and expanding the local\n            telephone network and expanding the long distance telephone\n            network; and (c) expanding telex and data services.  Further\n            to this, the project supports (d) improving the geographical\n            balance of the network by extending services outside\n            Budapest; and (e) providing consultants' services for\n            review of the tariff structure, traffic measurement and\n            engineering, creation of a software center, development of a\n            digitalization plan, improvement of management information\n            systems and expansion of telephone associations."}, "docdt": "1987-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
