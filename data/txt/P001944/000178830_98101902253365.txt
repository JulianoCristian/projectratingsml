REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Niger for the equivalent of US$15.6
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a highway project. The Banque
Arabe pour le Developpement Economique en Afrique (BADEA) is contributing
IJSS7 million to the project.  The BADEA loan will be ma(ie for a term of 3C
years, including 5 years of grace, at an Interest rate of I Percent per
annum: a commitment charge of 2 percent per annum will- ne applied to thie in-
withdrawrn portion of the loan. The African Development Fund (ADF) is con-
tribhtinp 3.24 million ADF Units of Account (presentlv equivalent to USS3Jr
million) to the project. The ADF loan will be made for a term of 50 years,
inclutding 10 years of grace; a service charge of 0.75 percent per annum will
he applied to the amount withdrawn and still outstanding.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The problems of economic development in Niger were set out in a
report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Niger" dated May 1972
(A14-36a). An economic mission visited Niger in October/November 1973 but
owing to the change of government that occurred in April 1974, official com-
ment of the new Government on the draft report could not be obtained. An
economic updating mission visited the country in October 1975 and a Countrv
Economic Memorandum is being prepared. Annex I contains country data.
Background
3.        Niger has been classified by the lUnited Nations as one of the 25
"least developed" countries. Like its SaheLian neighbors, it suffers from a
number of serious growth constraints: a landlocked position resu:lting in high
transport costs; a small domestic market and limited marketing facilities; poor
soils and unfavorable climatic conditions; lack of water; extremely high
energy costs; and a low level of education, particularly in the rural areas.
4.        The economy is particularly vulnerable to the vagaries of the
weather. Agriculture and livestock together account for nearly half of GDP
and provide the bulk of export earnings. The rapid development of uranium
mining in the desert is contributing to economic diversification, increased
net foreign exchange earnings and a most welcome broadening of the tax base.
The contribution of uranium mining to GDP is expected to increase from around
5 percent at present to 15 percent by the earlv 1980's. The share of manu-
facturing amounts to little over 10 percent of GDP. Consumption as a percen-
tage of GDP has traditionally been high (around 95 percent) and domestic

savings are very modest. During the past 5 years an estimated 85 percent of
investment in the monetized economy has been financed by external capital in-
flows.
Recent Economic Developments
5.        GDP increased moderately up to 1971.    As a result of the drought in
the Sahel, national income and capital assets (livestock) suffered a sharp
decline in 1973 and the first part of 1974. Recovery thereafter has been very
slow. The drought in the 1973/74 crop year severely affected agriculture and
livestock: production of basic food grains declined to about 750,000 tons,
or 60 percent of what is considered a normal crop. Export crops (groundnuts,
cotton) also suffered because of reduced yields, and as a result of a shift
of land and labor to food crops. The production of groundnuts for example,
traditionally the largest export crop, declined by 70 percent. Livestock
surveys conducted in early 1974 confirm that the size of the pre-drought
cattleherd was probably almost halved. Accordingly, the income of many
pastoralists has been sharply reduced, and the southward migration of the
population accelerated, adding new dimensions to an already difficult econo-
mic situation.
6.        In 1974/75, rainfall was more favorable and crop production recovered,
benefitting also from the Government's timely decision to raise producer prices
for several agricultural commodities. Groundnut.production, however, suffered
another severe set back, this time due to insect attacks and disease problems.
Recovery in livestock was understandably very slow. Altogether, value added
in the agricultural sector is still estimated to be substantially below its
1972 level.
7.        While reliance on foreign resources has remained important, the
balance of payments has been in surplus since 1969 -- except in 1974 when
falling agricultural exports and skyrocketing import prices resulted in a
more than 100 percent increase in the trade deficit, and an overall deficit
of US$16.8 million. The overall surpluses have been made possible by the
increasing inflow of foreign aid (largely grants). Net foreign assets, which
had doubled between 1969 and 1973, dropped to about US$45 million in late 1975,
equivalent to three months of imports. Most uranium mining development has
been financed by private foreign capital inflows. The Government has a
one-third interest in the equity of the first mine which started production
in 1971. A second mine is expected to commence production in 1978. At current
uranium prices this new industry in Niger is highly profitable both from a
private and a social point of view.
8.        In contrast with a rather depressed real economy, the Government's
financial situation has been relatively healthy in the last five to six years.
Control of current spending and rising revenue, mainly from taxes on the
"modern" sector, enabled the Government to generate increasing budgetary
savings. Sharply increased revenues from uranium (CFAF3-4 billion in 1975/76)
are expected following an agreement on higher uranium export prices with the
French Atomic Energy Commission. Whilst some of the major public sector enter-
prises are currently experiencing serious financial problems, the liquidity
position of the public sector as a whole continues to be strong. Treasury de-
posits with the banking system reached CFAF 8.5 billion in September 1975,
equivalent to about one third of current revenues expected in FY1975/1976.



-3-
Foreign Aid
9.        During 1968-1973, Niger obtained commitments of on average US$40
million a year from its major traditional sources of aid: France, FED, Canada,
the U.S.A., Germany, I.D.A. and the U.N. About 90 perc:ent of total aid in
the last few years has been made available in the form of grants; most of the
remainder consisted of loans on concessionary terms. Aid in the drought years
1972/73 and 1973/74, including emergency food shipments, was about double the
annual average level of 1968/73.
10.       At the end of 1973, the total amount of external debt outstanding was
US$116.7 million, of which US$71.3 million was disbursed. I.D.A.'s share of
total debt outstanding was 16.1 percent. The ratio of debt service payments
to exports of goods and non-factor services rose from 3.5 percent in 1973 to
about 5 percent in 1974 (estimate), mainly due to the (decline in exports. No
external debt servicing problems are foreseen.
Government Policies and Development Prospects
11.       At the time of the military take-over (April 1974), the previous
government was preparing a ten-year "perspective" program. This has been
abandoned, and the new regime has prepared a three-year interim development
program. It calls for annual public sector investments of over CFAF25
billion (US$120 million) which is more than double the highest level ever
achieved (1973/74). The investment target may be regarded as overly ambi-
tious in terms of both resources and absorbtive capacity. Highest priority
is attached to the development of agriculture and animal husbandry -- the
longer-run target being self-sufficiency in food grains. Infrastructure is
given lower priority than in the past. Industry will continue to be import-
substitution oriented. Mining development is to gain momentum thanks to
uranium. An earlier announced discovery of oil in the desert north of Lake
Chad turned out to be of no economic significance. Further exploratory
drilling is continuing.
12.       Shortcomings in project identification, preparation and implemen-
tation have been felt to be major obstacles to timely aclhievement of plan
targets. Now that the Government faces the problem of how best to use sub-
stantially greater resources than in the past from uranium exploitaition,
appropriate project selection must receive increased attention. To meet
this urgent need, the Government recently created a National Development
Council in which all ministries concerned are represented.
13.       Barring major new mineral discoveries, Niger's long-run development
potential lies mainly in agriculture and livestock. Self-sufficiency in food,
development of export crops and modernization of the livestock sector can
hardly be achieved without major increases in irrigation and application of
improved technologies. Arable land is becoming increasingly scarce and
growth through extensive cultivation increasingly difficult. In the live-
stock sector, the Government's intention of reconstituting the herd to 80
percent of its pre-drought size seems to be appropriate in view of the
limited pasture capacity. The Government also intends to, and should, take
full advantage of the present situation to change the life pattern of nomadic



livestock raisers, i.e. to induce them to settle by introducing suitable
credit and pasture management policies.
14.       The Government will continue to promote mineral prospecting and
exploitation. Besides uranium, interesting indications of large phosphate
deposits have been identified. It is impossible at this stage, however, to
say to what extent phosphate exploitation can contribute to development,
especially in view of the high transport costs involved. Even under favorable
assumptions regarding the mineral sector, the long-run prospects of the
economy cannot be depicted as bright considering the constraints described
in para. 3. Foreign aid (including technical assistance) will be needed for
years to come and should continue to flow, for some time at least, on highly
concessionary terms.
15.       The Government's contribution to the financing of public investment
projects can be expected to increase somewhat in the future, thanks to the
revenues contributed by uranium and assuming that policies of strict budget-
ary control will be continued. Nevertheless, in view of Niger's desperate
poverty it will be appropriate for external lending agencies to finance an ex-
ceptionally high proportion of project costs, including a substantial amount
of local costs.
PART II: BAiNK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGER
16.       Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Recognizing the magnitude of the constraint of inadequate transport
and communications on the development of Niger the Bank Group's strategy in
the country has been so far concentrated mainly on the development of the in-
ternal transportation infrastructure, primarily roads. Bankc Group operations
to date for highway development have been directed to up-grading trunk roads,
reviewing and reorganizing routine maintenance procedures and some training
of staff of the Directorate of Public Works and Urban Affairs (DPW). The
projects have all been satisfactorily executed and the most recent one is
virtually complete.
18.       Bank Group assistance in the development of the transportation sec-
tor will continue. However, future IDA lending will be increasingly channelled
directly to the two main productive sectors, agriculture and livestock, with
a view to raising the income of the rural population. An integrated rural
development project was recently approved by the Executive Directors. This
project covers the whole! department of Maradi and is designed to provide bene-
fits to about 70,000 families, involving some 500,000 people. Its primary aim
is to raise productivity in agriculture and animal husbandry through improved
extension services, agriculture credit, road development, soil conservation,
health care and functional literacy.



19.       A number of other projects are under consideration by the Association
for financing and are scheduled to be submitted to the Executive Directors for
consideration in the near future; a proJect for the production of rice under
irrigation, currently under preparation; a teleconmunications project; and a
livestock project currently being prepared by the Fonds d'Aide et de Coopera-
ticn (FAC).
20.       Niger remains one of the countries in which external assistance is
limited at present more by the country7s capacity to identify, prepare and
implement projects than by shortage of external funds. To alleviate this
constraint, projects financed by the Bank Group in Niger will generally
include elements of technical assistance and training of local staff.
21.       The Bank Group, which ranks sixth in terms of volume of aid com-
mitted, about US$32.8 million, behind France, the Fonds Europeen de Develop-
ment (FED), Canada, USA and Germany, and roughly on a par with the UN, has
been a relatively small lender to date, providing only about 7 percent of
total foreign aid committed to Niger during the six years ending 1973.
PART III: TRANSPORTATION IN NIGER
The Transport System
22.       Niger's land-locked economy is burdened with high transport costs
because of long distances between important production centers and to ocean
ports. Road transport is predominant; rail transport is non-existent. Scarce
natural resources cause heavy dependence on imports. There are three main
export/import routes; one runs from Zinder through Nigeria to the Port of
Lagos and carries about 50% of total import/export freight; a second runs
from Niamey through Benin    to the Ports of Cotonou and Lome and carries 45%
of total import/export freight; and the third runs from Niamey through Upper
Volta and the Ivory Coast to the Port of Abidjan and carries the remainder.
23.       There are about 7,000 km of classified roads, of which about 1,300
kin are paved; the remainder are gravel or earth roads and tracks which are of
generally low design standards and some are periodically closed to traffic
during the rainy season. There are also about 4,000 km of unclassified earth
tracks connecting areas of agricu'ltural activity. The main backbone of the
road system is the 1,800 km east-west axis between the Mali and Chad borders,
which crosses the most fertile and densely populated parts of the country,
and which is being improved with assistance from IDA, Canada and FED. The
vast uninhabited areas in the rest of the countrv are only sparsely served
(Map 11522).
24.       Water transport has been of little importance, primarily due to
highly irregular water levels and lack of infrastructure to harness the main
waterway, the Niger river.   In 1972 however, the Government created a Societe



- 6 -
Nationale des Transports Fluviaux (SNTF) which is working towards using the
Niger river as an alternative outlet to the sea. With the completion of the
Kainji dam in Nigeria in 1974, tile river became potentially navigahle for
about seven months of the year.   The Canadian International Development:
Agency (CIDA) is currently undertaking a uJS$4.0 million study of the feasibi-
lity of river transport with experimental barge trips betwecn Gaya to the port:
of Warri (Nigeria), a distance of about 1,400 km.    ihe first trial took place
in 1973, but activities are stil.l. conducted on an experimental basis and the
final result remains uncertain.
25.       Air transport in Niger is centered aroun-id the international airport
of Niamey which is the closest t:o Europe of ail West jAfrlcan airports south
of the Sahara, and an important transit stop; the airport has stimulated
the economy and generated significant revenues from alir- raft landing fees.
In view of the importance to the economy of retaining t:ransit traf-fic for
Niamey airport, the Association is helping finance a project for its
improvement.
Road Transport Industlr
26.       Public freight transport is handled by well over 250 transporters,
about half of theia located in the capital city, Niamey. The largest of these
is the Societe Nationale des Transporteurs Nigeriens (S'3TN), a company with
mixed capital (Government 49%; foreign, mainly Frencii, 47%; anc Niger private,
4%).  The company owns a fleet of about 260 iuiits, and when necessary, rmnts
trumcks.  It handles about 75% of ftuel transport, and aboot .30% of all general
freight carried; it has the monopoly for tranisport of uranium ore frozm the
mines at Arlit through Niamey to Parakou ( Benin ).
27,       There is little direct: government intervention in road transport
operations and no official tariffs.   The latter are negotiated on a case-bv--
case basis; in 1974, actual tariffs ranged between CFAF 16-24 (USe 7-1l.) per
ton-kni, only slightly hligher than in the coastal counltri-S of West Africa.
The prevailing competition among truckers and the lack of tariff regulationIs
mean that much of the decrease in vehicle operating costs resulxting from road
improvements will rmost probably be transferred to prc.dluc-rs and consumers,
Un.like freight haulage, passenger transport is poorly organized, and. deniand is
higner than the present capacity.
Iighway Administration
28.       The Directorate of Public Works aind Urban Affairs (DPW) has overall
responsibility for the admninistration, design, construction and maintenance uF
the road system;  for highways, the Road Study Office is in charge of design,
and the Central Office for Roads and New Works (Central Road Office, CRO)
handles construction and maintenance works, including management of th2     OPW
equipment pool.



-7-
29.       DPW's staffing situation is quite adequate, but management personnel
are almost all non-Nigeriens, mostly French engineers under a long-standing
FAC technical assistance program; some lower-level French officers also serve
under this program. The Ministry of Development has prepared a plan for
Nigerien staff to take over responsibilities now held by foreigners in all
Ministries; implementation of this plan within DPW is, however, quite diffi-
cult, as only a few local counterparts are available, mostly at middle-level
positions. The Government has agreed to review and update its replacement
plan and to carry out a realistic and well defined training program for high
level DPW personnel, all in consultation with the Association (Section 3.06
of draft Development Credit Agreement).
Planning
30.       Under a FAC-financed transport study carried out in 1967, French
consultants (SEDES) developed an eight-year plan (1968-75) which focussed on
two main requirements: upgrading the important east-west trunk road (about
1,800 km), and improving import-export routes. Highway investments over the
period have been based on this plan. The Bank Group has participated through
Credit 231-NIR which helped finance paving of the Niamey-Tillabery section
(115 km) of the east-west road; construction of import/export routes from
Zinder and Maradi to the Nigerian border is proposed under the present project.
The FAC is now planning to finance a study of transport development to be
executed over 1976/77. The proposed study will be a follow-up to tue one
carried out in 1967 and will pay special attention to the upgrading of the
road system.
31.       Since transport demand in Niger is generally low, major new invest-
ments in the expansion of the present road system can seldom be economically
justified. The appropriate strategy for coping with the critical problem of
high domestic transport costs is to preserve the existing network from deteri-
oration, and to plan for progressive improvement. Government policy in highway
planning is in line with this strategy.
Financing
32.       Highway expenditures are financed from three sources:    the National
Budget provides funds for administration and routine maintenance of national
roads; the National Investment Fund (para. 33 below) finances minor road
improvements and periodic maintenance works; foreign aid financing (princi-
pally from FAC, FED, USAID and the Bank Group) is spent mostly on new con-
struction. Road expenditures over 1970-74 totalled about CFAF 16.1 billion
(US$68.5 million equivalent), of which CFAF 11.2 billion (US$46 million) or
70% for investment, and the rest for maintenance.
33.       Road users contribute to the National Budget through taxes levied
on fuels (CFAF 16/liter on gasoline, CFAF 6/liter on diesel oil), taxes and
duties on imports of vehicles and spare parts, and taxes for vehicle regis-
tration and licensing. Additional taxes on fuels (CFAF 6/liter on gasoline,



-8-
CFAF 4/liter on diesel oil) are earmarked for road expenditures in the
National Investment Fund, established in 1970 to replace the Road Fund.
Total revenues from all the above sources amounted over 1970-74 to about CFAF
7 billion (US$28.4 million equivalent).
The Road Construction Industry
34.       The domestic construction industry is at an early stage of develop-
ment. In building construction, there are several contractors who can compete
with foreign firms. For road works, however, thvre are only two domestic
firms, and the activities of one of them are limited to transporting construc-
tion materials; the other, the Societe Nationale des Grands Travaux du Niger
(SNGTN) 1/, has staff and equipment to handle fairly large road works, as well
as a variety of building construction jobs. Its financial situation is none-
theless precarious, with a deficit in 1974 of about CFAF 40 million. Fortu-
nately, this deficit is expected to be partially offset by anticipated profits
of about CFAF 30 million from SNGTN's first international joint venture in
road construction, a contract with SATOM (France) for reconstruction of the
Tsernaoua-Tahoua road (122 km) being carried out with FAC financing. In an
attempt to promote the domestic industry, the Government: has requested that
a 7-1/2% preference in Bank Group-financed civil works be granted to contrac-
tors suitably prequalified as bona fide domestic firms.
Maintenance
35.       Road maintenance is carried out by DPW's regional divisions and
their subdivisions. Routine maintenance techniques and output have improved
substantially aas a result of the First Highway Maintenance Project (Credit
128-NIR). As regards periodic maintenance operations, the Highway Maintenance
Project achieved its aim of eliminating the heavy backlog by regravelling
about 750 km of roads by contract. Once this was done, periodic maintenance
continued to be carried out mostly by contract, but at a slower and inadequate
rate because of the shortage of government funds. One of the objectives of the
proposed Third Highway Project is to enable DPW to progressively assume res-
ponsibility for carrying out periodic maintenance with its own forces. This
will bring about savings in periodic maintenance costs and increased output
per year.
36.       The Government provided assurances under Credit 231-NIR that it
would make adequate budget allocations to ensure proper maintenance of the
road network. Accordingly, expenditures for maintenance (including adminis-
tration) have increased from about CFAF 756 million in 1970 to about CFAF
1.1 billion in 1974 and have even exceeded the amounts forecast during
appraisal of the above-mentioned project. For 1975, however, the maintenance
allocation dropped below the previous year's level and DPW has had to request
an extraordinary allocation of CFAF 200 million which is to be provided out
of budget reserves.

PART IV: THE PROJECT
37.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Highway Project-Niger"
(No. 899a - NIR) is being circulated separately. A credit and project summary,
including a breakdown of costs, is contained in Annex III, and the project
area is shown on the attached maps (IBRD 11522 and 11523). The project is
based on studies by consultants BCEOM and Louis Bergen done in 1974 an(i on
information provided by DPW. Field appraisal took place in November/December
1974, and after the finalization of co-financing arrangements which took
sometime, was completed at headquarters in October, 1975. Negotiations
were held in Washington from October 23 to October 24. The delegation was
led by M. Mahaman Annou, Minister of Develompent and included M. Moussa Bako,
Director of Public Works, Transportation and Urban Development.
Project Description
38.       The proposed project consists of:
(a) implementation of a four-year program of periodic
maintenance, including procurement of equipment and
training of specialized DPW staff at all levels;
(b) construction and improvement of the roads Zinder-
Nigerian border (about 113 km), and Maradi-Nigerian
border (Djibiya) (about 49 km); and
(c) consulting services for: (i) technical assistance
required under item (a) above; (ii) supervision of
road construction; and (iii) a survey of the domestic
construction industry.
Project Execution
39.       Execution of the project will be the responsibility of DPW, assisted
by consultants. The Government is planning to employ BCEOM to provide the
technical assistance required for the maintenance program because of its
experience with local conditions and problems acquired during its reorganiza-
tion of the routine maintenance operation in the country; the Association
accepts this arrangement. Consultants for the other project items will be
selected in agreement with, and on terms and conditions satisfactory to, the
Association. Project implementation is expected to start in early 1976, and
take 4 years to complete.
40.       The Zinder-Nigerian border road will establish a road link with Kano,
via the Babura-Kunyla road in\Nigeria.   Official assurances have been received
from the Niger-Nigeria Joint Commission that Nigeria's Third National Develop-
ment plan (1975) lists the Babura-Kunyia road as a federal road, and that it
will be constructed. These assurances have been confirmed during credit nego-
tiation and are considered adequate for present purposes. However, it has been
agreed that the Zinder-Nigerien border road will be deleted from the project
later on if the Association is not satisfied that the appropriate arrangements
have in fact been made to build the Babura-Kunyia road.



- 10 -
41.       Periodic maintenance will be carried out by force account with
equipment to be procured under the project. Four regravelling units to be
established will be expected ultimately to maintain annually about 320 km of
gravel roads, a rate sufficient to keep this network in satisfactory condition.
Some of the regravelling works may also provide suitable training for newly
established road contractors, and the terms of reference agreed upon with
the Government for the survev of the Nigerien rural construction industry
(para. 42 below) provide that, based on the findings and recommendations of
this survey, the Government will examine with the Association the possibility
of having some participation by domestic contractors in the execution of re-
gravelling works.
Survey of the Domestic Construction Industry
42.       The proposed project provides for about eight man-months of consul-
ting services to prepare a survey of the domestic construction industry.    The
consultants would be expectedl to review the present status of the industry
and attempt to identify factors hindering its growth and propose possible
solutions. Outline terms of reference have been discussed and agreed with
Government.
Training
43.       The proposed project provides for about 160 man-months of technical
assistance to help reorganize DPWq's activities to handle its increased main-
tenance responsibilities, and to train specialized local personnel at all
levels. Since the training of local staff is considered one of the most
important objectives of the maintenance component of the proposed project,
Government has agreed that qualified personnel will be appointed to serve as
counterparts to the consultant team. (Section 3.07 (a) and (b) of draft
Development Credit Agreement). Training will be done essentially on the job,
complemented by theoretical courses. The Government has agreed to prepare,
with the assistance of consultants, a detailed program with quantitative
targets for the training of DPW engineers, unit chiefs, and workshop and field
personnel, and will submit it- to the Association within four months of the date
of effectiveness of the proposed Credit, for review and approval (Section 3.07
(c) of draft Development Credit Agreement). Outline terms of reference for
technical assistance and the training program have been discussed and agreed
with Government.
Cost Estimates
44.       The total capital cost of the project, net of taxes and duties
but including contingencies, is estimated at US$28.7 million equivalent, with
foreign costs of about IS$24.7 million (86%); taxes and duties total about
US$9.8 million equivalent. Estimates reflect prices at end-1975. The details
of project cost estimates are presented in Annex III and summarized below:

Financial Arrangements and Disbursements
45.       The project will be financed by the Association, the Banque Arabe
pour le Development Economique en Afrique (BADEA), the African Development
Fund (ADF), and by Government, under separate agreements between each lending
agency and Government. The proposed financing plan, with the corresponding
proportion of total project costs net of taxes to be provided by each entity,
is as follows:  IDA Credit, US$15.6 million (54.3 percent); BADEA, US$7.0



- 12 -
million (24.4 percent), ADF, US$3.6 million 1/ (12.5 percent); Government,
US$2.5 million (8.8 percent). The entire Zinder-Nigerian border road will be
constructed under a single contract. The ADF will finance the full cost
(net of taxes) of one 28 km section of the road; the Association and BADEA
will jointly finance 90 percent of the cost (net of taxes) of the remainder
of this road (85 km), and of all remaining project components. The proposed
financing plan is summarized below:

Details of the above arrangements have been agreed with Government and the
co-financiers. The BADEA loan will be made for a term of 30 years, including
5 years grace, at an interest rate of 2 percent per annum; a commitment charge
of 0.5 percent per annum will be applied to the unwithdrawn portion of the loan.
The ADF loan will be made for a term of 50 years, including 10 years grace; a
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum will be applied to the amount with-
drawn and still outstanding.
46.       In order to ensure that the interdenendent aspects of the project
items are adequately taken into account bv the co-lenders, the Association
will enter into an understanding with ADF and BADEA, according to which all
these parties would agree to coordinate their actions and to keep each other
informed of the status of project implementation. The signing of the BADEA
and the ADI' loan Agreements is a condition of effectiveness for the proposed
project.
47.       In addition to its contribution to the capital costs of the project,
the Government has agreed to meet recurrent expenditures for routine and periodic
road maintenance operations (Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
1/   ADF is contributing ADF units of account 3.24 million presently equivalent
to USS3.6 million.

Procurement and Disbursement
48.       Road construction works will be carried out under unit price
contract to be awarded following international competitive bidding in ac-
cordance with Bank Group guidelines. At the Government's request, domestic
contractors will receive a preference in bid evaluation in accordance with
the above guidelines. Equipment will be procured on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. THow-
ever, for items or groups of items expected to cost the equivalent of
USS10,000 or less, up to an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent
of US$300,000, procurement may be on the basis of local bidding procedures
acceptable to the Association.
49.        IDA Credit proceeds will be disbursed on the following basis:    (a)
51 percent of total expenditures for technical assistance and training, and
other consulting services; (b) 53 percent of total expenditures for equipment
pruchase; and (c) 44 percent of total expenditures for road construction.
Benefits and Justification
50.       Overall, the maintenance and construction works under the proposed
project are expected to result in reduced vehicle operating costs and increased
efficiency of the road transport industry; these benefits will accrue to the
economv as a whole, and will be passed on to different segments of the popula-
tion in varying degrees. Reduced vehicle operating costs will directly benefit
the owners of commercial vehicles; since transport prices in Niger are determined
in a competitive framework, a substantial part of this benefit should be passed
on to producers and consumers. There would also be government savings in future
road rehabili-tation costs.
51.       The maintenance program is expected to lead to the following direct
benefits: (i) reduction in vehicle operating costs: (ii) increase in seasonal
use of roads which play a vital role in the country's economic development;
and (iii) reduction of the per kilometer cost of regravelling operations.
The economic return for the maintenance program which represents 24 percent of
project costs (net of taxes) is about 28 percent. As regards actual execution
of the program, maintenance units are expected to be in place at end-1978, and
full benefits of the operation are expected to accrue in 1980 (about 95 percent
in 197P, the last year of the proposed program). Implementation of the planned
maintenance is expected to produce a combined average reduction of about 25
percent in vehicle operating units. The direct benefits of the construction
of the proposed Zinder-Nigerien border road (113 km) will derive from distance
savings, reduced vehicle operating costs, and saving in maintenance costs. In
addition to the benefits from diverted and local traffic, the analysis also
includes generated traffic of light vehicles. The estimate of economic return
for construction of this road which represents 49 percent of project costs
(net of tax) is 13 percent. The benefits applied in the analysis of the cons-
truction of the Maradi-Nigerien Border Road (49 km) have been quantified and
expressed in road user savings and savinRs in future maintenance costs. The
return on this road which represents 27 percent of project costs (net of taxes)
is about 16 percent. The weighted average return for the project is estimated
at about 17 percent.



- 14 --
52.        Institution-building is of primary importance, and the component
included in the project represents a major benefit which cannot be quantified.
It consists of providing DPW with the technical assistance required to reor-
ganize its activities to handle new maintenance tasks. Seven experts will he
provided, each of whom will be expected to train a local counterpart to take
over his duties before the end of his assignment.
PART V:   LEGAL INShRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association and
the Republic of Niger, the recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit, are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
54.        The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the normal Dattern
for credits for highway projects. Special features of interest are referred
to in paragraghs 29, 40, 43 and 47.
55.       An additional condition of effectiveness would be that the BADEA
Loan Agreement and the ADF Loan Agreement have been signed and that conditions
precedent to the initial disbursements, if any, under said agreements, save
for the effectiveness of the IDA Development Credit Agreement, have been
fulfilled.
56.        I ar, s.;ttS`'ed th-;lt lhe proposo(I development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI:    RECOMMENDATION
57.        I recommend that the Executive D)irectors approve the proposed credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit 207 - Agricultural Credit Project; US$584,000 Credit of June 9, 1970;
Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Disbursements have been much lower than expected due to: lack of
demand until recently due to the drought; the existence of large inventories
of fertilizers and other inputs at the beginning of the project; Niger's poorly
developed credit, input and extension delivery systems. We have proposed and
Government has agreed, to cancel the remaining amount of this credit. Appro-
priate procedures are now being initiated to this end.

Credit 231 - Second Highway Construction Project; US$6.55 million Credit of
January 29, 1971 (as amended on November 26, 1973);
Closing Date - July 31, 1976
Work on the Niamey-Tillabery road (115 km) and on the Magaria-Tinkim-
Dan Tyao (28 km) has been completed. Detailed engineering for the Niamey-
Baleyara road was dropped at Government's request since its construction was
found to be pre-mature. Detailed engineering on the Maradi-Nigerian border
road (49 km) was substituted in its place. The Zinder-Bande road study was
extended to the Nigerian border as assurances were received by Nigeria that
the connecting road Babura-Kunyia would be constructed. Construction of the
roads are included in the Third Highway Project.
Credit 441 - Drought Relief Project; US$2.0 million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
The credit, approved on November 13, 1973, is one of six credits
made to the six sahelian countries to help people in drought-affected areas
to reestablish their self-sufficiency through redevelopment and improvement of
their farms and herds. The Banque de Developpment de la Republique du Niger
(BDRN) is serving as the intermediary for channeling funds to the different
Government agencies who have responsibility for the execution of various sub-
projects.
Credit 473 - Niamey Airport Project: US$5.0 million Credit of May 24, 1974;
"JL.1Ug Date December 31, 1976
This credit provides for improvements to existing facilities so as
to enable modern, large body aircraft to operate safely and economically to
and from Niamey Airport. The project provides for strengthening and lengthen-
ing the runway, strengthening of the taxiway, enlarging and strengthening the
aircraft parking apron as well as the upgrading and relocation of the Instru-
ment Landing System. Work began on the civil works portion of the project
in May, 1975 and is expected to be completed by September 1976. Due to cost
increases and currency realignments, supplementary financing of up to US$1.0
million may be needed at a later date.
Maradi Rural Development Project: US$10 million Credit to be signed shortly;
Closing Date June 30, 1979
This project provides production packages for the improvement of
the productivity of major crops, including groundnuts and millet, in areas
covered by 15 selected Associations Locales de Cooperatives; it aims to
strengthen these cooperative institutions, to expand educational and training
programs; to develop irrigation potential in the Goulbi de Maradi; to
construct roads; to improve livestock services; to increase productivity of
fuel wood plantations; and to establish a project education unit.

Procurement
Arrangements:           Road construction works will be carried out under
unit price contract to be awarded following inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines.   At the Government's request,
domestic contractors will receive a preference in
bid evaluation in accordance with the above guide-
lines. Equipment will be procured on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines. However, for items or
groups of items expected to cost the equivalent
of US$10,000 or less, up to an aggregate amount
not exceeding the equivalent of US$100,000, procure-
ment may be on the basis of local bidding procedures
acceptable to the Association.



ANNEX III
Page 5
Bidding documents, approved by the Association,
provide for a preference to domestic contractors
in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
Staffing:                 BCEOM's highway maintenance study estimates that about
160 man-months of technical assistance will be needed.
The proposed team would include initially one high--
way engineer, three mechanical experts, two chiefs for
the regravelling units, and one expert in routine
maintenance of paved roads. Each of the experts would
be expected to train a ]ocal counterpart to take over
his duties before the end of his assignment.   The
Government. with the assistance of consultants, will
prepare a detailed program with quantitative targets
for implementation of the training of DPW specialized
personnel.  The consultants will also prepare bidding
documents for equipment purchase. Consultant services
will be required for supervision of road construction
works. About 8 man-months are provided to prepare a
survey of the domestic construction industry.
