1.   The interest rate payable by Participating Financial Institu-
tions to the Borrower on funds out of the Loan shall be a variable
rate per annum equal to the  average weighted interest cost of the
Participating Financial  Institutions'  (excluding  BAPINDO, PDFCI
and UPPINDO) loanable funds arising out of their customer deposits
(i.e.,  excluding  free  funds   from  government  and  parastatal
agencies) over a six-month  period.  This  rate will be determined
according to the following  formula  and adjusted every six months
or such other period of time  to  be determined by the Borrower in
consultation with the Bank:
                   t=6
                     rTt (Tt) + rSt (St) + rDt (MDt)

          to an Interest Period for which BI has consolidated data
          on the deposit base of the PFIs
rDt  =    interest rate payable on  PFIs' demand deposits, at time
          t
rTt  =    interest rate payable on PFIs' time deposits, at time t
rSt  =    interest rate payable on  PFIs' saving deposits, at time

2.   Notwithstanding   the   above   cost-of-funds   formula,  the
relending rate of the  Participating Financial Institutions, shall
not be less than the interest  rate  on  the Loan plus a margin of
1.75%.
