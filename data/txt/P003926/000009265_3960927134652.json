has been\n            implementing a series of policy reforms aimed at promoting\n            private investment, stabilizing the economy, liberalizing\n            the trade regime, deregulating industry, and improving the\n            financial sector. Although this process is incomplete, the\n            results thus far have been encouraging. However, a need\n            still exists at the subsector level to provide financial and\n            technical assistance to help individual enterprises to\n            restructure and adjust to the increasingly deregulated, more\n            competitive environment. The Industrial Restructuring\n            Project will address this need through: (i) an investment\n            credit component to provide financial assistance through\n            participating financial institutions (PFI) for restructuring\n            projects, including environmental actions in eligible\n            enterprises; (ii) a technical assistance component to\n            strengthen institutional capabilities and technical\n            services, and improve the abilities of the PFIs to evaluate\n            the technical, environmental, financial, and economic\n            aspects of the proposals; and (iii) a studies component for\n            preparation of a second restructuring project."}, "docdt": "1989-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
