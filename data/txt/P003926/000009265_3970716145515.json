The project's main objective was to\n            increase the supply of unsubsidized term finance and\n            high-quality technical assistance to enterprises undergoing\n            restructuring in three industrial subsectors namely\n            textiles, pulp and paper, and engineering. Bank\u2019s\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower\u2019s performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned are as follows: (i)\n            the experience with the IRP confirmed the validity of the\n            Bank's Operational Directive on Financial Sector\n            Operations; (ii) support for the provision of technical\n            services to firms needs to be driven by the demands of those\n            enterprises, rather than be supply driven, and should be\n            based on supporting measures to improve the public and\n            private provision of those services; (iii) build into\n            projects systems to monitor subproject implementation\n            results and TA impact; and, (iv) successful execution of\n            studies requires participation of all stakeholders\n            throughout the process, and adequate capacity in the\n            implementing agencies to manage them effectively."}, "docdt": "1997-02-20T00:00:00Z"}
