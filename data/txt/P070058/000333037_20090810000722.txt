1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      At the time of appraisal, Uruguay had already achieved relatively high levels of public
service coverage and quality compared to other Latin American countries, but services were more
expensive and also suffered from shortcomings with respect to efficiency and consumer
protection. Public services were almost exclusively in the hands of state-owned utilities, which
functioned as policy makers, regulators, and operators. The absence of competition and
independent regulations contributed to relatively high prices and operational inefficiencies in
service provision that negatively impacted country competitiveness and consumer welfare. In
addition, the lack of independent and transparent regulations discouraged the participation of the
private sector in provision of public services.

2.      In the 1990s, the Government of Uruguay (GOU) initiated a process of gradual yet
significant sector reforms that encouraged private sector participation (PSP). This process
involved the de-monopolization of certain sectors coupled with the development of legal and
regulatory frameworks:

     Port operations improved substantially in recent years as the National Port Authority
        (ANP) introduced private concessionaries in the construction and operation of port
        facilities.
     In the electricity sector, new legislation challenged the role of the National Power
        Company (UTE) as policy maker, regulator and operator by opening power generation to
        competition, regulating transmission and distribution and allowing access to the
        transmission system by power generators and large customers;
     In the natural gas sector, decrees to regulate the import, transportation and storage of gas
        controlled by the National Petroleum, Alcohol and Cement Authority (ANCAP) and two
        private concessionaires (GASEBA and CONECTA) strengthened the institutional and
        legal structure for regulation and competition; and
     In the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector, two small private operators and one new
        medium size concession in the Department of Maldonado had broken the monopoly of
        the National Water Supply and Sanitation Utility (OSE).

3.      Despite significant progress, additional work was necessary to consolidate the existing
reforms and transform other monopolized sectors, such as petroleum, telecommunications, postal
services and railways. Consequently, the Bank and GOU Office of Planning and Budget (OPP)
designed this Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) to support the 2000 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) on public reform focusing on government priority sectors where investment operations
were taking place. The main focus was to support the development and strengthening of
regulatory bodies and frameworks, the segregation of sector functions, the promotion of PSP to
enhance competition, and the improvement of corporate governance in state-owned utilities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4.      The objective of the Project was to increase the efficiency and sustainability of and the
access to public services in Uruguay by (i) developing sector policies, strengthening legal and
regulatory frameworks, and designing appropriate regulatory instruments; (ii) increasing
competition among service providers; (iii) expanding and deepening PSP in the provision of


                                                1

public services; (iv) promoting stronger commercial orientation of public utilities; and (v)
ensuring the efficient delivery of services to the poor.

5.       Key performance indicators presented in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) are the
following:
      Effective regulatory authorities,      independent of utilities and policy makers, and with
         managerial and financial autonomy, are fully operational;

      Increased participation       (share of the market and/or number) of qualified private
         operators;

      Better quality of services     as measured by a series of quality of services indicators;

      Greater efficiency      in the provision of services measured by a series of efficiency
         indicators in the various sectors; and

      Greater access      to public services measured by increased coverage for individuals,
         businesses and the poorest segments of the population, particularly in sanitation,
         electricity and telecommunications services.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.       The project underwent restructuring in May 2004 to include the financial sector within
the design and implementation of an integrated Bank management system for the National
Mortgage Bank of Uruguay (BHU). The loan agreement was amended to expand the PDO to (a)
increase the efficiency and sustainability of and access to public services by (i) developing sector
policies, strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks, and designing appropriate regulatory
instruments; (ii) increasing competition among service providers; (iii) expanding and deepening
PSP in the provision of public services; (iv) promoting stronger commercial orientation of public
utilities; and (v) ensuring the efficient delivery of services to the poor; and (b) increase the
efficiency and sustainability of the financial sector, especially of the public banks, by supporting
the modernization and performance of BHU.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

7.       As the consumers of public services, the Uruguayan population was expected to be the
main beneficiary of the reforms to reduce cost, improve service quality, and enhance international
competitiveness. While not explicitly mentioned in the PAD, the participating government
agencies were also expected to benefit from activities to strengthen their institutions and
corporate governance. These agencies include:

      Oficina de Planeamiento y Presupuesto (OPP) - Implementing Agency
      Unidad Reguladora de Servicios de Energía y Agua (URSEA)
      Unidad Reguladora de Servicios de Comunicaciones (URSEC)
      Ministerio de Vivienda, Ordenamiento Territorial y Medio Ambiente (MVOTMA)
             o Dirección Nacional de Agua y Saneamiento (DINASA)
      Ministerio de Industria, Energía y Minería
             o Dirección Nacional de Energía y Tecnología Nuclear (DNETN)
      Ministerio de Transporte y Obras Públicas (MTOP)

component was to support the internal reform of AFE, based on a business oriented approach and
the preparation of regulations for railways interconnection, access, service quality, price setting
and customer service.

13.     Component 6 - Project Management (US$1.26 million). The objective of this
component was to strengthen the operational capacity of the Project Management Unit (PMU) to
manage, coordinate, and audit the Project.

1.6 Revised Components

14.     The first amendment (2004) to the loan agreement included a financial sector component
to support the design and implementation of an integrated system for bank management,
strengthening of professional management and training of BHU personnel.

15.      The second amendment (2006) to the loan agreement included additional activities under
the financial sector to support the strengthening of BHU's financial position, development of
Uruguay's capital market, a review of bankruptcy law, protection of bank savings and assistance
to the Central Bank to design and implement a new bank resolution mechanism and study
alternative options for improving corporate governance.

1.7 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations)

16.     The project underwent restructuring, reprogrammed activities and extensions due to a
series of economic and political events indicated in paragraph 17. The Bank provided two
extensions: a two-year extension in 2005, when about 40 percent of the final loan amount had
been disbursed, and an additional year in 2007. The implementing agency was not able to
conclude all the programmed activities during the final year. The project had two cancellations
reducing the loan amount from US$6 million to US$4.4 million. There was an undisbursed
amount of approximately US$220,000 at closing, resulting in a final amount of US$4.2 million.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

17.     A series of changes beyond the project's control affected project implementation
resulting in delays and restructuring. These changes included the 2002-2003 economic crisis, the
unprecedented change in government in 2005, and the 2003 oil and 2004 water referenda, which
made the provision of these services the exclusive right of the state. In 2004, the project was
restructured to include activities under the financial sector. Table 1 provides a summary of the
key dates and events affecting this TAL operation.

18.     Despite these shortcomings, the project achieved its overall objective of contributing to
an increase in efficiency, coverage, and sustainability of public services in Uruguay. As a result,
this ICR rates the overall outcome as moderately satisfactory.                                   As noted by the 2008
Latinobarometro index of satisfaction, Uruguay's level of satisfaction with public services is


                                                               4

number one in the region, with 44 percent of the population indicating a high level of satisfaction
compared to a regional average of 22 percent.1


2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.       Soundness of background analysis. Background analysis during project preparation was
crucial in terms of scope, relevance, and quality for the appropriate design of the TAL. Initially
prepared as a technical assistance component of the OSE Modernization & Systems
Rehabilitation Project (OSE APL1), this operation was expanded to include other sectors and
separated as a standalone loan to OPP during APL1 negotiations at the request of GOU for Bank
support on broader policy reform in public services and infrastructure. Project preparation
benefited from WSS background analyses commissioned by OSE to support the preparation of
the APL1. In addition, studies from the Japanese Grant (TF02092) on WSS regulatory sector
reform, an OPP study on the efficiency of public service providers and Bank analysis on
operations in Uruguay provided additional background for project preparation.2 Lessons learned
from past Bank infrastructure projects in Uruguay and from regulation and PSP in Latin
American were also used during preparation. The lessons that contributed to the success of the
project included flexibility and diversification of the reform strategy, political commitment and
ownership, and the creation of a PMU.

20.       Assessment of project design. The original PDO to increase the efficiency, sustainability,
and coverage of public services reflected Uruguay's essential priorities for public sector reform as
identified by both the government and the CAS at the time. Also, the revised PDO reflected the
Government's main concern with increasing the efficiency and sustainability of the financial
sector, especially after the 2002-2003 economic crisis. The original PDO was clear and specific,
and, rather than focus on PSP as a single solution to all type of problems, it provided five
complementary means of achieving improvements in public service sectors: (i) public sector
reform; (ii) PSP; (iii) increased competition; (iv) strong commercial orientation; and (v) access
for the poor. Its flexible design brought together a wide-range of tools to support institutional
renewal. Moreover, it provided a logical cause and effect relationship based on Bank experience
at the time. Nevertheless, the PDO is ambitious when analyzing the vertical link between the
PDO and the various components and outputs. The project financed various activities, including
training programs, equipment, international and local consultants and studies, all mainly to
support the operation of regulatory agencies and the design and development of legal and
regulatory frameworks and tools. Therefore, it is difficult to directly link the outputs to the PDO.
To reflect a more direct and realistic relationship, it would have been more appropriate to include
an intermediate objective, such as assistance to develop and strengthen institutions and to
facilitate knowledge exchange. The positive flexibility feature could have remained in the project
design, embedded in the components, performance strategies or in the implementation strategy.
The second part of the revised PDO was clear and realistic in relation to the envisioned activities
as it focused on the implementation of an integrated system for bank management at the BHU,
which was directly linked to improving performance at this institution.

Transport Loan (4204-UY) and v) the 1996 and 1997 sector studies entitled "Reform Options for Uruguay's Water and Sanitation
Sector" and "Towards a New Role for the State in Uruguay's Utilities," respectively.



                                                                  5

21.     Breadth of component activities. The specific activities under each component were
found to be generally adequate in relation to the project outputs; however, given the scope of
project inputs and the relatively short duration of the project, it was unclear how the activities
would help identify and develop opportunities for private sector participation, for example.

22.     Technical capacity of implementing agency. The technical capacity of OPP for sector
reform was strong. OPP produced a project proposal with a comprehensive strategy for each
sector, allowing it to design a project that built on sector reform work already in progress. As a
ministerial rank agency reporting directly to the Office of the President, OPP was appropriately
prepared and positioned within GOU to lead public service reform as well as to ensure project
oversight and coordination with all ministries, agencies, and autonomous public entities based on
its experience in managing projects financed by multilateral banks.

23.     Government commitment to reform. The project had the backing of the newly-elected
Government during project preparation, but several stakeholder groups were not fully in
agreement, especially with the PSP agenda. OPP was deeply involved with project preparation. In
addition, GOU encouraged and supported the URAGUA concession in the Department of
Maldonado to provide WSS services and initiated a range of regulatory studies with financing
from a Japanese Grant. However, as the project moved into implementation, the risk that
government ownership of the sector reform agenda would weaken became a reality. The project
would have benefited from a comprehensive mitigation plan, including a more explicit
stakeholder and political analysis to develop clearer strategies to support institutional change
champions while at the same time engaging in constructive dialogue with those wary of reforms.

24.      Assessment of risks. The identified risks were relevant and their ratings appropriate;
however, the risk of an economic crisis was not included, and when it occurred it had a
substantial impact on project implementation. Although it would have been difficult to predict the
magnitude of the crisis, the country was already in a recession and Argentina's economy was in
crisis by the end of project preparation. In this context, a risk assessment and mitigation plan
would have been appropriate.

25.     Some of the mitigation efforts were not fully effective. For example, the risk that PSP
would fail to gain backing from politicians and the general public was correctly identified as
substantial during preparation. Although at the time Uruguay had two private WSS concessions,
PSP remained a politically sensitive issue that increased with the global anti-privatization
movement. Given the extent of the global paradigm shift, it is unlikely that any measures
implemented by the project could have prevented the backlash against PSP and the subsequent
2004 Constitutional amendment, making the provision of water the exclusive right of the state.
This is especially true in Uruguay, where public utilities enjoy extensive support based on a
satisfactory record of delivering services in terms of access and quality. The same applies to the
2003 petroleum referendum, which revoked the 2002 law ending ANCAP's monopoly over the
import, export and refining of crude oil as well as the export of petroleum derivatives. Project
design did not rely solely on high-risk PSP and included a range of alternative strategies to help
mitigate the impact of this backlash once it materialized. These alternative strategies, such as
sector unbundling and regulation, public accountability and benchmarking, together proved an
effective contingency plan after PSP laws were made unconstitutional for both the water and
petroleum sectors. However, the project could have benefited from a stronger mitigation plan,
including extensive and inclusive consultations with main stakeholders, focusing on opposition
groups, sector reform and the benefits of PSP.

2.2 Implementation

26.       Several external and internal factors affected the original implementation strategy over
the seven years of project execution. Nonetheless, timely interventions from the Bank team and
OPP, coupled with a flexible project design, contributed to a relatively successful implementation.

27.       Economic Crisis and Bank Response. Uruguay entered a deep financial crisis following
neighboring Argentina's default on its public debt and devaluation of its currency. A contagion
effect rippled throughout Uruguay's economy, causing GDP to fall eleven percent in 2002 alone
and unemployment to rise to almost 20 percent by the end of the year. The 2002 CAS Progress
Report determined that the previous lending scenario was no longer appropriate and concluded
that additional support was required to assist Uruguay through the ongoing crisis. Two Structural
Adjustment Loans (SAL) and two Special SALs totaling US$550 million were designed during
fiscal year 2003-2004.3 As a result, this project and a number of others in Uruguay were delayed
in order to confront the economic crisis. The coordinated effort by the international community
and the determined policy response of GOU helped Uruguay achieve a relatively favorable
recovery. By mid-2003, Uruguay was on track to fully recover its pre-crisis level of income, and
it re-embarked on the agenda of public services reform. Increased disbursement in 2003, more
than four times the amount of the previous year, highlighted GOU's commitment to the project.

28.        Change in Government. President Tabaré Vazquez from the Frente Amplio took office
in March 2005, ending 170 years of political dominance by the two traditional parties, Partido
Colorado and Partido Nacional. Project implementation and disbursements slowed that year as
the new government reassessed the situation and reset its priorities. The project regained
momentum in 2006 and obtained higher disbursement levels in 2006-2008 compared to 2001-
2005. The new administration placed renewed emphasis on the public sector as a leading force in
the development process and on improving the efficiency of state-owned public service providers.
The government maintained the possibility of PSP in the majority of sectors but followed a
cautious path after the referenda.

29.       Support for public private participation weakens in some strategic sectors. The two
constitutionally sanctioned referenda changed the policy framework, making the implementation
of PSP activities in the WSS and petroleum sectors unachievable. With PSP no longer a viable
strategy to pursue increased efficiency, sustainability and coverage of public services, the reforms
now focused more on institutional, policy, and regulatory reform within the public sector.

30.       Agencies support for the reform agenda weakens. A complex project such as this one
greatly depended on the commitment and capacity of regulatory institutions, ministries and
utilities responsible for public services. The above-mentioned external factors reduced agency
support for some activities, leading to their cancellation, which slowed down disbursements and
delayed project implementation.

31.       Government and Bank Response. The amendments to the loan agreement to strengthen
the financial sector proved to be a positive strategy to reenergize the project. This permitted a
new budgetary allocation which filled the void left by cancelled activities. In fact, by the end of



3The Bank's response was directed to introduce specific reforms ranging from fiscal measures to increase revenues and
curtail spending, to bank restructuring, promotion of efficiency and competition in infrastructure, maintaining
investment in human capital and strengthening measures to protect vulnerable groups.



                                                            7

the project, the financial sector spent 25 percent of the total project cost, the highest of any sector.
Moreover, the implementation of the BHU management program was viewed as one of the most
significant outcomes of the project.

32.     Considering the significant delays and the restructuring process, the project was extended
from December 31, 2005 to December 31, 2007. The extension enabled the project to
strategically capitalize on the renewed commitment to institutional reform favored by the new
administration. For example, during the preparation of the extension, GOU included activities to
support the operations and technical strengthening of DINASA, the management capacity and
operational capacity of ANP, as well as additional activities to strengthen the operations of
URSEA and URSEC. Implementation continued to strengthen over the final three years of the
project, when more than 60 percent of the funds were disbursed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

33.     M&E Design. The PAD included key performance indicators within the project design
framework and M&E implementation plan. The framework included 11 outcome indicators to
measure and monitor progress toward the PDO and 24 output indicators to measure component
objectives. Overall the indicators were specific in terms of quantity, quality and time, except in
the case of three PDO indicators that lacked target values. In addition, the selected outcome
indicators were appropriate to measure and define the PDO based on its five-legged strategy for
sector reform: regulations, efficiency, PSP, competition, and access. However, eleven outcome
indicators were too numerous at the PDO level, and at the output level, the indicators measured
the completion of studies or training but not the added value that these activities brought to the
project. The project would have benefited from output indicators measuring change resulting
from the completion of a group of activities. For example, rather than using "regulatory
accountability study completed" a more adequate indicator would have been a regulatory
accounting system designed, developed and operational".

34.     M&E Implementation. During the supervision missions, the M&E framework was
further strengthened to include baseline values, targets that were not specified during design and
an output indicator for the financial sector. The Bank and OPP, in close collaboration with the
participating agencies, collected baseline data and tracked indicator performance during the
implementation of the project. Although the detailed M&E framework and efforts to collect
information are impressive, a project with fewer indicators focusing on the outputs of a TAL
would have been more appropriate as too many indicators give the impression of an overly broad
project without a clearly-defined focus.

35.     M&E Utilization. M&E information was used to provide feedback to OPP and the
participating agencies on issues relating to project implementation and sector performance. The
Bank team also used the M&E information to report progress and support decision-making and
resource allocation. The involvement of participating agencies, in particular URSEA and URSEC,
contributed to strengthening their capacity of gathering and disseminating sector performance
information, as the M&E information included mainly industry-standard indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.      Financial management arrangements were satisfactory throughout the implementation of
the project. Audit and project progress reports were received by their due dates. Procurement



                                                  8

under the project was conducted by OPP and UNDP. Procurement was moderately satisfactory
due to procedural shortcomings and delays.

2.5 Environmental assessment: Environment Category: C (Not Required)

2.6 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.     Transition Arrangements. The means of sustaining reforms and institutional capacity are
closely tied to URSEA and URSEC's ability to continue operating as regulatory agencies. Both
agencies have adequate legal and regulatory frameworks, budget provisions and management
procedures, and appropriate staffing as a result of the competitive selection process funded by this
project.

38.     Performance indicators. URSEA and URSEC's core operations include monitoring and
evaluating public service performance through the application of industry indicators. OSE
benchmarking also includes sector performance indicators that allow URSEA and OSE to
measure efficiency and service coverage in WSS.

39.     Follow-up Operation. The ICR team recommends technical assistance for URSEA,
URSEC, DINASA, DNETN and other relevant agencies as a crucial component of public service
infrastructure loans in Uruguay as this will provide an excellent opportunity to reinforce the
reform process and increase coordination between agencies.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

40.     Importance of project objectives. The project objectives, design, and implementation
strategy continue to be relevant for national priorities and Bank assistance. GOU has maintained
an emphasis on increasing efficiency, coverage and sustainability of public infrastructure services,
as expressed in the government document entitled El Gobierno de Cambio ­ La Transición
Responsable and the 2005 GOU letter of understanding. Both call for state reforms, including
enhancing transparency and accountability in state functions, decentralizing management and
clarifying roles and responsibilities and eradicating all forms of clientelism. Public service
modernization is also fully consistent with the Bank's 2005-2010 CAS. Although the
Government has emphasized the central role of the state in defining a social agenda, it also
promotes investment through PSP under certain conditions and in specific sectors, namely ports,
railways and telecommunications.

41.     Relevance of PSP. Although the overall project objective remains fully consistent with
the Government's vision for the public services sector, the two constitutional referenda on the
water and petroleum sectors removed the option of expanding and deepening PSP in these sectors.
While this did not affect the relevance of the overall project objective, it did affect the results of
specific outputs and outcomes. The project focused on strengthening the policy making capacity
of ministries and the authority of regulators. Its flexible design coupled with the fast response of
the Bank team and OPP allowed the project to remain relevant and important in these two sectors.

42.     The amendments to modernize the financial sector are also highly relevant. The 2002-
2003 economic crises exposed the weakness of the financial system and made its reform more
significant. The sector continues to be relevant in the current government program and in the


                                                  9

latest CAS. Two development objectives mentioned in the CAS, which are in line with this
project, include (i) reducing financial sector vulnerability and improving the efficiency of
financial intermediation and (ii) developing capital markets and de-dollarizing the economy. The
decision by Bank staff and OPP to restructure the project during implementation is positive in
hindsight, as the modernization of the financial system continues to be relevant today in the
global financial crisis.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

(Brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)

43.      The project had two PDOs: (a) increase the efficiency and sustainability of and access to
public services and (b) increase the efficiency and sustainability of the financial sector by
supporting the modernization and performance of BHU. The objectives included specific
strategies to achieve them as well as key performance indicators to monitor and evaluate progress
and completion against targets. This section describes the extent to which the operation achieved
its objectives, using the PDO indicators and operational design features as a reference. It also
includes a brief discussion of causal linkages between PDO outcomes, outputs, and component
activities.

PDO (a) Increase the efficiency, sustainability, and coverage of public services

44.      In general, Uruguay has increased the efficiency, sustainability, and coverage of public
services and infrastructure during the life of the project. In contrast with the rest of the region,
Uruguay maintains high coverage rates for public services and infrastructure and high levels of
satisfaction with these services. In particular, the telecommunication sector experienced a
significant increase in internet users (115%), mobile teledensity (570%), and international voice
traffic (98%) compared to 2000 and 2001 values, mainly due to market liberalization.4 Sewerage
coverage increased moderately (34%), but not enough to achieve the project target value. Overall,
the perceived quality of public services and infrastructure in Uruguay remains high, except for the
railway sector, which continues to experience significant inefficiencies, as noted by the Global
Competitiveness Report 2008-2009.5 Regarding efficiency and sustainability, overall they have
been achieved as indicated by an increase in investments and operational and commercial
efficiency indicators. In ports, for example, container traffic has increased by 50 percent; labor
productivity in UTE and OSE has improved 12 percent and 24 percent respectively; the Digital
Opportunity Index (DOI) in telecommunication has increased by 44 percent; and the number of
deliveries per capita in the postal sector has improved by 26 percent. Annex 6 provides additional
information.

45.      The discussions below follows five specific strategies and outcomes under the PDO
related to the project intervention.

Developing sector policies, strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks, and designing
appropriate regulatory instruments

46.      The project was for the most part successful in developing sector policies and legal and
regulatory frameworks through numerous studies, training programs, and knowledge exchange
activities with international consultants. These activities supported the preparation of legal and
regulatory frameworks in the WSS, natural gas, petroleum and postal sectors, while strengthening
the existing frameworks in the electricity and telecommunication sectors. The project contributed
to the following achievements: (i) draft water law submitted to the Parliament for approval; (ii)
two new regulations issued by URSEA on liquefied petroleum gas; (iii) provisions in the 2005-
2009 budget law to regulate and define the postal service sector; and (iv) draft interconnection
regulation to accommodate services and network convergence in telecommunications. While the
regulatory framework for the petroleum sector was not completed, two studies, one on energy
consumption in the transport sector to support the national energy policy and another on import
parity pricing for petroleum products, were financed by this operation.

47.      In the case of railways and ports, the project did not contribute to developing a regulatory
framework, as originally planned due to lack of interest from MTOP in establishing an
independent regulatory body. Instead, the project supported the 2002 AFE reform and the ANP
human resources capacity development program.

48.      Regarding the outcome indicator requiring that "effective regulatory authorities,
independent of the utilities and policy makers, and with managerial and financial autonomy, are
fully operational", PDO achievement was satisfactory. The project provided much needed support
for the establishment and strengthening of URSEA and URSEC. URSEC was established at the
beginning of implementation and URSEA was established one year later. URSEA and URSEC
are independent executive units with financial and administrative autonomy, as their budget
comes from a regulation tax applied to service providers and decisions on expenditures are made
at their directive commission meetings. Although the Executive retains the power to determine
tariffs, URSEA and URSEC play an important regulatory role for consumer complaints, service
quality, anti-competitive behavior and development of technical tariffs. The success of
strengthening and consolidating URSEA and URSEC is demonstrated by the following results:

    a) Both agencies are now well established entities that have continuously improved their
         technical and managerial capacities;

    b) URSEA and URSEC's roles and responsibilities are now acknowledged and recognized,
         and their reputation with the companies they regulate and the public are sound;

    c) Both agencies regularly publish performance indicators, develop strategies to foster
         growth and competition, and focus public scrutiny on private and public utilities;

    d) Both agencies enjoy a high degree of autonomy as they have autonomous budgets and
         organizational structure and they have implemented ambitious training programs.

Opening sectors to expand and deepen private sector involvement in service delivery

49.      One of the objectives of the project was to expand and deepen PSP in the WSS, energy
and telecommunications sectors. Based on the outcomes indicated in Table 2, the PSP strategy
was only successful in the telecommunications sector, where the achieved values exceeded the
targets. The project fostered an environment for private investment by supporting regulations on

                                                  11

spectrum licensing and interconnection under the network convergence framework and regulatory
norms for digital signature transactions. The strengthening and consolidation of URSEC also
provided confidence for private investors.

                                 Table 2: Key Performance Indicators for PSP
Key Performance (Outcome)                             Baseline (2001)              Achieved Values at Completion

(1) Private sector water connections were from URAGUA, Aguas del Pinar and Aguas de la Costa concessions.
(2) The State Telecommunications Company (ANTEL) for ILD and ANCEL owned by ANTEL for cellular.


50.         In the WSS sector, following the national referendum, activities related to PSP were
cancelled and resources were allocated towards strengthening and consolidating the institutional
and technical capacity of DINASA, a new policy making institution under MVOTMA which is
responsible for national policies concerning the provision of WSS and water resources
management, and urban drainage.

51.         In the energy sector, the target value of 10 percent of electricity demand supplied by
private providers was not achieved. The public utility maintains control over the sector through
the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. Only 2 percent of the electricity
demand is provided by private operators, mostly from the Botnia Biomass Power Plant that
generates energy from its pulp mill production. GOU is currently taking measures to increase PSP
in renewable energy, and it recently granted contracts to private companies for the production of
60 MW of renewable energy by 2010.

52.         To increase competition in the electricity sector, the government created an Electricity
Wholesale Market (ADME) in 2002 with the mandate to administer and operate the service grid,
commercial power contracts and interconnections between Argentina and Brazil. However,
regional constraints to import electricity from Argentina and the lack of private investment in
electricity generation, made it impossible for ADME to be fully operational. GOU decided not to
transfer the operation to ADME and to continue the operation of the load dispatch center under
UTE. In 2008, UTE and ADME signed a contract agreement in which ADME, as the
administrator of the whole sale market, contracts UTE for the operation of the load dispatch
center under its supervision and auditing. This agreement allows ADME to partially meet its legal
obligations and provides some confidence to private companies. Nonetheless, this arrangement
does not fulfill what the legislation originally envisioned for a wholesale market.

 Increasing competition among service providers;

53.         Competition based on the number of service providers has improved in some sectors, but
continues to be low in others. Table 3 indicates the current levels of competition.




                                                           12

                             Table 3: Competition Levels in Project Sectors

       Sectors           Level                                             Comments

WSS                       PU         OSE

Petroleum                M/P         ANCAP monopoly on import, export and refining of crude oil and petroleum
                                     derivatives; partial competition in commercialization of petroleum products
                                     (ANCAP 58%, Petrobras 22% and ESSO 18%).

Natural Gas                C         Competition in natural gas and liquid propane gas (LPG)

Telecommunications       PU/C        ANTEL operates fixed-line; competition in ILD, mobile telephone and internet

Postal                   PU/C        ANC operates the Universal Postal Service; other services through private operators

Railways                   P         Railway Corporation of Uruguay (CFU), a public limited company, in combination
                                     with other private companies responsible for the rehabilitation and maintenance of
                                     railways.

Ports                      C         ANP owns the basic port infrastructure while private concessionaries build
                                     superstructure facilities and operate port facilities.
PU=public; M = monopoly, P = partial competition; C=competition


54.       The increased competition in the telecommunications sector is noteworthy given
ANTEL's past monopoly in providing fixed line, ILD and mobile services. Currently, eleven
private companies provide ILD services and three mobile companies compete with the national
public provider. Also important is the increased competition in the LPG market, which is partially
due to two URSEA regulations supported by the project. Although ANCAP has a monopoly on
crude oil and petroleum derivatives, there is competition through the monthly publication of the
import parity pricing for petroleum products produced by URSEA with the assistance of an
international consultant financed by the project. This has encouraged ANCAP to improve its
efficiency.

55.       To measure the increased competition among service providers, the project design
identified "better quality of services as measured by a series of indicators in the sectors (to be
defined by benchmarking studies)" as a key performance indicator. However, during project
implementation, tools and procedures implemented by regulatory agencies and service providers
to provide reasonable yardstick competition were used to measure progress toward the PDO.
Following the same logic, this ICR considers that the project made significant progress towards
enabling yardstick competition by developing regulatory accounting systems, benchmarking tools
and service quality regulations in the WSS, energy and communications sectors. Specific
achievements include: (i) regulatory accounting implemented in the WSS and electricity sectors
with both state-owned utilities following specified procedures; (ii) performance indicators for the
WSS, electricity, and telecommunications sectors disclosed and published periodically; and (iii)
service quality regulations for WSS, postal, and electricity distribution in place and operational.
The project encouraged coordination between URSEA and OSE on the benchmarking system that
OSE is implementing under the OSE Modernization & Systems Rehabilitation project financed
by the Bank.

Promoting, through appropriate economic incentives, a stronger commercial orientation of state
owned utilities in the delivery of public services.

56.       Improved efficiency in the provision of services in the WSS, telecommunications, and
electricity sectors was used to measure this aspect of the PDO. While the percentage of power



                                                             13

losses in the distribution system remained constant, all of the other achieved values went beyond
the targets. Table 4 presents the results of the selected performance indicators.

             Table 4: Key Performance Indicators to measure increased efficiency

  Key Performance (Outcome)                             Baseline (2001)   Values Achieved at Completion

  percent
  Decrease the total number of blackouts/clients/yr             18.5                    5.0


57.      Additional project contributions to the ones already mentioned include the development
of a telephone numbering management system to increase URSEC's efficiency in granting
licenses and assigning numbers. This was approved in 2004 and its implementation is expected in
2010. Furthermore, a value added study (VADE) on electricity distribution promoting cost
transparency was completed and provided an incentive for UTE to increase its efficiency.
URSEA submitted the results and recommendations of this study to the Executive to help
improve tariff targeting. To improve efficiency in the WSS sector, OSE is taking steps to reduce
unaccounted for water and enhance institutional renewal and corporate governance under the
Bank-financed OSE APL-2.

58.      Other achievements not reflected in the efficiency indicators but representing significant
project contributions include: (i) assistance to AFE in its institutional reform, which resulted in
lower operating subsidies and higher labor productivity. Nonetheless, AFE's labor and
operational productivity as well as infrastructure quality continue to be lower than those in
comparable countries; and (ii) development and strengthening of ANP's human resources
division, which trained approximately thirty-five professionals from different government
agencies, including OSE and the postal services, and laid the foundation for a training center for
public servants on project management, information technology, quality assurance and logistics.

Ensuring access for the poor

59.      Uruguay has Latin America's highest public service and infrastructure coverage levels.
Therefore, M&E indicators focused on sectors where coverage is weak.

                                   Table 5: Ensuring access for the poor
  Key Performance (Outcome)                             Baseline (2001)  Values Achieved at Completion

  Increase access to the INTERNET in public schools.            0                     1,000


60.      Project activities were not directly tied to the achievement of these indicators, but
indirectly they may have contributed to these results. Sewerage coverage did not reach target
values, but OSE continues to work on the expansion of the network through the OSE APL-2. The
increased internet access in public schools resulted from the GOU one-laptop-per-child project
and ANTEL educational connectivity program.

61.      The project planned three studies related to ensuring universal access to
telecommunications, postal and electricity sectors. However, only the postal study was conducted
and universal access provisions are now in place. The telecommunications study was not
conducted as 100 percent of the population in Uruguay has access to fixed telephone, cellular

                                                       14

mobile footprint and internet.6 In addition, ANTEL has a universal access initiative through
public telephone and community services. Dialogue with UTE to create an energy basket
benefitting the poor began but a study was not produced.

PDO (b) Increase the efficiency and sustainability of the Borrower's financial sector,
especially of the public banks, by supporting the modernization and performance of the BHU
and other activities aimed at strengthening the Borrower's financial system

62.      The design and implementation of an integrated system for bank management supported
the modernization and improved performance of the BHU. The integrated bank system was a
critical instrument in the implementation of the bank restructuring processes and it solved
numerous problems caused by the information technology disadvantage. Given these improved
efficiency steps, BHU was able to transfer toxic loans and reassign employees to the National
Housing Agency, quantify managing assets, and recapitalize to make the bank solvent again. In
December 2008, the Central Bank of Uruguay authorized BHU to resume mortgage lending after
6 years without lending activity. BHU expects to grant 3,000 loans in 2009, ranging from
US$8,000 to US$80,000 with favorable interest rates and maturities.7

63.      The project strengthened the Superintendency for the Protection of Bank Savings (SPBS)
by designing a methodology to calculate the contribution of financial intermediation institutions
to the deposit insurance program. Furthermore, assistance to the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) and the Central Bank of Uruguay was provided on a new regulatory and
institutional framework for the development of capital markets. Some activities envisioned in the
second amendment were not conducted: (i) review of the bankruptcy law; (ii) institutional and
organizational design for the SPBS; and (iii) assistance to the Central Bank on a new bank
resolution mechanism and a study on corporate governance.

3.3 Efficiency

64.      The PAD did not contain a formal economic analysis as it is not required for a TA loan.
However, it provided a narrative explanation of the economic benefits the project could deliver
based on extensive international experience. Project benefits included the reduced cost of
services, improved service quality, and economic stability for the entire population. The ICR
considers that the project was satisfactory in terms of efficiency considering the PDO
achievements discussed in Section 3.2 and the low project cost per person ($1.30 per person
based on the total loan amount).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

65.      Since the original PDO was formally revised, project outcome was assessed against both
the original and revised project objectives following the 2006 ICR guidelines under which
separate outcome ratings (against original and revised project objectives) are weighted in
proportion to the share of actual loan/credit disbursements made in the periods before and after
approval of the revision. Table 6 summarizes this exercise resulting in an overall outcome rating
of moderately satisfactory.

Highly Satisfactory=6, Satisfactory=5, Moderately Satisfactory=4, Moderately Unsatisfactory=3, Unsatisfactory=2, and Highly
Unsatisfactory = 1

66.        In general, the ICR rating of moderately satisfactory seems appropriate considering the
achievements presented in Section 3.2 and the shortcomings resulting from external and internal
factors.     In addition, the project continues to be highly relevant with regard to improving
sustainability, efficiency and access to public services through corporate governance of state-
owned utilities, yard stick competition, effective regulatory agencies and unbundling of functions,
as well as PSP in telecommunication, railways, ports and, to a minor extent, electricity.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

67.        The project indirectly contributed to poverty alleviation through improved services and
streamlined government spending directed away from inefficient public utilities and towards
targeting support for services to the poor. For example, a regulatory framework for universal
postal services is a successful outcome benefiting people in remote and rural areas of the country.
Adequate implementation of sector reforms, regulatory tools and economic incentives, all
achievements of this project, are expected to increase Uruguay's competitiveness in the
international market and its overall economic growth.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

68.        The project had a major impact on the institutional strengthening of public services.
Substantial progress was made in consolidating URSEA and URSEC as effective regulatory
bodies operating independently, transparently and with the necessary technical and institutional
tools to fulfill their mandates. In addition, particular efforts were made in the WSS and electricity
sectors to strengthen the technical and operational capacities of DINASA and DNETN. DINASA
received support from international consultants to develop an integrated urban water management
approach which was later incorporated into the draft water law. DNETN received assistance on
guidelines for a national energy policy and a study to update the energy matrix calculation.
Institutional strengthening was cross linked with all project activities. The project also supported
AFE reform, ANP human resources capacity on labor competence, BHU institutional and system
operation changes, and OPP operational capacity to manage projects funded by multi-laterals.




                                                                16

(c ) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

69.       The knowledge of Uruguay's public services gained during the preparation of this project
coupled with the excellent working relationship with GOU was particularly important during the
preparation of the Public Services SAL. The Bank was able to prepare and implement this
operation in less than four months, thus providing much needed assistance to Uruguay during the
2002-2003 economic crises. The project played a critical role in consolidating the public sector
reforms introduced by the SAL.

70.       The project has also been particularly useful in ensuring an adequate level of dialogue
with two successive administrations on some complex policy issues within public sector reform.
The Bank was able to adjust project content to respond to the needs of the current Government
and it ensured that the project continued to be an effective instrument for policy dialogues.

4.        Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (Sustainability
Rating)
Rating: Moderate

71.       Reduced Institutional Support. The regulatory bodies and other sector agencies that
participated in this project have sound legislative frameworks and budgetary provisions and their
functions and responsibilities are valuable to the population.8 Although government support could
waver with a new administration, public reforms in Uruguay have traditionally followed a
political and social consensus approach, ensuring sustainability once implemented.

72.       Regional shocks. Uruguay is vulnerable to economic shocks emanating from neighboring
Brazil and Argentina. Uruguay has attempted to diversify its export markets to reduce its
vulnerability to neighboring countries, and it has also made important reforms to address
weaknesses in the financial sector.

73.       Energy security. Energy dependency is a potential source of risk which could threaten
economic recovery if supplies were to be interrupted. GOU has been working towards securing
its energy supply through, inter alia, increases in generation capacity and electricity
interconnection with Brazil.

5.        Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.       Project preparation was supported by analytical work and lessons learned from Bank
operations in Uruguay and public sector reform in Latin America. It was consistent with the
government's development priorities and the CAS. The main strength of project design and

responsibilities.



                                                        17

preparation was the ability to accurately identify the key sector issues, the close collaboration
with OPP during preparation, and the flexibility of bringing together a wide-range of tools to
support institutional renewal.

75.      Shortcomings included the ambitious PDO in the context of a technical assistance project,
an extensive number of indicators and, in some cases, vague linkages among them, and limited
explanation of the mitigation efforts for the risks analyzed during project preparation. The project
could have benefited from more inclusive and extensive consultations with main stakeholders,
including water trade unions and other PSP opponents, on the reform process and in particular the
role of PSP.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

76.      The Bank team played an active and effective role in the supervision of this project
during the course of implementation, and proactively provided support to address implementation
problems, including disbursement concerns, technical guidance and policy dialogues, which
helped strengthen the operation and build confidence on public sector reform. The Bank team
conducted five supervision missions and prepared fifteen PSRs. Additional supervision missions
were jointly conducted with SAL and APL-1 OSE supervision missions. Corrective actions were
taken when needed to ensure the achievement of the PDOs, including restructuring to include the
financial sector, realigning activities and budget allocations within the project scope and partial
cancellation of the loan to meet changing needs and achieve project objectives and outputs. The
Bank team relied on the M&E framework as a tool for project supervision and worked in
collaboration with technical agencies to collect baseline data and to assure quality values.

77.      One shortcoming was not to modify the PDO outcomes and project outputs after the
setbacks in the WSS and petroleum sectors during the first restructuring as it was clear that they
would be impossible to achieve following the constitutional referenda.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

78.      For the above cited reasons, the overall rating of Bank performance is rated Satisfactory.
Despite the shortcomings, the basic project design proved relatively robust given that it survived
a severe economic crisis, political leadership changes and the global PSP backlash, and it
achieved most of its outcomes and outputs. In addition, the team demonstrated pragmatism,
flexibility, and adaptability to the changing environment, confirming its longstanding
involvement and commitment to Uruguay's growth.

Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.      During loan preparation, GOU demonstrated strong commitment and ownership by
actively participating in the design of the project, including technical background information and
discussion on project formulation. Nevertheless, the project had a slow start, mainly due the
GOU's inability to advance key reforms given reduced interest from technical agencies.
Emergency priorities raised by the economic crisis also delayed project implementation, but to a
certain extent a weak consultation process with reform opponents also resulted in a lack of

                                                 18

ownership from some agencies. Noteworthy was the GOU's proposal to include the financial
sector under the modernization of public sectors, as this change reenergized the project and
resulted in an important achievement for the BHU.

80.       Borrower commitment and ownership varied over the course of implementation,
reflecting the 2002-2003 economic crisis and changes in administration. The project slowed
during the period of political transition. After considering the project's relevance, the new
administration showed commitment to the project's PDO and it became more supportive. The
new administration proved to be an advocate for improved corporate governance of state-owned
utilities and for increased sector efficiency.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.       OPP demonstrated commitment to fulfilling the PDOs and provided adequate internal
staff and resources to ensure implementation success despite the difficult enabling environment
and changes outside of its direct control. It complied with all Bank loan covenants, produced
regular progress reports and discharged its fiduciary duties in a satisfactory manner. OPP played
an important interagency coordination and project management role. Its efforts to strengthen the
operation with new activities through dialogue with technical agencies and a call for proposals
contributed to reenergizing the project. However, some technical agencies believed that the
interagency coordination could have been better at explaining the project, procedures, and
objectives at the technical and management level.

82.       The major shortcoming of OPP during project implementation was the slow pace of
procurement processing which in part was due to external factors but also to a lack of urgency
from OPP and technical agencies. In the last two years, the decision from MEF to reduce the
2008 budgetary allocation to some beneficiaries of the loan and poor performance by UNDP in
processing procurement matters also contributed to slow disbursements and loan cancellations.
Despite these shortcomings, during the last two years, OPP was able to disburse 42 percent of the
total loan.

83.       UNDP experienced internal processing problems. UNDP was only responsible for
preparing contracts under this project, but in 2007 its function expanded to include overall
procurement procedures. As a result, procurement documents and procedures had to be modified
to adjust to this change. Significant delays were reported by OPP and technical agencies with the
new structure when purchasing equipment and contracting companies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.       Despite its numerous challenges and shortcoming and the variability of its performance
throughout the life of the project, the Borrower managed to conclude the project in a moderately
satisfactory manner and achieve the targeted values for most of its outcome and output indicators.
Therefore, the overall Borrower performance rating is deemed moderately satisfactory.

6.        Lessons Learned

85.       PDO Design. Considering the nature of technical assistance operations, PDOs should be
designed as intermediate objectives (e.g. to assist in a country's policy/program implementation,


                                                19

develop/ strengthen institutions and/or to facilitate knowledge exchange) rather than higher level
objectives (e.g. increased efficiency and coverage of public services). Intermediate objectives will
provide a more direct and realistic vertical logic among component activities, outputs and
outcomes facilitating an objective basis for assessing and monitoring projects.

86.       M&E Framework. The Bank in collaboration with the Borrower should design a
framework with adequate indicators and targets that best represent the project's outcomes and
outputs, while also acknowledging that this is a dynamic task requiring fine-tuning and on-going
support. It should be clear and relatively simple to implement with only the minimum number of
indicators required to determine what must be achieved to meet the objectives. Too many
indicators cause unnecessary complexity that can weaken project design. Furthermore, the M&E
framework should support effective monitoring of results by properly designing protocols to
avoid variations in data measurements and interpretations that differ from what the project
originally intended.

87.       Critical Risks/Mitigation. The Bank should be mindful that reforms may be affected by
changes with consequences beyond national frontiers. When a project is vulnerable to serious
economic and political risks, it should include contingency plans that could be mobilized if these
risks materialize. Project design adequately identified risks that materialized during
implementation, but planned mitigation measures were weak. The project would have benefited
from a contingency plan focusing on mitigation measures with adequate arrangements and Bank
supervision procedures.

88.       Stakeholder consultations. Projects involving broad based public reform should include
inclusive and extensive consultations with stakeholders in the reform process to better explain
objectives, design, approach and benefits. A stakeholder and political analysis during project
preparation should help to identify institutional change champions and those opposed to reform,
therefore, assisting in the consultation strategies.

89.       Supervision. Close and careful supervision can secure the sustainability of programs even
in a time of crisis or change in government. Despite the difficult economic circumstances and
changing political environment, proactive supervision and a sustained dialogue with OPP and
sector authorities engendered support from all counterparts and ensured implementation.

90.       Sector Reform. Sector reform requires flexibility and the ability to not prematurely close
any door. The project strategies for sector reform, namely regulatory frameworks and institutions,
PSP, yardstick competition, unbundling of sectors and corporate governance of state owned
utilities, reinforced each other and contributed to the transformation of public services. This
allowed the Bank to continue to push for sector reform once PSP became off limits for some
sectors. Given the likelihood of a shift in the political context during long-term reform projects, it
is essential that the strategy to achieve a given objective remain flexible to ensure the project is
relevant and palatable to successive administrations and for popular support.

91.       Knowledge base. The Bank and GOU gained valuable experience with sector reform. It is
essential that projects of this nature include an important knowledge base component, including
dissemination of publications and tools to a wider public. The wide dissemination of the project
and the creation of a specific knowledge base could have an impact in increasing local ownership
and acknowledgement of reform at all levels.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

This loan was negotiated and approved to support the Government of Uruguay (GOU) in its on-
going program to modernize public services by developing and strengthening regulations,
corporate governance, private sector participation (PSP), and separation of roles in four main
sectors: water supply and sanitation (WSS), energy, telecommunications, and transportation.

Despite the passing of time and changes in government, the project development objective of
increasing efficiency, sustainability, and coverage of public services through effective regulatory
agencies, PSP, yard stick competition, strong commercial orientation, and improving access to the
poor, continues to be relevant and valuable in Uruguay today. This objective is aligned with the
current government program as indicated in the ICR.

We feel that this operation achieved most of its original outcomes, as it contributed significantly
to the establishment and consolidation of URSEA and URSEC as regulatory agencies, the
development and implementation of regulations, the modernization of the financial sector, and the
increased competition in the telecommunication sector, among others discussed in the ICR. On
the other hand, we recognize that the outcomes for PSP in the WSS and petroleum sectors were
not achieved as originally envisioned due to the 2003 and 2004 referenda. In addition, other
outputs were partially achieved or not met due to changes in priorities in some technical agencies
and slow procurement procedures toward the end of the project. The refocusing of the operation
to support BHU internal reform, ANP human resources competitive program, and policy capacity
building on DINASA and DNETN is particularly noteworthy as it contributed to the overall
outcome of the project. Consequently, and despite the significant achievements of the project, we
agree with the overall outcome rating of moderately satisfactory.

We would also like to share the following specific comments:

 From the beginning of project implementation to the end of 2006, UNDP only executed
    individual and firm contracts without intervening in the selection process. Starting in 2007,
    UNDP began conducting all aspects of procurement procedures, thus causing a project
    slowdown, especially regarding the notification of bidding opportunities for the contracting
    of consulting firms and the purchasing of goods. In addition, the UNDP service charge
    increased with its new responsibilities.

 Although OPP requested a project extension in August 2007, it was not approved by the Bank
    until mid-December, thus causing delays with the implementation of new activities and
    contracting initiatives. The project was practically on hold from August to December 2007.

 Despite the above shortcomings and the ones mentioned in the ICR, the operation was able to
    disburse 49 percent of the total financed amount during the last two years. The figure below
    shows the project disbursement per year.




                                                31

 We feel that OPP worked well as the implementing agency and coordinator of multiple
 technical agencies given its oversight responsibilities in budgeting and performance
 evaluation under the Executive Government. OPP provided support to technical agencies
 in the coordination and preparation of proposals and project implementation.

 We would like to underscore the project's contributions towards setting the foundations
 for URSEA and URSEC regulatory functions with technical and operational assistance,
 which was fundamental for their strengthening and consolidation as regulatory agencies.

 When evaluating the project, the Bank should consider the various external complications
 that the country experienced during the operation. The project was conceived in a period
 in which Uruguay was experiencing significant economic growth; however, this changed
 in 2002 with the Argentina and Brazilian economic crisis and it became worse when it hit
 Uruguay in 2002-2003.      As a result, the government responded to the emergency
 situation and had to postpone some activities under this operation.

Annex 6. Additional Performance Indicators

Additional performance indicators are documented in this annex to support Uruguay's progress
on achieving the PDO of increase the efficiency and sustainability of and the access to public
services in Uruguay by (i) developing sector policies, strengthening legal and regulatory
frameworks, and designing appropriate regulatory instruments; (ii) increasing competition among
service providers; (iii) expanding and deepening PSP in the provision of public services; (iv)
promoting stronger commercial orientation of public utilities; and (v) ensuring the efficient
delivery of services to the poor.

Index of Satisfaction with Basic Services
According to the Latinobarometro survey, Uruguay's level of satisfaction with public services is
number one in the region, with 44 percent of the population indicating a high level of satisfaction
compared to a region average of 22 percent.       In addition, as indicated below, Uruguay has the
lowest low satisfaction values in the region reported in 2006-2008.

           Table 7: Index of satisfaction with basic services; by country, 2006-2008




Perception of Level of Infrastructure Development

Uruguayans are understandably satisfied with the development of their infrastructure services. A
2003 poll finds Uruguayans to be second only to Chile among selected Latin American countries
in their perception of the overall quality of their infrastructure development.    However, in the
case of railroads the quality is considered to be underdeveloped and inefficient.

WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR

OSE made some steady efficiency gains since 2002. Key commercial and operational efficiency
indicators have improved.       Between 2002 and 2006, OSE successfully increased labor
productivity from 5.4 employees/1000 connections to 4.2, decreased operating costs from US$
0.98/m3 to US$ 0.81/m3; and increased operating margins from 37 percent to 43 percent.
Collection rates also recovered rapidly, from a low of 87 percent in 2003 to 93 percent in 2006.

ENERGY

Before 2002, UTE had been gradually and consistently reducing its energy losses (both technical
and commercial) through improved commercial management and a comprehensive network
renovation and expansion plan. In 2000 total losses were as low as 13.5 percent. However, the
2002-2003 economic crises caused this figure to rise, reaching 19.5 percent in 2004. Starting in
July 2004, UTE launched a campaign to identify cases of fraud and raise consumer awareness,
leading to a reduction in total losses from 19.5 percent in 2004 to 17.1 percent in 2006.

UTE's labor productivity continued to improve in 2002-2006 as a result of a gradual reduction
and a better use of its labor force. Total staffing has been reduced from 6,760 in 2002 to 6,265 in
2006, while the customers per employee ratio has improved from 176 to 197 in during the same 4
years (see figure below).

TELECOMMUNICATIONS


Improvement in the overall performance of the sector can be measured by the evolution of the
Digital Opportunity Index (DOI), which is based upon different groups of indicators and
categories of targets/objectives. It is built upon three categories: Opportunity (coverage and
tariffs), Infrastructure, and Utilization. Uruguay's DOI for 2007 was 0.59, one of the highest in
the region. The index has positively evolved in the period 2003-2007, mainly due to increases in
the categories of Infrastructure and Utilization. The first is driven by the increase in the volume of
services of mobile telephony whilst the growth of internet access would account for the rise in the
Utilization category, both correlated to increased competition.

deliveries per capita. This figure has positively evolved in the period 2001-2008 as depicted in the

RAILWAYS

AFE operating subsidies have significantly decreased. As shown in the figure below, operating
subsidies to AFE (and DNV) decreased by 66 percent from US$19.6 million in 2000 to US$6.6
million in 2005. During the same period, the labor productivity increased due to a voluntary
retirement scheme and the transfer of AFE employees to MTOP, amid the separation of railway
management from operation. On the other hand, service quality has not improved in this sector.
While the rail network is extensive, only few lines are in operation, derailings are frequent, and
cargo traffic density and train velocities are low compared to standard levels.

PORTS

Ports operations in Montevideo are competitive and have grown considerably since the 2002
reform. In 2005, the port of Montevideo handled 454,531 TEU (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit), --
a 51 percent increase from 2001 figures. The reform resulted in intra-port competition, a decline
in port tariffs, and significant new investments from the private sector. The average cost of
container transfer in Montevideo is substantially lower than non-concessioned ports in Peru,
Ecuador, and Central America. The port of Montevideo is fairly competitive relative to other
privately operated ports in Latin America.
