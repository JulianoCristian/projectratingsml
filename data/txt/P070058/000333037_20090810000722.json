moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            projects involving broad based public reform should include\n            inclusive and extensive consultations with stakeholders in\n            the reform process to better explain objectives, design,\n            approach, and benefits. A stakeholder and political analysis\n            during project preparation should help to identify\n            institutional change champions and those opposed to reform,\n            therefore, assisting in the consultation strategies. Sector\n            reform requires flexibility and the ability to not\n            prematurely close any door. The project strategies for\n            sector reform, namely regulatory frameworks and\n            institutions, Private Sector Participation (PSP), yardstick\n            competition, unbundling of sectors, and corporate governance\n            of state owned utilities, reinforced each other and\n            contributed to the transformation of public services. This\n            allowed the Bank to continue to push for sector reform once\n            PSP became off limits for some sectors. Given the likelihood\n            of a shift in the political context during long-term reform\n            projects, it is essential that the strategy to achieve a\n            given objective remain flexible to ensure the project is\n            relevant and palatable to successive administrations and for\n            popular support. The Bank and Government of Uruguay (GoU)\n            gained valuable experience with sector reform. It is\n            essential that projects of this nature include an important\n            knowledge base component, including dissemination of\n            publications and tools to a wider public. The wide\n            dissemination of the project and the creation of a specific\n            knowledge base could have an impact in increasing local\n            ownership and acknowledgement of reform at all levels."}, "docdt": "2009-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
