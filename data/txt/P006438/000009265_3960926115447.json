An\n            additional objective is to support the Ministry of Health\n            (MOH) activities to reduce the occurrence of AIDS cases. To\n            that end, the project includes five components. These\n            involve a) prevention and control of disease transmission;\n            b) community mobilization; c) operational research; and d)\n            institutional development. Lastly, the project entails e)\n            aids control, including a mass media campaign on AIDS\n            prevention, testing of blood supply and donors and health\n            staff training. Approximately 30 million at risk people\n            (small farmers, poor peasants and urban families in the ten\n            states of the Northeast) will benefit from the project."}, "docdt": "1988-01-19T00:00:00Z"}
