KHARTOUM - PORT SUDAN ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 2070-SU)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Note (PCN) for the Khartoum - Port Sudan Road
Rehabilitation Project for which Credit 2070-SU in the amount of SDR 65.7 million
(US$82.2 million equivalent) was approved on December 5, 1989, and made effective on
September 20, 1990.
As with other projects in Sudan, disbursements under the Credit were suspended
on September 13, 1993, following the Government failure to meet its debt service
obligation to IDA, and the country was placed in non-accrual status. On April 8, 1994,
the Credit was closed and the undisbursed balance in the amount of SDR 31.45 million
was canceled.
The PCN was prepared by Mr. S.L. Kathuria, Highway Engineer Consultant, Task
Manager, AF2EI, as desk review on the basis of the materials in the project files, and
reviewed by Mr. Stephen Weissman, Chief, AF2EI, and Mr. Surendra Agarwal, Project
Adviser, AF2DR.
No comments were received on the PCN from the co-financiers (KfW and the
Kingdom of Norway).

KHARTOUM - PORT SUDAN ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 2070-SU)
INTRODUCTION
1.    The Khartoum - Port Sudan Road, a principal transport link and economic life of
the country, extends from Khartoum to Port Sudan on the Red Sea via Wad Medani,
Gedaref, Kassala and Haiya; 1,182 km long it represents 50% of Sudan's paved road
network. Consistent with the Bank's strategy to support essential infrastructure needed to
facilitate the expansion of exports and economic development in Sudan, the project
provided for reconstruction/ strengthening of major sections of the road that were in need
of urgent repair. Built in sections, the road was in part 17 years old. Due to heavy
overloading of trucks, especially during the 1985 drought relief transport operations,
certain segments, notably between Gedaref and Kassala and between Haiya and Suakin
(Map IBRD 21991R), were showing severe base failure and were approaching the stage
where full reconstruction would be the only solution. The rehabilitation needs of the
failed or failing se^tions of the road increased after the August 1988 floods because the
flood waters hastened the deterioration of certain additional sections of the road. The
rehabilitation/reconstruction of the road was so urgent that the project was initially called
Highway Emergency Project; however, the term "emergency" was later dropped since the
project did not fall under the definition of an "emergency operation". The detailed
engineering and bidding documents for the road were prepared by consultants financed
from a Norwegian Grant administered by IDA. The project was appraised in June - July
1988.
2.    The project underwent several changes after negotiations in December 1988:
(i) KfW agreed to co-finance the project and to contribute DM 30 million (US$16.1
million equivalen'). under a joint financing agreement, toward rehabilitation of the road;
(ii) payme:4t of a cost overrun (US$15.6 million) on the Jebel Aulia - Ed Dueim Road
construction component of the Second Highways Project was added to the project; and
(iii) ODA which had originally intended to cofinance certain institutional development
measures decided to withdraw from the project, in line with its revised country strategy.
These changes led to two "renegotiations", April 1989 in London and September 1989 in
Addis Ababa. The project was approved by the Board on December 5, 1989.



3.    The Credit became effective on September 20, 1990, some 5 months behind
schedule. The Credit effectiveness was delayed because of the delay in the finalization of
the financing agreement between KfW and Government. The Finance and Project
Agreement between KfW and Government was signed on August 18, 1990. According to
the disbursement arrangements agreed between KfW and IDA, German funds were to be
utilized to finance 35.3% of the foreign exchange component of the advance payment and
100% of subsequent interim payments (foreign exchange component) of the road
rehabilitation contract until DM 30 million were consumed.
Project Objectives
4.    The project objectives were: (i) to arrest deterioration of the Gedaref - Port Sudan
section of the Khartoum - Port Sudan Road by reconstructing or strengthening sections in
need of urgent repair, thus protecting capital investment in Sudan's main transport
corridor and preventing transport costs and delivery times from increasing; (ii) to plan
and implement an effective Axle Load Control System to prevent or reduce the abuse of
the road once the same had been rehabilitated; (iii) to institute a Pavement Management
System so that Roads and Bridges Public Corporation (RBPC) could better assess and
plan its future road maintenance and reconstruction needs in a timely fashion; and (iv) to
continue supporting RBPC's institutional development with technical assistance and
training.
5.    The project objectives were realistic and important for the sector and in line with
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. Avoiding the complete break-up of major
sections of the Khartoum - Port Sudan road and averting the need for much greater
investments in the future were critical to the Sudanese economy. Implementing an Axle
Load Control System was essential to prevent premature deterioration of the road and
instituting a Pavement Management System to better assess and plan future road
maintenance and reconstruction needs.
Project Description
6.    The project consisted of: (i) reconstruction of 70 km and overlaying of about 500
km of deteriorating sections of the Khartoum - Port Sudan Road between Gedaref and
Port Sudan, repairs to one hundred or so bridges, and related construction supervision;
(ii) funding of a cost overrun on the Jebel Aulia - Ed Dueim Road construction
component of the Second Highways Project; (iii) implementation of an Axle Load
Control System, including provision of technical assistance and training, rescue vehicles
and data processing equipment, and construction and equipping of permanent and mobile
weighbridges; (iv) implementation of a Pavement Management System (PMS) including
provision of technical assistance and training; and (v) institutional support for RBPC,
agency responsible for project implementation.

Project Costs and Financing
7.    The total project costs, net of taxes and duties, were estimated at US$114.4
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$98.3 million (86 percent). IDA's
contribution was to be US$82.2 million, KfW's DM 30 million (US$16.1 million
equivalent) and Government was to finance local costs of the project, estimated at
US$16.1 million equivalent. Following Board presentation, the PMS forming part of the
project was agreed to be financed through a Norwegian Grant in an amount of NOK 6
million; an Agreement between the Kingdom of Norway and the Association was signed
on December 14, 1990, and a Development Grant Agreement between the Republic of the
Sudan and the Association, as Administrator on behalf of the Kingdom of Norway, was
signed on April 16, 1991.
Project Implementation
8.    RBPC awarded, with the Association's approval, a contract (a combination of 2
contracts) for the rehabilitation of Khartoum - Port Sudan Road to the lowest evaluated
bidder; a contract between Government and the contractor was signed on February 20,
1991, some 1O months after the public bid opening. The delay in signing the contract
was caused due to: (i) the delay in finalization of the financing agreement between KfW
and Government (Para. 3); and (ii) the long time spent in contract negotiations between
Government and the contractor. The order to commence works was given on July 10,
1991, with contract completion by February 9, 1994, about 18 months behind the
Appraisal estimates.
9.    Actual construction works on the road started on October 10, 1991, after a 3-
month mobilization period. The works progressed well and generally stayed ahead of
schedule. RBPC issued several variation orders for the work, including pothole patching
and overlaying of certain new sections, aggregating 194 km, between Haiya and Kassala
which were not included in the original road rehabilitation program. The road in these
new sections was at the time of preparation in 1988-89, considered to be in reasonably
good condition, and was scheduled only for resealing with the help of road maintenance
units.
10.   Following increase in the scope of the work as a result of the said variation orders,
the contract compli ion date was extended by 11 1/2 months to January 24, 1995; the
contract price increased from US$63 million equivalent to US$75.4 million equivalent.
Based on the January 1994 Bank supervision mission's findings -- this was the last
supervision mission fielded by IDA --, some 90 percent of the original contract work had
been completed and taking into account the Variation Orders, about 75 percent had been
completed. No information is available on the latest progress of the works, or current
costs of the project.
11.   Due to the non-payment by Government of contractor's invoices, following the
suspension of disbursements by IDA, the contractor after giving 30 days notice, on March



- 4-
1, 1994, to RBPC of its intention to terminate its employment under the contract,
suspended all operations at the end of March 1994, and subsequently, on January 19,
1995, notified its intention to lodge a formal request for arbitration to the International
Chamber of Commerce.
12.   The cost overrun on the Jebel Aulia - Dueim Road construction component of the
Second Highway Project was covered by way of payment to the contractor of the
arbitration award resulting from a dispute with the Government.
13.   Two permanent weighbridges and three mobile weighbridge sites were
constructed, but equipment for the Axle Load Control System was not procured. RBPC
signed contracts with suppliers for the supply of rescue vehicles, radio equipment,
wrecking cranes, etc.; however, RBPC did not proceed with the contracts, in view of the
suspension of disbursements. Also, it did not employ technical assistance for
implementation of the Axle Load Control System.
14.   RBPC engaged consultants for the implementation of the PMS; a contract
between Government and the consultants was signed on January 4, 1993. After initial
delays, actual work on the PMS started in September 1993. The work progressed well
and by March 1994, equipment for the PMS had been procured, pavement condition
survey data collected and a number of RBPC engineers trained in the usage of equipment.
To allow completion of the implementation phase (Stage 3) of the PMS, IDA extended,
with the agreement of the Kingdom of Norway, the original closing date of March 31,
1994, of the Norwegian Grant to December 31, 1994. The follow-up phase (Stage 4) for
the annual input to the road maintenance program, which was intended to be carried out
with the help of consultants for a period of 3 years, was deleted, as it was thought that
with the completion of the implementation phase RBPC would have a fully functional
PMS and adequately trained staff to continue its operations.
15.   RBPC signed contract with consultants for technical assistance services for
institutional development, but did not proceed with the same in view of the suspension.
Bank Performance
16.   The Bank's performance in project preparation assistance and appraisal, as well as
project supervision was satisfactory. The Bank identified implementation problems
correctly and provided appropriate and timely advice to the borrower.
Borrower Performance
17.   The borrower's performance in project preparation was satisfactory. However,
due to the weak management of RBPC progress reports on the project were generally
received very late; no audit reports were received for FY92 and FY93. Government
failed to meet its debt service obligations to IDA.



-5-
Project Achievements
18.   The project did not achieve its objectives to protect capital investment and to
prevent transport costs and delivery times from increasing, and to prevent the abuse of the
road due to heavy overloading of trucks. Pavement rehabilitation was done for about 80
percent of the length involved; some 30 bridges were provided only with temporary
ramps; and road shoulders were left incomplete over long lengths. Possible contractor
claims for demobilization costs, idle equipment and labor, lost profits, etc. and
unforeseen delays in the execution of the remaining works would have resulted in much
higher costs than wLre originally estimated, besides loss of economic benefits. Although
work on a few weighbridges was completed, equipment for the axle load control was not
procured, nor was any technical assistance employed for the implementation of the Axle
Load Control System. No technical assistance was employed for the follow-up phase of
the PMS (Para. 14), or for the institutional support for RBPC (Para. 15).
Lessons Learned
19.   The project was processed at a time when the country's economy was in a very
poor state. A new Government had assumed power in June 1989, the peace process had
stalemated and the Government was in the process of defining its economic policies. The
October 1989 IMF mission to the country observed that the economic reforms that the
authorities were considering fell short of what the mission considered adequate. As a
consequence, the Bank decided to limit its exposure in Sudan. Since the Bank, however,
viewed the rehabilitation of this road as critical to the Sudan's existence as well as its
economic recovery, it decided to proceed with the project despite the risks posed by the
deteriorating macroeconomic situation. Although not successful, we believe the risk was
justified under the circumstances.
