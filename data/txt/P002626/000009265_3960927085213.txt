MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAI DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SUDAN
FOR A KHARTOTJM-PORT SUDAN ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed credit to Sudan for SDR 65.7
million (US$82.2 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms with forty years maturity
and help finance a Khartoum - Port Sudan Road Rehabilitation Project. The
Project would be co-financed by KfW for SDR 12.9 million (US$16.1 million
equivalent).
2.       Background.  Sudan, the largest country in Africa with an area of
2.5 million square km. has only 2,335 km of paved roads. Forty percent of
this total consists of a 1,182 km long road from Port Sudan on the Red Sea
through major agricultural areas to Khartoum, the country's inland capital
and major city. Since its completion, this road has become the most
important communications link in the country, now transporting about 902 of
all imports and exports; the road is carrying more than sevenfold the
tonnage that the railroad in the same corridor is carrying (3.8 million
tons against 0.5 million tons in 1985/86). Attempts are being made to
arrest the further decline of the Sudan Railways Corperation under a multi-
donor funded restructuring program. Even if the railroad rehabilitation is
successful, however, between 2.5-3.0 million tons of freight traffic will
still be transported on the road. Built in sections, the road is in part
17 years old, and certain segments, notably between Gedaref and Kassala and
between Haiya and Port Sudan, are showing severe base failure and are
approaching the stage where full reconstruction is required. In large
measure the deteriorated condition of the road is due to heavy overloading
of trucks but the floods in August 1988 further damaged the pavement in
some places, and substantially extended the number of kilometers in need of
immediate overlay. Rehabilitation of the road must be implemented soon to
protect the capital investment and to avoid rapid increase in vehicle
operating costs.
3.       Sudan's highway authority, the Roads and Bridges Public
Corporation, has begun to repair the road's most damaged sections between
Gedaref and Kassala, but its capacity is far from sufficient to eliminate
the backlog of repair work (accumulated in the last 3-5 years) in other
sections. The on-going IDA-funded Third Highway Project (Cr. 1450-SU) is
providing assistance to build up Government's capacity to meet maintenance
and construction targets and to initiate some control over axle loads, but
the Project has not yet progressed to the point where results are
sufficient to prevent premature deterioration of the roads. In view of the
urgent need to rehabilitate about 566 km of the Khartoum-Port Sudan road,
the Government requested the Bank to initiate this separate Rehabilitation
Project to reconstruct or provide an overlay on the most critical sections
of this link.



- 2 .
4.       Under the on-going Third Highway Project, a team of experts has
been attached to RBPC to assist in improving the institutional capacity of
the organization, in particular related to road maintenance. It will take
time before assistance of this nature will achieve its full impact. The
Project includes funding for further technical assistance to be provided
upon expiration of this technical assistance contract to continue
supporting RBPC's institutional development and to ensure that the
organization benefits from the Project's institutional measures.
5.       The proposed Project is the result of collaboration of IDA with
two donors. The Kingdom of Norway played an essential role in its
preparation by funding detailed engineering studies of the sections to be
rehabilitated and KfW is assisting in its financing. IDA's ongoing Third
Highway Project provided an opportunity to launch preparation of this
emergency project and to integrate its components with current efforts to
strengthen Sudan's Roads and Bridges Public Corporation's overall
maintenance capacity and institute more effective axle load control
measures.
6.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Avoiding the complete break-up of
some sections of the Khartoum - Port Sudan road and prolonging the life and
protecting the investment of additional parts otherwise in jeopardy is
essential to Sudan's existence as well as to economic recovery. The road
is the country's lifeline and if not repaired soon some sections will
break-up completely within a year and others will become candidates for
reconstruction rather than overlay. Unpaved detours around broken sections
will proliferate, and vehicle operating costs and transit time will
increase dramatically.
7.       Sudan's highway authority, although gradually improving its
ability to maintain this and other parts of the road network, does not yet
have the capacity to undertake the emergency work required to keep open the
road, nor does Government have the foreign exchange available to fund
private contractors to do the work. The proposed Project will keep open
the road and set the stage for preventing similar emergencies from arising
in the future.
8.       Proiect Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed Project are:
(1) to arrest further deterioration and avert the need for even greater
investment in the Port Sudan to Khartoum road by addressing now, sections
in need of urgent repair and maintenance; and to thereby prevent transport
costs and delivery times from increasing and hampering Sudan's economic
recovery program; (2) to implement an effective Axle Load Control System to
reduce the overloading of vehicles that has, in large measure, created this
urgent situation and thus prevent undue abuse of the road once the road has
been restored; (3) to institute a Pavement Management System so that RBPC
can better assess the condition of the road network, alert itself to
potential problems and plan future road maintenance and reconstruction
needs in a timely fashion; and (4) to continue supporting RBPC's
institutional development with technical assistance and training.

9.       Project Description.  Totalling US$114.4 million with a foreign
exchange component of 80, the Project would finance: (i) road
construction, consisting of rehabilitation of the Khartoum - Port Sudan
Road (US$88.1 million), construction supervision (US$4.1 million) and
funding of a cost overrun on the Jebel Aulia - Ed Dueim Road construction
component of the Second Highways Project (US$15.6 million); (ii)
implementation of an Axle Load Control System, including provision of
technical assistance, training, and construction and equipment for
permanent and mobile weighbridges (including rescue and road safety
equipment) (US$4.6 million); (iii) implementation of a Pavement Management
System including provision of technical assistance and training (US$0.9
million); and (iv) institutional support for RBPC in the form of technical
assistance and training (US$1.1 million). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Sudan are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A
map and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 7443-SU dated September 15, 1989 are
also attached.
10.      Agreed Actions.  ,t negotiations, agreement was reached that the
Government would: (i) establish axle load limits and take alf measures
necessary to enforce such limits by means of implementing the Axle Load
Control System provided in the Project; (ii) establish a Pavement
Management System within RBPC to monitor Sudan's bitumen network by dates
agreed; (iii) adopt a road classification system and implement
organizational changes within RBPC according to agreed action plans; (iv)
improve RBPC's operational flexibility by raising substantially the value
of tenders that can be approved by RBPC; (v) instruct RBPC to submit to IDA
an annual maintenance plan relating budge to physical works programmed for
the subsequent year and relating such work to the maintenance needs of the
entire bitumen road network in the long term. As a condition of
effectiveness, Government would have obtained the necessary co-financing
for the Project from KfW.
11.      Benefits.  The main quantified economic benefits of the Project
are savings in vehicle operating costs. The Government will also benefit
from savings to be gained to the extent that application of an overlay or
resealing will avoid costlier reconstruction of these sections in the
future. Additional benefits will result in time savings and from improved
road safety but these are difficult to quantify. The major direct
beneficiaries of the reduced transport costs and improved road safety will
be truck and bus owners. The Axle Load Control System will reduce
overloading and prevent premature deterioration of the reconstructed road.
The Pavement Management System will enable RBPC and Government to better
monitor and plan maintenance for its paved road system. Thus, RBPC will be
a stronger institution with the means to better plan and manage its
maintenance requirements and reduce abuse of the road.
12.      Risks.  The major risk of the Project relates to the institutional
measures. The Axle Load Control System may not be successful due to
possible opposition from road transport users, failure of RBPC and the
Police to carry out fully the proposed system, or general socio-behavioral



- 4 -
factors. Similarly, R8PC's implementation of the Pavemeat Management
System may not be successfully implemented because of possible
organisational and managerial weaknesses. These risks are reduced by the
fact that the technical assistance team begun under the Highways I:.
Project will be continued under the Project and by the recognized need for
these measures and the strong comitments given both by RBPC and Gcvernment
to implement them.
13.      On the civil works component of the Project, there is little risk
to Implementation since the work will be carried out by contract awarded
under ICB. The risk of cost escalation is small as estimates have been
based on detailed engineering and in any event, the economic rate of return
remains high even with substantial cost increases. With respect to the
objective of extending the life of the entire road by rehabilitating
sections most in need of urgent repairs, there is a risk that sections not
included ln the Project might fail and require investment sooner than
anticipated. This risk is reduced by introducing in the Project, technical
assistance components to increase RBPC's capacity to carry out periodic
maintenance operations. Furthermore, during identification and preparation
of the upcoming Fourth Highway Project, the performance of the Khartoum -
Port Sudan road will be closely monitored, ar.4 if necessary, a second
rehabilitation phase will be included in Highways IV scheduled for
implementation in 1993-98.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
