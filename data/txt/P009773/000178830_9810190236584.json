will finance construction, over a four-year period, of\n            120-160 tank irrigation schemes throughout the State of\n            Karnataka estimated to irrigate about 25,000 ha. The project\n            will also assist GOK in creating an improved hydrological\n            data base for planning, design and construction of future\n            minor irrigation projects. Finally, a study aimed at\n            improving utilization of irrigation water will be conducted.\n            The main project risk concerns the uncertainty of long-term\n            projections of average annual water runoff into tanks.\n            Adequate account of this fact has been taken in calculating\n            costs and benefits under this project.
