1. INTRODUCTION
These guidelines are as a result of an environmental review of the Rural Investment and Support Project.
Projected sub-project activities have been examined from the point of view of the impacts that such sub-
projects may have on aspects of the environment.
The intention of these guidelines is to provide RISP staff, and particularly loan officers, with basic
information on the effects that each class of sub-projects may have on various aspects of the environment.
In referencing these guidelines, the officers will be able to provide specific conditions to each of the sub-
project loans to ensure that potential impacts are minimized, if not entirely avoided. Since these are only
guidelines and the information contained within is generalized, in some instances the officers would be
advised to seek local professional opinion (e.g. Ministry of Environmental Protection and Territorial
Development officials, agricultural extension staff, research officers, etc.) for specific information.
As the type of loans may change with time, it is important that these guidelines be reviewed periodically,
and modified where necessary, to ensure their useful application.
Commercial credit is the project's main components. A component of the project will be for small loans
to farmers. Possible activities for small farm loan support may include the following:
*  Seed
*  Fertilizer
*  Pesticide
*  Machinery hire for land preparation
*  Livestock for breeding
*  Livestock for finishing
*  Livestock feed
*  Building materials
*  Fencing
*  Small implements including carts
*  Draft animals
*  On farm processing equipment
2. ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION
The Republic of Moldova has a comprehensive set of environmental laws and regulations and there is a
general consensus that this existing body of laws, governmental and ministerial decrees, official rules and
standards is a sufficient base for effectively addressing the country's serious environmental issues. The
following is a list of the most important environmental laws and codes in Moldova:
*  The Constitution (1994)
*  Underground Resources Code (1993)
*  Water Code (1993)
*  Land Code (1991, revised in 1995)
*  Forestry Code (1996)
*  Law on Environmental Protection (1993, modification in 1997)
*  Law on Sanitary-Epidemiological Protection of the Population (1993)
*  Law on Protected Areas (1998)
*  Law on Natural Resources (1997)
2



*  Law on the Protection of Riparian Zones (1995)
*  Law on Taxes on Environmental Pollution (1998)
*  Law on Hazardous Substances and Products Management (1997)
*  Law on Air Protection (1997)
*  Law on Wastes (1997)
*  Law on Secondary Material Resources (1996)
*  Law on Protection of Fauna (1995)
*  Law on Ecological Expertise and Environmental Impact Assessment (1996)
*  Law on Wastes (1997)
*  Law on Secondary Material Resources (1996)
*  Law on Protection of Fauna (1995)
*  Law on Ecological Expertise and Environmental Impact Assessment (1996)
*  Law on the Protection of Consumer's Rights (1993)
*  Law on the Protection of Monuments (1993)
*  Law on Land Property Control, Cadastre and State Land Monitoring (1992)
*  Law on Drinking Water (1999)
The two most important laws are the Law on Environmental Protection (1993, 1997) and the Law on
Ecological Expertise and Environmental Impact Assessment (1996). These are briefly described in the
following paragraphs:
Law on Environmental Protection
This law is the main framework legislation. It is an umbrella legal framework and serves as a background
for development of specific legislation and regulations. The Law describes: i) the principals of
environmental management; (ii) the role, rights and obligations of different state bodies (President,
Parliament and Government), elected local and regional authorities, physical and juridical persons and
entities; (iii) the principal structure of Government organizations (main ones), which are responsible for
environmental management and control in Moldova; and (iv) main directions and policies in the domains
of land (soil), water, air and biodiversity protection, as well as hazardous substances management.
Law on Ecological Expertise and Environmental Impact Assessment
This law is intended to establish permit procedures before any new development is to be implemented. For
specific projects that can have potential significant negative environmental impact, an EIA is conducted
prior to detailed design. The EIA report is subject to public and ministerial reviews and should be
approved by ecological expertise. All other developments and projects should be passed by the ecological
expertise at the moment the detailed design is prepared and all marginal permissions have been received.
The Law describes the basic principals of the State, Public Ecological Expertise and framework
procedures.
Agricultural Oriented Environmental Policy, Strategies and Important Recommendations
A number of policies and strategic documents, prepared both in the pre-independence and transition
periods comprise environmental policy. There is considerable overlap between the various policies,
particularly at the broad national level. Table 1 below summarizes the most important policies and
strategies.

The legal instrumentation, along with the various policies and strategies, as these relate to agriculture and
the environment, appear to be comprehensive. However, the institutional network and the system to ensure
that policies and strategies are implemented, that laws are enforced, and that perpetrators are dealt with in
an efficient and effective manner, are weak.
3. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Impact assessment
Formal EIA procedures were introduced in 1996. The EIA procedures are applicable to complex and
potentially dangerous (to the environment) projects which could lead to significant impacts. Thirty-two
topics on the list of activities requiring an EIA, are applicable to agricultural and agro-industrial activities.
These include:
*   ether-oil factories
*   sugar refinery and butter-fat factories
6



*  meat and dairy enterprises
*  canning factories (> 100 million cans per year) and large storage/pre-processing units
*  livestock complexes (cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry)
*  orchards and vineyards (> 500 ha)
*  irrigation (> 1,000 ha) and drainage (> 100 ha) schemes
*  glass houses (> 24 ha)
*  alcohol production facilities (wine, beer, brandy, etc.) (> 100,000 deca-liters per year)
*  tanneries, including leather pre-processing
The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Territorial Development (MEPTD) may require EIA for
other types and scales of projects.
The EIA should be conducted at an early stage of the project if new construction, upgrading,
reconstruction, modernization, production profile changes, conservation or liquidation of existing
enterprises or new development planning is expected to be implemented.
The proponent is responsible for supervision of the EIA and preparation of the EIA report. He will prepare
the terms of reference for the EIA and hire the team. He will also clarify the procedures and establish the
time frame for reporting. All of this, along with determination of expected outputs, report structure and
administrative details will be discussed and agreed upon with MEPTD.
The EIA is conducted by national certified experts following the defined methodology, report structure
and documentation requirements. The brief Statement on the Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA)
should be a subject of public and ministerial revisions. Corrected SEIA and other documentation should
be presented to the Ecological Expertise Department of MEPTD for adoption. The principal objective of
the Ecological Expertise Department is to check if all environmental standards/principals are followed and
environmental protection measures are addressed and in place. A positive decision on the SELA provides
the official basis to initiate detail design of the project.
Once the technical and economic evaluation (feasibility study) and detailed design is prepared it is again
subject to review by the Ecological Expertise Department. The EIA findings should be incorporated in the
chapter "Protection of Environment", of the Design Report including mitigation measures and the
environmental management plan. The State Ecological Expertise can be conducted either by the central
office of the State Ecological Expertise in Chisinau, or by the Zonal Ecological Agencies, depending on
the scale of the project and its economic importance. In addition to the obligatory State Ecological
Expertise, so called "ministerial" and/or "public" expertise can be voluntarily applied.
The State Ecological Expertise makes the final decision if the EIA is acceptable or not.
4. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF RISP
Prevention. Under the existing legislation the great majority of RISP activities would not require an ELA.
Since preventive measures are favored over mitigatory or compensatory measures whenever feasible, the
Project will build capacity in CAPMU, supported by a parallel GEF funded Agricultural Pollution
Control Project (APCP), to avoid or minimize potential environmental impacts through applying a set of
good practices directed to farmers through the advisory Components of the RISP, such as providing
guidance to clients on environmental and agricultural sustainability matters when advising on agricultural
production activities. These Components will also support environmentally sustainable agriculture
technologies, organic farming, and provide farmer education on environmentally sound practices.
Mitigation For those rare cases when EIA will be necessary, in order to avoid, or minimize, environmental
impacts, practical mitigative measures must be adopted and applied. Mitigation should be a condition of
7



any loan. Mitigation for the most part for RISP loans will include effective planning, cooperation, and the
use of agricultural extension services. Mitigation should not require significant amounts of addition
financial resources.
Residual impacts Residual impacts are those that remain after all mitigation has been carried out.
Assuming that all mitigation as indicated in the guideline tables is implemented effectively, the residual
effects, even cumulatively on all sub-projects, should not be significant.
5. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT UNDER RISP
The RISP is not in the business of managing the environment, however, it does have a responsibility to
ensure that loans do not support projects that will contribute to the deterioration of the environment.
Project management's most important role in this respect will be two fold: i) to ensure that appropriate
mitigative measures are incorporated into the loan agreement, and, ii) that it monitors projects to ensure
that mitigation is carried out and to ensure that environmental impacts not previously anticipated, do not
occur.
The major role of the RISP environmental specialist (or a consultant working with RISP) will be two fold:
i) to provide assistance to each of the loan officers to determine the exact impacts that can be expected
from proposed activities for which loans are being sought, as well as prescribing in specific terms the
required mitigative actions to be taken; and, ii) to monitor on a regular basis the effects that activities
financed by RISP have on aspects of the environment, to ensure that mitigation is carried out, and to
assess for unanticipated impacts.
Monitoring. Frequent monitoring by the Bank and CAPMU will be required to ensure that mitigation is
carried out and to also determine whether or not additional impacts, not identified in this environmental
review, have not been overlooked. Monitoring will be carried out on a systematic basis by the project
management team or its designate (e.g. a local environmental consultant). A detailed monitoring
procedure will be developed and the individual(s) responsible would receive training in monitoring
techniques. The World Bank should also include an environmental specialist on the occasional
supervisory mission to ensure that environmental monitoring is being conducted effectively and that
monitoring results are being acted upon.
6. USE OF GUIDELINES
The first part of the Guidelines is a set of tables, one for each of the five sub-components of the project.
These are the tables developed for the EIA. Each table describes the environmental impact that could
occur as a result of the activity being financed by the loan, the cause of the impact and the effect or
consequence of the impact. A broad level of significance (assuming no mitigation) of the impact is given
(High, Moderate or Low) and the general mitigative action required to address each of the impacts is
provided. Expectations for residual impacts, assuming mitigation is carried out, are provided as well.
The second part is an Environmental Checklist - a matrix indicating the various agricultural activities that
can affect aspects of the environment. The matrix will alert the loan officer to the significance of any
potential impact that a specific agricultural activity may have on aspects of the environment.
Loan officers will use both sets of tables (Set A and Set B attached) to assist in determining both the
general and specific impacts that can be expected from different types of projects. Knowing the
correlations to be expected, the loan officer, with input from the environmental specialist, can set the
mitigative measures required as a condition for the loan. These guidelines will also be used by the
environmental specialist, particularly for monitoring.
8



7. EIA REVIEW PROCESS
The following is a suggested procedure for environmental screening and EIA preparation, review and
approval. This could be modified as the project further develops.
Step 1. Application for line of credit is submitted to the lending institution;
Step 2. Lending institution, with the help of a user friendly EIA guidelines and Environmental Check
List, determines whether or not the activity will require an EIA. CAPMU will monitor the
FI's compliance with the Development credit Agreement for the Project on the environmental
review process, including periodic monitoring of the Fl's screening process of applications for
EAI requirement.
Step 3. If the lending institution concludes that the activity will require an EIA it forwards the
application to CAPMU management for confirmation re: EIA requirement;
Step 4. CAPMU management (environmental officer) reviews application and verifies;
Step 5. If CAPMU management decides that an ETA is required, it informs lending institution of such
and lending institution informs loan applicant;
Step 6. If the applicant wishes to proceed he carries out an EIA (guidelines to be provided);
Step 7. Applicant submits EIA to lending institution which in turn forwards it to CAPMU
management;
Step 8. CAPMU reviews EIA and suggests revisions, clarilication etc that the applicant is to provide;
Step 9. CAPMU eventually approves or rejects project on the basis of the EIA;
Step 10. If approved, CAPMU will monitor the activity to ensure that it is in full compliance with the
management plan.
8. TRAINING AND CAPACITY BUILDING
The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Territorial Development is responsible for administering
the Law on Environmental Protection. However, apart from complex and potentially dangerous projects,
this law does not address the need for ETAs on most projects. To ensure that the World Bank is not
providing funding to an intermediary that may unknowingly support an activity that would normally fall
into the Bank's Category A or Category B project list, RISP management staff and lending agencies' staff
will require various levels of environmental management training. Training requirements are described in
the Table 3 below.
Project management personnel within CAPMU have no formal training in any aspect of environmental
management. It is important that those who are, and will be, associated with the management of the
project benefit from a workshop focusing on environmental awareness. This would allow management
staff to gain an appreciation for the importance of the environment and how the project can affect various
aspects of the environment. A workshop of three days duralion would be designed and would have a
capacity for approximately 12 participants. It is suggested that other members of CAPMU who have
management responsibility for other agricultural projects also participate in the workshop.
The METD only reviews project designs and revises such designs on environmental grounds. EIAs are not
conducted on any but the largest of projects. Since most activities resulting from RISP funding will be
9



small and not covered under the METD mandate it will be imrportant that project management have the
knowledge to recognize a RISP sponsored activity that may require an EIA. The Project will have one
officer (co-funded by a parallel GEF Nutrient Reduction Project) designated full time with the
responsibility of environmental review. The officer would be able to screen projects and indicate which
ones would require an EIA. He/she should be in the position to be able to review the EIA in terms of
adequacy, fact and completion. This officer would require additional and specialized training.
The agricultural advisory group will be in the most critical position to affect the environment since it will
be its advice to farmers that will translate into improved production. It will be essential that this group not
only receive a workshop on environmental awareness but also be advised on best practices that will
promote sustainable agriculture. A five day workshop for this group would include environmental
awareness and a practical exercise to observe and learn about sustainable agricultural practices. GEF
funded Nutrient Pollution Project on "environmental best practices" GEF funded Agricultural Pollution
Control Project (APCP) will also provide TA for applying a set of good practices directed to farmers
through the advisory Components of the RISP, such as providing guidance to clients on environmental and
agricultural sustainability matters when advising on agricultural production activities.
A number of institutions yet to be identified will be given the responsibility for reviewing loan
applications for agribusiness development and small credits for farmers and farmer groups, under the
close monitoring of the CAPMU. The loan officers of these institutions will need to be versed in aspects
of the environment to enable them to recognize potential environmental impacts. This group should
participate in a five day environmental workshop. The number of workshops required will depend upon
how many multiples of 12 would be required to attend the workshop.
A fourth and most critical group to be exposed to the importance of the environment includes the farmers
who will be receiving advice from the advisory group members. It will be included in the mandate of the
advisors that they clearly point out the environmental consequences of various farming and farming
related activities. This will be done on two fronts; with individual farmers and with farmer organizations
where it is envisioned that from time to time farmer organizations will be addressed by the advisors.
Included in capacity development will be the preparation of a user friendly field manual for use by the
above mentioned groups. The manual have a dual purpose: i) it will indicate how to recognize an
agribusiness that may fall into one of the Bank's A or B environmental categories, and in which case will
require an EIA, and ii) it will provide assistance for agricultural advisors and loan officers to identify
agricultural activities that may have an effect on the environment.

Special Credit Line Sub - Component
Individual farmers would use the special credit line for imnproving overall farm production. There is no indication in the project description of specific activities that farmers would
consider under the credit line. It can be assumed that small lines of credit would be used for seed, fertilizer, pesticides, land preparation, pedigree stock purchase, livestock purchase
for finishing, small implement purchasing, general building materials. The following impacts analysis is generic, taking into consideration these general areas of activity that farmers
are likely to pursue through the line of credit sub-component.
