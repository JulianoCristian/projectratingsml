development outcome was significant;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory; and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned include:\n            conditions attached to projects, particularly those bearing\n            on sector development policy, should be proportionate to\n            project scale; otherwise, they should be consigned to other\n            operations. Credit agreements and project budgets should be\n            sufficiently flexible to allow for changes in project\n            financial intermediaries during implementation. A grant\n            element was included in the credit line for enterprise\n            start-ups in order to accommodate businesses with weaker\n            collateral. But, in practice, the same collateral\n            requirements were applied, whether or not a grant was\n            attached to the loan. Credit lines involving multiple\n            sub-loans require a considerable delegation of fiduciary\n            responsibility. Providing consulting services to help small\n            entrepreneurs prepare and implement business plans is as\n            critical for the success of rural finance programs as\n            providing long-term credit."}, "docdt": "2009-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
