them. High standard phytosanitary requirements ,\n            adequate packaging, and compliance with bilateral agreements\n            will ensure that pests and diseases and diseased animals and\n            animal products will not be introduced in export. Staff will\n            be trained in proper handling methods, appropriate storage\n            of fuels and lubricants, and periodic safe transfer to\n            recycling facilities will reduce soil contamination and\n            water pollution. Safety equipment and clothing will be\n            issued and on-site warnings given to avoid personal\n            injuries. Loss of aquatic ecosystems and resources will be\n            prevented by appropriately handling and storing pesticides,\n            fertilizers, and waste materials. Also, farmers will be\n            trained in appropriate application levels. And the\n            timeliness of applications. The importance of the ecosystem\n            from where irrigated water will be sourced will reduce the\n            loss of water systems through irrigation. Traditional plant\n            varieties and indigenous and endemic germplasm will be\n            protected. Crop rotation with legumes and green manures will\n            avert heavy dependence on fertilizers. There will likely be\n            some nutrient leaching from chemicals into surface waters\n            and into groundwater sources as well as nutrient enrichment\n            of the soil. Effective air emission controls will be deployed."}, "docdt": "2002-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
