    that Moldova's agricultural sector can play its full\n            role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth\n            and poverty reduction. There are three main project\n            components plus support for project management. The first\n            component provides the most essential information to\n            emerging private farmers. The second component creates\n            legally registered rural businesses with business plans. The\n            third component provides finance to bankable rural clients.\n            The first two components provide predominantly technical\n            assistance, while the third component provides private\n            investment support along with the necessary technical\n            assistance to participating financial institutions. The\n            first three components are closely linked, with each\n            dependent on the others for successful outcomes."}, "docdt": "2002-05-22T00:00:00Z"}
