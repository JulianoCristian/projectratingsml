Lessons address the\n            following: 1) On broad policy issues, conditionalities\n            should be very limited in investment lending operations,\n            limited to policies that affected the project directly. For\n            example, further disbursement to savings and credit\n            associations should not have been allowed until there was a\n            proper supervisory authority in place. As much as possible,\n            further \"policy issues\" should be integrated into\n            alternative documents. 2) On Rural Finance, credit lines\n            that are likely to make a large number of small sub-loans\n            need considerable delegation of fiduciary responsibilities.\n            While eligibility criteria for participating financial\n            institutions should be designed during project preparation,\n            the project should allow for some flexibility to\n            add/subtract financial intermediaries throughout project\n            implementation. Loan documents AND budgets should allow this\n            flexibility. If the credit line is going to contain a grant\n            portion, the project should ensure there is a general\n            consensus on the constrain the grant is trying to address,\n            so that the project can objectively measure its\n            effectiveness. 3) On advisory and business development\n            services, the lack of consulting services to help small\n            entrepreneurs prepare and implement business plans, was as\n            important a constrain to rural finance, as the lack of\n            long-term credit on the market."}, "docdt": "2005-04-14T00:00:00Z"}
