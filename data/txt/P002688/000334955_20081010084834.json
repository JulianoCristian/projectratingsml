Design of some\n            components was inappropriate, technical assistance provided\n            by a bilateral donor was slow in becoming effective, the\n            project implementation unit (PIU) could have used more\n            building inspectors and equipment lists were in some cases\n            not provided when needed. In addition, a lack of\n            coordination existed between equipment provision and\n            construction and Bank supervision missions were often too\n            short, inappropriately staffed, and tried to supervise too\n            many project components without sufficient attention to site\n            inspection. However, given the complexity of the project,\n            the heavy workload imposed upon the PIU as well as\n            unforeseen and unavoidable constraints, it is probably\n            remarkable that the project outcome has been satisfactory in\n            many instances. The ultimate impact of the project cannot be\n            assessed properly at this point. To date, the results may be\n            termed positive in terms of quantitative outcomes with the\n            exception of the community education center (CECs) and the\n            in-service primary teacher training program (Bagamoyo).\n            Final evaluation of qualitative outcomes would be premature\n            at this time as the deficiencies presented concerning the\n            CECs, college of national education (CNEs) and vocational\n            training center (VTCs) have not yet been overcome. Finally,\n            it would appear that the results of the management study\n            have already been unusually successful. Lessons learned from\n            the project are: 1) project preparation was in some\n            instances not well advanced at appraisal suggesting that in\n            the future appraisal should exclude items not well prepared\n            if there is a risk that preparation will not be accelerated\n            early in project implementation; 2) the project required a\n            significant strengthening of the PIU which was largely\n            beyond the control of the Bank or Government since\n            expatriate technical assistance was provided by a bilateral\n            source. The Bank might have anticipated such a problem and\n            taken a more aggressive approach to resolving it during\n            project preparation; and 3) in addition, the PIU suffered\n            from its low administrative position; while it is a\n            sensitive point, the Bank might have been more persuasive in\n            its efforts to convince Government that the PIU should have\n            been given the equivalent of departmental status due to its\n            heavy responsibilities in project planning and implementation."}, "docdt": "1983-09-15T00:00:00Z"}
