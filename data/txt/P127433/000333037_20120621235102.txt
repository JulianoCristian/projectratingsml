                                SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION∗

                               Meeting of the Executive Directors

                                           June 19, 2012


       Executive Directors approved the Programmatic Public Finance Development Policy
Loan for Poland in the amount of Euro 750,000,000 (US$ 991,400,000 equivalent) on the
payment terms and conditions set out in the President’s Memorandum (R2012-0118).

        Directors expressed support for the program, which would strengthen Poland’s public
finances, improve social safety nets, and create fiscal space for strategic growth-enhancing
investments. Directors commended the authorities on the recently passed pension reforms to
ensure fiscal sustainability, the long-term adequacy of pensions, and to improve labor
participation. Directors emphasized the need to continue pursuing measures that would mitigate
the impact of the volatility in the Euro area.
