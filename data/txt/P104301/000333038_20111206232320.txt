Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The objective of the project is to achieve operational sustainability for most microfinance service providers
(MFPs) and help them scale up outreach of financial services to meet the demands and needs of many poor
Afghans, especially women. This will take place through: - Increased sustainability of MFPs that have
begun the process of diversifying their funding sources to include commercial sources in addition to funds
provided by the Government of Afghanistan - MFPs are registered as Afghan companies and operate under
relevant Afghan laws and supervision - Scaled up outreach to many more poor people in most provinces
