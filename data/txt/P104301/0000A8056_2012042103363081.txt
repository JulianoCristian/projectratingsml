                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to achieve operational sustainability for most microfinance service providers (MFPs) and help them scale up outreach of financial
                         services to meet the demands and needs of many poor Afghans, especially women. This will take place through: - Increased sustainability of MFPs that have begun the
                         process of diversifying their funding sources to include commercial sources in addition to funds provided by the Government of Afghanistan - MFPs are registered as
                         Afghan companies and operate under relevant Afghan laws and supervision - Scaled up outreach to many more poor people in most provinces
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation progress following restructuring shows achievement of several target indicators of performance including a) the revised target increase in the amount and percentage
                         of loan outstanding relative to the base year, b ) achievement of the 65% target percent of loan outstanding accounted for by MFPs with full Operational Self-Sufficiency (albeit with a
                         concentration of the portfolio in one large MFI), c) the percentage of microfinance providers with a portfolio at risk less than 5% is achieved by the target 57% (4 out of 7) of MFPs.
                         Also the 75% target percentage of active clients who are women has been achieved. However,the current performance shows that the overall number of active borrowers has
                         decreased from 267,664 as at end of August 2010 to 236,208 a year later. This is the result of the consolidation process. The total portfolio outstanding by August 2010 was about

                         5.056 billion AFN and as at August 2011 it was 5.518 billion AFN. The overall repayment rate is 89%. MISFA has continued to support its partner MFIs by ensuring that they are
                         facilitated to develop diverse products; to provide quality services; to encourage gainful access to microfinance; and to ensure that the clientele is informed and that there is a broad
                         market participation. This support is intended to move these institutions towards Operational Self Sufficiency(OSS) . Currently only one of the remaining 7 MFIs has achieved 100%
                         OSS and it is expected that by 2013, two others will have reached this level. MISFA has been open to a broad selection of partner types and looked into diverse markets. This open

                         minded approach has enabled the partner MFIs and their clients to appreciate the financial inclusion agenda. MISFA continues to coordinate and co-operate with other development
                         finance providers. The potential achievement of the development objective is still moderately satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         During the post-consolidation period MISFAhas slightly changed the way it will report on the performance of the microfinance operations. There are now 7 partners and MISFA will be
                         providing a general overview of their partner's performance and their contribution to the microfinance sector. MISFA will also be working very closely with each partner according to
                         their various stages of development using differing approaches for each to reach sustainability. According to the financial projections prepared by MISFA ,during the next two years
                         MISFA will not require additional external resources to advance to the partner MFIs. This is because the needs of each MFI is limited, given the reorganizations that have taken
                         place during the consolidation stage that has reduced the rate of credit growth to a pace that is commensurate with the capacity and operational efficiency of each one of the
                         institutions. A total of SDR 8,781,966.57 was cancelled as of November 1,2011 and will be committed to other purposes in the country. The closing date for the project was extended
                         to June 30, 2012. Financial Management (FM) assessment was moderately satisfactory during the last mission, but due to the continued improvement in all aspects of FM by MISFA,
                         the rating has been upgraded to satisfactory.
