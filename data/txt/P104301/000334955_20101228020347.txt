7a.  Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes 
The objective of the project is to achieve operational sustainability for most microfinance service providers  
(MFPs) and help them scale up outreach of financial services to meet the demands and needs of many poor 
Afghans, especially women. This will take place through: - Increased sustainability of MFPs that have 
begun the process of diversifying their funding sources to include commercial sources in addition to funds 
provided by the Government of Afghanistan - MFPs are registered as Afghan companies and operate under 
relevant Afghan laws and supervision - Scaled up outreach to many more poor people in most provinces
