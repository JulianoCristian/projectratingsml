This\n            restructuring paper seeks approval to extend the closing\n            date of the International Development Association (IDA)\n            Grant for the project from December 31, 2011 to June 30,\n            2012. This second extension, bringing the cumulative\n            extension period to 18 months, is required to provide\n            adequate time to complete the remaining project activities\n            and thus allow full completion of the project development\n            objective (PDO). The activities have been delayed due to\n            several factors, some of which have been outside the control\n            of the project implementing agency, Microfinance Investment\n            Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA)."}, "docdt": "2011-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
