                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to achieve operational sustainability for most microfinance service providers (MFPs) and help them scale up outreach of financial
                         services to meet the demands and needs of many poor Afghans, especially women. This will take place through: - Increased sustainability of MFPs that have
                         begun the process of diversifying their funding sources to include commercial sources in addition to funds provided by the Government of Afghanistan - MFPs
                         are registered as Afghan companies and operate under relevant Afghan laws and supervision - Scaled up outreach to many more poor people in most provinces
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The total microfinance sector outstanding portfolio by March 2011 was about AFN 4.97billion. The sector was supporting 245,370 active borrowers (of which 72 % were women).
                         The portfolio at risk > 30 days has improved from 6.9 % in September 2010 and now stands at 6.01 %, with an average operational self sufficiency of 86.4 % as opposed to 76% in
                         September 2010. The mission that took place from March 30 to April 12 reviewed the implementation progress and found that there has been significant progress since the
                         November mission regarding the achievement of the development objectives (reduced delinquency and operational self sufficiency). The overall performance as indicated above has
                         been due to the continued focused support that MISFA has provided to its partners during the consolidation process and will be providing in 2011, 2012 and 2013 .It is expected that

                         going forward this support will ensure that the remaining MFIs achieve operational self sufficiency. Given this demonstrated commitment and support, the mission decided to upgrade
                         the potential achievement of the development objectives to moderately satisfactory.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         MISFA has since the last mission in November, 2010 demonstrated the commitment and support that the partner MFIs require to achieve sustainability and in this respect MISFA
                         has instituted a system of working with the MFIs during their business plans' preparation to ensure that the elements that lead to this results are taken care of in terms of skills
                         development for staff and lending instruments. Because of these measures and others that have been put in place , the mission has upgraded the potential achievement of the
                         development objectives from moderately unsatisfactory to moderately satisfactory.
