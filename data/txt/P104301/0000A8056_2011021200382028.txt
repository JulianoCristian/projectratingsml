                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objective of the project is to achieve operational sustainability for most microfinance service providers (MFPs) and help them scale up outreach of financial
                         services to meet the demands and needs of many poor Afghans, especially women. This will take place through: - Increased sustainability of MFPs that have
                         begun the process of diversifying their funding sources to include commercial sources in addition to funds provided by the Government of Afghanistan - MFPs
                         are registered as Afghan companies and operate under relevant Afghan laws and supervision - Scaled up outreach to many more poor people in most provinces

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The total microfinance sector outstanding portfolio by September 2010 was about US$ 123 million. The sector was supporting 435,544 active clients including savers (of which 60 %
                         women) with 290,776 as borrowers (66% are women). The portfolio at risk > 30 days has improved and now stands at 6.9 %, with an average operational self sufficiency of 76 %.
                         The November implementation support mission noted that MISFA has taken bold and proactive steps to steer the processes of consolidation and liquidation( agreed upon with IDA
                         and commenced in 2008), and this has led to the improvement in the operational efficiency and performance of MFIs. . So far, nine MFIs are undergoing consolidation into three
                         entities. Out of this exercise five MFIs namely, Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), First Microfinance Bank( FMFB), World Council of Credit Unions(WOCCU),

                         FINCA and ASA have emerged as stronger institutions able to provide microfinance services in Afghanistan. By November 2010, the supervision mission observed tremendous
                         progress by MISFA to improve the sector's performance and sustainability. The mission recommended that the Implementation Performance rating be upgraded from Moderately

                         Unsatisfactory (MU) to Moderately Satisfactory (MS). The current performance of the sector shows that prospects for achieving project objectives (focused on sector operational and
                         financial sustainability) are good as a result of the successful consolidation process, thus justifying the project restructuring and extension by one year to December 31, 2010.
                         Nevertheless, the Project Development Objectives (PDO) rating remains MU until substantial improvement in terms of implementation progress justifies upgrading.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government requested a one year extension of the closing date to December 31, 2011. Given that the IDA project is at a critical juncture and continued IDA support would assist
                         MISFA to improve microfinance sector performance, the team recommended the extension to IDA Management and this has been approved .
