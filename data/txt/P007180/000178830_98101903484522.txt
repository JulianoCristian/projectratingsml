i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project consisting of
the Jurun-i4arinala Hydroelectric Scheme, associated high voltage trans-
mission lines, and other smaller gene:rating facilities, and special
consultants' services for engineering planning and management reorgani-
zation.
ii.       A Bank loan of US$1500 million equivalent, which would include
interest during construction, has been reauested to cover the foreign
exchange cost of the project, the total cost of which is estimated to be
the equivalent of U]S$23.5 million.

viii.     IMNE has agreed that during the construction period it will
maintain its existing tariffs in the isolated systems, and that it will
realize a 10% rate of return on the average net cost of those facilities
in its central system which are necessary for the sale of power to EEG.

INDE has also agreed that beginning with the year 1971 tariffs will be
maintained at levels which will enable it to achieve a return of at least
9% on its average net fixed assets in operatione Such arrangements should
elimlnate the need for continued government equity contributions by the
end of 1969. The Government has agreed to provide all the necessary funds
to complete the construction of the proposed project.
ix.       The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$15cO million
equivalent, for a period of 25 years including a grace period of four years,
subject to the provisions of paragraph 108.

3.        In 1960 a grant was made from the U.N. Special Fund to cover
the foreign currency costs Of a study by Consultants of Guatemala
electric power resources, a determination of the country's power require-
ments and the prepar-ation of a power development program.  The Bank was
appointed as the Executing Agency by the U.N. This study was completed
in 1962. In Septemdber 1964 alternativea proposals for the power develop-
ment program were put forward by a second firm of consultants engaged by
I1NDE and, as a resu2Lt of the recommendations made by these consultants,
INDE proposes to construct the Jurun-Marinala Hydroelectric Scheme as a
first priority.
4.        The entire project including the Jurun-Marinala Hydroelectric
Scheme, which forms the major part of the program, is expected to be in
commission during the latter half of 1969.
5.        This report has been based on information supplied by INDE
and the Empresa Electrica de Guatemala (EEG) to a mission consisting of
Messrs. J. Beach and J. Bruen, which visited Guatemala in May-June 1965,
information subsequently supplied by INDE and EEG and further informa-
tion obtained by Mr. J. Beach during a visit to Guatemala in August 1966.
II. BACKGROUND
6.        Guatemala is mainly an agricultural country and coffee produc-
tion is the mainstay of the economy th-rough its contribution to the export
trade.



- 2 -
7.        Gradual structural changes in the economy are likely, however,
in the form of an increasing trend towards industrialization and a rela-
tive reduction in the importance of agriculture. Within the manufac-
turing sector it is probable that the food, beverage and tobacco indus-
tries, which are the older industries and now account for more than half
of the industrial output, will, while continuing to grow, decline in
relative imtortance as the paper. rubber. metal-working. machinery and
petroleum industries gain sharply in their share of the total industrial
output.
8.        Such industrial activitv as nresentlv exists is concentrated
in the areas of Guatemala City and Escuintla (Central Region) and
Quezaltenango (Western Regionn) Ther,e are few industrial nlants in
other areas.  In an effort to decentralize development, the Government
is actively following a policy of encounrnging ne-w industries to develon
in areas away from the capital city. It is likely, however, that for many
yars to rnome the greater par+. of tn+.mnla s industry will be I  onopntrate.
in or around the capital.
9.        For the purposes of electricity supply, Guatemala has been
evired int+. forni' regions:  Cerntral, WIestern, Eastern and Atlantic (see
map).  At the present time the generating facilities in these regions
are designed to meet their own load requirements, and regional inter-
connection does not exist. The Central Region includes Guatemala City

(5 IMW) anci El Salto (5.5 MW) and two small diesel units at Laguna (7 MO.),
Ilhe insti-alled capacity had increased tio 20 Mw by 956. BetLween 1956 ald
1964 EEG installed a further 45 TV oI' thermal capacity which, together
with existing installations was able to meet the increasing demands up
to that time e  At all times, however, very little spare capacity was
available, !ND)E rias now assumed the responsibility for tne installation
of future generating capacity to meet the needs of the EEG system and
commissioned a 12 5 1MD! gas turbine unit in September 1965 and a 13 11v
hydro planit in August 1966. EEG now serves a number of towns adjacent
to the capital city and is following a policy of extending services to
those areas where the load demand warrants the necessary transmission
and distr:Lbution ).ineso This system is the largest in the country and
supplies practically the whole of the Central Region.



12.       The second largest system is in the Westorn Region. which
obtains power from generating plants lccated in the Santa Maria area.
These nl ants ccmnrise diiespl and hcir-rn units with an installed canacitv
of 8.7 MW. They form part of INDE's, existing generation facilities which
includ18e the  nnt  q Maria svs-t.pm serv:Lng the mimici nilitv Of Of'Quezaltenango
and a number' of other small towns in the Western Region.

15.       On the basis of statistics available for the period 1950
through 1964, the per capita consumption for the Central Region has risen
from 102.3 kwh in 1950 to 277.7 kwh in 1964, for the remainder of the
country from 17.6 kwhr to 30.1 kwh, and for, the country as a whole from
36.6 kwh to 85.6 kwh. These figures represent average annual increases
of aTbout 7%,, 4% and 6% respectively.
16.       The distribution of consumption among categories of consumers
has remained almost constant throughout the same period and is approxi-
mately as follows:

III. THE BORROWER
17.       The Borrower would be the Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion
(INDE), an autonomous agency created by Decree No. 1287 in l"ay 1959 with
full authority to develop Guatemala's electric power resources "for the
general benefit of the nation". This decree gave IN1DE responsibility to
develop the hydraulic resources for irrigation and electric power, and
regulation of the power industry in Guatemala. To this end it is per-
mitted to generate, transmit, distribute, buy and sell electrical energy,
and to reglaate the power industry.
l80       T'he decision to form a national power authority was made in
1959 but because of' the time required to form the organization and to
turn over existing generating facilit-ies, INDE did not become active
until 19614. Before! this date no single organization in Guatemala was
responsible for the! control of the powrer industry. Some of the functiors
of such an organization had 'ceen carried out by the Department of National
ElectrificaLtion which formed part of the Ministry of Public Works. The
Department did not have any well-defined jurisdiction and in general its
activities were confined to investigation of future hydroelectric projects
and the provision of electric generation facilities in some of the smaller
communities,
19.       Decree No. 275 of September 1964 detailed the construction pro-
gram which INDE was to undertake. An-art from the Los Esclavos and El
Porvenir hydro projects (in the Central and Western Regions respectively),
already under construction. and the studv of the future develonment of
Lake Atitlan, it included the gas turbine plant at Escuintla and the
Jurun-ilari-iala scheme, hoth of which Porm part of this project.
20.       The decrFee further gave authorLty to the Minister of the Treasury
and Public Credits to provide such finance as was necessary for the execu-
tion Or these worrks^
21.       The faciities owned and operated by T\IMDR comprise hvrno n1ants at
Los Esclavos (13 IMW), Santa Maria (5.3 MW), Rio Hondo (2.4 IW), Comaja
(192 1w), and Santan Posnlia (150 kw); dliesel installations at San Felipe-
(2.9 IW) and Tecum Uman (60 kw), which form part of the Santa Maria system,
and the first gas t-urbine .nit at Escui.ntla (12I5 II).

230       The general manager, who attends all Board meetings, is the
chief executive of INDE and is respon.sibLe for day-to-day operations in
line with policies laid down by the Board.
24.       The general manager and key personnel lack experience in the
electricity supply industry and INDE will require assistance from con-
sultants qualified in system planning, engineering and design, rate
studies andi in negotiating major sales contracts. Additionally the
emplovment of suitable management consultants will be required to assist
INDE to develop an effective organization structure and to advise on
changes to be made in its acont tina svstem,  Tt is a condition for

No. 1287 which charges INDE with responsibility for the installation of
IIDE power in the Central Region and proposes to continue its policy of
extending services to those parts of it6 conceion area where the load
demand warrants the necessary transmission and distribution lines and
also pro,poses to exterld its electricity facilities to la-rge isolabed
loads outside its present service area. During the period 1961-1965
investments by EEG in transmission and distribution lines, substations and
consumers' services were as follows:

Further details of EEGIs financial position, particularly wit?i
regard to its ability to continue investing in its distribution system
are given in the Financial Section (Paras. 78,79, and 80).
26.       The installed generating capacity owned by EEG totals about
65 MW, and comprises 30 N44 of steam, 12.5 Mi of gas turbines, 9 MW of
diesel and about 13 MW of hydro.

The largest load center is the munici.paiity of Quezaltenango which oILaU-±DS
its energy requirements partly from the Santa Maria system, and partly
from its cwn plants at Zunii (1 iVXW hydro) and Quezaltenango (500 kw diesel).
29.       The present naximum demand on the Santa Maria system is about
5.0 I.W. Ihe firm capacity available in the system to deal with this load
is 8.7 MW, which will be increased by a further 2.2 NJi w¢ith the commis-

local hydroelectric or diesel stations. Many of these very small sta-
tions and their distribution networks are inadequate to supply the
present demand, resulting in unsatisfactory service and considerable
losses in the distribution systems. IIDE plans to acquire, improve and
interconnect some of these isolated networks.
Forecast of Future Demand
(a) Central Region
32.      The demand on the EEG system which serves the major portion of
this region has increased from about 41 N in 1960 to 76 N in 1965, an
average anmual increase of 13%. During the same period the sale of energyr
increased from about 155 million kwh to about 307 million kwh, an average
annual increase of about 14i%. This has been due to easing of restric-
tions of supply made possible by the installation of new plant and the
revision of EEG's rate structure to p?romote load growth. A major factor
has also been EEG" s expansion of the service area to connect existing
isolated industrial loads.
33.      INOEts consultants forecast a load growth of 125 annuallv for
the five-year period ending 1967 and 10% for the period 1967-71. This
forecast. was arri-red at after taking into account the effect of both t1le
direct development of industrial demand and the indirect effect of



.7 -
increased employment and the increased purchasing power of existing
and potential consumers in the Guatemala City area. Estimates prepared
by EEG forecast a load growth of a litt:le over 12% per annum during
the period 1964-69. Based on these forecasts and an analysis of the
increase of load in the entire Cerntral Region over the last 10 years,
a rate of growth of 12% per annum has been assumed in this report for
the period 1965-71.
34.      iBased on this growth rate the sale of energy in the Central
Region is forecast to increase from 307 million kwh in 1965 to 630 mill:ion
kwh in 1971 and the system demand to increase from 76 IV to 150) M  durilg
the same period.
35.       ENDE has assumed responsibility for the provision of all
future generating capacity and in order to meet the load requirements
of the Central Region commissioned a -as turbine unit of 12.5 SJ capa-
citv at Escuintla in September 1965 and the 13 MI Los Esclavos hydro-
electric sltation, financial assistance for which was provided by the
Inter-American Development Bank. in August 1966. Other planned additions
to INDE S generating capacity in the Central Region are a second gas
turbine unit of l5 nil capacity at Escuintla. to be commissioned by the
end of 1967 and the 60 ith Jurun-Marinala hydroelectric station, the
first unit of whichi is expected to he nornmissioned in July 1969.
36,,      Tn order to m.eet the growing de-mand of this region- the con-
struction of additional generating capacity would need to be started
by the end of 1967 in order to be a'hp iThhTh to meet the le.m.nri forecaqst

(b) Santa Maria System Clesterrn Region)
4o.       The limited statistics available for this area and the lack
of suitable metering equipment make it difficult to determine the actual
rate of growth of this system. The principal consumer is the municipality
of Quezaltenango, which has recently increased its own generating capacity
by installing a 500 kw diesel plant with the result that purchases of power
from the I1mDE-owned Hidroelectrica de Santa Maria have declined.  INDE's
consultants have forecast that the dern-id on the Santa Maria system will
grow at a rate of 8% per annum. This iS reasonable and such an assumec!
rate of gTrowth wourld result in sales of energv incrensing from 16.5 million
kwh in 1965 to 266 million kwh in 1971, and maximum demand rising from
5c.n tr i; n 1965 to a    -t n 8 i oMA! by 1971.  The generating capacity presently
available and planned for the system should be adequate to deal with the
inereases durring this periodl
h'l.      Th>e t,.to other teas wvhere e~leo+rie4-t   nnsreopJ4-n is + >
place are the East-ern Region and the Atlantic Region (see map). The
Eastern Resgion -is serv4ed pr;cipally by1- I,s Rio Hondo UAhyA'o1 c
station which has an installed capacity of 2.h ITV. The present maximrur

expansL Ii±n pJrogr. r L-riINDE proposes to a4qLIIre, iUpirove duiu tnULI,ect some
of these isolated plants.
42.       In the Atlantic Region INDE has no generating facilities but
proposes to instaLl a diesel plant at ruerto Matia-s de Galvez, withn an
initial c,apacity of 2.5 W{, to be commissioned in 1967, with a second
installation of 2 15 IVW in 1969. This installation is required to provide
supplies -to the port of Matias de Galvez which the Government is planning
to develop.
43.       For the purpose of determining a suitable rate of- growtn these
two adjacent regions have been combined. Very little statistical data
exist which could be of assistance in determining the rate of growth.
The growth of the Rio Hondo system is likely to follow the pattern of
the rural areas of Guatemala which have shown a development of a little
under 6% per annum during the last 15 years. On the other hand, Puerto
Matias de Galvez could develop at a much faster rate and accordingly a
figure of between 8% and 9% has beern assumed for the two systems com-
bined. As a result, the sale of energy by INDE in these two regions is
forecast to increase from 6.6 million kwh in 1965 to 17.5 million kwh
in 1971.



V.  TY PROJECT
44.       A detailed description of the project is given in Annex 3.
Annex 4 shows the layout of the Jurun-Marinala hydroelectric scheme
and the map shows the location of the various sections of the project.
45.       The pro.ject would consist of:
(i)  A hydroelectric station of 60 I4T capacity to be constructed
about 30 miles to the south of Guatemala City. The station
would make use of the discharge of the waters of Lake Amatitlan
along the watercourse of the M4ichatoya River on which a regu-
lating hasin will 'h rnnnstriiated at Jurun. about 10 miles from
the lake. From the regulatling basin the water would be con-

48.       The estimate of costs, prepared by INiJE assisted by their
consultant.s, is based on reasonably reliable costs available from bids
received f'or the civil works and plant f'or the Jurun-Marinala Hydro
Scheme. Additional civil works for the tunnel and penstock supports,
not includled in the bids but found to be necessary after site explora-
tory work have been added at the unit prices quoted. Having regard to
the above the estimates appear realistic and the comparatively small
contingency allowance of about 7% for the Jurun-Marinala scheme should
be adequate. The estimate of the cost of engineeriLngservices for Juruxl-
M4arinala, particularly local costs, appear high, but much of this is dute
to extensive, planning, exploratory work and site testing already carri.ed
out by INDE.
49.       For the construction of the transmission line costs are basecl
on estimated quantities to which unit prices have been applied.  The unit
prices are based on the cost of simnLar work in neighboring El Salvador
and Hondiuas, with suitable adjustments to allow for wages and benefits
applicable in Guatemala0  The estimated cost of the gas turbine plant at
Escuintla has been based on the cost of a gas turbine plant of similar
capacity installed at Escuintla towards the end of 1965, while the cost
of the diesel plant at Puerto Matias de Galvez has been based on quota'-
tions received by INDE.
S0.       The proposed loan covers the estimated foreign exchanze re-
quirements of the project amounting to US$15.0 million equivalent. Pro-
curement of materials and eauinment covered by the proposed loan would
be on the basis of international competitive bidding.

Engine2ErnC and Supervision of Construction
51.       The construction of the project would be undertaken by INDE
who would employ contractors in addition to its own labor forces.
52.       A firm of Swiss consulting engineers, Electro-Watt of Zurich,
has been retained by INDE to assist it with the engineerinR supervision.,
Electro-Watt has a:Lso been responsible for the preparation of detailed
designs and construction plans. specifications and bidding documents for
the Jurun-lqLrinala scheme, and is assisting INDE with the analysis of bids
received.
53.       Snecifications and bidding documentation for the gas turbine
unit at Escuintla and for the diesel plant at Puerto Matias de Galvez
have been nrenared by IT:%DE and are satis.factory to the Bank-

Construction Schedule
55.       The first unit of Jurun*-Marinala is planned to be comnissioned
in July 1969, followed at three-nonth intervals by the second and third
units. The construction schedule, wich is based on a detailed construc-
tion program prepared byhr ILTDI c silan+ CZ anvd takes tn.to acco 1 t com-
pletion dates for civil construction and delivery dates for piant, available
in the bid.s submitted, is reasonable and should be achie-nTrA

58.       A shortfall in generating capacity is likely to occur towards
the end of 1968 and dur.ig the first half of 1969.  ivDE has been con-
sidering the action that can be taken to meet this shortfall and is
presently discussing wibh its consultants tha possibility of advancirng
the commissioning of the first unit of the second stage power development.
Problems Associated with Water Diversion at Jurun
59.       The effect of the diversion of the waters of the Michatoya
River at Jurun has been investigated by the consulting engineers.
This mainl-y concerns the reduction in output of the existing San Luis
and El Salto hydro plants, the continiued availability of water to users

txi±s is tentative, it has been adopted for the purposes of this reporu.
Tentative agreement has been reached with regard to the purchase price of
the land bu.t EEG has stipulated that the sale is to be contingent upon
agreement being reached on compensation for its water rights. Since there
may be delay in reaching final agreement and therefore in the execution of
the project, the Bank will be satisfied if, as a condition for the signing
of the loan, MIME has obtained the right of access to commence construc-
tion together with an agreement outlining the basis of compensation, with
a final settlement to be reached before waters are diverted, which is
expected tc be about the middle of 1969.
61.       A site investigation was carried out by the mission and it was
concluded that no serious problems wouLLd arise for the downstream water
users after the diversion of the Michatoya River at Jurun.
62.       Certain compensation may become payable to some of the tenants
around Lake Amatitlan but it is unlikely to be heavy.
Possible Alternatives to the Jurun--Marinala Scheme
63.       During the last few years studies have been made by a number of
engineering consulting firms to determLine! the most suitable size and
location of the hydroelectric generating plants necessary to meet the
growing power requirements of Guatemala.   The Jurun-Marinala Droject was
recommended by the Harza Engineering Company in 1955.   Electro-Watt carried
out a feasibility study for the proiect in 196L. Other nossible alterna-
tive hydro projects of about the same size and cost as Jurun-Marinala were
the El Canada project, recommended for nrioritv construction bv Acres
International Limited in 1962, and the Michatoya project. A further alter-
native to the Jurun-Marinala project would be a thermal nower station located
in the area of Lake Amatitlan. These various alternatives are discussed
in the following paragraphs anr it. is eonluirei that it wouild be most.
desirable to proceed with the Jurun-Marinala project.



- 13 -
640      'nTe El Canada hydroelectric scheme would be constructed in the
westerni Region downstream of the existing Santa Mliaria hydro plant and
would utilize the waters of the Samala River. This scheme was recommended
for priority construction in the U.N. Special Fund Study carried out by
Acres International Limited in 1961-62.   ENDE's consultants have studied
this project and have arrived at the conclusion that the costs of con-
struction and operation would be of' the same order as Jurun-Marinala.
The disadvantages of5 the scheme would be -that it would be necessary to
construct a high voLtage tranlsbmission line, approximately 100 miles long,
to convey thle power to the load center, Guatemala City; it would prejudice
the future development of Lake Atitlan into which the waters of the Samala
River could be diverted, and an additional six months would be required
to prepare specifications and bidding documents.   INDE has shown a definite
preference for the Jurun-Marinala scheme and taking into account the advan-
tages and disadvantages of the two schemes, their preference is reasonab:Le.
65.       The Michatoya hydroelectric scheme would develop the waters of
the Michato;ya River within its own watercourse instead of diverting them
at Jurun. This wouLd have the advantage that the downstream hydro plants
at San Luis and El Salto would continue to operate as at the present time.
The chief disadvantage of the scheme would be that it would not be able to
utilize an additional head of 300 feet available to Jurun-Iarinala, with a
consequent reduction in generating capacity. INDE's consultants have
studied this alternative and consicler that although the time required for
construction and cost ner installed kw would be of the same order for both
schemes, the cost of producing energy would be less for Jurun-Marinala.
66.       The combined capacity of the Michatoya development and the
ixist.ins hvdirn nlant..s wnill nmouint. tn At MA, cnnnahl e. of onprntin., at an
annual plant factor of about 50% provided that additional expenditure was
incurred on- -he nn-tr.-mtlon of a regulating pond uipstre a mn of the qqn T,is

would have a net capacity of 50 MW at an annual plant factor of 35%.
67.       It can be seen, therefore, that of the several other hydro-
electric sch,,es studied, none offers a tec.    l 1a -feas^besolutioni +o
providing increased power supply for INDE's markets.   The other alternative

69.       Two alternative development plans to equally-well serve INDE's
market requirements until 1971 (the time at which the proposed Project
would be fully utilized) were devised: one based upon the immediate
initiation of the Project; and, the other based upon sequential construction
of new thermal capacity. The total costs to construct and operate each
alternative over a 50-year period (the assumed economic life of the Project)
were then compared on a present value. i.e. discounted cash flow, basis.
It was found that for costs of capital of' 10% per annum or less, the Project-
based alternative renresents the more economic choice.
70.      1Wfhen comriared with the nossible alternatives, the construction of
the Jurun-Marinala Hydroelectric Schemxe is therefore technically and
economic ally illStif'ied.



Vi.  FINANCIAL ASPECMs
Tariffs
71.       Apart from a formal and now out-dated tariff structure, which
discourages load growth, and which was sanctioned by the Government in
1947, the principles of a tariff policy have never been developed in
Guatemala. Nor have the tariffs charged by utilities been subject to an
effective control by a regulatory agency. In IINE's two isolated systems
the Government has in the past granted tariff privileges which include
the supply of free energy to several towns. In the central area EEG's
concession contract allows this private company to set its own rates.
72.       When INDE was organized, regulatory functions were included in
its charter but so far a lack of a defined program and competent and
qualified personnel have prevented INDE from performing these functions.
The Government and INDE have agreed that the nucleus of a regulatory
agency will now be established within INDE although it was realized that
it may not 'be appropriate for INDE to combine indefinitely the function
of a tariff regulatory body with the generation and supply of bulk power.
However, in view of the lack of any feasible alternative, INDE will have
to fulfill this role initially.
73.       INDE recognizes that once it becomes the major supplier of bulk
power the regulatory activities are to be divorced from INDE and carried
out bv an indenendent agencv.  As a condition of signing of the proposed
loan, INDE will be required to make arrangements, acceptable to the Bank,
for the serviees of a suitahly qualified exnert to organize the agencv
and train the necessary personnel.   The Government and INDE have agreed
to the formntion of a regurlatory agenrcy to estabish anti regulate future
tariffs in Guatemala.
7Lh.      One of the tasks which has been undertaken is the negotiation
of sl+be taiff  fo  thess'  ofIIin's  owe  to ERG.  ITME _-. EEG

EEG shall pay fuel costs. The revenue projections for IMDE's Central
System showan in Annex 5 have been prepared using -his proposed tariff.
INDE's average revenue per kwh will be governed by the number of hours of
use of the capacity (kw) purchased; as fuller utilization of such capacl.ty-
purchased is realized the average per kwh will decline. The minimum
average per kwn woulid not however be 'Less than 1.31 centavos. It is expected
that under such arrangements EEG, on its part, will be able to earn a
reasonable rate of return on its investment, without the possible need for
an increase in its tariffs to its consumers.
78.       EEG has during the past five years realized a rate of return on
its average net fixed plant in operat:ion kless plant financed by customers'

In 1964 the company made a tariff reduction in view of its increasing rate
of return and large accumulated earni:ngs.
79.       The company has been able to finance most of its capital exspansion
from its oaim internal cash generation and also has been able to declare
cash dividends on am average of about 12% on its common stock and 7% and 8%
on its preferred stock during the period 1961-65. About 84% of earned
surplus has been allocated to dividends during this period as follows:

80.       The company's debt equity ratio in 1961 was 15/85 which was
reduced to a ratio of 13/87 by the end of 1965 (Debt 03.3 million, Equitv
Q22.6 million).  Its long-term debt iS primarily made up of about Q2.9
million of 6% mortgage bonds due and payable in Anril 1971.   This is about
90% of its long-term debt outstanding..  Other borrowings have recently been

operation INDE's rate of return on its total system would exceed 9%.
At this level internal cash generatio;n would enable INDE to finance a
reasonable portion of its future construction. INDE and the Government
have also agreed that beginning in 1971 its tariffs will be maintained
at levels which will enable it to earn at least 9% on its average net
fixed assets in operation for its total system after allowing for adequate
maintenance and straight line depreciation.
Financial Position
84.       I[NDE does not follow normal public utility accounting procedu.res.
Its records and statements are maintained in a manner related to "fund
accounting" whereby all charges are applied against gross income irrespective
of whether or not the charge is an operating expense or a capital expendii-
ture. No depreciation has been charged except for office, transportation
* It is estimated that the annual investment in transmission and distri.-
bution will average between Ql.5' million and Q2 million.

and other miscellaneous equipment. HEnce INDE's net fixed assets are
recorved at original costs pl-us major renailitation costs. INIME'  accounlub
have not been audited in the past.
85.       T'he firm of management consultants which would assist INDE in
reorganizing and coordinating its activities (paragraph 24) should have
to advise INDE on changes necessary to set up its accounts in accordance
with accepted commercial accounting practices. As a condition of tne
proposed loan, INDE: has agreed to engage an independent auditing firm,
acceptable to the Eank, to make annual audits of its books and to certify
its annual statements.
86.       The financial statements of INDE have been substantially rearranged
for the purposes of this report.  INDE's revised balance sheets for 1961-65
are shown in Annex 6. Adjustments include the calculation of a depreciation
reserve and the capitalization of exp:Loration and planning costs which had
been partly charged against operating income. Corresponding adjustments
were made in equity.
87.       On this basis, INDE's posit-Lon as of December 31, 1965 would
have been as follows:
Thousands of                           Thousands of

88.       The table shows that INDE's caDitalization consisted mainly of
equity contributions received from the Government. These contributions
were macie in the form of fixed assets or as cash contributions for canital
construction. The Government obtains the necessary funds from the Bank
of GuatemaIla for such cash contributions by issuing 15-vear bonds at an
annual interest rate of 3%. Although the proceeds of the bond issues have
been eArmnrked fnr specific power projects, INME does not assume any
responsibility for the debt service of these issues. Before bonds may be

issued, INDEts technical renorts on the proposed nrolect have to be
approved by certain government departments and the National Planning
Counci_. The nrojects included in th npronosed eXpansion program have
already been approved.  As of December 31, 1965, INDE has received
ahniit. 0Q97 miIllion of the Q15 mJIIJ-,n o%f bhonds  Ahic4 were anproved and
are being purchased by the Central Bank.
89.       In the latter part of i96Lh, INDE incurred its first long-tern
debt.  It Obtanred a 20yea   loan at4 anv 47ir.te  r   of 6% from the
Inter-American Development Bank in the amount of US$3.15 million to

of this report (paragraph 86).  Although INDE was officially created in
June 1959, its operations started onL SeptemDer 30, 196i when the Govern-
ment transferred two existing small systems and other assets to its
ownership.  INDE:s Santa Yiaria system (previously a state-owned entity)
has operated at a profit in spite of the fact that government establish-
ments receive a 50% discount and the municipality of Quezaltenango, which
accounts for 42% of the total energy sales, pays only a fraction of cost
for its power consumption.  INDME!s Rio Hondo system has operated at a
deficit during 1962-6h because most of the towns served have been receiving
free energy (paragraph 82).  In 1965 gross revenues for the system
increased quite substantially because an amount of Q161,0O0 was includled
as compensation to be received for free energy which was delivered to the
municipality of Zacapa during the period from June 1963 through December
31, 1965. A contract between IIJDE and Zacapa was completed in October
1965 covering the arrangerients f or such compensation.  The retroactive
compensation distorts INDE's actual performance for this year.
91        INDE's central office overhead, which covers the planning,
programing and execution of the country's power and irrigation expans:ion
program, cannot be financed from the operating revenues of the two isolated
systems and therefore the Government has made yearly appropriations from
its treasury to cover these central office expenses. It is expected that
this practice of annual appropriations to cover such expenses will no
longer be necessary after 1966 as a result of INDEfs expanded operations.
Proposed Financing Plan
92        A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the 5 years
through 1971 is shown in Annex 7. During the 4 years ending December 31,1970
the construction period of the Jurum-Narinala project, INDEfs requirements
are expected to aggregate Q50.8 million, of which about Q30.4 million would
be capital expenditures on the first stage of the program including



- 20 .
the Bank project; Q1]7.2 million would be initial expenditures on the
second stage of the program, to be starteci in 1967; Q2.9 million would be
for interest during construction, and QO.3 million for additions to working
capital. Details of tnese requirements, and of the sources from which
they are expected tc) be met, are shown in the following table:

will begin in 1969 and end nine years lazr, in 1977, on the date of final
termination of EEG's existing concession contract. As outlined in

The proposed Bank loan of uSp15.U Mion equivalent wu .,Up
sent 29.5% of the requirements during the construction period of the project.
It is assumed to hrave a term of 25 years, including a four-year grace pei -od
and an interest rate of 6%. This loan is about 50% of the total cost of
the wnole project.  An estimated foreign loan of $19.8 million equivalent is
assumed to be obtained late in 1967 under terms similar to those of the
proposed Bank loan, to finance the foreign costs of the second stage of the
proposed program. It is expected that $14.2 million equivalent will be
drawn down during 1967-70, or about 28.0% of the requirements of the construc-
tion period of the project.
96.       The Government has agreed to contribute the balance of the fun(ds
required to complete the project. These contributions which will come
from appropriations or by the sale of additional bonds to the Central Bank
(see paragr;aph 84) are expected to total about Q7.3 million, or 14.4% of the
period's requirements.  Based on the present estimates of future borrowings
and internal cash gesneration, govermment contributions would no longer be
needed after 1969.  The guarantee agreement includes a provision that all
necessary funds wil:l be provided to complete the project.
97.       In view of the limited resources available, INDE has agreed that,
without the Bank's prior approval during the construction period through
December 31, 1971 it will not acquire facilities aggregating more than
Q500,000 in any consecutive 12-month period nor carry out any expansion
not contemplated in the proposed program.
Estimated Future Earnings
98.       INDE's estimated income statements for the six-year period
1966-71 are shown in Annex 5. The income statements reflect future
earnings for each of the systems as follows:
(a)  Because of the elimination of tariff privileges the rate of
return in the Santa Maria system is expected to rise from
9.3% in 1965 to 12.7% in 1966. The El Porvenir hydro plant,
which is exnected to be commissioned late in 1967. will cause
an increase in expenses and in the asset base. Accordingly,
the rate of return for that year would dron to 8.2%    There-
after it :is expected that the growing volume of energy sales
will caulse a aradua1 rise in. the rate of return to 10,6% in 19?71
(b)  The Rio H-ondo sr.stem and the Puerto Matias arvea a- shoi-^m as
one system. The elimination. of tariff privileges will cause
the estimated high rates of return in 1966 and 1967 .  roxTever
in 1968 addition of the first Puerto Hatias diesel unit together



- 22 -
with other related new facilities will cause an increase in
the asset base thereby reducing the rate of return to a more
normal level of 12.2%. The! addition of the second unit in
1969 will also affect the return in the same manner but to a
lesser degree. The increases in sales in 1970-71 period,
however, are expected to result in a rate of return of 9.5%.
(c)  Annex 2 shows the forecast demands and energy of INDE's Central
.SvstpTn which are expected to he pumrchased by EEf- The timing
of INDE's new facilities coming in commercial operation is a
critical factor regarding i.ts ability of realiznga n ln  return
on such facilities. Based on the assumptions used in Annex 2
ITDE is expected to reaLize a rate of retlon on the average
net costs of its facilities of between 10% and 10.9% during
1Q67-71  TIn 1966 the retu    s e     ted to be orlyr 8% due to
the fact, that the Los EscliLvos plant will be in operation
f or o.r ry p-nt of thi,-Js year.
99.    not     +eA-. A---- e5, the combi.ned -a.o I.Es tJesLT M  o +nal
system beginning in 1966 will start to earn a net operating income after
central office overhead.   The rate of return is expected to rise gra-
dually from 7.8% in 1966 to 10.1% in 197'1.  Net operating income is

ex    e  *,o cover total interest 3.87 times in 1966, duclining to 1. 42
times in 1.968 and rising to 2.14 times in 1971.
Future Financial Position
100.      Annex 6 shows forecast 'balance sheets for the six-year periodc
under revi.ew.  Total fixed assets are expected to increase from Qll.3
million irn 1965 to Q68.3 million by the end of 1971.  The proportion of
debt of total capitalization will rise from 10% in 1965 to 56% in 1971.
101.      During negotiations agreement was reached on a covenant limiting
incurrence! of debt, after December 31., 1971 (see paragraph 97). It is
proposed that INDE would not borrow or incur any debt other than in the
normal course of business without the previous permission of the Bank,
unless actual inteernal cash generation for a recent 12-month period covers
at least 1.h times the future maximum debt service requirements on
existing and proposed debt.   Under thle present estimates this test would
be met beginning in 1972, when revenues are derived from the facilities
included in the present program of expansion.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
102.      INDE has become responsible for future power development in
Guatemala.  Its proposed expansion program consisting of the provision
of additional gene.rating capacity, associated substations and high
voltage transmission lines, is essential to meet the expected demand
for power in the Central Region and :in the isolated area of Puerto
Matias de Galvez. The proposed installations would be the most practical
and econoimical means of meeting the demands.

Detailed Description of the Project
The project would comprise:
1. A hydroelectric power station, of 60,000 kw capacity, designed
to operate at an annual plant factor of about 35%.
2. A 138 kv transmission line conrnecting the power station to the!
princinal load center. Guatemala Citv.
3. h 1_OOo kw gas tmrhine generator at. Escuint7a.
h1. A diesel installation of 5jO00 kw capacity at. Puerto Matias
de Galvez.
1.    Jurun-Marinala Hydroelectric Scheme
The Jurun-Marinala scheme is designed to utilize the regulated
discharge of +he wlate+vS -f T ile. Avm+- +- nT ,,-Tl which f-IrT.T ml ron +-he Mcz.a+-oai In+n
River to an intake at Jurun about 10 miles from the lake. The head available

(5,000 kw) and El Salto (5,500 kw).
A description of the various parts of the scheme and their prin-
cipal features is given below:
(i)   Lake Amatitlan Regulation Weir
At the outlet from the lake a new weir will be constructed which
would allow a further drawdown of the level of the lake than is at present
possible. This would result in a maximum regulated range of 2.20 meter,3
with a corresponding usable storage volume of 1,050 million cubic feet.
This volume of pondage would be required only during the course of an
exceptionally dry year which, from the records available, occurs about once
in 30 years. In a mean hydrological year the variation of the level of the
lake will not exceed 1.50 meters which corresponds to the present variation.
The rate of discharge would be remotely controlled by either a control cen-
ter in Guatemala or from the power station. The weir is capable of spiLling
2,600 cubic feet per second corresponding to maximum flood conditions.

(ii) Jurun Intake
The intake system will consist of an earth danm, wit!> mass concrete
spillway, across the Michatoya River at Jurun, an intalc dime ;sioned for a
maxinum flow of 400 cubic feet per second, a sandtrap provided with an auto-
matic flushing system, and a regulation basin with a storage capacity of
about 4 million cubic feet. The crest elevation of the dam is such as to
enable 500,000 cubic feet of water to be stored in the river between Jurun
and Lake Amatitlan.
(iii) Tunnel
The tunnel intake would be located at the end of the regulation
basin and would be provided with a trashrack and intake gate. From the
intake the 12.300 foot long concrete lined tunnel follows along and under
the mountain crest. The lining thickness would vary according to the rock
qualitv and overburden thickness. Sore sections of the tunnel would be in
open cut and would 'be steel lined.
(iv) Penstock
The penstock would have a tctal length of 9,300 feet and a maximum
dianmeter of 5 fte 6 ins. It Twould be of werlded stee crnstic.ti^ Afl pporte1
on rocking supports and fixed anchor blocks.

sultants and also the results of exmloratorv drilling. previously carried
out by EEG, have been made availabLe to INDE. Complementary deep drilling
and shaft exploration are presently being carried out along the tunnel route
and at the proposed. locations of the penstock supports.
The findings of these investigations indicate that problems may
arise diup tc th  spismin nactivity of the nren and ITTMtDs onnsultants made
suitable allowances in the design of all structures.
2.   138 kv Transmission Line
Ihe proposed transmission line would interconnect the proposed.
thermna-l (gas turne) sta tniJon _+ at scutla r+ i.Ti+h +h1g _Tjii"i1n_Mniinnal: nmrpr
station to convey their output to Guatemala City.
Ihe line about 30 miles long, would operate at a nominal voltage
o   - 138   --'I Ad wo A'.d be dobecrut, 4three -1s,-  .-.o4te onstel  -tvwrs
Later the line would be extended westward from Escuintla in order to prcvide
ar, ir,ter-zone l-i}-il bL-et-Ween. the Ct'e nt ra andeser Reios -h construction-
of this link would not form part of this project9
3.   Escuintla Gas Turbine Installation
I't is proposed to augment the capacity of the existing 12,500 kw
thIer1iLgaj ( u.rb)A  staTion at Escuintia Dy the adoition ofE a gas LUUrL-41e
generating unit of 15,000 kw nominal capacity.
She turbine would operate oni diesel oil at a speed of 3600 r.p.mo
and would be compleLTe with air inleti and exhaust ductiing, a silencer oI the
industrial type, and generator and oi:L cooling equipment. The unit would be
of the packaged type housed in a steel structure and would be supplied cuoml-
plete with all accessories required for normal operation and maintenance,
including substation equipment ana associated control gearo  In adLditior, a
mobile crane of 15 tons capacity and a separate light building in which over-
hauls woul(d be carrled out would also be provided.
4.   Puerto Matias de Galvez - Diesel Installation
The proposed diesel plant would have an initial output of 2,500 kKW
and would consist of two package type units each of 1,250 kw capacity com-
plete with all necessary accessories and controls. The diesel engines would
be of the slow speed type and would use B3unker 'IC" fuel. It is estimate:d
that an extension to this installation w.ill be required early in 1969 and
the projectl allows for an additional 2,500 kw of capacity to be installed
about that time, the precise date being determined by the rate at which the
load grows.
