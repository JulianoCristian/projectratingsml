Section 4.01. (a) It is the policy of the Bank, in making loans to, or with

priority over its loans in the allocation, realization or distribution of foreign
exchange held under the control or for the benefit of such member. To that end,

and interest and other charges on, the Loan, and the Borrower, in creating or
permitting the creation of such lien, shall make express provision to that effect;
provided, however, that, if for any constitutional or other legal reason such
provision cannot be made with respect to any lien created on assets of any of

cost to the Bank secure the principal of, and interest and other charges on, the
Loan by an equivalent lien on other public assets satisfactory to the Bank.
(b)   The foregoing undertaking shall not apply to: (i) any lien created on
property, at the time of purchase thereof, solely as security for payment of the
purchase price of such property; and (ii) any lien arising in the ordinary course

its date.
(c)   As used in this Section, the term "public assets" means assets of the
Borrower, of any political or administrative subdivision thereof and of any entity
owned or controlled by, or operating for the account or benefit of, the Borrower
or any such subdivision, including gold and other foreign exchange assets held by
any institution performing the functions of a central bank or exchange stabilization
fund, or similar functions, for the Borrower.
Section 4.02.. The Borrower shall maintain or cause to be maintained records

or supplement the laws and regulations referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.

integral planning for the transport sector of the Borrower with, inter alia, the
following functions: (i) to assess present and future transport needs of the Borrower;
(ii) to identify transport projects and to prepare a ten-year program of investment
priorities on the basis of sound economic criteria; and (iii) to formulate a national
transport policy; and
(b)   provide such office, promptly as needed, with such qualified and
experienced supporting staff, facilities, funds and other resources as shall be required

2.   For the purposes of this Schedule:
(a)   the term  "foreign expenditures" means expenditures for goods or
services supplied from, the territory, and in the currency, of any country other
than the Borrower; and

(b)   the term "local expenditures" means expenditures in the currency of
the Borrower, and for goods or services supplied from the territory of the Borrower.
3.   The disbursement percentage for local expenditures has been calculated in
compliance with the policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the Loan shall be
disbursed on account of payments for taxes levied by, or in the territory of, the
Borrower on goods or services, or on the importation, manufacture, procurement
or supply thereof; to that end, if any event occurs which shall affect the amount
of any such taxes included in the cost of any item to be financed out of the

of the Loan then allocated to any Category will be insufficient to finance all
expenditures in that Category, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower reallocate
to such Category to the extent required to meet such estimated shortfall proceeds
of the Loan which are then allocated to another Category and which in the opinion
of the Bank are not needed to meet other expenditures.
6.    If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the procurement of any
item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures set forth or referred to
in this Agreement, no expenditures for such item shall be financed out of the
proceeds of the Loan and the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting
any other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement, by
notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the Loan as in the Bank's reasonable
opinion, represents the amount of such expenditures which would otherwise have
been eligible for financing out of the proceeds of the Loan.

SCHEDULE 4
Procurement
A.    General Procedures
1.    Except as provided in Part A.3 hereof, contracts shall be let under procedures
consistent with those set forth in the "Guidelines for Procurement under World
Bank Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in April 1972, as revised
in October 1972 (hereinafter called the Guidelines), on the basis of international
competitive bidding.
2.    (i)         Bidders for the works included in Part A of the Project shall
be prequalified as described in part 2.2 of the Guidelines.
(ii)        For    bidding   purposes,   construction   work    for   the
Encarnaci6n-Hohenau-Pirapo road shall be divided into two
sections. The invitations to bid for such work shall, inter alia,
specify that (A) all bids will be opened simultaneously and
awarded simultaneously; (B) awards shall be made on the basis
of the lowest evaluated bid or combination of bids; and (C)
the Borrower will have the option of awarding to one contractor
a single contract in respect of the two sections or separate
contracts to different contractors in respect of each section. For
bidding   purposes,    the   construction   work    for   the
Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia road shall be considered as
a single section. A period of at least 60 days shall be allowed
for the submission of bids.
3.    Spare parts under Part B.1(a) of the Project shall be procured through
negotiated purchase after solicitation of quotations from suppliers. Contracts for
such spare parts shall not exceed in each case the equivalent of $50,000.
B.    Review of Procurement Decisions by Bank
1.    Review of prequalification. The Borrower shall, before qualification is invited,
inform the Bank in detail of the procedure to be followed and shall introduce
such modifications in said procedure as the Bank shall reasonably request. The
list of prequalified bidders, together with a statement of their qualifications and
of the reasons for the exclusion of any applicant for prequalification shall be
furnished by the Borrower to the Bank for its comments before the applicants
are notified, and the Borrower shall make such additions to, deletions from, or
modifications in, the said list as the Bank shall reasonably request.

2.    Review of invitation to bid and of proposed awards and final contracts for
civil works and tires and batteries:
(a)   Before bids are invited, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, for
its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and the specifications and other
bidding documents, together with a description of the advertising procedures to
be followed for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said
documents or procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any further
modification to the bidding documents shall require the Bank's concurrence before
it is issued to the prospective bidders.
(b)   Promptly after the bids have been received, the Borrower shall inform
the Bank of the names of the bidders and the respective amounts of the bids.
(c)   After bids have been received and evaluated, the Borrower shall, before
a final decision on the award is made, inform the Bank of the name of the bidder
to which it intends to award the contract and the reasons for the intended award
and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient time for its review, a detailed report
on the evaluation and comparison of the bids received, together with the
recommendation for award and such other information as the Bank shall reasonably
request. The Bank shall, if it determines that the intended award would be
inconsistent with the Guidelines or this Schedule, promptly inform the Borrower
and state the reasons for such determination.
(d)   The terms and conditions of the contract shall not, without the Bank's
concurrence, materially differ from those on which bids were asked or
prequalification invited.
(e)   Two conformed copies of the contract shall be furnished to the Bank
promptly after its execution and prior to the submission to the Bank of the first
application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of such
contract.
3.    With respect to each contract to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Loan and not governed by the preceding paragraph, the Borrower shall furnish
to the Bank promptly after its execution and prior to the submission to the Bank
of the first application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect
of such contract, two conformed copies of such contract, and such information
as the Bank shall reasonably request. The Bank shall, if it determines that the
award of the contract was not consistent with this Schedule, promptly inform
the Borrower and state the reasons for such determination.
