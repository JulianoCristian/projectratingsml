The credit grant will help finance\n            approximately 500 small scale, community implemented and\n            maintained irrigation schemes in the provinces most affected\n            by the recent food price increases. This program document\n            seeks financing from the Food Policy Crisis Response (FPCPR)\n            Trust Fund for the Second National Solidarity Program being\n            supported by International Development Association (IDA).\n            One of the priorities of the Food Price Crisis Response\n            (FPCR) resources is to reduce the medium term impacts of the\n            food crisis, and irrigation rehabilitation is an effective\n            way of achieving this. Afghanistan currently imports about\n            20-30 percent of its requirements in a normal year, and can\n            reach 80-90 percent food self-sufficiency in a\n            bumper-harvest year. Therefore, supporting enhancement of\n            local production of wheat will help to ameliorate shortages\n            and help achieve self-sufficiency in normal years.\n            Considering that nearly 70 percent of Afghanistan wheat\n            production comes from irrigated lands where the yields are 2\n            to 4 time higher than rain-fed areas, wheat productivity\n            enhancement program must focus on irrigation improvement."}, "docdt": "2008-07-21T00:00:00Z"}
