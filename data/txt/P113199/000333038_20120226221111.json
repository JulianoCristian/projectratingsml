"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Food Crisis Response\n            Project for Afghanistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The project\n            included three components: i) block grants disbursements\n            (US$7 million, 87.5 percent) would go towards building or\n            rehabilitating small-scale irrigation projects in the most\n            vulnerable provinces; ii) community facilitation and\n            capacity building (US$600,000, 7.5 percent of total grant\n            funding) would finance Facilitating Partner (FP) costs,\n            including goods, services, and operations costs of NSP FPs;\n            and iii) implementation and management support (US$400,000,\n            5 percent of total grant costs), included both NSP II\n            (National Solidarity Program) Management Support Consultant\n            (MSC) and Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development\n            (MRRD) management costs; and comprised incremental expenses\n            incurred in project implementation and management. This\n            included costs of services and operational expenses at the\n            central, regional, and provincial levels. Some lessons\n            learned included: the NSP experience illustrates the vital\n            importance of strong and sustained commitment and vision on\n            the part of key high level Government officials. NSP also\n            illustrates how a national program reaching rural\n            populations in remote parts of the country can help enhance\n            the legitimacy of the government, as findings of the first\n            follow up survey highlight this lesson. Decentralized task\n            teams are essential especially in post-conflict/fragile\n            state situations where continuous and intensive\n            implementation assistance/supervision is needed. It\n            facilitates greater support to communities, expedites\n            sub-project preparation to completion cycle and strengthens\n            project results monitoring on the ground."}, "docdt": "2011-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
