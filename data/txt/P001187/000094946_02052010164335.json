Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory, despite\n            the drop in supervision intensity during the latter years of\n            project execution, when the focus was on attempts to use\n            unspent balances of project resources. On the whole,\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Six lessons were\n            learned from this project: On a strategic level, a project\n            seeking to invest in techncial capacity needs to ensure that\n            government staff skills, education, management systems and\n            equipment are underpinned by institutional arrangements\n            capable of creating incentives and rules to effectively\n            harness the fruits of such investments. Second the\n            traditional multi-component technical assistance projects\n            with multiple executing agencies addressing a core\n            government function should include only those components\n            that are closely interdependent. Third an unmanageable\n            component of a third should be dropped and freed up\n            resources shifted to components that are implementing well.\n            Fourth the implications of the technical complexity of\n            computerized information systems should not be\n            underestimated. Fifth excessive staff turnover compromised\n            the continuity and purposefulness of project execution.\n            Sixth, proper planning and arrangements should be made to\n            ensure that counterparts are made available to work\n            alongside external consultants, and that they are given\n            incentives to stay committed for the duration of the projec"}, "docdt": "2002-04-25T00:00:00Z"}
