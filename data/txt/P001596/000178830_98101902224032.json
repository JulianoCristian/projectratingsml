  Viphya plateau. A prefeasibility study, financed by UNDP and\n            executed by IBRD, concluded that the establishment of a\n            pulpmill at Chinteche would be the most economical\n            alternative. More detailed studies on cost and engineering\n            of various aspects of the scheme are, however, required. In\n            addition, technical assistance will be required to enable\n            Malawi to identify and secure financial, technical, and\n            commercial partners to carry out the scheme. A preparation\n            program has been drawn up jointly between the Government,\n            UNDP, FAO, the United Kingdom and IDA, who would participate\n            in financing and executing this program."}, "docdt": "1974-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
