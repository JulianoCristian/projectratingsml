widening\n            and deepening of creeks, where necessary, to facilitate\n            water distribution; (c) installation of 100 primary pumps to\n            raise water from the perennial channels to the creek storage\n            ponds; (d) installation of 2,500 secondary pumps or other\n            devices to raise water to farmers' fields from\n            perennial rivers and from the creek storage ponds; (e)\n            provision of storage and distribution facilities for fuel\n            and fertilizers; (f) provision of equipment and spares for\n            workshops which
