                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project activities are making good overall progress. Since the last ISR, the Government countersigned a Level 2 restructuring in February 2013. As result of the restructuring, an
                         additional 694 schools that previously had not received any equipment and learning materials under the project are on target to receive them by December 2013. That will bring the
                         total number of schools supported by the project from 1,501 to 2,195.

                         The second round of assessments for grade 4 students has been completed. Following the pilot of the assessment instruments in December 2012, the project team conducted the
                         full second round assessment of 11,200 grade 4 students in 300 schools from April 30 to May 15, 2013. The assessment was held in both project supported and non-project schools.
                         The analysis on student assessment will be available in October 2013.
