                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project is making good overall progress towards achieving its goals by the Project closing in March 2014.

                         (1) Selected general secondary education schools and pre-schools in rural areas have been successfully supported through targeted interventions. Successful interventions were

                         aimed at (i) enhancing schoolsâ€™ learning environment by provision of teaching and learning materials (TLMs) in 2,195 schools ; (ii) improving the quality of teaching through
                         upgrading teacher training programs and developing Schools Based Teacher Training (SBTT) model ; (iii) greater community engagement in the school development through
                         supporting School Boards and provision of small grants.

                         (2) The project contributed to improving education system monitoring through building assessment capacity in the country. Two rounds of student assessments of Grade 4 were
                         successfully carried out.

                         (3) The education financing system has been improved (using the Banks technical advice in the initial stages) through designing of a per capita based financing of the general
                         education schools (which the government implemented and monitored on its own across the entire country without using Bank financing ).
