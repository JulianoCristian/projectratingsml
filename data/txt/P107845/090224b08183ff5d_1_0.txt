                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project activities are making good progress overall, and improved implementation since the last ISR has been accompanied by an increase in disbursements from 44% to 50% of
                         credit value, significantly reducing the disbursement lag. In addition, the government has now formally submitted the reallocation request for 9.53 m USD which is being processed as
                         a Level 2 restructuring.

                         The Project supports five key activities, namely, procurement and use of Teaching and Learning Materials (TLMs), School Based Teacher Training (SBTT), Competitive School
                         Grants, assessment of Per-capita Financing for Schools, and Student Assessments. All activities have seen a marked improvement in implementation. In particular the preparatory
                         activities follow-on student assessment for grade 4 are now at an advanced stage and will require close supervision by the Bank during implementation.
