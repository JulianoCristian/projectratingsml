Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The overall objective of the program and each of the phases is to continue supporting GoU's efforts to
improve effectiveness of teaching and learning through (1) targeted interventions in selected general
secondary education schools and preschools in rural poor areas; (2) development of institutional capacity to
assess student learning; and (3) adoption of predictable and transparent school budgets in selected oblasts.

     BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT SECOND PHASE (CREDIT NO. 4598-UZ)
                      RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      The Uzbekistan’s Basic Education Project Phase II (BEP 2) is financed by an
International Development Association (IDA) credit in the amount of US$ 28 million
equivalent. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to continue supporting the
Government of Uzbekistan’s (GoU) efforts to improve the effectiveness of teaching and
learning through: (i) targeted interventions in selected general secondary education
schools and preschools in poor, rural areas; (ii) development of institutional capacity to
assess student learning; and (iii) adoption of predictable and transparent school budgets in
selected oblasts.

2.     This Restructuring Paper seeks management approval to a request from the GoU
dated February 28, 2014 to restructure the BEP 2 to cancel IDA financing in the amount
of US$ 2.5 million equivalent since the project is due to close by March 31, 2014 and this
financing is no longer needed for project activities.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      The BEP 2 was approved by the Board on June 23, 2009 in the amount of US$ 28
million equivalent, and it became effective on March 11, 2010. Project implementation
started slowly with disbursement of only 12.4% of credit value in 2011 two years after
the effectiveness date. The Project was restructured in December 2012, leading to an
overall improvement in implementation; by February 2014, disbursement had reached
87.8 % of total credit amount.

4.       The Project is likely to achieve its development objectives of supporting
Governments efforts for improved teaching and learning as it has (i) successfully
provided teaching and learning materials to 2,195 schools (as against an original target
of 1,501 schools); (ii) contributed towards improving the quality of teaching through
upgrading teacher training programs and developing Schools Based Teacher Training
model (which trained 3,102 pre-school and school leaders, and 59,346 pre-school and
school teachers); (iii) encouraged greater community engagement in the school
development through supporting School Boards and provision of small grants (which
were awarded to 500 competitively selected schools); and (iv) supported capacity
development in carrying out two rounds of student assessments in Grade 4. Finally, the
education financing system has been improved (using the Banks technical advice in the
initial stages) through designing a per capita based scheme for financing of the general
education schools (which the government implemented and monitored on its own across
the entire country without using Bank financing).

5.     The Project is organized into five components:

Component 1: Providing Learning Materials and Resources for Grades 5 through 9
of General Secondary Schools (Total estimated cost US$ 29.9 million of which IDA


                                                                                           6
is US$ 22.8 million equivalent). The objective of this component is to improve the
quality of teaching and learning in project schools through effective use of learning
materials and resources acquired under the Project.

Component 2: Strengthening School-based Training for Teachers and Directors in
Preschools and General Secondary Schools (Total estimated cost US$ 1.4 million of
which IDA is US$ 1.0 million equivalent). The objective of this component is to change
teaching in project preschools and schools towards a more interactive, student-centered
approach to improve learning outcomes.

Component 3: Strengthening School Boards and Providing Competitive Grants to
Selected Schools for School Improvement (Total estimated cost US$ 2.7 million of
which IDA is US$ 2.7 million equivalent). The objective of this component is to further
increase the involvement of school boards in project schools and provide competitive
funding for school improvement.

Component 4: Improving Education Financing, Budgeting and Management (Total
estimated cost US$0.5 million of which IDA is US$0.3 million equivalent). The
objective of this component is to improve education financing, budgeting, and school
management in selected oblasts.

Component 5: Supporting Project Management and Results Management (Total
estimated cost US$ 1.5 million of which IDA is US$ 1.2 million equivalent). The
objective of this component is to support project management, implement national
standardized assessment of student learning, and evaluate project effectiveness.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

6.     An amount of US$ 2.5 million equivalent was saved after the successful
completion of the procurement processes of goods planned under the project. As such,
the Government has requested that the Bank cancel US$ 2.5 million equivalent (SDR
1,615,613.29) of the original Credit effective as of February 28, 2014, date of the
cancellation request.

The partial cancellation per category has been discussed with the client who are in full
agreement with the revised allocations. The table below shows the revised allocation of
financing proceeds.
