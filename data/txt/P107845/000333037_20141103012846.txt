1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. Uzbekistan is an upper low-income resource rich, landlocked country, strategically located in the
   heart of Central Asia. At the time of appraisal in 2009, its population was 27 million. Having
   gained independence in 1991, by 2007 the Atlas Gross National Income (GNI) per capita had
   reached an estimated US$730. Uzbekistan had a young and predominantly rural population (65
   percent). Its development strategy included a strong focus on the maintenance of basic public
   services, including education. Since the mid-1990s, Uzbekistan had devoted 5.6-9.5 percent of its
   Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to education. Until 2004, education expenditures had concentrated
   on new programs to upgrade secondary vocational education while funding shortages remained in
   general education (grades 1-9).

2. The general education sector faced constraints. Participation of the community and other
   stakeholders as a way to encourage public accountability for school policies, resource allocation, and
   school management was limited. While the MoPE monitored and openly discussed learning
   outcomes, there had been no experience with national standardized assessments. With support from
   the Bank-financed Basic Education Project (First Phase of an Adaptable Program Loan in Support of
   the Education Reform Program), the GoU took positive steps to address these issues in 2006 through
   a national standardized assessment of student learning for students in grades 4 and 8, and through
   school board activation and community participation in school decisions in selected schools,

3. The government was just completing implementation of its School Education Development Program
   (SEDP) for 2004-2009 to improve conditions of school buildings and learning resources and
   equipment in schools. Donor financing had also provided support to the SEDP, including textbooks,
   ICT, distance education, teacher training, equipment and learning materials. Teacher salaries also
   increased significantly during that period. Most schools continued, however, to need learning
   materials and resources, student-centered teacher training and other improvements to increase
   quality and reduce disparities. The government was preparing the next medium-term education
   program and planned to keep the SEDP Fund to continue development of basic education and
   increase its focus on preschools.

4. The most recent data available (2004) indicated that enrollment rates were above 99 percent.
   Learning outcomes and quality of education were a concern. Many factors hindered improvement of
   learning and quality: overloaded and outdated curricula, insufficient and outdated equipment and
   learning resources in schools, a lack of teachers’ professional competence to promote active
   engagement by students in their own learning, no incentives for schools or teachers to change the
   system or improve its outcomes, limited data for monitoring and evaluation, and limited community
   and stakeholder participation to encourage accountability.

5. Schools in rural communities, especially if remote, fared worse in most aspects than urban schools.
   For instance, only 37 percent of remote rural schools had sufficient numbers of teaching manuals as
   compared with 64 percent in urban areas. The urban/rural disparities in school and teacher
   characteristics had a disproportionate effect on low-income households, as these were more
   prevalent in rural areas.



                                                   1
6. The GoU was working to improve public finance management including introducing a Treasury
   system, performance-based budgeting, per capita financing in health and education, and a Medium
   Term Budget Framework (MTBF). In 2007 the GoU took a number of steps by Presidential decree
   to adopt a new way of financing schools, moving to begin implementation of per capita financing of
   schools in order to reduce inequities in the distribution of expenditures and increase the efficiency
   and equity of school financing. The GoU began to implement per capita financing in 2008 in
   Bukhara and Ferghana Oblasts and Tashkent City; and work was underway to extend per capita
   financing to three additional oblasts in 2009. As part of these reforms, responsibility for budget
   allocations for basic education schools was transferred from the Ministry of Public Education
   (MoPE) and its regional departments to the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and its regional departments.
   Basic education schools were declared legal entities and school directors became the primary
   administrators of budgetary funds and the Director’s fund for top-up of teacher salaries.

7. The project (entitled BEP-2) was designed to be the second phase of a two-phased Adaptable
   Program Loan (APL). The project was designed to support Uzbekistan’s education reform program,
   which aimed to make significant improvements in the school education system, including
   improvements in physical conditions of educational facilities, development of educational standards
   satisfactory to international standards, and creation of equal access and quality of education for
   children living in rural and urban areas. The first phase of the APL (BEP1) was designed to build
   capacity, while BEP-2 was designed to build upon and extend the capacity to encourage greater
   education reform.

8. The project was aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which included service
   delivery as one of its four pillars for Bank engagement with Uzbekistan. Education, especially
   support for improved quality and governance, was highlighted under this pillar. Another CAS pillar
   supported improved economic opportunities in rural areas. As project schools were in poor, rural
   areas, the project also supported this pillar.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

9. The overall objective of the APL and each of the phases was to continue supporting GoU's efforts to
   improve effectiveness of teaching and learning through (1) targeted interventions in selected general
   secondary education schools and preschools in rural poor areas; (2) development of institutional
   capacity to assess student learning; and (3) adoption of predictable and transparent school budgets in
   selected oblasts.

10. Progress towards achievement of the objective was to be measured through three key project
    outcome indicators:
    • An increase in learning outcomes in grade 4 that is greater in project schools than in non-project
       schools as measured by a new standardized assessment of learning achievement available for a
       sample of students in project and non-project schools.
    • National standardized assessments of student learning carried out periodically in grades 4 and 8
        with report analyzing and disseminating the results. 1


1
    This is the wording from the Results Framework in Annex 3. In ‘Section C. PDO and key indicators’, the word ‘periodically’ is omitted.




                                                                     2
   •     Per capita financing implemented in six oblasts with report analyzing and disseminating the
        results.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

11. The Project Development Objective was not revised. Revisions were made to outcome indicators 2
    and 3 during a level-2 restructuring (approved on December 18, 2012) subsequent to the mid-term
    review. The revisions were was as follows:
    • Outcome indicator 2: National standardized sample-based assessment of student learning carried
        out in Grade 4 with report analyzing and disseminating the results.
            o This was a corrective restructuring. Given delays in the procurement teaching and
                learning materials for Grades 5 to 9 and in the training of teachers, it was no longer
                technically relevant to attribute any changes in the results of the student assessment for
                Grade 8 to the project. Further, it had become apparent that no institutional niche within
                the MoPE had emerged for carrying out regular standardized assessments, and the MoES
                decided to reduce the number of assessments to be undertaken. As such, this indicator
                was revised to remove the reference to Grade 8.
    • Outcome indicator 3: Per-capita financing implemented with report analyzing and disseminating
        the results.
            o This was an implementation adjustment. During the first year of project implementation,
                the Government decided to scale up per capita financing nationally. Therefore reference
                to six oblasts was removed, and the indicator phrased to encompass national coverage.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

    •   The main beneficiaries described in the project document were:
    •   Students, teachers, and school management and Board in 1,501 general secondary schools
        located in low-income, rural areas who would benefit from teaching-learning materials; teacher
        and school management training to build capacities in child-centered active learning techniques;
        and grants to implement school improvements plans.
    •   Students, teachers and directors in 598 Kindergartens in low-income, rural areas who would
        benefit from training to build capacities in child-centered active learning techniques.
    •   The main stakeholders at schools operating in six oblasts benefiting from the strengthening and
        implementation of per capita financing reforms, designed to improve the transparent and
        equitable distribution of funds and provide incentives for the efficient use of resources.
    •   The government, MoPE included, would benefit from periodic information being made
        available on system performance in terms of learning outcomes.

1.5 Original Components

Component 1: Providing Learning Materials and Resources for Grades Five through Nine of
General Secondary Schools (Total estimated cost of US$ 29.9 million of which IDA is US$ 22.8
million)

12. The objective was to improve the quality of teaching and learning in project schools through the
    effective use of learning materials and resources acquired under the project. The project would
    finance the procurement of learning materials, equipment and other resources for grades 5-9 in 1,501
    general secondary schools. The project would also finance the holding of exhibition fairs at which
    the full range of materials, equipment and other resources available for procurement would be shown
    to school boards, teachers, parents and communities. School boards were to assess school needs
    through an open and participatory process, and then select a list of materials for procurement,
    working with a budget calculated based on the number of classes and students in grades 5-9, and the
    remoteness of the school.

Component 2: Strengthening School-Based Training for Teachers and Directors in Preschools and
General Secondary Schools (Total estimated cost of US$ 1.4 million of which IDA is US$ 1.0
million)

13. The objective was to change teaching in project schools and preschools towards a more interactive,
    student-centered approach to improve learning outcomes. The component was to develop and
    introduce School-based Teacher Training (SBTT) as a complement to existing training strategies.
    The training programs supported by the project would promote the use of student-centered active
    learning strategies, improvement of student assessment methods, cooperation-based work methods,
    community mobilization and effective use of modern teaching aids.

14. Four training programs were to be financed: (i) refresher training of 165 facilitators (oblast-level
    specialists and rayon methodologists) who had been trainers under BEP1; (ii) training directors of
    project schools and preschools on the teacher training program and on education management; (iii)
    training teams of school and preschool teachers on the new teaching methods and on adult training;
    and (iv) training teachers in project schools and preschools on the new teaching methods. Mentoring
    was to be provided in each training program. The project was to finance technical assistance to
    develop and adapt teacher training strategies, building on prior work done under BEP1; and the
    development, production and purchase of training modules and materials. The project was also to
    finance fees for trainers and mentors, travel expenses, and the accommodation and meals for trainers
    and trainees. To promote SBTT as a complementary approach to centralized teacher training
    schemes, the project would also support the development of a SBTT strategy.

Component 3: Strengthening School Boards and Providing Competitive Grants to Selected
Schools for School Improvement (Total estimated cost US$ 2.7 million of which IDA is US$ 2.7
million)

15. The objective was to increase further the involvement of school boards in project schools and
    provide competitive funding for school improvement. Building on the activation of school boards
    from BEP1, BEP2 was to continue to build capacity and move school boards to an even higher level
    of participation by encouraging them to develop proposals for Competitive Grants to finance Sub-


                                                   4
   projects aimed at school improvement. The component therefore supported the establishment and
   implementation of a Competitive Grants program for school boards to design and implement their
   own plans to improve school quality. Positive discriminatory criteria were to be introduced in the
   annual allocation of funds to allow a significant number of high-risk project schools, the poorest and
   lowest performing project schools, to tap the competitive funds with good quality proposals. The
   proposals were expected to aim at improving the classroom pedagogical process and the school
   pedagogical climate.

Component 4: Improving Education Financing, Budgeting and Management (Total estimated cost
US$ 0.5 million of which IDA is US$ 0.3 million)

16. The objective was to improve education financing, budgeting and school management in selected
    oblasts. Building upon the GoU’s implementation of PCF in 2008 in Bukhara Oblast, Ferghana
    Oblast and Tashkent City, the BEP-2 was to support the GoU’s expansion of per capita financing to
    three additional oblasts, Namanghan, Syrdarya and Khorezm. The component would finance
    training on school budget planning, execution and accounting; establishment of a school financial
    management and public expenditure monitoring system, including software development and
    installation of a school financial management and accounting system on a pilot basis in the six
    oblasts; and monitoring and evaluation activities.

Component 5: Supporting Project Management and Results Management (Total estimated cost
US$ 1.5 million of which IDA is US$ 1.2 million)

17. The objective was to support project management, implement national standardized assessment of
    student learning, and evaluate project effectiveness. The component was to finance: (i) project
    management, including procurement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation and support
    to implement specific project activities; (ii) a final standardized national learning assessment for
    project and non-project schools; (iii) standardized national assessment for 4th and 8th grades; (iv)
    updating and analysis of the baseline survey collected during BEP1; (v) periodic monitoring and
    reporting of key educational indicators in a sample of project and comparable non-project schools;
    (vi) updating of the agreed BEP2 project’s indicators; and (vii) carrying out of an impact evaluation
    study of the overall BEP2, including on-site assessment of the classroom pedagogical changes
    towards a more student-centered approach and effective use of new learning materials.

1.6 Revised Components

                                                             the MoES decided to reduce the
                                                             number of assessments to be
                                                             undertaken.

1.7 Other significant changes

19. On the request from the MoF dated February 28, 2014, the amount of US$ 2.5 million (due to
    savings from the last procurement of ICT equipment for 694 additional schools) was cancelled in
    March 2014.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and outcomes
2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20. BEP-2 was the second phase of a US$ 28 million adaptable program loan (APL). It was approved
    on June 23, 2009, and became effective on March 11, 2010. The BEP-2 was designed to build on
    the capacities developed under BEP-1, the first phase of the APL. The BEP-2 kept the same PDO
    and a similar set of activities, but had a longer duration of four years. (See Box 1).

21. The project’s background analysis provided a reasonable foundation for project design. Learning
    outcomes were cited as a fundamental concern, as was the lack of national standardized learning
    assessments. Immediate causal factors were provided, including an unsatisfactory availability of
    teaching-learning materials (particularly in rural areas); a lack of teacher competence in active
    learning techniques; and a limited community participation in the school to encourage


                                                             6
   accountability. The inequitable distribution of funding was identified as an underlying problem.
   The analysis however lacked details on the in-service teacher training system (to explain the lack of
   teacher competence); as well as the existing system for monitoring learning achievements (to clarify
   why system results are generally unavailable and a standardized national assessment is required).

Box 1.: Design, achievements and lessons of BEP-1 built in to BEP-2
The BEP was initially designed as a one four-year investment project but later changed into a two-
phased Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The two projects shared the same PDO; there was strong
continuity in the design; and the achievements and lessons of BEP-1 contributed to the design and
results of BEP-2. In general, the BEP aimed to make significant improvements in the school education
system, including improvements in physical conditions of education facilities, development of
educational standards satisfactory to international standards, and creation of equal access and quality of
education. The BEP-1 was designed to build capacity, while the BEP-2 was designed to build upon and
extend the capacity to encourage greater education reform. In particular, the BEP-1 helped to make
significant progress in capacity building in several key areas, including:
• Community involvement in school decision-making increased at project schools through the training
    of school boards and their active involvement in needs assessment and selection of learning
    materials for the primary grades. BEP-2 built on this by extending the needs assessment and
    selection of learning materials to cover grades 5-9.
• Teacher training materials were developed and facilitators and experts trained to build the capacities
    of teachers in the area of student-centered active learning. This enabled BEP-2 to implement this
    training to cover all project schools.
• Per capita financing was designed and implemented in two oblasts and Tashkent City. This enabled
    BEP-2 to target scaling up to three more oblasts, thus expanding the transparency, predictability,
    efficiency and equity entailed by the reform.
• The pilot of a national standardized student assessment was carried out for grades 4 and 8, with the
    results analyzed for grade 8. This provided a baseline for setting a Grade 4 learning target for the
    PDO for BEP-2, and also laid the foundation for planning a series of learning assessments under
    BEP-2.
BEP-1 also provided lessons, which were built into BEP-2 design. These included the need to have
longer time frames for decision-making, procurement and ensuring community participation inherent in
a highly hierarchical and controlled environment. Indeed, BEP-2 was a four-year project, whereas BEP-
1 was designed to last 18 months. Another lesson was the importance of brining in the experience of
other countries, and this was built into BEP-2 design by including study tours in key technical areas.
Finally, as BEP-1 was the first Bank-financed education project without a PIU in Uzbekistan, MoPE
staff needed to learn Bank procedures and how to implement without a PIU; under BEP-2,
implementation arrangements were designed to provide implementing departments of the MoPE with
adequate capacity.

22. The components were designed to respond to the analysis and to complement one another so as to
    contribute synergistically to the achievement of the PDO, which was to be measured along three
    dimensions. (See Graphic 1 below). An improvement in learning achievements was to be brought
    about through making teaching-learning materials more available, building the capacities of teachers
    and school directors to introduce pedagogically more effective interactive teaching-learning
    techniques, and supporting the implementation of School Implementation Plans that aimed to
    increase the quality of learning and improve the availability of pedagogical materials. However, the



                                                    7
   target for learning achievements pertained only to Grade 4, and thus neglected to take into account
   the contribution of C1 (teaching-learning materials for Grades 5-9); rather the target seems to have
   been the planned outcome of providing teaching-learning materials under BEP-1 and the continued
   support under BEP-2 to teacher training and school improvements. This resulted in a fundamental
   disconnect between the first outcome measured and the actual interventions financed under BEP-2.
   The expansion and analysis of per capita financing was to be brought about through the technical
   and other support provided under C4. The standardized and sample-based assessment of learning
   outcomes was to be achieved by C5, which financed the design and implementation of such
   assessments.

23. The components on in-service teacher training (C2) and learning assessments (part of C5) might
    have usefully included activities to understand, reform and/or build institutional capacities, in order
    to promote the conditions required for the long-term sustainability of the innovations supported by
    the project in these two areas. In the case of SBTT, there was no analysis in the PAD of the existing
    training delivery system (and why an alternative model was needed as a complement), and the
    parameters of the model proposed in the PAD had constraints (particularly in terms of locating
    training at the district level where there are no in-service training institutions or staff) that ran a risk
    of being resisted by existing institutions. With respect to learning assessments, the PAD did not
    analyze the existing system of assessing learning or identify its shortcomings, and project activities
    did not foresee a comparison of the assessment approach supported by the project with the existing
    system. Such exercises would have highlighted various technical and economic advantages of the
    project-supported approach, and might have helped lay the foundations for ensuring the
    sustainability of standardized assessments. The funds allocated for learning assessments under C5
    were very limited, particularly in light of the prominence of learning assessments in the PDO.

    (plus TLMs 1-4 provided
    under BEP-1)

     Component 2: Building

     learning assessments                          sample-based assessments



24. The project was well aligned with the School Education Development Plan (SEDP) in force at that
    time, which focused on improving the physical conditions of the learning environment. The
    government satisfied two conditions (‘triggers’) to move from phase one to phase two, indicating
    government commitment to the project. Substantial government commitment was also built into
    project design, with counterpart contributions estimated at US$ 8 million and covering inter alia the
    delivery of goods, payment of taxes and duties, certain training costs, and study tours.

25. Adequate implementation arrangements and capacity were foreseen during project preparation.
    Rather than establishing a PIU, implementation responsibility laid with the MoPE. The Deputy
    Minister acted as project Director, with responsibility for overall leadership, management and
    oversight. The relevant MoPE and Ministry of Finance departments were made responsible for the
    implementation and coordination of the components and their activities, as well as for procurement
    and financial management. The implementation arrangements were implicitly designed to build
    institutional capacity by making the relevant departments responsible for the implementation of their
    respective parts of the project, supporting them with consultants to augment their capacity and
    manage the additional tasks entailed by the project.



                                                   9
26. The risks were generally well defined and provided with appropriate mitigation measures. With
    respect to implementation capacity and sustainability, more might have been said about
    sustainability risks pertaining to project-supported innovations (particularly SBTT, PCF and learning
    assessments) and corresponding mitigation measures. The quality of the design of the results
    framework and monitoring and evaluation arrangements is discussed in Section 2.3.

2.2. Implementation

   The following factors affected project implementation.

27. Government’s commitment. The political stability and GoU consistency in supporting the sector’s
    goals generally, and the project’s objectives specifically, contributed to successful implementation.
    Further, the bulk of the government’s significant counterpart contributions were realized and in some
    cases exceeded (see Section 5.2), and the government was supportive in resolving issues hindering
    implementation. However, fewer learning assessments were carried out than planned, the result in
    part of a failure to find the right institutional niche within the government’s administrative apparatus.

28. Cost savings. There were significant cost savings (US$ 9.53 million) during the procurement
    process for goods under Component 1. This was the result of the effectiveness of the bidding
    process, as well as the prudently high unit prices built into the procurement plan to start with. These
    savings were used to cover an additional 694 schools, which were located in oblasts targeted by the
    project and selected on the basis of previously agreed criteria. These schools benefited from
    computers and other ICT devices to allow teachers and students to use contextualized digital
    learning content.

29. Implementing Agency (IA) Factors. The MoPE’s performance in terms of management
    effectiveness, staffing adequacy and quality, use of technical assistance, monitoring and evaluation
    and beneficiary participation generally enabled the project’s successful implementation. However, a
    hesitant follow-up by the MoPE of issues hindering School Boards to absorb school grants provided
    under Component 3 led to only 303 of 500 beneficiary schools receiving the full grant, with the
    remainder receiving 70 percent of the grant. Not all activities were completed; a learning assessment
    exercise for Grade Four scheduled for Year Two was never conducted. There was some improper
    sequencing, largely the result of implementation delays. In particular, the bulk of the training under
    Component 2 took place after the Grade 4 learning assessment exercise in Year Four.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

30. Design. The monitoring framework was designed to capture project outcomes and outputs. Project
    development outcome indicators focused on improved learning achievements (to reflect effects of
    inputs to project schools), national learning assessments (to reflect the project contribution to the
    conduct of periodic national assessments), and PCF (to reflect project support for scaling up).
    However, there were serious shortcomings in the framework indicators. The first PDO indicator was
    overly ambitious and raises a question of attribution. It is difficult to ensure that all inputs are
    effectively delivered on a timely basis in order to produce learning results within four years; the
    schools operate in a multi-factorial environment, some of which might affect learning in ways that
    overwhelm project inputs; and the education system might change learning benchmarks (e.g. through



                                                     10
   curriculum reforms). Further, by restricting the measurement to Grade 4, the indicator neglected to
   measure any effects of Component 1 (accounting for the largest share of the loan), which purchased
   teaching-learning materials for grades 5-9. The indicator might also have been more tightly phrased
   in terms of the project schools’ performance relative to the non-project schools, so as to capture
   ‘difference-in-difference’ rather than simply ‘an increase.’ Including a PDO pertaining to learning
   assessments (entailing three separate national assessments within a four-year period), was
   disproportionate to the activities identified and resources allocated. The third PDO indicator
   captured processes (PCF implementation) rather than outcomes (e.g effects on equity or efficiency).
   At the level of intermediate outcomes, the indicator for Component 2 pertaining to numbers of
   teachers trained did not distinguish between teachers directly and indirectly trained; these two are
   essentially different, and at the least the indicator should have been disaggregated. (The project
   financed the two-week training of ‘key teachers’. In turn, these key teachers trained their colleagues
   over a shorter period, during which time project-financed trainers visited the schools to support this
   second level of training). (See also Annex 2).

31. Implementation and utilization. Arrangements were largely implemented as designed in the PAD,
    regular reporting was conducted, and the information was discussed and used to track progress,
    identify bottlenecks and course corrections, and contribute to policy review and development. For
    instance:
    • Component 2 monitoring and evaluation information was regularly reviewed with MoPE,
        leading to improvements in model design, revision of materials, reinforcement/replacement of
        trainers, and decisions on how the training would be incorporated into national systems.
    • Component 3 monitoring highlighted difficulties in releasing the final tranche representing 30
        percent of grants’ allocation to school boards benefiting from the first wave of school grants.
        These were discussed and eventually resolved.

32. Component-wise project monitoring and evaluation of implementation and intermediate outcomes
    were generally robust. However there were some aspects that might have been improved.
   • The learning achievement exercise was conducted before the 2nd and 3rd (of 3) rounds of teacher
      training were completed, and therefore did not pick up the effects of the training. Further, the
      PAD RF called for two Grade 4 exercises (in years 2 and 4), whereas only one was done (year 4).
   • The intermediate outcome indicator for Component 2 was implicitly based upon having a baseline
      measurement, but this was not done. Instead, the evaluation used two samples: teachers directly
      trained (in round 2) under the project; and teachers from schools that would be indirectly covered
      under round 3, but who would not be directly trained. That is, the ‘trained’ group consisted of
      ‘key’ teachers who had just been trained; while the ‘untrained’ group consisted of teachers who
      would not be directly trained by the project, but who worked at schools where key teachers were
      about to be trained by the project. The ‘key’ teachers who received direct training from the
      project were generally Heads of Methodological Units. These are teachers who tend to be
      relatively experienced and qualified. By comparing such teachers with teachers in a control
      sample that generally excludes Heads of Methodological Units, there may have been a bias in the
      sampling such that the ‘trained’ sample may have contained better teachers than the ‘untrained’
      sample. Further, the evaluation was meant to cover 10 percent of general secondary project
      schools, but in fact the sample contained only 100 (or 6.6 percent) general secondary project
      schools. The evaluation of PCF was not done.



                                                  11
2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

33. The project was rated C for environmental safeguards as major civil works were not envisaged.

34. Fiduciary performance was rated Satisfactory over the life of the project, except during two
    implementation support visits, when financial management rating was downgraded to 'moderately
    satisfactory'. The reason for downgrade was due to identification of ineligible project expenses in
    relation to income tax expenses. This issue was subsequently clarified as they pertained to
    interpretation of country financing percentages but a reimbursement from the GoU to the Bank is
    still pending. Procurement performance was considered moderately satisfactory. The MoPE
    gradually gained experience during the life of the project and efficiently managed a large number of
    contracts. Significant savings were generated through lower prices obtained from competitive
    bidding. Procurement under the school grants scheme could have been designed so as to allow
    greater oversight of local School Boards. Procurement capacity could have been strengthened with
    targeted capacity building within MoPE while managing risk and without overly relying on
    consultants.

2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35. There are post-completion considerations to take into account for the SBTT (under Component 2),
    per capita financing (Component 4) and learning assessments (Component 5). As amplified in
    Annex 2, it is unclear to what extent SBTT can be incorporated into national in-service training
    systems. In its role as Grant Supervisor for the forthcoming Global Partnership for Education (GPE)
    grant, the Bank will continue to explore with the MoPE and other donor partners how this
    mainstreaming can take place. With respect to per capita financing, the government has already
    undertaken extensive measures to ensure the reform’s sustainability. The Bank should continue to
    encourage the government to conduct an evaluation; in light of the government’s intention to expand
    PCF to other sectors, the Bank may also consider the planned IDA operation in tertiary education as
    an opportunity for such expansion. As for learning assessments, the GPE presents an opportunity for
    the government to continue carrying out standardized assessments at grades 4 and 9 with a view to
    longer term institutionalization. This should be complemented by assistance to help government
    identify the objectives, uses and tools of standardized assessments, along with their advantages and
    drawbacks.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1.Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Objectives

36. The PDO retains high overall relevance at the time of the ICR (as it did at the time of design).
    Efforts to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning remain relevant, including through
    targeted interventions such as those supported by the project. The effort to develop institutional
    capacity to assess student learning remains highly relevant, particularly in the form of standardized
    assessments as supported by the project. Finally, the need to ensure predictable and transparent
    school budgets in selected oblasts remains relevant. The ongoing relevance is underlined by the


                                                   12
   congruence between the PDO and the recently approved Education Sector Plan (ESP) for 2013-17;
   as well as the Country Partnership Strategy for FY 2012-2015.

Design

37. The design was based on a generally sound situation analysis that retains much of its relevance. The
    PDO was aligned with national development priorities and sectoral constraints that continue to be
    relevant; and the components were designed to achieve their own objectives as well as contribute
    jointly to the project’s development objective. The design’s relevance was undermined in that the
    target chosen to measure the teaching effectiveness dimension of the PDO did not correspond to the
    grades that received the greatest project support (in dollar terms). The implementation arrangements
    were generally adequate and built upon those first tested under BEP-1, whereby implementation
    responsibility was given directly to the MoPE and MoF, which were provided with technical
    consultants to augment their capacity including for fiduciary aspects of implementation. These
    arrangements continue to be relevant, and can mostly be used again in future.

Implementation

38. The project’s implementation retained its relevance through a timely restructuring, which enabled a
    significantly increased coverage for Component 1. At restructuring, the results framework and
    evaluation activities were adjusted to be in line with the accelerated schedule to scale up PCF; and to
    drop any reference to a Grade 8 learning assessment, which was no longer taking place under the
    project. However, the restructuring was a missed opportunity to revise the results framework; in
    particular, the first outcome indicator might have been modified to take into account the largest
    component (C1). Other areas were also overlooked during the restructuring. First, it was already
    clear at that point that most of the activities in Component 4 (pertaining to PCF) were being fully
    financed by the Ministry of Finance, and the resources originally allocated to those activities should
    have been reallocated to other project activities. Similarly, under Component 2 (pertaining to
    SBTT), the government had already taken financial responsibility for certain training activities that
    were originally part of the project’s financed activities, thus those funds should also have been
    reallocated. Finally, the mid-term review and restructuring were also an opportunity to tackle the
    sustainability issues mentioned above.

3.2.Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

39. Project achievement is rated moderately unsatisfactory as the project development objective was
    partially achieved, with significant shortcomings. The project contributed to an increased
    effectiveness in teaching at the primary and secondary levels, but the evidence for improved student
    learning at the primary level is mixed while no data were adduced for the grades that the project’s
    largest component was targeting. The national standardized assessment at grade 4 was carried out
    but was not institutionalized. Per capita financing was scaled up nationally; and reporting was
    conducted, analyzed and disseminated with project support.

40. Therefore the target of the first outcome indicator was partly achieved; the second outcome
    indicator’s original target was not met, but the revised target was achieved; and the third outcome
    indicator’s original target was exceeded, while the revised target was achieved. Given that the first


                                                    13
    outcome indicator was designed to reflect interventions in project schools, and the bulk of project
    funding was spent on these interventions, the performance of this PDO receives a preponderant
    weight in the overall rating. The analysis below is broken down by the three PDO indicators, which
    pertain to improvements in learning, national standardized assessments, and education financing
    reforms.

41. Improvements in learning. The first outcome indicator target was partly achieved, in that the
    targeted schools experienced a significant increase in Grade 4 math scores (from 478 at baseline to
    514 at completion) that was greater than in non-project schools (from 487 to 496); reading scores
    stayed substantially the same (485 at baseline and 482 at completion), though in non-project schools
    there was a significant decline (from 511 to 485). 2 That is, while the project schools did not achieve
    absolute gains in test scores in both subjects (as targeted by the project), there was an improvement
    in both subjects relative to non-project schools. There was no measurement of learning at the
    secondary level, even though the bulk of the BEP-2 resources was targeted at that level. As teaching
    effectiveness is a key contributor to the learning process, it is essential also to consider measured
    changes in teacher behavior and practice. There is evidence for an increased teaching effectiveness
    of teachers (at both primary and secondary levels) who received project-financed training. An
    independent evaluation found that 76.2% of project-trained teachers had adopted more effective
    student-centered teaching practices, a substantially higher prevalence than among those not trained
    (62.1%).

42. By design, an improvement in learning outcomes should also have been the synergistic result of an
    increased availability of key inputs of teaching and learning materials and an improvement in school
    planning and management. Teaching-learning materials for Grade 4 were supplied under BEP-1 at
    least 3 years before the learning assessment. (BEP-2 was designed to be continuous with, and build
    upon, BEP-1). The bulk of the Grade 5-9 learning materials supplied under BEP-2 arrived in the
    second half of the third year and at the beginning of the fourth year, leaving limited time in which to
    have an impact on learning outcomes. Some of the learning materials acquired under the school
    improvement plans were relevant to the primary curriculum; delivery to schools started in the 2nd
    year of the project, in time to have an effect on learning before project closure. The community and
    School Board participation that was stimulated under Component 3 contributed to participatory
    school improvement planning and management, and sustaining a learning culture in school.

43. Given that the project substantially achieved all its targets in increasing teaching effectiveness
    through training and mentoring of proven practice, in making teaching-learning materials available,
    and in enabling all targeted schools to implement an Improvement Plan; but only partially met its
    learning targets for Grade 4 while failing to provide evidence for improved learning in grades 5-9:
    the ICR team concluded that the project was moderately unsuccessful in supporting the GoU’s
    efforts to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning through targeted interventions in
    selected general secondary education schools and preschools in rural poor areas.



2
  The increase in maths scores in project schools was statistically significant (95% confidence interval); the increase in maths
scores in non-project schools was not significant. The decline in reading scores in project schools was not statistically
significant; the decline in reading scores in non-project schools was significant.



                                                              14
44. National standardized assessments. The second revised outcome indicator target was fully
    achieved, although partially achieved when compared to the original target. In the PAD, the
    indicator referred to Grade 4 and 8 assessments, with exercises scheduled for years 2, 3 and 4; in the
    Restructuring Paper, reference to Grade 8 was removed as requested by the government, and the RF
    targets included only one Grade 4 assessment in year 4. The Grade 4 assessment was successfully
    carried out under the project.

45. Education financing reforms. The third outcome indicator target was achieved, both in its original
    and revised forms. Initially, the project had targeted implementing PCF in three additional oblasts.
    However, in 2010, the Government scaled up PCF nationally and fully financed its implementation –
    including activities originally foreseen to be financed by the loan (e.g. training on school budget
    planning, execution and accounting; establishment of a school financial management and public
    expenditure monitoring system, including software for a school financial management and
    accounting system). After the mid-term review, the indicator was revised to cover the whole country
    rather than the three additional oblasts. The indicator also includes ‘report analyzing and
    disseminating the results.’ The PCF was implemented nationwide and a report was done and
    disseminated, though a rigorous evaluation was not undertaken as foreseen under the project.

3.3.Efficiency

46. Traditional values for measuring efficiency gains such as the project’s Economic Rate of Return or
    Net Present Value were not calculated at appraisal. Instead, the economic analysis put its emphasis
    on equity in the allocation of educational resources. Such choice of methodology precluded an ex-
    post evaluation to quantify the project costs and benefits. An alternative to assess the project’s cost
    effectiveness was also constrained by the lack of data to construct substitute scenarios to compare
    their costs and benefits for demonstration of value for money and or the least cost. Given the above,
    the ICR team re-visited the original economic analysis of the project, focusing on the gains
    generated by the expansion of per capita financing. Annex 3 details the analysis. The ICR team
    concluded that the national expansion of PCF has in fact led to a more equitable allocation of
    resources, and more efficient spending at the system level. Specifically, PCF has led to a significant
    reduction in the variance in allocation of resources across schools from 60 to 10 percent, as well as
    to the rationalization of the school network as evidenced by an increase in the average classroom
    size and in the teacher-student ratio. The analysis also concluded that improved pedagogy of
    teachers resulting from project interventions contributed to better student learning outcomes, a lower
    cost scenario to achieve better student learning than higher cost of remedial education.

3.4.Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

47. The project’s design and objectives were substantially relevant at its onset and remain so today.
    There were significant shortcomings in achieving the project’s main objective – to improve the
    effectiveness of teaching and learning through targeted interventions in rural poor areas - in that
    only one of the two primary-level learning targets was achieved while no measurement of learning
    was undertaken in those grades that received the bulk of the project’s resources. There were
    moderate shortcomings in developing the institutional capacity to assess student learning, as there
    remain concerns regarding the medium to long-term sustainability of this intervention. There were
    only minor shortcomings in achieving the adoption of predictable and transparent school budgets in


                                                    15
   selected oblasts; while the PCF reform was scaled up beyond initial targets and successfully yielded
   efficiency and equity gains, a thorough evaluation remains to be done. Given the project’s
   substantial relevance and efficiency, but taking into account significant shortcomings in achieving
   the main objective and minor or moderate shortcomings in achieving the other objectives, the overall
   outcome rating is moderately unsatisfactory.

3.5.Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty

48. The project contributed to more equitable access to quality basic social services through targeted
    support to schools in poor and disadvantaged regions and communities. As already stated, the
    nationwide introduction of PCF led to a significant reduction in the variance in allocation of
    resources across schools from 60 to 10 percent. The targeted interventions helped equalize the
    opportunity for poor households and their children of improved access to schooling, increased
    availability of didactic materials in schools in relatively poor areas, and consequently to improve
    learning.

(b) Governance

49. The project also supported interventions contributing to enhanced governance of the decentralizing
    system. The roll-out of School Boards system-wide enabled stakeholder participation in decision
    making on school development and planning which empowered the voice and participation of
    stakeholders and citizen engagement. The introduction of per capita financing has made the
    allocation and use of resources transparent.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

50. The PDO was measured using three dimensions: increased learning outcomes in project schools; the
    periodic conduct of national standardized assessments with results being analyzed and disseminated;
    and the implementation of per capita financing. There is a low risk that the learning outcome results
    in project schools will be reversed. Any contribution made by the training should strengthen over
    time as teachers gain more experience in applying the teaching-learning techniques and the school’s
    pedagogical culture strengthens in these areas. More broadly, the teaching-learning materials on
    interactive learning developed by the project have been incorporated into the curricula of teacher
    training institutions, and a forthcoming project under the Global Partnership for Education (GPE)
    includes training targeting this competency. Any contribution made by the teaching-learning
    materials should last at least as long as the useful life of the materials. The strong stakeholder
    commitment to the objectives of the project also augurs well for maintaining the gains. There is a
    deep commitment to funding public education, and communities appear to be supportive of their
    local schools.

51. The risk to sustaining the periodic conduct of national standardized assessments has been moderated
    recently, while this report was being prepared. According to updated information on the GPE’s
    forthcoming operation, the government has agreed to standardized assessments at grade 4 and grade
    9 during GPE project implementation over the next three years. This recent decision has enhanced



                                                   16
   the probability that the government will sustain such exercises over time and continue building on
   the technical capacities for test design, sampling methods, and administration procedures supported
   by the BEP-2.

52. There is a negligible to low risk that the per capita financing reforms will be reversed. The
    government greatly accelerated the reform’s implementation schedule; remains strongly committed
    to the reform, and continues to invest extensively in capacity building and the development of
    information and IT systems to strengthen the reform’s effective implementation. The government
    has plans to extend the principles of PCF to other educational sub-sectors.

53. Given these differential risk ratings for the different dimensions of the project’s development
    outcome, the overall risk to development outcome is moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank performance

(a) Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

54. While in most respects the Bank’s performance at entry was satisfactory, there were serious
    shortcomings in supporting the client to develop the right strategic approach to build institutional
    aspects into the project design, and to elaborate an adequate results framework and indicators that
    captured the causal linkages between project inputs, outputs and outcomes. . (See sections 2.1 and
    2.3).

(b) Quality of supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

55. The Bank’s supervision focused on development impact, supervision of fiduciary aspects, adequacy
    of supervision inputs and processes, candor and quality of performance reporting, including the
    timely carrying-out of the MTR and restructuring and the role in ensuring adequate transition
    arrangements. However, the restructuring might have better mitigated the shortcomings of the M &
    E design, particularly the lack of a project development indicator that took into account the project’s
    largest component, addressed sustainability issues, and adjusted the financing plan in light of
    changes in implementation. The performance is therefore rated as moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of rating for overall Bank performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

56. The rating is based on the serious shortcomings of quality at entry and moderate shortcomings in
    supervision in three important areas:, supporting the client to develop the right strategic approach, to
    build institutional aspects into the project design, and to elaborate an adequate results framework.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government performance
Rating: Satisfactory

57. Government ownership and commitment to achieving the development objective was strong. The
    enabling environment in the education sector was conducive to the successful implementation of the
    project. Implementation issues were generally well resolved, though issues that prevented either the
    timely or full implementation of certain activities could have been resolved more quickly with
    stronger oversight of the IA. (These issues are discussed in Annex 2 and summarized below). The
    government made significant financial contributions to the project, as per project design. However,
    none of the study tours foreseen in the PAD (to be paid by government) were undertaken.

(b) Implementing Agency (IA) performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

58. The project was implemented by the MoPE with the assistance of consultants. The MoPE’ss
    commitment to achieving development objectives was strong. The implementation of monitoring
    and evaluation arrangements provided by project design, including the utilization of M&E data in
    decision-making and resource allocation, was done well. For Components 1-3, the IA elaborated
    monitoring arrangements beyond the minimum specifications of the PAD, and the IA seems to have
    extensively monitored implementation progress, including keeping extensive documentation.
    Information was used in decision-making and resource allocation. The fiduciary aspects of project
    implementation were acceptable.

59. At the same time, the IA’s performance could have been better if the following issues had been
    addressed on a timely basis. Under Component 3, only 303 out of 500 School Boards that were
    awarded a school grant fully used both the first and second tranches (of 70 and 30 percent). The
    Bank supervision team noted in the final ISR that ‘intensive support to schools at the beginning of
    project implementation by the client team would have ensured greater capacity building and
    ownership of the process in the schools.’ This in turn would have enabled a higher use of both
    tranches. Further, procurement delays resulted in teaching-learning materials arriving later than
    originally scheduled; and roughly two-thirds of teachers were trained behind schedule, in the last
    nine months of the project, such that the effects of these trainings could not be picked up in the
    learning assessment exercise for Grade 4 conducted in Year 4 as a project evaluation exercise.
    Implementation delays led to the Grade 4 learning assessment scheduled for Year 2 not being
    conducted.

(c) Justification of rating for overall Borrower performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

60. While the Government’s performance was satisfactory, there were moderate shortcomings in the
    performance of the IA in terms of resolving disbursement issues for School Boards on a timely basis,
    and the timely and proper sequencing of activities.

6. Lessons Learned
61. Implementation arrangements must continuously strive to accommodate yet build MoPE
    capacities. The need for an implementing agency is dictated by the lack of MoPE capacities to
    implement a project given its current structure and staffing levels, as well as the different fiduciary
    procedures followed by the Government and the Bank. Under BEP-2, instead of creating a PIU, the
    project hired a team of consultants who were to support MoPE and MoF departments, with the
    departments having direct implementation responsibility for the components. It is undoubtedly
    difficult to reconcile MoPE staffing levels and structure with the implementation needs of a project,
    particularly when different fiduciary procedures are followed by the Government and the Bank.
    Nonetheless, more might be done to increase MoPE implementation ownership and capacity within
    existing institutional arrangements. For example, MoPE departments that already have strong
    implementation capacity (e.g. in procurement) should take a stronger role. While all implementing
    team consultants worked in coordination with the relevant department, having among their terms of
    reference the duty to transfer capacity could have strengthened the transition and long term capacity.

62. Attention to developing sustainable institutional and budgetary arrangements for innovations
    should be built into project design and implementation. As explained in Sections 2, 5 and Annex
    2, project design and implementation gave relatively little attention to the institutional and budgetary
    reforms that would be required to enable project innovations in Component 2 and 5 to become
    sustainable. This in turn contributed to the SBTT model and project approach to learning
    assessments not being formally adopted for eventual scale-up by the education sector. Therefore the
    design and implementation of innovative models should from the beginning take into account or
    foresee the issues of sustainable scale-up. For instance, project activities in such cases should
    include: an analysis of existing systems and their shortcomings, along with some identification of the
    superior aspects of the model; and the identification of institutional and financial requirements of
    scaling up the model, and contrasting these with existing institutions and budgets, thereby leading to
    the identification of institutional and budgetary reforms that would be required.

63. The purpose of learning assessments should be defined, and the approach designed
    accordingly. One of the key factors impeding the institutionalization of standardized assessments is
    the absence of a clearly defined assessment strategy. While the project implemented sample-based
    testing, the MoPE was focusing its effort to monitor system performance using an existing
    monitoring tool without thinking through the purpose of different assessment instruments. Countries
    that have a functioning assessment system should have a balance between summative and formative
    assessments. Institutionalizing standardized testing could help MoPE to track and monitor system
    wide performance and student learning trends, while classroom-based assessment would provide
    more effective support for teachers to measure progress of student learning and improve teaching.
    Assessment remains an area where further assistance may be needed to put in place a coherent
    strategy to clearly define the purpose of the assessment at system, school and classroom levels and
    align the instruments and support for capacity building.

64. A properly designed results framework is essential to project design and evaluation. The
    indicators and targets must capture not only the project outputs, but also the causal relations between
    these and the project outcomes. Further, the outcomes must be carefully articulated to capture the
    PDO, and must realistically take into account issues of implementation timing and attribution.
    Deficiency in these aspects makes it subsequently difficult to assess project performance. In



                                                    19
   retrospect, the BEP-2 outcome capturing the teaching effectiveness dimension of the PDO should
   have been more realistically restricted to achieving improvements in teaching-learning practices
   (including the use of newly available teaching-learning materials) at both primary and secondary
   levels. This would have enabled one to discern continuity with the BEP-1 while, more importantly,
   setting a realistic yet rigorous standard against which the success of the BEP-2 could be measured.

1. Component One exceeded its intermediate outcome targets. The project planned to, and did in fact
   supply 1,501 general secondary schools with teaching-learning materials for grades 5-9. As per
   project design, the materials were selected from a list by the schools themselves. The list was
   designed by the MoPE, and the school’s selection was elaborated and finalized by School Boards in
   consultation with teachers, school management, students and parents. There were US$ 9.53 million
   savings as an outcome of the procurement of these materials. Following a level-2 restructuring
   (approved on December 18, 2012), the project financed materials for a further 694 schools in the
   project oblasts. The government made significant contributions to the achievement of the
   component results, covering all taxes and delivery costs. Project monitoring and an independent
   evaluation confirmed that materials were received, highly appreciated and effectively used by
   teachers, students and other stakeholders. The independent evaluation also found that 93.8 percent
   of general education teachers in the project schools used the teaching-learning materials effectively,
   higher than the project’s 50 percent intermediate outcome target.

2. Component Two partly achieved or exceeded (with some qualifications) its intermediate outcome
   targets.

    •    The project exceeded its intermediate outcome target of training 50,000 pre-school and school
         teachers, and reported training 59,147 teachers. The project financed the training of 4,139
         general secondary teachers and 534 kindergarten teachers directly; these in turn trained 52,264
         and 2,210 teachers, respectively, while receiving mentoring support from master trainers.
         Further, the project trained 1,506 general secondary school directors and 1,023 deputy directors,
         as well as 376 kindergarten directors.
    •    The project exceeded its intermediate outcome target of teachers ‘changing their teaching
         practice towards a more student-centered approach’ as measured by an independent evaluation.
         An independent evaluation found that 76.2 percent of general education teachers who were
         directly trained under the project, and 84.8 percent of pre-school teachers directly trained under
         the project, had adopted student-centered approaches; the target in the PAD was 60 percent. The
         evaluation also found that the quality of the teacher training was high.
    •    The project partially met its intermediate outcome target of having a SBTT strategy adopted by
         the MoPE. While the Minister has verbally indicated that the MoPE is favorable to adopting
         elements of the SBTT as developed by the project, there is no detailed and budgeted plan for
         training teachers using the SBTT. During the ICR mission, the Deputy Minister indicated that
         adopting elements of the SBTT might entail using it during the traditional August district-level
         methodological meetings at which teachers participate.

3. The component was proactively managed by the project implementation team and partners in the
   MoPE and in-service teacher training institutes. The training materials produced by the project were
   formally approved for use by the relevant academic and training institutions, widely lauded for their
   quality and usefulness, and broadly disseminated beyond the confines of the project. They are
   reportedly having an impact on training programs in the central and oblast-level in-service teacher
   training institutes. The course provided under the project was redesigned during implementation to
   be formally recognized as satisfying official in-service training requirements, such that in the second
   and third rounds of training, some participating teachers were able to receive their in-service training

    certificate and satisfy the formal three-yearly requirements for professional development. In all,
    1,149 of the 4,139 directly trained teachers (general secondary) received an official certificate from
    the oblast in-service teacher training institute. The SBTT also has four distinctive features that were
    appreciated by participants. First, the training delivery was broken up into different weeks, between
    which teachers had an opportunity to apply what they had learned; and during which they had an
    opportunity to discuss their classroom experience. Second, trainers came to the school to observe
    and mentor the teachers. Third, a substantial part of the course was devoted to building the teacher’s
    capacity to train their colleagues in child-centered teaching-learning techniques. Fourth, the training
    took place at the district level, instead of at the institute in the Oblast capital.

4. The counterpart financing contribution to this component was substantial. Teacher training
   institutions covered most training fees, as well as the accommodation and meals for teachers trained
   at oblast-level institutions; while schools covered expenses associated with sending their teachers for
   training. Indeed, the range of expenses covered by government was larger than initially planned, and
   this contributed to the relatively low level of disbursement (roughly 20 percent) of IDA funds
   against the component’s IDA budget.

5. This component contributed to the achievement of the PDO as measured by the first indicator
   (pertaining to learning achievements in Grade 4); indeed its contribution is likely understated by the
   values measured at the end of the project. By the time the final round of Grade 4 learning
   achievements was conducted, only the first round of teacher training had been fully completed
   (covering approximately 21,000 teachers directly and indirectly trained). Had the training been
   completed as originally scheduled, its impact on learning achievements might have been more
   marked.

6. Component 3 exceeded its intermediate outcome target, with 500 project schools implementing a
   school development proposal, that is, 33 percent of project schools versus the 30 percent target. As
   per project design, all 1,501 School Boards elaborated a proposal, and an independent commission
   awarded funds to the 500 winning proposals. Not all funds were disbursed, however, the result of
   initial difficulties in reconciling requirements of the project and of the treasury system. Further,
   government counterparts and the project team identified implementation constraints pertaining to the
   limited disbursement period, maximum expenditure levels for hardware, and School Board
   capacities. The project team worked proactively with the government to resolve these issues, though
   this took some time. Measures taken included adoption of more flexible treasury rules, raising of
   hardware expenditures ceiling, and capacity building. As a result, while in the first and second
   rounds, only 42 percent of schools secured the second tranche (70 percent of funds were provided in

    the first tranche and the remaining 30% in the second tranche), in the third round 99.4 percent of
    schools did so.

7. This component contributed to the PDO as measured by the first PDO indicator, in that some of the
   learning materials acquired were relevant to the primary curriculum. Delivery to schools started in
   the 2nd year of the project, in time to have an effect on learning. More broadly, the community and
   School Board participation that was stimulated by the component (and focused as it was on learning
   materials and learning) may have contributed to creating or sustaining a learning culture in the
   school.

8. Component 4 exceeded its intermediate outcome indicator target. The project had originally
   intended to support the scaling up of PCF to six oblasts (from three covered under BEP-1). This
   support entailed financing training on school budget planning, execution and accounting;
   establishment of a school financial management and public expenditure monitoring system,
   including software development and installation of a school financial management and accounting
   system on a pilot basis in the six oblasts; and monitoring and evaluation activities.

9. However, in 2010 (the year the project became effective), the government scaled up PCF nationally
   and directly financed most the activities that had originally been slated for project financing.
   Therefore after the mid-term review, the PDO and intermediate outcome indicator were revised to
   cover the whole country rather than the six oblasts. The Restructuring Paper noted that the
   component would finance a rigorous evaluation of the PCF across the entire country instead of in six
   oblasts, as originally envisaged. The Ministry of Finance did conduct training and established a
   school financial management and expenditure monitoring system, based on software it developed
   and made available to all schools. The project did support the development and disseminating of a
   report analyzing on PCF implementation, though a rigorous evaluation was not undertaken.

10. By the end of the project, according to Ministry of Finance data, the percentage of schools
    participating in PCF getting more than 10 percent above or below average spending per student
    reached 0 percent, better than the RF target of 30 percent. What this basically means is that all
    schools were receiving allocations on the basis of the norms established under the PCF, thus
    promoting greater equity and transparency in resource allocation. The Ministry of Finance data also
    showed a more efficient use of resources. For instance, the national average teacher to student ratio

      increased from 11.3 in 2009 to 12.1 in 2013, while during the same period the average class size
      increased from 25.1 to 25.5. 2 Interviews with school management and board members during
      implementation support visits and ICR field trips revealed widespread satisfaction with the
      transparency, autonomy and increase in funding that have all been associated with the introduction
      of PCF.

11. Component 5 met its revised intermediate outcome indicator targets. The project had originally
    aimed to finance national assessments for Grades 4 (years 2 and 3) and 8 (year 4). After the mid-
    term review, the Grade 8 exercise was dropped and the target was revised to cover one Grade 4
    assessment only. Having missed the Grade 4 exercise in year 2 as a result of implementation delays,
    the project was restructured to remove it from the RF . Therefore, while the project reached its
    revised outcome target, it missed its original target. This may have been due in part to design
    shortcomings, whereby learning assessments were allocated relatively few funds and relegated to
    being an activity in a component that included project and results management. Indeed, as noted in
    ISR 5 (November 2011, or roughly 1.5 years into implementation), ‘The Bank team has noted that
    carrying out standardized assessments and the design of National Assessment System is an
    enormous undertaking, and the time and effort required to set up such a system may have been

    These are unweighted national averages using oblast-level data.




                                                                      26
       underestimated. It is essential to plan this carefully in order to ensure a sustainable and appropriate
       design for Uzbekistan.’3 Further, the project does not seem to have made significant progress in
       developing ‘institutional capacity to assess student learning’ (as per the PDO), particularly from the
       point of view of sustainability. As noted in ISR 7 (June 2012, or roughly two years into
       implementation), the ‘work (on learning assessments) is done mostly by consultants, with limited
       involvement of regular MoPE staff, which raises a question about the sustainability of this exercise
       after project closure.’ (p. 5). In ISR 8 (December 2012), it is noted that ‘it is clear that there is no
       institutional niche for this exercise in MoPE and this lessens the sustainability after project closure.’
       (p. 6). One must nonetheless acknowledge that the assessment carried out was done under the
       authority of the MoPE and with the direct involvement of the specialists of MoPE and the
       Republican Education Centre.

12. The intermediate outcome indicator targets pertaining to the survey of schools and households and to
    the impact evaluation were also met.

13. All the indicators and their targets for this component include an element of dissemination. In the
    event, workshops about the learning assessments were held for teachers and specialists of district
    and regional departments, as well as teachers of the regional teacher training institutes and members
    of trustee boards in 6 regions for the whole country. Regional conferences for dissemination of the
    outcomes of component 2 implementation were held for teacher training institute specialists, project
    trainers, and teachers of the pilot schools and preschools. All evaluation and assessment results were
    also discussed at the project’s closing workshop.

14. This component contributed significantly to the PDO as measured by the second PDO indicator
    (revised), in that it carried out and analyzed a learning achievements exercise for Grade 4.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


15. The economic analysis at the time of project design did not include an Economic Rate of Return
    (ERR) or Net Present Value (NPV) estimates; as such analyses would not be an appropriate tool for
    a project focused on pre-school and primary education. An ERR or NPV would have required
    making many arbitrary assumptions, undermining the accuracy of its conclusion. The economic
    analysis here therefore includes reference to the effectiveness of key interventions as well as the
    efficiency gains in terms of the student teacher ratio and average class size, which implies savings in
    public funding.

Rational for public investment

16. In the absence of NPV or ERR estimates, the ICR analyses the project’s efficiency using any other
    appropriate cost-effectiveness criteria to determine whether the project represented the expected
    least-cost solution to attain identified and measurable benefits by either an analysis of cost per unit
    of input or cost per unit of output.

17. Since the early 1990s, Uzbekistan has consistently allocated 8-9 percent of its Gross Domestic
    Product (GDP) to education, 4 which is one of the highest in the world, and much higher than
    neighboring countries (5.2 percent for all income levels in Europe and Central Asia (2010) or 4.4
    percent for developing countries only in ECA (2009) 5). The composition of education spending has
    changed over time, however. Until 2004, considerable budget growth was concentrated in
    specialized secondary education, underfinancing other sub-sectors. Preschool education suffered
    from severe budget constraints after independence because there was no alternative funding once
    enterprises and communities that had financed the subsector during the pre-independent period could
    no longer afford it. 6 Not only have preschool and basic education received relatively low allocation
    of the education budget, it has also been predominantly spent on wages, leaving less than five
    percent of the total recurrent budget for non-wage items to improve teaching and learning
    conditions.

18. The role of the government also includes equitable distribution of public resources. The specific
    attributes of basic education in Uzbekistan are such that the inequities do not lie predominantly in
    enrollment or attendance rates (which are near universal). Instead, they manifest themselves in the
    school infrastructure as well as availability of learning and teaching inputs. For example, 72 percent
    of urban schools had sufficient number of classrooms and desks, whereas this rate was only 66
    percent for rural schools. 7 A study on school financing also observed that per student spending had

       been allocated inequitably between oblasts, rayons and schools. 8 As a result of inequitable
       distribution of resources and learning conditions, the high reliance on informal private spending on
       uniforms, textbooks, learning materials and informal contributions to schools has limited access to
       good quality education, especially among the poor in rural areas. 9 Therefore, at the outset of the
       project, the PAD highlighted system-wide poor quality school infrastructure along with disparity in
       education inputs such as the number of classrooms and availability of student desks by urban and
       rural location as the economic rationale underlying this investment. Then, the project successfully
       provided learning materials to 1,501 schools and ICT equipment to 694 schools in rural areas to
       narrow the gap.

19. Addressing these types of inequities is a worthy use of public funds since school resources have an
    impact on learning outcomes for basic education students. Equity in education has strong merits
    from various perspectives, including human rights and social cohesion. From an economics point of
    view, one of the strong arguments takes into consideration that inequitable access to, and delivery of,
    education leads to an underutilization of talent. As a result, portions of society are not able to
    develop their skills and abilities to the best of their ability, which can limit their contributions to
    economic growth and society (OECD, August 2003).

Bank value added

20. To redirect the government budget more towards preschool and basic education, the government
    launched the off-budget School Education Development Program (SEDP) 2004-2009, adding about
    30 percent of the consolidated government spending on education, primarily to invest in
    infrastructure and teacher salaries annually between 2005 and 2009. 10 Both the BEP1 and BEP2
    were designed to complement the government’s effort in addressing inequity in learning
    environment of preschools and basic schools across countries. This complementarity was strategic
    and cost-effective. The largest amount of the project cost—US$ 29.9 million (of which IDA US$
    22.8)—was spent on the provision of learning materials and resources, and the project was designed
    to ensure that these inputs be used effectively by complementing with school-based teacher and
    director training and the activation of school boards. It is essential that the project is designed to
    involve teachers and school boards in the selection of learning materials because they need to align
    with the needs, interests and abilities of the learners, about whom teachers and parents know the
    best.

21. Learning outcomes are influenced by many factors at the student and school level, primarily
    interactions with people (teachers and peers) and instructional materials (textbooks, workbooks,
    instructional software, web-based content, homework, projects, quizzes, and tests). Instruction
    materials have a direct influence on student learning via their effects on teachers. Teachers vary

  The average education-related expenditure per student in basic education in 2000 was more than the poverty level monthly expenditure on
food (World Bank, 2007, Republic of Uzbekistan: Living Standards Assessment Update, p. 89).

10
   Salaries for general education teachers annually went up by 40 to 50 percent between 2005 and 2009 before slowing down, yet
substantial, to 32 % (2010), 27 % (2011) and 15 % (2012) annual increases.




                                                                    29
      considerably in the way they use textbooks, teacher’s guides, and assessment materials, but in
      general, teachers are much more likely to cover topics presented in the selected materials.
      Instructional materials exercise their influence on learning directly as well as by influencing
      teachers’ instructional choices and behavior. 11 For instance, the relationship between learning
      outcomes and related factors can be examined on a comparable basis across countries using Program
      for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 data. PISA tests 15 year olds in mathematics,
      reading, and science. Although Uzbekistan did not participate in PISA 2009, other countries in the
      region were included in the study, such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and the
      Russian Federation. The PISA results demonstrate that it is crucial for schools to have a minimum
      level of resources in order to achieve results, though beyond that threshold, additional resources may
      no longer affect test scores. 12

22. Without the project investment in learning materials and associated activities, the government’s
    investment in infrastructure and teacher salaries alone would have resulted in less effective to impact
    on student learning. Uzbekistan has about 394,000 general education teachers and 33,000 preschool
    teachers, of which 59,147 benefitted from training under the project. Teacher performance is a
    strong catalyst for student learning, which is one of the most important metrics in looking at the
    efficiency of an education system. According to an observation of teacher training and teaching
    practices in classroom, by improving skills and competence in using newly acquired educational
    materials and training aids, teachers in project pilot schools were observed to have adopted active
    teaching methods, student-centered and participatory learning, and classroom assessments, compared
    to those in control schools(see Table 1). 13 Results from classroom observation indicate that teacher
    training had a large impact on improving teaching and learning techniques applied in the classroom
    which is anticipated to positively impact student learning in the future. The classroom observation
    also suggests, however, that the investment could have been more cost effective if there were more
    training and support to teachers in using complicated materials (which were less popular among
    teachers due to difficulties in using them) and also to school directors in monitoring and evaluation
    of teaching practices by teachers.

Public spending on education and project investment

23. The project provided substantial benefits to Uzbekistan’s education budget for general secondary
    schools. In 2009, the government allocated recurrent budget of US$ 1,310 million to basic education
    and US$ 248 million to preschool education, and capital budget (i.e., SEDP) of US$ 382 million to
    basic education. Of the recurrent budget, around 25 percent was allocated to personnel training,
    while most of the remaining was spent on wages. It is estimated only about 5 percent of non-training
    recurrent budget (approximately US$ 49 million for basic education and US$ 9 million to preschool)
    was allocated to non-wage items. In 2011, whereas the recurrent spending increased to US$ 1,834
    million for basic education and US$ 334 million for preschool education, capital budget dropped to
    US$ 198 million, as expected partly due to the international economic crisis then. Assuming that 75
    percent of the recurrent budget was allocated to non-training spending and 5 percent of which was
    allocated to non-wage items, about US$ 69 million for basic education and US$ 13 million for
    preschool, respectively were spent on non-wage recurrent items. Compared to the government’s own
    education budget on non-wage, non-training recurrent spending, the project’s contribution of US$
    29.9 million to enhance learning and teaching materials, US$ 1.4 million for strengthening school-
    based training, and strengthening school boards, and providing competitive grants for school
    improvement (US$ 2.7 million) were substantial. Due to the importance and effectiveness of these
    investment, the recently approved Global Partnership for Education Project: Improving Pre-primary
    and General Secondary Education (US$ 23.2 million out of US$ 49.9 million in total) will continue
    investing in training activities for teachers and school managers and increasing the availability of
    adequate equipment and teaching and learning materials for general secondary education schools
    offering grades 5-9 in rural areas.

Per capita financing reform

24. In 2007, the government decided to adopt a new way of financing schools, and began implementing
    per capita financing (PCF) of schools to reduce inequities in the distribution of expenditures and
    increase the efficiency and equity of school financing. With support from the First Basic Education
    Project (BEP1), the government began implementing PCF in 2008 in Bukhara and Ferghana Oblasts
    and Tashkent City; and work was underway to extend per capita financing to three additional oblasts
    in 2009. As part of these reforms, the responsibility for budget allocations for basic education
    schools was transferred from Ministry of Public Education (MoPE) and its regional departments to
    the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and its regional departments. Basic education schools were declared
    legal entities and school directors became the primary administrators of budgetary funds and the
    Director’s fund for top-up of teacher salaries.


                                                           31
25. An evaluation of the PCF reform suggests that its implementation has resulted in “rationalization and
    optimization of budget expenditures (reduction of unnecessary staff positions, resupply of classes,
    economical use of funds for utilities, etc.),” 14 and its impact is sustainable and significant. The
    Ministry of Finance data for select Oblasts demonstrates that introduction of PCF improved financial
    allocation per student so that there was less than 10 percent variance between oblasts, which marks a
    huge improvement beyond the baseline of 60 percent at beginning of project. Although
    improvements were small in many cases, the student-teacher ratio and the average class size also
    improved in all of the 14 regions 15 in the country. From 2009 to 2012, the average teacher to student
    ratio increased from 11.3 to 12.1 (7.1 percent increase), and the average class size increase from 25.1
    students to 25.5 (see Table 2). Of the total basic education budget of USD 1,834 million in 2011
    (data for 2012 is not available), it can be estimated that USD 1,284 (70 percent) was spent on teacher
    salaries. Assuming that the STR was 12.1 in 2011, USD 91 million (7.1 percent of the teacher
    salaries) was saved due to the improvement in the STR, compared to the teacher salaries at the same
    STR as that in 2009. The saving in 2012 would have been more because the total budget was higher
    than in 2011, though the precise data is not available. USD 91 million saving is more than three
    times as much as the total project credit amount (USD 28 million).

26. The BEP2 was designed to support the government’s expansion of PCF to three additional oblasts,
    Namanghan, Syrdarya and Khorezm Oblasts. However, after the successful implementation of the
    PCF under the BEP1, the government decided to accelerate the reform and expand it nationwide
    using its own fund rather than slowly expanding under the BEP2. Because of this government’s
    decision to institutionalize the successful reform initiated under the previous project, the BEP2’s
    fund was no longer needed to carry out most of its planned activities related to PCF. As a result, a
    negligible amount of funds for this component was disbursed, but this result should be rather
    welcome and positively evaluated as the project’s objective to implement PCF was achieved in a
    bigger scale than the project originally intended. On the other hand, the government has not
    produced or disseminated an evaluation report on the outcomes of the PCF reform, which is one of
    the PDO indicators.

27. The Government’s report describes the project background and design, including its objectives and
    components; as well as changes to the project during implementation including revisions to Project
    Outcome Indicators and the reprogramming of funds under Component 1 following savings through
    procurement.

28. With respect to the achievement of Project Development Objectives, the Government noted:
    • all 1,501 project schools (100%) received all (100%) planned teaching-learning materials for
       Grades 5-9 based on requests from schools.
    • more than 62,000 teachers and school principals were trained, exceeding the target of 50,000
       teachers.
    • nearly all teachers are using effectively the learning materials and resources required under the
       project, as observed by an independent evaluation; this greatly exceeded the target of 50%.
       Effective use is highest among teachers trained by the project.
    • 76% of trained teachers (vs. 62% of non-trained) use interactive teaching methods and critical
       and creative thinking development methods. For preschool teachers, these indicators are 85%
       among trained teachers and 66% among those not trained. These results exceed the 60% target.
    • School boards of 98% of schools who won competitive funding fulfilled all events specified in
       the school improvement plan.
    • Per capita financing was introduced nationwide, and deviations from budget estimates according
       to the formula were detected only in 8% of schools.
    • The Grade 4 mathematics score in project score increased from 486 in 2008 to 500 in 2013 (494
       to 502 in non-project schools). In Reading, the scores were 482 in 2008 and 480 in 2013 in
       project schools (502 and 485, respectively, for non-project schools).

29. The results of the project were disseminated and discussed at a Republic Conference in March, 2014
    attended by stakeholders, indicating the high level of public education sector accountability.

30. With respect to project implementation, the report notes that it gained from BEP-1 experience to
    conduct appropriate monitoring and evaluation. Under BEP-2, the project used international and
    national technical assistance to design, build capacities in, and execute a standardized learning
    assessment; and hired an independent firm to evaluate training effectiveness and the use of teaching-
    learning materials. The MoPE regularly reported on implementation and results, and plans to use
    survey results to improve teaching/learning process and quality of education. There was regular
    monitoring of schools in terms of their provision with learning materials for grades 5-9 and their use
    by teachers.

31. With respect to fiduciary requirements, the Bank’s initial assessment of financial management
    capacities concluded that financial management arrangements for BEP 2 were adequate in terms of
    staffing, budgeting and internal controls. At the time of initial assessment, however, the accounting
    system was not capable of supporting the preparation of regular and reliable financial statements.
    Following implementation of the action plan agreed during the assessment, the project accounting
    system was modified and was able to process all financial transactions under BEP 2 and develop
    interim financial reports. Further adequate mitigating measures were added, including making the
    project accounting system fully operational with built-in controls and updating the Operational


                                                   37
   Manual (OM) to include detailed requirements to the management of competitive school grants (FM
   procedures, accounting, reporting, internal controls and audit requirements).

32. With respect to procurement, the Bank’s initial assessment concluded that the local procurement
    consultant and the international specialist hired under BEP 1 had gained sufficient working
    knowledge of World Bank procurement procedures and guidelines to carry out activities
    successfully, but MoPE had insufficient DSE staff to provide adequate support to the
    implementation of activities under BEP in a timely manner. During project implementation, MoPE
    had overall responsibility for procurement functions, with support of a local and international
    consultant and DSE participation. All procurement under the project were carried out in accordance
    with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published in
    May 2004 and revised in October 2006 (Procurement Guidelines); and the provisions stipulated in
    the Financing Agreement.

33. With respect to post-completion operations, the Government noted:
    • the SBTT strategy (Component 2) has been adopted to support teachers between regular
       professional development trainings.
    • a large number of school boards, using acquired knowledge and skills under Component 3, are
       able to find sponsors, develop new project proposals for teaching implement, and win grants for
       these purposes.
    • per capita financing has been introduced throughout the Republic. To facilitate its ongoing
       implementation, the Ministry of Finance developed an automated accounting system for
       budgetary units (UzASBO) designed for computerized accounting for public education,
       healthcare, higher education, and financial institutions.
