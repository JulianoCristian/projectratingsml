                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR. The project has made good overall progress towards achieving its goals. The key achievements are listed below:

                         (1) Selected general secondary education schools and pre-schools in rural areas have been successfully supported through targeted interventions. Successful interventions were

                         aimed at (i) enhancing schoolsâ€™ learning environment by provision of teaching and learning materials (TLMs) in 2,195 schools (against an original target of 1501 schools) ; (ii)
                         improving the quality of teaching through upgrading teacher training programs and developing Schools Based Teacher Training (SBTT) model ( which trained 3,102 pre-school and
                         school leaders, and 59,346 pre-school and school teachers); (iii) greater community engagement in the school development through supporting School Boards and provision of small
                         grants ( which were awarded to 500 competitively selected schools).

                         (2) The project contributed to improving education system monitoring through building assessment capacity in the country. Two rounds of student assessments of Grade 4 were
                         successfully carried out.

                         (3) The education financing system has been improved (using the Banks technical advice in the initial stages) through designing of a per capita based financing of the general
                         education schools which the government implemented and monitored on its own across the entire country.

                         On March 27, 2014, the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) successfully held a closing conference with participation of key stakeholders including representatives from the regions
                         and development partners.
