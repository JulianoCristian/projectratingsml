                         Implementation Status Overview
                         It is likely that the project will reach its Project Development Objective (PDO), if implementation of key activities such as School Based Teacher Training (SBTT), School Grants,
                         procurement and use of Teaching and Learning Materials (TMLR), implementation and assessment of Per-capita Financing (PCF) for Schools, and Student Assessments continue
                         to make satisfactory progress. The mission is pleased to report that SBTT is at an advanced stage of design, and a pilot is planned for September 2012. Similarly, the implementation

                         of Schools Grants has picked up pace and applications from schools for the third and last phase of the School Grants are now being received. The award of grants is expected to
                         take place ahead of the start of the school year in September 2012. Teaching and Learning materials for all project schools have been procured and are in the possession of the
                         Ministry of Public Education (MPE). These materials are on track for delivery to schools by September 2012. Improved implementation of project activities has been accompanied by
                         an increase in disbursements from 7% to 44% of loan value, significantly reducing the disbursement lag.

                         However, activities in support of student assessments continue to face design and implementation challenges thereby imperiling two of the three PDO indicators that rely on these
                         assessment being done on time. The third PDO indicator pertains to the implementation of per-capita financing (PCF) in schools of six Oblasts, and an evaluation of its usage . While
                         the Government has implemented PCF all over Uzbekistan, there has been no formal assessment of the effectiveness of this approach, and there appears to be no movement
                         towards this end. In addition it is noted with concern that while 9.6 million USD have been available for reallocation since the start of the year, the Government has not yet reached a
                         decision on how to use these funds, thereby delaying the restructuring of the project.

                         Given the slow progress in activities associated with the PDO indicators (Student assessments and PCF implementation assessment), the progress towards PDO is rated as MU.
                         However this rating may be upgraded as activities in support of students assessment and PCF implementation assessment pick up pace. The appropriateness of PDO indicators may
                         be revisited at the Mid-Term Review (MTR ) because at present they are heavily reliant on a very limited number of project activities. The MTR is planned for October 2012, and
                         will also be an appropriate time to undertake the restructuring of the project subject to a Government request in this regard.
