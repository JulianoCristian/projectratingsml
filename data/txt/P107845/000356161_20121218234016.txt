     BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT SECOND PHASE (CREDIT NO. 4598-UZ)
                      RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      The Uzbekistan’s Basic Education Project Phase II (BEP 2) is financed by an
International Development Association (IDA) credit in the amount of US$ 28 million.
BEP 2’s Project Development Objective (PDO) is to continue supporting the Recipient
efforts to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning through: (i) targeted
interventions in selected general secondary education schools and preschools in poor,
rural areas; (ii) development of institutional capacity to assess student learning; and (iii)
adoption of predictable and transparent school budgets in selected oblasts.

2.      This Restructuring Paper seeks management approval (i) to a request from the
GoU dated October 9, 2012 to restructure the BEP 2 i.e. to use project savings of US $
9.53 million to expand activities under Component 1 (Providing Learning Materials and
Resources for Grades 5 through 9 of General Secondary Schools); (ii) to adjust the
Project’s Results Framework to better align it with Project-financed activities especially
since the Project will no longer finance the follow-on student assessment for Grade 8 and
will finance the evaluation of per-capita financing in schools across the entire country.
The PDO will remain the same.

B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      The BEP 2 was approved by the Board on June 23, 2009, in the amount of US$
28,000,000, and it became effective on March 11, 2010. Project implementation started
slowly with disbursement of only 12.4% of credit value in 2011 two years after the
effectiveness date. As result of improved implementation planning since March 2012,
Project performance has improved and the total amount of disbursement has reached
50.6% of total credit value.

4.     The Project is organized into five components:

Component 1: Providing Learning Materials and Resources for Grades 5 through 9
of General Secondary Schools (Total estimated cost US$ 29.9 million of which IDA
is US$ 22.8 million). The objective of this component is to improve the quality of
teaching and learning in project schools through effective use of learning materials and
resources acquired under the Project.

Component 2: Strengthening School-based Training for Teachers and Directors in
Preschools and General Secondary Schools (Total estimated cost US$ 1.4 million of
which IDA is US$ 1.0 million). The objective of this component is to change teaching in
project preschools and schools towards a more interactive, student-centered approach to
improve learning outcomes.

Component 3: Strengthening School Boards and Providing Competitive Grants to
Selected Schools for School Improvement (Total estimated cost US$ 2.7 million of
                                                                                            5
which IDA is US$ 2.7 million). The objective of this component is to further increase
the involvement of school boards in project schools and provide competitive funding for
school improvement.

Component 4: Improving Education Financing, Budgeting and Management (Total
estimated cost US$0.5 million of which IDA is US$0.3 million). The objective of this
component is to improve education financing, budgeting, and school management in
selected oblasts.

Component 5: Supporting Project Management and Results Management (Total
estimated cost US$ 1.5 million of which IDA is US$ 1.2 million). The objective of this
component is to support project management, implement national standardized
assessment of student learning, and evaluate project effectiveness.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

5.    The following changes are proposed to activities financed under project
components to project design:

Component 1: Providing Learning Materials and Resources for Grades 5 through 9 of
General Secondary Schools (US$ 22.8 million). The Government is proposing to
increase the scope of this component to support 694 additional schools, from the original
1,501 envisioned under the original project design. The 694 additional schools would be
located in oblasts targeted by the Project and would be selected on the basis of previously
agreed criteria1; they would benefit from multimedia classrooms equipped with modern
desktop computers and other ICT devices to allow teachers and students to use
contextualized digital learning content. This is possible because an amount of US$9.53
million was saved after the successful completion of the procurement processes of goods.

Component 4: Improving Education Financing, Budgeting and Management (US$ 0.3
million). Instead of an evaluation of the phased roll-out of per capita financing in six
oblasts as originally envisaged, this component would finance a rigorous evaluation of
the per-capita financing (PCF) of schools across the entire country.

Component 5: Project Management and Results Management (US$ 1.2 million).
Given the revised implementation timeframes, particularly those related to the
procurement and delivery of teaching and learning materials for Grades 5 to 9, it is no
longer technically relevant to carry out a student assessment for Grade 8 and attribute any
changes to the Project. As such, this Restructuring Paper proposes to drop this activity.




6.       Revision of the Results Framework

1
 The schools will be selected if a). they didn’t receive any equipment or learning materials procured using
Project funds; and b) have either no or outdated ICT equipment.
                                                                                                          6
The PDO is currently measured by three PDO-level indicators:

  i.    An increase in learning outcomes in Grade 4 that is greater in project schools than
        in non-project schools as measured by a new standardized test of learning
        achievement available for a sample of students in project and non-project schools.
 ii.    National standardized assessments of student learning carried out periodically in
        Grades 4 and 8 with report analyzing and disseminating the results.
iii.    Per-capita financing implemented in six oblasts with report analyzing and
        disseminating the results.

7.      The restructuring proposes the following revisions that have been agreed with the
client during mission, to the second and third PDO indicators:

   i.   To drop Grade 8 assessments from the second indicator so that it would read:
        National standardized sample-based assessments of student learning carried out
        in Grade 4 with report analyzing and disseminating the results. As mentioned
        above, the Project is no longer funding a follow-on assessment of Grade 8, so this
        indicator is amended accordingly. The corresponding intermediate indicators are
        also changed.

  ii.   To expand the scope of the third indicator so that it would read: Per-capita
        financing implemented with report analyzing and disseminating the results. As
        mentioned above, the Government has already implemented per-capita financing
        nationwide without using the Bank’s technical assistance or financing. Thus, there
        is no longer a need to refer to a specific number of oblasts, which would have
        been relevant if phased implementation was carried out as originally envisaged.
