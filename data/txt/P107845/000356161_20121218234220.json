This\n            restructuring paper seeks management approval: to a request\n            from the GoU dated October 9, 2012 to restructure the Second\n            Basic Education Project (BEP 2) i.e. to use project savings\n            of US $ 9.53 million to expand activities under component\n            one; and to adjust the project's results framework to\n            better align it with project-financed activities especially\n            since the project will no longer finance the follow-on\n            student assessment for grade eight and will finance the\n            evaluation of per-capita financing in schools across the\n            entire country."}, "docdt": "2012-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
