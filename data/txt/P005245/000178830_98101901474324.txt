JORDAN
FIRST POWER PROJECT
Appraisal of the Hussein Thermal Power Project
Jordan Electricity Authority
Summary and Conclusions
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Hussein Thermal Power Project
of the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), the Government entity established
in 1967 to provide for coordinated development of the power sector. JEA has
requested assistance from the Association and Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (Kuwait Fund) in jointly financing the project.
ii.       The project comprises a thermal power station, located at Zarqa
about 42 km northeast of Amman, the capital of Jordan, with two 33 MW steam-
electric units, and a 12-MW gas turbine to provide urgently needed interim
capacity. Consultant services for management and studies to assist JEA in
reorganizing and enlarging its establishment would also be included.
iii.      The cost of the project is estimated to be US$24.7 million, of which
the foreign exchange cost is US$20.4 million equivalent. The foreign cost
would be financed by an IDA Credit of US$10.2 million and a Kuwait Fund Loan
for an equal amount. Both the credit and the loan would be made to the
Jordanian Government and relent to JEA on conventional terms commensurate
with Bank (7-1/4%) and Kuwait Fund (6%) practices. The local cost of the
project and related works would be covered by funds from the Government,
which would capitalize these as equity contributions as well as the existing
Government loans for JEA's preliminary expenses.
iv.       During the construction of the project, JEA would also undertake
to construct a transmission system essential for the transfer of bulk power
from Zarqa to Amman, estimated to cost about US$5.5 million (US$4 million in
foreign exchange). The Government is seeking bilateral assistance for fi-
nancing this system. If such bilateral assistance should not be forthcoming
it would make other arrangements for financing, acceptable to IDA, to provide
the necessary funds to complete the system prior to commissioning of the
steam-electric plant.
v.        The electricity sector of Jordan is presently not well planned or
organized, is divided between two major regional concessions and many small
local entities and service is rather unreliable. An important objective of
the proposed Credit is therefore to achieve an economical and reliable service
by encouraging the Government to organize JEA as a truly autonomous Govern-
ment entity responsible for all major generation and overall planning.
vi.       Initially, JEA will supply power in bulk solely to the Jordanian
Electricity Power Company (JEPCO), which operates 3 diesel power stations



- ii -
and distributes electricity in the Amman concession area. An extension of
the bulk supply to the Irbid District Power Company (IDECO), which operates
diesel stations and distributes power in the Irbid concession area, should
be justified by 1978/79.
vii.      JEPCO's load growth averaged some 13% annually between 1963 and
1969, but in 1970 came to a virtual standstill due to the civil disturbances.
There is a great deal of pent-up demand in Jordan but future load growth
will depend on the political and economic stability of the area. For this
reason three alternative load growth patterns have been considered viz: low,
probable, and high. The probable growth rate of sales is 13-15% until the
end of this decade.
viii.     Power development in Jordan has been on the basis of diesel genera-
tion and the country has no significant sources of hydro power that can be
readily developed. The alternative to continued diesel development is there-
fore steam. For this reason, the project, which comprises an all-steam de-
velopment, was compared with continued diesel development up to 100 NW in new
capacity followed by steam. The equalizing discount rate, reflecting the
range of uncertainties up to which the all-steam development would be more
economic than a diesel steam development, ranges between 9% and 15.3% and is
about 13.5% for the most probable growth rate.
ix.       Although the equalizing discount rate is highly sensitive to the
growth rate of demand, it is relatively insensitive to the actual timing of
the changeover to steam. The sector is presently served by a multiplicity of
relatively small diesel units and to delay this change would (i) increase the
physical difficulties of operating an ever growing number of diesels, (ii) in-
creasingly raise the capital requirements for the changeover to steam, and
(iii) make more and more diesel capacity obsolete at the time of the change
because not more than about 50% of all diesel plant available at that time
would be required as a reserve. The Association, therefore, concurs with
the Government's decision to move ahead with a steam development at this
time.
x.        The installation of an intermediate gas turbine, to meet peaking
and standby requirement in 1974 and 1975 is justified because the cost to
the economy of failing to install intermediate plant would exceed the cost
of the gas turbine (estimated at US$2.2 million) by at least 10%.
xi.       The financial forecast indicates that JEA, as well as its only
consumer, JEPCO, should be able to maintain a satisfactory financial posi-
tion after the project goes into operation.
xii.      Procurement is following the Bank Group's Guidelines, and bids have
been received for major equipment. The project is expected to be completed
by early 1977.
xiii.     In view of the agreement reached with the Government and JEA as set
forth in Section 7, the proposed project would constitute a suitable basis
for an IDA Credit of US$10.2 million equivalent to be relent to J.E.A. by the
Government at 7-1/4% interest and repayed over a period of 25 years, including
a grace period of 3-1/2 years.



JORDAN
Appraisal of the Hussein Thermal Power Project
of the Jordan Electricity Authority
1. Introduction
1.01      The Government of Jordan has requested the International Development
Association (IDA) and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (Kuwait
Fund) to jointly assist in financing a project comprising a 66-MW steam-
electric plant and a 12-MW gas turbine to be located at Zarqa near Amman, the
capital of Jordan. A credit of US$10.2 million is proposed to cover 50% of
the foreign exchange cost of the project, the total cost of which is about
US$24.7 million. A Kuwait Fund loan would finance the remaining 502 of the
foreign exchange cost. The Government would relend the proceeds from the
IDA credit and the Kuwait Fund loan to the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA),
a Government-owned entity, for a period of 25 years, including grace periods
of 3-1/2 and 5 years respectively. Disbursements from the proposed IDA credit
and the Kuwait Fund loan would be made on a 50/50 basis after both loans
became effective. Neither the Bank nor IDA has previously lent for power
in Jordan.
1.02      The project first came to the attention of IDA in 1969 when the
Government requested IDA's assistance in financing the proposed steam station.
The Government had previously obtained the assistance of the US Agency for
International Development (USAID) in financing a feasibility study for instal-
lation of a large thermal power station at Zarqa; it was to be designed to
operate in conjunction with a proposed hydroelectric power station at Shuneh
on the Yarmouk River in north Jordan and a 132-kV transmission system inter-
connecting Amman, Jerusalem, Nablus and Irbid. The Jordan Electricity
Authority (JEA) was established in 1967 to construct and operate these facil-
ities. These plans had to be modified because of the June 1967 war, and the
consultants who were preparing the feasibility study were instructed to take
into account the occupation of the West Bank and omit from the consideration
the hydroelectric potential at Shuneh. Parallel with this change the Govern-
ment had instructed Messrs. Preece, Cardew and Rider, of the United Kingdom
(U.K.), who had prepared the original report on the associated 132-kV trans-
mission requirements, to modify their study accordingly.
1.03      On the basis of these revised studies, the project was first
appraised by Messrs. A.E. Bailey and F. Rydell in June 1971 shortly after
the civil disturbances which occurred at the end of 1970. The effect of
these disturbances on development and consequently on the electricity market
was at that time still highly uncertain and the Association concluded that
construction of the thermal plant at Zarqa would not be the most economical



-2-
use of resources to meet Jordan's immediate power requirements. However,
by the middle of 1972 it appeared that the market had recovered and that a
sustained high growth rate of demand for electricity could be expected. In
October 1972 the Government requested IDA and the Kuwait Fund to reappraise
the project.
1.04      This report is based on an updated feasibility study prepared by
the Kuljian Corporation (Kuljian) of the USA, JEA's consultants for the
project, information supplied by JEA and the Jordanian Electricity Company
(JEPCO) of Amman during an appraisal by Messrs. W.F. Kiipper and A.J.D.
Hutchins, who visited Jordan in November/December 1972.
2. THE POWER SECTOR
General
2.01      The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is divided by the Jordan River into
two main areas -- the agriculturally oriented West Bank and the more econom-
ically diversified East Bank. As the West Bank has been under Israeli occu-
pation since June 1967, this report confines the study area to the East Bank,2
which comprises some 91,000 km2 of the country's total land area of 97,000 km
The population of the East Bank, now estimated to be 1.7 million, includes
about 700,000 people who live in cities and towns of more than 2,000 inhab-
itants and over 500,000 displaced persons living in refugee camps.
2.02      Most of Jordan's East Bank population is concentrated in the Northern
part, in an area of about 7,500 km2. Development has been confined almost en-
tirely to this area apart from a small area around Aqaba in the south, Jordan's
only outlet to the sea.
2.03      The best aRricultural area in the East Bank region is the floor of
the Jordan Valley where citrus fruits and bananas are grown. East of this
valley the terrain rises toward the fringe of the desert. The Irbid area
in the north produces wheat and other grain crops. Phosphate rock, quarried
from one of the world's richest deposits, is the principal developed resource
of the East Bank region.
2.04      Before the Arab-Israeli war in June 1967, buoyant growth took place
in all sectors. The war interrupted these favorable trends but the Government
took action to alleviate the difficulties from the war and its aftermath and
growth returned rapidly to the pre-1967 trend. Civil disturbances in the
second half of 1970, however, brought the economy virtually to a standstill
and power service was interrupted in the Amman area for some time. Since
1970 the Government's actions have helped substantially to restore a confi-
dent investment climate. As a consequence, present demand for power is well
above past trends.



-3-
Energy Resources
2.05      Jordan has few natural energy resources.  There are no coal deposits
nor any known deposits of oil. The only indigenous energy resources are (a)
a small hydro-power potential of about 5 21W, on the Zarqa River, which is
associated with an irrigation program for the Jordan Valley where construction
of a dam has been started but the execution of the power component has not
yet been considered, and (b) a hydro-power potential of about 46 MW at Shuneh
on the Yarmuk River in North Jordan. A feasibility study on the latter
project (hydro-electric and irrigation) was carried out by Energoprojekt of
Yugoslavia and work had commenced, but the project had to be abandoned in
June 1967 when Israel occupied the opposite bank of the river.
2.06      Oil is the main source of commercial energy and is imported under
an agreement with the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company (Tapline) for the tran-
sit of oil from Saudi Arabia through Jordan to the Mediterranean. The oil
is conveyed by pipe from Tapline to the Jordan Refinery, located at Zarqa,
in which the Government has a majority shareholding. The diesel stations
use mainly residual fuel oil although they also use some gas oil. Both are
supplied by the refinery in road tankers throug out the country at a fixed
base price equivalent to about 58.0 US cents/10 BTU (about $23.00/ton) for
residual oil and US$1.26/106 BTU (about US$54.28/ton) for gas oil. On
contracts for larger supplies a small discount is granted, for the power
company in Amman this amounts to about 5% for residual oil and 2% on gas oil.
Characteristics of the Sector
2.07      Power supply in Jordan is generally on a local basis, not well planned
or organized and rather unreliable. Most of the plants are small, catering to
small communities and to private industry. The generating facilities are in
most cases derated due to cooling problems and are badly maintained. Annex 1
gives available data on power installations in the country. The rated distribu-
tion voltage throughout the country is 220/380 V, three-phase, four wire, at
50 Hz.
2.08      In Northern Jordan where almost the entire population of the East
Bank lives, public electricity supplies are provided by JEPCO (Amman) and the
Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO), both Jordanian private sector
companies, in their respective concession areas. The number of consumers
supplied by these two companies as of January 1, 1973, was about 96,600, of
whom 73,800 or 76% were supplied by JEPCO and 22,800 or 24% by IDECO. JEPCO
supplies the area with the greatest growth potential, including the capital
city of Amman and the Zarqa industrial area. The area supplied by IDECO is
mainly agriculturally oriented. Under the terms of their concessions, the
companies have been extending their respective 33-kV networks during the past
few years to supply outlying towns and villages (see Annex 2). The existing
facilities of both companies are discussed below (2.12 through 2.15).
2.09      In South Jordan, electricity supply is provided by isolated under-
takings, the largest public one being the Aqaba Port Authority which supplies



-4-
a peak demand of about 3 MW. The Jordan Phosphate Company, which has a load
of some 5 MW, generates its own requirements near its mine at Al Hasa.
2.1()     Private power capacity operating in the Amman area (Annex 1) is
estimated to be about the same as JEPCO's total installed capacity.  The
largest private plants are the Jordan Cement Company (14 MW), about 20 km
south-west of Amman, and the refinery at Zarqa (4.3 MW). There are a number
of small private plants, some of which are used for emergency standby only.
In the Jordan Valley there are about 200 small pumping stations, all operated
by small individual diesels, aggregating at least 1,500 kW.
2.11      Statistics for JEPCO's and IDECO electricity generation and supply
as shown in Annexes 3 through 6 can be summarized as follows for the 4 years
1967-1972:
--JEPCO -----                 ----------IDECO---------

/1   Would have been some 20-25% including refinery (see below).
The effects of the 1970 civil disturbances on the power market are clearly
visible in the above table, particularly for JEPCO which, even during 1971,
had not yet returned to its average growth rate in sales of some 13%. In
1971, the situation was further aggravated for JEPCO when the refinery in-
stalled its own 4.8 M1 of plant to provide the reliability of supply necessary
for its operating requirements. But for the loss of this 12 GWh load, sales
would have increased some 20-25% in that year. The two major private industries
in the JFPCO area --- the Jordan Cement Company and the Jordan Oil Refinery --
now privately generate some 75 GWh annually (equal to 60% of JEPCO's estimated
1972 sales) at an aggregate maximum demand of some 10 MW (equal to 33% of
JEPCO's 1971 demand). The rapid growth of IDECO's sales in 1971.and 1972 was
due mainly to extension of the 33-kV system to new areas and areas where there
were existing loads supplied from private plants.
Jordanian Electricity Power Company
2.12      JEPCO operates 3 diesel stations in the Amman area (Annex 7):
(a) the base loaded Marqa station near Amman has 8 units originally
aggregating about 35 WN in capacity now derated to 27 4W;



-5-
(b) the Abdali station at Zarqa comprises 6 units, originally
aggregating 5.8 MW now derated to 4.5 NW; and
(c)  the Ras-al-Ain power station in Amman, the oldest of the three
stations, with 10 units, derated from about 5.3 MW to 4.4 MW.
JEPCO also operates an isolated undertaking at Madaba, southwest of Amman, to
which 2 small Abdali units will be transferred as soon as a new 6-NW;
diesel unit enters service in the Marqa station.  The Abdali and Ras-al-Ain
power stations are scheduled to be retired and sold when the proposed new
Zarqa power station is commissioned.
2.13      Transmission and distribution follows the European pattern:  power
is transmitted at 33 kV and subtransmitted at 6.6 kV, except in Zarqa, where
the intermediate voltage is 10 kV. The distribution voltage is 220/380V.
JEPCO's supply network comprises some 200 km of 33-kV and 6.6-kV lines and
about 130 km of 6.6-kV underground cable.
Irbid District Electricity Company
2.14      IDE00 operates a diesel station in Irbid and some small diesel sta-
tions aggregating some 670 kW (derated to 500 kW) in townships that are con-
nected to the 33-kV network. It also operates one small isolated undertaking
(North Shunah) in the Jordan Valley and a second is under construction at
El-Mashari.  The Irbid power station comprises 6 units totaling 4.4 NW derated
to 4 MW.
2.15      IDECO transmits power at 33 kV and 6.6 kV (partly underground cable),
distributing at 220/380 V, 50 Hz. It presently operates some 150 km of 33-kV
lines and 42 km of 6.6-kV lines and underground cables.
Future Developments
2.16      In addition to the proposed project, JEA proposes to construct a
40 km long double circuit 132-kV transmission line to Amman with a step-up
substation at Zarqa and 2 step-down substations in Amman (at Marqa, and at
Bayader somewhat east of the city), with provisions for future extensions to
form a ring main for Amman.
2.17      JEPCO is executing its 1971-1975 development program (Annex 2) under
which three 6-NW diesel units are scheduled for commissioning before the end
of 1973. IDECO, with U.K. financial assistance is continuing to expand its
33-kV system and expects to complete a new diesel station with three 2.8-MW
diesel units by the end of 1974.
2.18      Demand is expected to exceed JEPCO's firm capacity by 1974 and JEA
would meet JEPCO's peaking requirements for 1974 and 1975 with the gas turbine
proposed for financing under this credit. In early 1976 the Hussein station
would meet all of JEPCO's requirements and, under a special contract with JEA



- 6 -
(see 6.11), JEPCO would operate its Marqa power station as directed by JEA,
mainly for peaking and standby purposes. By about 1978 a third 33-MW unit
will probably be required in the Hussein station and by that time the connec-
tion of the Irbid system to the JEA system may also be justified.
2.19      The Government recently announced its 3 year Rehabilitation and
Development Plan for the Jordan Valley (see Annex 2).  The power facilities
would be supplied from IDECO's system in the north and from JEPCO's system
in the south.  The estimated load, increasing from 6.5 MW in 1975 to 16 MW
by 1980, has not been taken into account in JEPCO's and IDECO's load forecasts
until firmer information is available on the execution of the Plan. The in-
creased demand for power in the Jordan Valley will depend on progress in
implementing the Plan and the extent to which the forecast influx of popula-
tion is achieved. It has not been included in the justification of the IDA
project.
2.20      The power sector is the responsibility of the Ministry of National
Economy (which has a small Electricity Department) and is governed by a num-
ber of concession contracts and licenses, and the Jordan Electricity Law of
1967 which created JEA. Concurrently with the preparation of the JEA law a
General Electricity Law was prepared which, however, was never promulgated
in the aftermath of the 1967 war.
2.21      During the appraisal the subject of the desirability of regulating
the sector within the framework of a General Electricity Law, and of particu-
lar problems arising from the JEA law (see 6.09 and 6.12), were discussed with
the Government and during negotiations the Government undertook to:
(a)  review the JEA law and propose appropriate legislative
action for amending this law so as to allow JEA to develop
into an autonomous agency, subject only to the direction
of the Minister of National Economy in respect to specified
matters of sufficient general importance to merit Ministerial
decisions;
(b)  initiate appropriate legislative action and present by
September 30, 1974, its proposals to the Legislature for
enactment of a General Electricity Law to regulate the
power sector; such law to set out the principles and basic
requirements for, inter alia, generation, transmission and
distribution of power (including concessions and licenses),
tariffs, easements, inspection and testing, a unified
accounting system, the collection of statistics and the
preparation of technical information;
(c)  make available to the Association its proposals for the
said Law sufficiently in advance for the Association's
comment; and
(d)  formulate such regulations or bylaws as may be necessary to
achieve the objectives of said Law including the delegation
to JEA of regulatory functions of a technical nature.



Tariffs
2.22      As outlined in Annex S a simple and uniform tariff structure prevails
throughout the country, comprising block rates only, which presently appear
adequate to aclhieve the required level of revenue. However, consultants for
both JEPCO and I1frlO have recommended that the tariffs be modernized by the
introduction of special industrial two part tariffs which should also relate
to supply voltage. The Association shares this view, but agrees with the Gov-
ernment that the appropriate time for such a study would be at the end of 1973,
or early 1974, when the effects of IDECO's new power station on its costs, and
the implications of JEA's supplies to JEPCO from the new Zarqa thermal plant,
can be assessed on a firmer basis than at present. For this reason the pro-
posed credit includes a study to rnake recommendations to the Government not
later than D)ecember 31, 1974 for JEA's future bulk sales tariff and for a
modern retail tariff structure including in both cases the provision of a
fuel price adjustment clause (see 6.13) which could be-implemented through-
out the country. The achievement of a broadly comparable and reasonable rate
of return for JEA and the retail distributor's supplied by JEA should remain
the basic objective of any future decisions on the wholesale and retail levels
of electricity tariffs in Jordan. JEA has agreed that this study will be made
by consultants acceptable to IDA under terms of reference acceptable to the
Association.
3. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The Jordan Electricity Authority was established in 1967 with the
enactment of the Jordan Electricity Authority Law No. 21, to provide for co-
ordinated development of the power sector and the country's power resources.
Before the Authority came into being an Implementation Committee was estab-
lished to appoint consultants and a nucleus JEA staff and to deal with all
interim matters. The Authority is responsible to the Ministry of National
Economy, to ensure efficient operation of the power sector.
3.02      JEA's principal functions under Law 21 are (a) to establish generat-
ing and transmission facilities to supply energy in bulk to other undertakings
whose systems are connected to the JEA system; (b) to manage and operate any
undertaking transferred to or acquired by JEA and (c) to develop a supply of
electricity in areas where there is an economic demand and which are not within
the concession area of supply of other undertakings. Existing power stations
may be designated by JEA as "selected power stations" and will then operate
under JEA's direction. Subject to Cabinet approval these "selected power
stations" may either be purchased by agreement with the owners, or acquired
by Government direction, or the energy produced may be bought by JEA at a
cost sufficient to cover the owner's related operating costs. Under the law
JEA may require that power stations connected to the system but not designated
as "selected power stations" and not considered to be economically justified
for continued generation, cease operation. Under Law 21 JEA may also purchase
any of the other electricity undertakings in Jordan by agreement with the
owners subject to the Cabinet's consent.



-8-
3.03      Under the 1964-1970 Economic Development plan, JEA planned to con-
struct an 88-MW thermal power station at Zarqa, a 46-MW hydro-electric gen-
erating station at Shuneh, and a 132-kV transmission system interconnecting
Zarqa with Amman, Jerusalem, Nablus and Irbid. This program had to be deferred
following the June 1967 war, so JEA has not yet operated as an electricity
supply undertaking although it has supervised the expansion of generation
facilities and the 33-kV distribution networks in the Armman and Irbid con-
cession areas (see 2.17).
3.04      The only major noncurrent assets of JEA are at present (a) a plant
for the manufacture of concrete poles financed by a UK loan and built in 1967
mainly to manufacture poles for JEA's transmission program and for JEPCO's
and IDECO's distribution programs, and (b) its construction loans to IDECO
and JEPCO (see 6.02).
Organization and M1anagement
3.05      Because of JEA's limited activities, the Economic Security Com-
mittee resolved in August 1967 that the Implementation Committee should
continue to assume the powers and duties of the Board of Directors for the
time being. On August 8, 1972 this arrangement was terminated when the
Cabinet appointed JFA's first Board of Directors in accordance with the
Authority Law, comprising a Chairman, who is the Minister of National
Economy; a Vice-Chairman and 6 other members, who presently include JEPCO's
General Manager, the President of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, and JEA's
General Manager.
Staffing
3.06      Again because of JEAts limited activities so far, its organization
and staff have not expanded as originally envisaged. The present staff of
JEA only numbers about 60, all Jordanian, of whom 30 work in the concrete
pole manufacturing plant. The remaining 30 who work in the headquarters
establishment include the General Manager, 3 Engineers and a Chief Accoun-
tant. All new works financed by the UK loans are designed and supervised
by JEPCO's or IDECO's consultants in conjunction with JEA's engineers and
constructed by contractors.
3.07      The present management and staff, with the assistance of consultants,
are competent to operate JEA within its present limited responsibilities, but
the additional responsibilities that will result from the implementation of
the Project call for a complete reorganization and substantial enlargement
of its establishment. The General Manager is a competent executive but will
need management consultants to advise him in the enlarged undertaking. JEA
is aware of the particular difficulties and during negotiations covenanted
that:
(a)  the position of its General  tanager, Chief Engineer, Chief
Accountant and Superintendent in charge of the Hussein
Power Station at all times will be filled by qualified and



9 
experienced persons; it will consuilt with the Association
regarding appointments to the post of General Manager,
and inform the Association of the names and qualifications
of individuals filling the remaining posts and prospective
appointments to such posts;
(b) at all times, it will maintain its salary scales at levels
adequate to ensure the employment of competent staff in
sufficient numbers; and
(c) to appoint management consultants not later than April 1,
1974 with terms of reference and on conditions satis-
factory to IDA to advise on the organizational changes
necessary for operation of the project, and consult
from time to time with IDA on actions it proposes to
take on the consultant's recommendations.
3.08      During the appraisal a preliminary recruiting program and staff
organization were discussed with JEA and Kuljian. A number of key personnel
will have to be recruited and their training started before the completion
of the study by the management consultants, and JEA has agreed that detailed
proposals for a preliminary organization, remuneration schedules, and recruit-
ment and training programs will be completed and presented to IDA prior to
September 30, 1973 together with the relevant cost estimates.
Training
3.09      JEA has contracted with its consultants to train senior supervisory
staff for the power station and to provide experienced expatriate supervisory
staff for the first 12 months of operation after the Zarqa plant is commis-
sioned. It is anticipated that with the availability of Zarqa's power, JEPCO's
Ras-Al-Ain and the Zarqa diesel power stations will be closed down. This and
the reorganization of JEPCO's Marqa power station for two-shift and later
single-shift operation will make redundant enough skilled labor and junior
power station operating staff to fill most of the appointments for the new
Zarqa power station. The problem will be to ensure that some of this potential
staff can be released by JEPCO well enough in advance of commissioning the
new plant to ensure that they will get adequate training in the operation of
a steam power station before taking up their new duties. JEPCO does not feel
that this will present insuperable problems.
3.10      There is an adequate number of Jordanian artisans and operators
with appropriate basic training, either within Jordan or working at power
stations in neighboring Arab countries. There should not be any major pro-
blem, therefore, in obtaining junior operational staff suitable for training.
3.11      Because it is expected that part of the extensive training required
will be in the factories of manufacturers awvarded the main contracts as well
as in several steam power stations in other Arab countries and in the US, a



- 10 -
training component has been included in the proposed credit to cover travel-
ling, subsistence, and other expenses to be incurred for technical or admin-
istrative staff training in countries outside Jordan and not already included
in a consultant's contract.
4. TIE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The project is described in detail in Annex 9.  It consists of the
first stage of a steam-electric power station with two generating units of 33
;J each and a gas turbine of about 12 M1i (site rating). The station is to be
constructed adjacent to the Jordan Refinery at Zarqa, some 42 km from Amman.
The selection of this site was based on availability of water and proximity
to the fuel supply. The ultimate capacity of the station will be largely
determined by the availability of water but total proved production at the
selected site is adequate to sustain a steam power station of at least 200 MW
capacity.
4.02      The electricity sector of Jordan is presently not well planned or
organized, it is divided between two major regional concessions and many small
local entities and service is rather unreliable. An important objective of
the proposed Credit is therefore to achieve an economical and reliable service
by encouraging the Government to organize JEA as a truly autonomous Govern-
ment entity responsible for all major generation and overall planning.
Estimated Cost
4.03      The estimated cost of the project is US$24.7 million equivalent,
of which US$20.4 million would be in foreign exchange, based on the parity
rate of JD 1 = US$3.1 i.e. after the US dollar devaluation in February 1973.
Annex 10 shows the estimated cost of the project which is summarized in the

The project represents 56% of JEA's total expected 1972-1979 construction
program (see 6.07).  Confirmation has been obtained from the Government
that the Kuwait Fund Loan will be made available to the Government at 4%
repayable over 25 years including a grace period of 5 years and it and the
Credit would be relent to JEA at 6% (Kuwait,Fund) and 7-1/4% (credit), re-
payable over 25 years including grace periods of 5 years and 3-1/2 years
respectively.
Basis for Estimates
4.04      The above estimates have been based on bids received for main con-
tracts representing about 65% of the foreign exchange requirements, and on
quotations obtained from representative manufacturers.  The estimates include
a price contingency of about 5% on direct foreign exchange costs and 10% on
direct local cost of equipment and civil works, and about 15% and 6% of direct
local and foreign cost respectively hias been allowed for physical contingencies.
The price contingency allowance is considered adequate because of expected
early signature of fixed price contracts for major equipment on bids already
received. The foreign exchange estimates also include: provision for man-
agement consultants (US$115,000) (paragraph 3.07); the training of staff
(US$125,000) (paragraphs 3.11 and 6.04); and a tariff study (US$40,000)
(see 2.22).

Status of Engineering and Construction
4.05       The feasibility study for the project was financed by USAID.  The
conditions under which Kuljian was employed are acceptable to the Association
an(d it is intended that they will be retained for the design and supervision
of construction and certain training (paragraph 3.09).  They are responsible
for the preparation of bid documents and evaluation of tenders.  Bid documents
nave been issued in accordance with IDA procurement guidelines and main con-
Cracts are expected to be placed as soon as the IDA Credit is signed and the
Kuwait loan becomes effective (see 4.08).  The target for cominissioning the
first unit is early 1976.  This is considered reasonable.  During rnegotia-
tions assurances have been obtained that JEA will continue to employ consul-
tants acceptable to IDA for the design and supervision of the project.
Associated Transmission Lines
4.06      During negotiations assurances have also be obtained that JEA will
engage competent consultants for the final design, preparation of bid documents,
evaluation of bids and supervision of construction of the 132-kV transmission
system between Zarqa and Amman not forming part of the project, but essential
for its operation. The Governrment is seeking bilateral financing from the U.K.
for the foreign exchange romponent of this line and a condition of effective-
ness of the credit will be that a Credit Agreement is signed between the Gov-
ernmenit and the U.K. or other financing arrangements acceptable to the Asso-
ciation are completed, in order to ensure completion of the line prior to
commissioning of the Hussein station.
?rocurement and Disbursements
4.07      All contracts to be financed from the proposed credit (except for
consulting services) would be awarded on the basis of international compe-
titive bidding, consistent with the Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement.
JEA is exempt from paying import duties.  A preference of 15% or customs
duty wlhichever is the lesser would be granted to Jordanian manufacturers.
Formal agreement to these procedures has been obtained from the Kuwait
Fund.
4.DU2     In order not to delay the execution of the project the Kuwait Fund
has been sent a copy of the IDA draft appraisal report, and has thereby been
able to move ahead with its own lending procedures. It is expected that the
Fund loan will be signed slightly ahead of the IDA credit and that its effec-
tiveness will be conditional on the signing of the IDA Credit. The Fund and
the Association have agreed on the following procedures for disbursements.
The Kuwait Fund will disburse 100% of (a) the retroactive cost (not exceeding
US$350,000) of consulting services incurred from February 6, 1972, onward
(the date of signing of the relevant contract) and (b) the initial down-
payments on major contracts (estimated to be in the order of US$1.8 million)
which become payable after Credit signature but prior to its becoming effec-
tive. Thus the Fund, on a temporary basis, will advance the matching foreign
exchange fusnds that would be eligible for reimbursement by IDA as soon as the
Credit becomes effective. The advances made by the Fund will be reimbursed
by IDA immediately after effectiveness of the Credit upon formal request



- 13 -
of JEA, including up to US$175,000 (50%) of the above total retroactive pay-
ments for consulting services.
4.09      On the basis of the proposed joint 50/50 financing, all requests
for disbursements together with supporting documents would be sent to both
IDA and the Kuwait Fund, and each institution will authorize disbursements
of its 50% share. Prior to effectiveness of the Credit, the Kuwait Fund
would only pay the temporary advance of 50% after agreement by the Associa-
tion. The proceeds of the proposed Credit would finance the CIF cost of
imported equipment, the actual foreign exchange cost of Consultant's serv-
ices and overseas training, and an agreed percentage for Civil Works con-
tracts. The Kuwait Fund has confirmed that these procedures are acceptable.
Should the foreign exchange cost to complete the project be less than esti-
mated, any undisbursed amount of the proposed Credit should be reallocated
to consulting services for the next stage of development or if not required
for that purpose the undisbursed amount should be cancelled at the closing
date of the Credit. The project is expected to be completed in early 1976;
the closing date would be March 31, 1977 to allow for final guarantee
payments.
Environment
4.10      The proposed oil-burning plant would be located some 10 km from the
township of Zarqa, adjacent to the oil refinery. The surrounding countryside
is largely desert. A 95% effective mechanical precipitator would be installed
and no problems with dust emissions or ash disposal are expected. Sufficient
space would be provided to install additional exhaust gas cleaning facilities
if necessary in the future.
5. JUSTIFICATION
Forecast of Sales and Demand
5.01      JEPCO will be JEA's sole customer for several years after commission-
ing of the Zarqa plant and is expected to remain JEA's most important customer
thereafter (requiring 80% or more of JEA's output). Since 1963 JEPCO's average
growth rate in sales has been 11.7% (Annex 13), which includes the "bad" year
1970. JEA's consultants (Kuljian) forecast an annual growth in sales of about
20% through 1977 and 15% thereafter until 1990 based on indicators such as
population growth, employment and income data and average consumption per
household.
5.02      Annexes 3 and 4 (JEPCO) and Annex 12 (JEA) show forecast sales for
the period 1973-1980. They are based on past trends in JEPCO's retail sales
excluding sales to the refinery, but adding estimated future sales to some
larger consumers for which supplies have already been committed. Thus an
annual growth rate in retail sales of 14.5% for the period up to 1976 (when
JFA starts operating), and an average of about 12% for 1976-1980 has been
assumed in this report for the financial forecast so as to avoid the possi-
bility of overstating JEA's expected revenue. Beyond 1980 the growth rate



- 14 -
would drop to some 11%, and overall "low" growth rate (see 5.04) would aver-
age about 13%. Demand would grow from 36 MW in 1972 to 103 MW in 1980. Annex
12 also shows forecasts for generation, losses and available and firm capac-
ities.
5.03      For plant scheduling a continuing 14% average annual growth rate
In retail sales has been assumed (see 5.04) as the most likely growth rate.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.04      In Annex 13 a comparison of alternative plant programs has been made
using three alternative growth rates:
(a)  a 'low"' growth rate as used for the financial appraisal
of this report,
(b)  a  'high-" growth rate based on the estimates of JEA's
consultants, and
(c)  an "intermediate" growth rate of 14% per annum.
5.05      Because no significant hydro resources can be developed in Jordan,
there are only two reasonble alternative basic programs:  Alternative 1
represents the installation of steam plant now, and Alternative 2, the
continued installation of large diesel units for several years before the
installation of steam plant. Because a very large number of diesel units
would be unmanageable (and about two 10 MW sets would have to be installed
annually by the end of the decade), a practical limit of 100 MW in new diesel
plant has been assumed for Alternative 2. For these alternatives a unit size
of 33 MWl has been assumed for the first steam plant to be installed, and 1C
MW for diesel plant.
5.06      As shown in Annex 13, the discount rates at which the cash flows
for the basic alternatives equate are sensitive to growth rate; they range
from about 9% for the low demand forecast to 15.3% for the high demand fore-
cast. The market is expected to develop fairly rapidly in the future (see
5.02) with a possible average growth rate of about 14% per annum, and the
equalizing discount rate for this most likely (intermediate) forecast is
about 13.5%. Up to these values an all-steam development would be more
economic than a diesel/steam development.
5.07      It is further established in Annex 13 that (a) a smaller unit size
of say 25 'IW for the initial plant for the all-steam development would have
a higher cost than the 33 M.4W alternative, (b) a larger unit size (50 MW) for
the initial steam plant in the diesel/steam development would have about equal
cost, (c) in any diesel/steam development the total capacity of the steam plant
to be Installed should be about equal to the installed diesel capacity avail-
able at the time of commissioning of the steam plant, and (d) the equalizing
rate hardly varies whether steam plant is installed immediately or after in-
stalling a further 20 MW or 50 MW or 100 MW of diesel plant.



5.08      In the light of the above comparisons and in view of the inevitable
practical necessity of changing to steam at some not too distant date, the
Government's construction of a steam station to meet the projected increase
in demand is fully justified. Particular points of consideration in this
respect are the following:
(a) The logistic problems of operating a growing number of
diesels in a country with a shortage of highly skilled
technicians has been more than apparent in Jordan. The
resulting frequent power interruptions has already led
to a proliferation of captive plant installations (see
2.11) which over a period of years can be expected to
close down in favor of JEA's supplies once the reliability
of steam generated public supplies has been established.
(b) Because steam plant, once commissioned, should operate to
the fullest extent possible, the bulk (up to some 50%) of
all diesel plant available in the system at the time of
the change over to steam, would immediately become ob-
solete. Thus any delay in installing steam plant would
increasingly raise the capacity of such redundant diesel
plant and the financial consequences of the change would
become increasingly severe.
Gas Turbine Plant
5.09      On the basis of the most pessimistic load forecast the demand will
exceed the present plant capacity in the two years preceding commissioning
of the steam plant early in 1976. Because it is not possible to justify the
addition of interim plant to meet this demand on a basis of its output an at-
tempt has been made in Annex 13 to calculate the economic cost of not install-
ing it. As shown in the Annex this would exceed the capital cost of the gas
turbine by at least 10% and the full savings would probably be appreciably
higher.
5.10      Having regard to the short time available for manufacture and in-
stallation, only diesel or gas turbine plant can be considered as practical
alternatives. Since the plant will operate only at peak demand periods for
a period of about two years followed by several years on standby until most
of the presently available diesels have been sold, the amount of energy it
would be required to generate is small. The capital cost is therefore the
factor which determines the selection of the least cost alternative, %.7'ic'
in this case would be a gas turbine (see Annex 1 ).

6.01      JEA's only activities at present are the production of concrete poles
(see 3.04) and the supervision of projects financed by U.K. loans and relent
by JEA to IDECO and JEPCO (see 2.17). Although JEA anticipates enlarging its
pole plant slightly to include other concrete products such as telephone poles,
curbstones and fence posts for other industries, it is intended, as in the
past, that all these products will be sold at cost. The pole plant was
closed for 9 months in 1972 for modification.
6.02      The U.K. credits to the Government were relent by JEA for the con-
struction of IDECO's generation and transmission development schemes and for
JEPCO1s expansion of generation. These U.K. credits to the Government of
Jordan carry no interest, are relent to JEA on the same terms and again re-
lent by JEA to IDECO and JEPCO on more exacting terms including interest at
4% or 6%. Relending profits are transferred to JEAts capital reserve in com-
pliance with its agreement with the Government. Annex 14 gives the details
of the lending and relending terms of all such loans.
6.03      JEA's actual and forecast income statements and balance sheets,
covering the years 1969 through 1979, are shown in Annexes 15 and 16. The
financial position at December 31, 1971 is, of course, not representative
of the role JEA is expected to assume in the electricity sector. JEA's
net fixed assets of JD 113,000 mainly comprised the value of the pole plant
(JD32,000) and work in progress in expanding this plant. Long term invest-
ments (JD 761,000) were the U.K. loans relent to JEPCO (JD 188,000) and to
IDECO (JD 573,000). Current assets included a high cash balance of JD
483,000 due to the time lag between receiving funds from the Government out
of the U.K. loans and disbursing these funds to JEPCO and IDECO, see 6.08;
JD 87,000 of this was in fact in transit to JEPCO on 12-31-1971. JEA's net
equity was negative (JD 45,000 capital reserve from the proceeds of the re-
lending operations less JD 58,000 accumulated losses) and its long term debt
totaling JD 1,460,000 was all in respect of loans for relending to JEPCO and
IDECO, except for JD 159,000 from the Government to support JEA's net ex-
penditure pending its actual operations as public utility.
Accounting Staff
6.04      JEA's accounting staff comprises a chief accountant and two junior
accountants. This is adequate for the present but when JEA starts its cons-
truction program and actual operations as a utility company it will not only
need additional accounting staff, but all the staff (including the present
employees) will require training. The management consultants to be employed
under the project (see 3.07) will design the appropriate accounting procedures
and will provide on-the-job training to the accounting staff. They should
arrange for at least one senior accountant to be sent abroad for a period of
training with an appropriate utility organization and the foreign exchange
cost of this is included in the proposed credit.



- 17 -
Auditing
6.05      In accordance with Section 44 of the Jordan Electricity Authority
Law, the books and accounts are audited annually by auditors appointed by
the Minister. In the past the Minister has appointed the local auditing
firm of Shair, Aweida, Shatara and Ayed. One of the partners of this firm,
Mr. Wahib A. Shair, is a UK Chartered Accountant and has carried out JEA's
past annual audits. These auditing arrangements are satisfactory and inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Association will continue to be appointed.
Insurance
6.06      Insurance coverage is provided thirough private local insurance com-
panies operating under Government regulations; in addition, the Government
guarantees legitimate claims against these companies. JEA's purchases from
abroad are usually covered by insurance provided by the supplier. A review
of JEA's insurance program indicates adequate protection except in one re-
spect: it does not carry third-party public liability coverage other than
insurance on motor vehicles. At this time, because of JEA's very limited
activities, this may not present a serious problem, but JEA and the Govern-
ment have agreed that, during the project construction period and thereafter,
adequate insurance protection will be in force.
JEA's Financing Plan 1972-1979
6.07      Since JEA will only start as an electricity entity when the project
is complete in about 1976, the financing plan covers the period throughl 1979.
It therefore covers not only the construction of the project and of Stage I
of the 132-kV transmission line from Zarqa to Amman (1973 through 1976) but
also the third steam unit at Zarqa (1977 through 1979) and iost of the as-
sociated strengthening and extension (Stages II and III) of the 132-kV trans-
mission system (1977 through 1981).  The build up of JEA's fixed asset. will
be financed from borrowing except for (a) the Government loans converted into
equity (see 6.08), and (b) the local costs of the third Zarqa unit with its
associated transmission line, to be financed by JEA. In addition to ttie proj-
ect, which will be financed 82% by IDA and the Kuwait Fund and the remaining
18% (JD 1,380,000) by the Government; the associated Stage I of- the 132-kV
Zarqa/Amman line will also be financed entirely by the Government - JD 1,292,000
for foreign exchange (expected to be on-lent from a UK credit) and JD 500,000
for loca;l expenditure. Future foreign loans on Bank terms have been assumed
for Zaiqa unit No. 3 and for the second and third stages of the transmission
syster. (JD 4,083,00 including JD 534,000 interest during construction).  Local
currency costs of the latter expansion will be financed by JEA from internal
cash generation. It has been assumed that interest during construction for
these latter project will be included in the future foreign loans. The high
level of cash shown by 1979 reflects the initial 100% outside financing of
construction costs up to 1976. No dividends have been included in reduction
of this cash balance in view of the tentative construction plans for the
Jordan Valley Development and the IDECO-Zarqa 132-kV link, which might be
started by 1979. These projects have not been included in JEA's forecast
construction program since their timing is uncertain. Both projects would
probably entail a high proportion of JEA financing from its own funds.



- 18 -
6.08      The Government has agreed that its advances (estimated to total
JD 2,111,000 by 1976) comprising the local expenditures mentioned above on
the project (JD 1,380,000) and on the 132-kV line (JD 500,000), preliminary
expenses (JD 159,000) (see 6.03) and miscellaneous additional expenditure on
loans to IDECO (JD 72,000); will be capitalized as Government equity when
JEA starts to generate power from the Zarqa steam units. Dividends on this
share capital could provide a flexible and convenient vehicle for transfer-
ring funds back to the treasury should JEA in due course generate cash in
excess of its operating and expansion requirements after 1978. The Govern-
m.ent and JEA have agreed however that no dividends shall be declared or paid
before 1979 unless in the opinion of the Association, such a distribution
would not be prejudicial to JEA's requirements for its capital expansion.
In summary JEA's financing plan for 1972 through 1979, which is realistic,
is as follows:

6.09      Section 38(3) of the Jordan Electricity Authority Law states that
the maximum JEA can borrow shall not be more than JD 10.0 million unless
authorized by another law.  The Government has confirmed that the JEA law
will be amended to ensure that JEA borrowing are not in conflict with the
law or the debt limitation covenant.
JEA's Operating Future
6.10      Although JEA is expected to sell small quantities of energy from
the gas turbine in 1974 and 1975, (see 2.18) JEA's operations as a utility
company will not really start unti 1976 with the coming into service of the
steam generating units. During the forecast period through 1979, JEA's only
customer will be JEPCO (unless IDECO were to be connected to the JEA system
in 1978/79), and from 1976 JEA will require JEPCO's "selected" Marqa diesel
station (see 3.02) to generate power for standby or for peaking purposes in
order to ensure the most economic overall generation for the system. The
Government has agreed that Marqa will be declared a "selected" station when
the first Zarqa steam turbine unit becomes operational for the sale of power.
6.11      In this report it has been assumed that JEPCO will enter into a
long-term operating contract (revised periodically according to JEA's esti-
mate of the number of shifts per day and level of readiness required) whereby
JEPCO would receive a fixed operating contract price designed to meet all its
fixed costs of running its Marqa station including depreciation, plus a mar-
gin of profit equivalent to a 9% return on its average net fixed assets at
Marqa. All actual kWh's generated for the system at JEA's request, would be
paid for by JEA at marginal cost only i.e. fuel plus expendable materials
estimated at 2.26 fils/kWh (US cents 0.70). These assumed conditions of
contract and the principles behind them were discussed with the Government,
JEA and JEPCO during the appraisal and no objections were raised. It is a
condition of effectiveness of the Credit that, should Marqa not be purchased
or acquired from JEPCO, JEA and JEPCO agree to enter into some such operat-
ing contract by not later than June 30, 1975 for the use of JEPCO's Marqa
station as a "selected" station and that this contract would be drawn up in
a mutually agreed form which would be specified and based on principles ac-
ceptable to the Government and the Association. Having agreed to enter into
such a contract as a condition of effectiveness of the credit, JEA and JEPCO
would then have time to negotiate the precise terms nearer to mid-1975, when
the actual operating conditions and costs expected for 1976 could be forecast
more accurately. JEA's selling price to JEPCO and JEPCO's retail price will
be determined by tariff regulations which are expected to be promulgated by
the end of 1975 following the completion of the legal and tariff studies
(see 2.22).
6.12      Marqa, when declared a "selected station" may be purchased or
acquired from JEPCO, or may be operated by JEPCO under JEA's direction.
The Government has confirmed that an operating contract between JEA and
JEPCO of the type envisaged in 6.11 will not be in conflict with JEA's
law.



- 20 -
6.13      All of Jordan's generation is thermal and it would therefore be
prudent for wholesale and retail tariffs for electricity to include a fuel
price adjustment clause to protect the financial viability of the operating
companies. Under this clause, all increases in the price of residual fuel
oil above a predetermined base price would automatically be passed on to
the retail distributor and, if appropriate, to the consumers. The Govern-
ment agreed to empower the JEA to implement such a fuel adjustment clause
not later than June 30th, 1975, incorporating a base price paid by JEA of
JD 7.5 per ton for residual oil.
6.14      Assuming the type of contract envisaged in 6.11 (including a fuel
price adjustment clause) resulting in an average selling price to JEPCO for
electricity (including any generation at Marqa) of 7.5 fils/kWh (2.3 USc/kWJh),
JEA is expected to achieve an annual rate of return in the order of 9% once
its operating pattern settles down (see Annex 15). JEPCO also is expected
to achieve an annual rate of return of 9% by 1979 with the above purchase
price for electricity for JEA and the proposed operating contract for Marqa
(see 6.11). The Government and JEA have agreed that JEA's tariffs will be
maintained at a level high enough to produce an annual rate of return of at
least 9% on average net fixed assets in operation. Although the forecast
return for 1979 is shown as being lower than this (8.3%), no increase in
tariffs have been anticipated in the forecast because of the conservative
growth rate (of about 12% annually) used for the sales estimates; because
of the lack of an existing organization with historical operating records
and accounts to provide a firm basis for estimates of future expenditure
in 6 years time; and because of the impending tariff study.
JEA's Future Balance Sheets
6.15      JEA's financial position is expected to be sound and its predicted
balance sheets for 1976 through 1979 (Annex 16) reflect the start up and ex-
pansion of its major activity as an electricity wholesale supply organization.
Whilst the build up of its fixed assets will be financed largely from borrow-
ing, JEA has agreed not to incur additional long term debt unless its debt
service in any future year is expected to be covered at least 1.5 times by
its internal net cash generation. Net current assets reflect the expected
start up of activity by JEA and the supply of the initial inventory support
by the main construction contractors. JEA's Debt/Equity ratio is shown as
being in the region of 81:14 by 1979, but this would be 77:23 if the relent
debt were excluded.
7. AGREEMENTS RkEACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the Government agreed:
(a) to review JEA law and propose appropriate legislative
action for amending this law so as to allow JEA to
develop in an autonomous agency (see 2.21);



- 21 -
(b)  to initiate legislative action and present by September 30,
1974, its proposals to the Legislature for enactment of a
General Electricity Law to regulate the power sector; the
proposals for said Law will be made available to the Asso-
ciation in time for comments; to achieve the objectives of
this Law, such regulations or bylaws will be formulated
as may be necessary and regulatory functions of a technical
nature will be delegated to JEA (see 2.21);
(c)  to prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends by
JEA before January 1, 1979, unless in the opinion of the
Association such distribution would not be prejudicial to
JEA's requirements for financing its expansion program
(see 6.07);
(d)  to convert into equity all JEA's preliminary expenditures
financed by the Government prior to commissioning of the
Hussein station (see 6.08); and
(e)  empower JEA, not later than June 30, 1975, to implement
a fuel adjustment clause to cover additional operating
expenses resulting from variations in the price paid by
JEA for residual oil above a base price of JD 7.5 per
ton (see 6.13).
7.02      During negotiations, the following was agreed with the Government
and JEA:
(a)  to set and maintain tariffs to provide a rate of return
of not less than 9% (see 6.14); and
(b)  that JEA will not incur additional long term debt unless
its debt service in any future year is expected to be
covered at least 1.5 times by its net cash generation
(see 6.15).
7.03      During negotiations, JEA agreed:
(a)  to engage consultants for a tariff study in time for them
to make recommendations to the Government by not later than
December 31, 1974 (see 2.22);
(b)  to consult with the Association regarding appointments
to the post of General Manager, to inform the Associa-
tion concerning prospective appointments of other chief
officers, and to maintain its salary scales at levels
adequate to ensure employment of competent staff
(see 3.07);



- 22 -
(c)  to present to the Association prior to September 30, 1973
its detailed proposals for a preliminary organization, re-
numberation schedules, and recruitment and training programs
(see 3.08);
(d)  employ consultants acceptable to the Association for the
design and supervision of the project, and of the 132-kV trans-
mission system between Zarqa and Amman (see 4.05 and 4.06);
(e)  employ outside auditors acceptable to the Association
(see 6.05); and
(f)  to adequately insure its assets (see 6.06).
7.04      During negotiations, the following events were agreed as conditions
of effectiveness:
(a)  the signing of a bilateral agreement with the UK, or of
other arrangements acceptable to the Association, for
financing of the 132-kV system between Zarqa and Amman
(see 4.06);
(b)  that the Kuwait Loan Agreement has, or will concurrently
with the credit agreement, become fully effective (see
4.09); and
(c)  that, unless JFA shall have acquired Marqa, JEA will con-
clude a basic agreement with JEPCO for the operation of
Marqa committing both parties to conclude a final con-
tract not later than June 30, 1975 (see 6.11).
7.05      On the basis of the foregoing, the project is suitable for a Credit
of US$10.2 million equivalent to be relent to JEA by the Government at 7-1/4%
interest for a period of 25 years including a grace period of 3.5 years.

JORDAN
The Histories of JEPCO and IDECO
Development Programs
1.        Electricity is distributed in Eastern North Jordan, the area which
will be supplied by the Project, by JEPCO and IDECO in their respective
Concession Areas. The composition, history and future developments of these
companies are described below:
The Jordan Electricity Power Company Limited
2.        Prior to 1947 several small electric power companies were independently
operating in the Amman area. The Government decided at that time that the
activities of these companies should be unified and on August 14, 1947 the
Transjordan Electric Power Company Limited was established, with paid up
capital of JD 121,900 to take over these small enterprises. At the same time
the Transjordan Electric Power Company was granted a concession by the Govern-
ment which licensed the new company to generate, transmit and distribute
electrical energy in the area specified by the concession for a period of
60 years after which the concession could be reviewed or the assets could be
purchased by the Government. The paid up capital was increased to JD 250,000
in 1955.
3.        As of January 1, 1963 the Transjordan Electric Power Company Limited
merged with the jordan Central Electric Company which supplied the Zarqa
concession area, and the new company was named the Jordanian Electricity
Power Company Limited. The combined concession, covering the areas supplied
by the previous two companies, was established by law as published in the
Official Gazette No. 1651 dated November 22, 1962. The authorized capital
of the new company was JD 2,500,000, of which JD 2,040,000 was paid up.
Authorized capital was later increased to JD 3,000,000 with JD 2,717,975 paid
up. The nominal value of a share is one Jordan Dinar. The Company presently
is owned by 6,572 shareholders and the distribution of shares is shown in the
following table:
Shareholders                    No. of Shares               7
a.  Municipalities                      232,670                  8.6
b.  Government                           33,528                  1.2
c.  Company                             145,766                  5.4

4.        The Board of Directors of JEPCO comprises eleven members, two of
whom are representatives of the Government and the Municipality of Amman
respectively. Total staff is about 800 employees.
JEPCO's Expansion Program
5.        JEPCO is presently executing a 5-year development plan (1971-1975)
for the expansion of its own generation, transmission and distribution facil-
ities, pending the commissioning of bulk supplies from JEA's Zarqa station.
A UK loan of JD 3.1 million has been made, through JEA, towards the cost of
this program, which includes 3 diesel units of 6-MW site rating presently being
installed. JEPCO's transmission/distribution program orovides for extending
its 33-kV network and includes a routine expenditure of some JD 500,000
annually to develop the company's 220/380-V network. The latter financial
provisions appear adequate to meet the increases in power requirements
during the period. It is expected that JEPCO's demand will exceed its firm
capacity in generating plant by 1974. JEA, by means of the gasturbine proposed
for financing from the credit is expected to meet these requirements. It
appears likely that JEPCO's older diesels in the Marqa station can be sold
to municipal undertakings, so that the three newer diesels (18 MW) together
with the gasturbine (12 MW) will comprise the necessary reserve for the Zarqa
station by about 1978 to meet JEPCO's requirements as well as those for IDECO
(see below). A further extension of the transmissions system would also be
required by that time.
Irbid District Electricity Company
6.        The companv was established as a private company in Irbid in 1957
under the name of Ajlun District Power Company. Irbid power station was
acquired in 1961 and the company was converted into a public company with an
authorized capital of JD 1,000,000. The name was changed to the Irbid District
Electricity Company. The Company was granted the present concession under
Law No. 1 dated 23 of January 1961 (as published in the Official Gazette No.
1535 dated February 16, 1961). The concession is for a period of 50 years,
after which it can be renewed or the assets may be purchased by the Govern-
ment.
7.        From 1962 onward IDECO has been acquiring smaller municipal under-
takins, a process that has been accelerated since 1968 when the company
obtained its first UK loan for expanding its transmission and distribution
system (see 9 below).
8.        The authorized capital of IDECO is still JD 1,000,000 of which
JD 757,165 has been paid up. The nominal value of a share is one Jordan
Dinar and the distribution of shares as of December 31, 1971 is shown in the
following table:

IDECO's Expansion Program
9.        IDECO, which recently completed its Stage I'.transmissior and
generation program with the assistance of JD 360,000 (equivalent) UK financ-
ing, obtained two further UK loans through JEA of the equivalent of JD 300,000
and JD 750,000 respectively toward expansion. The first loan covered the
installation of two 1 MW diesel units in the existing station and the exten-
sion of the 33-kV system by about 120 km. The second loan covered further
33-kV extensions and the third construction of a new power station at Irbid
with three 2.8-M; diesel units. These works are expected to be completed
by the end of 1974. NRA's pumping stations (see paragraph 2.10) will all be
connected to the IDECO system for supply during off-peak hours, as scoa as
sufficient capacity is available. IDECO's major construction is supervised
by JEA. Additionally, IDECO is budgeting an annual expenditure of some JD
120,000 for expansion of its 220/380-V facilities. IDECO plans to install
two additional 3-MT generating units prior to 1978.  By that time, or early
in 1979, the construction of a 90 km long 132-kV transmission line from Zarqa
to Irbid may well be justified.
Jordan Valley Rehabilitation and Development Plan
10.       The Government recently announcecl its 3 year Rehabilitation and
Development Plan of the Jordan Valley. This plan envisages the migration of
some 100,000 persons to the Jordan valley by 1980 to participate in the
planned agricultural and environmental improvements of the valley. Towards
the achievement of this aim, the Plan includes a power development project
comprising a 33-kV line along the valley (200 km including feeders and spurs)
and distribution networks for the expansion of existing townships, for new
settlements and for the pumping of irrigation and drinking water. The line
would be supplied in the north from the IDECO system and in the south from
the JEPCO system. Demand is expected to grow from about 6.5 1TW in 1975 to
16 M; in 1980, including an off peak load for pumping of 2.3 - 3.6 MW. The
demand for power will, however, be entirely subject to progress made in
implementing the Plan and to the extent that the proposed influx of population
is achieved. For this reason this estimated load has not yet been taken
into account in JEPCO's or IDECO's load forecasts until firmer information is
available on the execution of the Plan.

Electric Power Rates
1.        JEA's Laws (and the draft Electricity Law of 1966) require that the
prices to be charged by tndertakings shall be in accordance with such tariffs
as they may fix from time to time, with the approval of the Cabinet on the
recommendation of the Minister. No specific concepts or regulations, are set
forth, however, for the defiritions of costs, rate base, rate of return, etc.
2.        In practice a single and simple uniform tariff structure prevails
in the cotntry, comprising block rates only. On a monthly basis they are
the following for the two most important companies (in fils (0.31 USO) per
JEPCO                          Fils/kWh           USW/kWh
First 50 kWh                      30                  9.3
Next 2450 kWh                      15                 4.6
Over 2500 kWh                     11                  3.4
IDECO
First 50 kWh                      40                 12.4
Next 50 kWh                       25                  7.7
Next 900 kWh                      20                  6.2
Over 1000 kWh                     15                  4.6
3.        Special contracts are allowed at lower prices and normally this
takes the form of a discount. In the case of JEPCO, employees have a 75%
discount and institutions considered socially important (churches, hospitals,
schools, charity) 25%. For streetlighting, under a special contract, the
original discount was 30%. Each year, however, this increases by 5% and the
present situation in Amman, is that within 4 years streetlighting supply
and replacements will be fully subsidized by other consumers, the municipality
financing the extensions. In 1970, about 12% of all of JEPCO's supply was
at a discount, constituting about 6.3% of revenue. Similar discounts exists
in Irbid where, however, the discount for streetlighting increase 10%
annually but is limited to a maximum of 60%. Some larger industrial consumers
have a special contract setting the highest block rate at 12 fils/ kWh.
4.        As a condition for lending JEA required JEPCO to have its tariffs
studied by an acceptable consultant, to investigate if they could be reduced.
The company's costs were to be analysed and recommendations were to be made
for any promotional activities to be initiated, including setting up a
commercial section. The study was completed by Kennedy and Donkin of the
UK in May 1972.

5.        The consultants reached the following main conclusions:
(a) the present block tariff is still most appropriate for the present
situation; no change is recommended at present in pattern, sizes
of the blocks or in prices within these blocks. The tariff should
be studied again, however, within 2-3 years when all the aspects
of the future JEA generation and supply are better known.
(b)  the company's target should be the allocation of an amount equal to
about 3% of net fixed asset value for internal financing of projects
even if dividend target payments (of 10% per share, presently
equivalent to about 8% of net fixed assets in operation) were to
suffer.
(c) the promotional aspect in the present tariff is appropriate for
the domestic sector; some meter equipment should be installed
for JEPCO's larger consumers in order to study the viability of
installing maximum demand meter equipment and to frame an appro-
priate industrial tariff (in 1970 there were 6 "large" consumers
with an installed capacity of 800-1000 kW or more and 65 "medium"
consumers with an installed capacity of 75-90 kW to 800-1000 kW,
some operating during the peak and some operating outside the peak);
when making a decision on the tariff, a distinction could be
made between high voltage and low voltage supply.
(d)  the present lowest blockrate of 11 fils/kWh appears slightly below
present fixed and variable charges (i.e., well above marginal short
term cost of supply in the order of 5-6 fils/kWh).
6.        Preece Cardew and Rider in their report, dated November 1969, on
the development of electrical supplies in the Irbid district and the organiza-
tion of IDECO, express the opinion that the situation calls for a thorough
study of the possibilities for introducing new forms of tariffs. Nothing
has been done however in this respect, except that IDECO introduced a special
off-peak rate for water pumping at 8 fils/kWh, as recommended by the consult-
ants, in order to attract the considerable NRA demand. With this IDECO expects
to increase its load factor from the present 35% to some 55%.
7.        No provision has been made in the Electricity laws for a fuel
price surcharge adjustment to be passed on to consumers through the retail
tariffs. In view of internationally rising fuel prices the implementation of
a fuel price surcharge appears appropriate.

Description of the Project
The proposed new thermal electric power station will be constructed
at Zarqa which is some 42 km. northeast of Amman. It will be located adjacent
to and just east of the Jordan Refinery in an area which is presently unused
for any purpose. This site was chosen because of the existing access facil-
ities, an adequate supply of water, proximity to the source of fuel with conse-
quent savings in cost, and its remoteness from urban areas. The capacity of
the power station will be 66 MW initially, but site facilities are adequate
for the ultimate development of a power station of several hundred megawatts.
The generating plant will consist of two standard 33 MW turbo-
alternator sets and boilers, together with all ancilliary equipment, switch-
gear, etc. The turbines will be designed to operate with steam conditions
of 850 psi and 900°F. The generators will operate at 3,000 rpm. Each will
be hydrogen cooled and rated at 38,825 kVA; 33,000 kW at 0.85 power factor
and will generate at 13,800 volts, 50 cycles, 3 phase.
The boilers will be of the outdoor multi-drum pressurized type with
provision of combustion air by forced draft fans. They will be designed to
burn local residual fuel oil and will be rated at 320,000 lbs. per hour at
900F with final feed water temperature of 395°F. The firing isle of the
boilers will be incorporated in the building housing the turbo generators and
auxiliary equipment. This will be an economically designed building of
steel frame construction with provision also for housing the low voltage switch-
gear, the water treatment plant, offices and other ancilliary facilities.
Fuel will be supplied by pipeline to daily service tanks from the
adjacent oil refinery. Water for boiler-make up, cooling and other purposes
will be available from wells on the site. Eight wells have been drilled of
which five are productive with a total capacity of 1,800 gallons per minute.
In order to conserve water a multi-cell mechanical draft, closed circuit, dry
type cooling tower will be installed to serve both units.
Each generator will be connected to a 13.8/132-kV step-up trans-
former and the 132-kV substation will be an outdoor type structure with open
buses. All the net power generated will be fed into JEPCO's distribution
system network via a double circuit 132-kV transmission line which is not
part of the Project.
Although, except for a mechanical precipitator of 95% efficiency,
no means of cleaning exhaust gases would be installed, sufficient space will
be provided to install such facilities if they are necessary in the future.

The gasturbine will be of the standard industrial packaged type
rated about 15 MW at sea level (12-13 MW at the Amman/Zarqa elevation). A
cubicle type substation will be provided to connect the unit for about 1 1/2
years to the 33-kV subtransmission system (either near JEPCO's Marqa station
or near the refinery at Zarqa) until the Zarqa plant is commissioned. Then
the gasturbine unit will be permanently installed adjacent to this station.

However, the annex has not been amended, because the conclusions are inalf-

7.1 Comparison of Alternative Generation Developments
.2 Sensitivity of the Equalizing Discount Rate to Growthrate, and Costs
(for Intermediate Demand Forecast)
A.   Forecast of Sales and Demand
1.        JEPCO, the company supplying Amman and surroundings will be JEA's
sole customer for several years after commissioning of the Zarqa plant, and
is exnected to remain JEA's most important customer (requiring 80% or more
of JEA's output) for the rest of the century. Consequently JEPCO's forecast
sales and demand are the most important parameters for JFA's expansion program.
2.        Historical data for maximum demand (MW), sales (GWh) for each of
the consumer categories, and generation (GWh) in JEPCO's system are shown in
Attachment 1. In 1962/63 JEPCO merged with the company supplying the Zarea
area and from January 1, 1q63, the above data was consolidated.
3.        Two important events have distorted the 1970 supply, and to a
lesser degree those of 1971: (i) civil disturbances in the later part of
1970 virtually brought economic activity to a halt (even the Amman power
supply was completely shut down for some time), and (ii) early in 1970 the
refinery in Zarqa, JEPCO's largest consumer (some 13 GWh annually), installed
its owm Plant because of increased power requirements and because it wished
to increase reliability of supply.
4.        The Amman/Zaroa area has suffered frequent power shortages and in
consequence substantial capacity in captive plant has been installed. A pre-
liminary survey by JEA (which has not, however, as yet located many of the
smaller plants) shows that a capacity aggregating about 6.4 MW has been in-
stalled for standby services, most of which appear normal for the type of con-
sumer (see Annex 1), and that about 30 '11W is in regular service. The cement
factory in consultation with JEA is studying the possibility of interconnect-
ing its plant with JEA's system in 1976 so as to make use of public supply
for its extensions, estimated to require 10-12 MW. Whether or not this company
will decide in favor of JEA supply is not expected to be known for same time.
It appears likely that some 10 MW of other captive plant could phase out
gradually if adequate and dependable public supply were available.  In view
of the difficulties of estimating the gradual return of captive plant to
public supply, such return has not been included specifically in the forecasts.
5.        Taking into account the most recent data available up to September
1972, JPA's consultants for the prolect, Kuljian of Philadelphia, have re-
centlv prepared revised market estimates for the period 1972 through 1990 on
the basis of their May 1971 report: "Eastern North Jordan Electric Facilities
Power Study". They used statistics on population growth, particularly in
the Amman area, utilization of appliances, average consumption per household,
employment (lata, income, and similar indicators, concluding that the growth
rate for tle next dacade can be expected to he high.  The consultant forecast
is shown in the right hand columns of Attachment 2 (Tigh Forecast).  Compared
with 1971 demand would grow an average of about 20% in the next 5 years and
until 1990 average growth rate would be some 15% in generation and 14% in
demand .



ANNEX 13
Page 3 of 10 pages
6.        Although the consultant's forecast may be achieved by actual
development, the probability of this achievement appears small because political
stability in the area could be jeopardized again, as it has been in the past,
and any prediction that the growthrate of the economy will return to its
pre-1970 level would be somewhat premature at this juncture. The growthrate
of electricity supplies must be somewhat uncertain and because JEA's financial
development will only start with the operation of the Zarqa station it appears
appropriate to estimate future sales conservatively to avoid any optimistic
evaluation of the company's financial viability. As shown in Attachment 1,
the growthtrend (calculated by means of the least squares method) for the
period 1963-1971 has been 11.7% which includes the "bad" year 1970. Using
the average of this trend and the 1962-1969 trend (i.e. 12.3%), and adding
only those new important customers for whom connections have been committed,
the following sales development is obtained:
1971      1972       1973      1974     1975      1976
Trend in Sales         112.9       130         146      164       184       207
Steelmill                                        3        9         9         9
Medical University                                        2.5       5         5
Pumping                                          1        1.5       2         2
112.9      130         150      177      200        223
Growthrate %                   15        15.5      18         13       11.5
Average Growthrate % ---------14.5 --------------------------
7.        In order to assess scnsitivity to growthrate, both a "high" and
a "low" growthrate were assumed.  The first - the consultant's forecast - has
been discussed above in 5. The second, "low" forecast, as shown in the left
hand columns of Attachment 2, is based on the above forecast, assuming that
IDECO would be connected at the end of 1978 or early 1979 and that sales to
IDECO would be some 20-25 GWh only, which is about 50% of the estimate of its
consultants. It is highly probable that this conservative estimate of IDECO's
sales will be exceeded. The overall growthrate would reduce to some 11-11.5%
by 1990. This low forecast shows an average growth rate of 13% in generation
and 12.5% in demand.
8.        In view of the uncertainties in Jordan a reasonable choice for a
forecast of generation and demand to be used for basic scheduling of plant
and for sensitivity calculations, would lie midway (i.e. at 14%) between the
low and the high forecast provided this does not lead to a forecast exceeding
past trends, taking into account (a) the "background" growth of industry,
i,e. the growth trend excluding supplies to the refinery and (b) interpolating
for the "bad" year 1970.  In Annex 3 this trend is shown to be at least 15%
if 1970 is ommitted from consideration as 18% trend is shown, i.e. above the
intermediate growth rate, and the market is expected to develop fairly rapidly
in the future at a sustained high growth rate of some 14%.
9.        Maximum demand has not been used to assess trends.  JEPCO, in the
past, went through several periods of power shortages and has been suppres-
sing voltage accordingly. Sales and generation of energy, of course, have



ANNEX 13
Page 4 of 10 pages
been less effected and can be considered more reliable parameters for asses-
sing trends than demand.  As a consequence of suppressed demand, the load
factor must have been rather erratic as, indeed, is shown in Attachment 1.
0O.      JEPCO's sales are rapidly returning to the normal "background"
trend after excluding past supplies to the refinery. In 1971 growth was
still some 13 GWh below this trend, but the quick recovery is illustrated
I- the fact that 1973 sales rate 19.3% compared with 11.7% in 1972. On a
short term basis, the 196911970 trend of some 14.5%, after discarding the
effects of the disturbances, is clearly continuing.
B.   Assumptions for Scheduling of Plant and Cost Estimates
1.        The consultants, on the basis of their forecast, have compared an
"all-diesel" development with an "all-steam" development, showing the all-
steam development to be justified for discount rates up to at least 15%.
Sensitivity to a lower forecast was, however, not investigated and the
hypothetical installation of hundreds of 1MW's in diesel plant is clearly
impossible for practical engineering reasons. In the present study, the
installation of new diesel plant (including 18 MW to be commissioned in 1973)
is assumed to be restricted to 100 MW then to be followed by steam. This
alternative is designated as "Diesel/Steam" development, except for inter-
mediate capacity which ma- comprise either diesel or gasturbine plant.
2.        To replace the diesels in Alternative 2 by gas turbines would not
be a practical alternative,  At the assumed fuel oil price (industrial diesel
oil) of JD 9/ton (US$2,520/ton) and annual operation of 5,000 hours or more,
a comparison has shown that cost of operating gas turbine plant would be
higher than cost of operating diesel plant (i.e. the equalizing discount rates
discussed below would increase, favoring the steam development still more).
in fact, it has been shown that capital cost per effective kW of gas turbine
plant should at least by US$100 below the capital cost per kW of diesel plant
in order to reach similar equalizing discount rates. This is mainly due to
the fact the A'mnan/Zarqa elevation requires gas turbine to be derated by about
20%, compared with a maximum of 5% for diesel plant.
Available Capacities
3.        Annex 4 shows JEPCO's power stations site rating and available
(derated) capacities for each unit, retirements and total available capacity
ln each year except for the three 6 MW units, presently being installed. It
is assumed that the existing diesels in JEPCO's Marqa station cannot be
reconditioned in any substantial degree at reasonable cost. The station's
cooling system, using well water and heat exchangers, would have to be
completely redesigned and replaced by radiator cooling to avoid scaling.
Several diesels would have to be practically rebuilt to bring them up to site
rated capacity, (if indeed this could be done at all - two of them, for in-
stance, have piston seizure above 75% load), or would have to be repositioned
on their foundations, which have cracked or deteriorated under the bedplates.



ANNEX 13
Page 5 of 10 pages
Any attempted reconditioning would almost certainly cause a long period of
load repression because reserve capacity in the 2 years prior to the commis-
sioning of the Zarqa station does not exceed the larges unit (G MW). The
estimated cost of reconditioning would be in the order of US$1 million, which
would be about the same as the cost of replacing with new plant the estimated
5 MW gain in capacity resulting from reconditioning.
Assumptions for Cost Estimates
4.        The relevant assumptions are shown in Attachment 3.
C.   Definition of Basic Alternative Development
Schemes 1 & 2
1.        Two basic alternatives were compared first
Alternative 1: All-steam development with 33 MW initial unit size
Alternative 2: Diesel/steam development with 10 MW diesel unit size
and 33 MW initial steam unit size.
2.        Attachment 4 page 1 shows, for both alternatives, plant to 'le com-
missioned in the relevant years to meet requirements of demand and generation,
taking into account the phasing out of JEPCO's old plant (as shown in Annex 4)
and subsequent retirement of the newer diesels at the end of their 15-year
economic life. Annual capital expenditures, fuel cost and operating cost,
based on the assumptions set forth in Attachment 3, are shown separately for
diesel and for steam for purposes of a sensitivity analyses. In view of its
complexity, the analysis has been simplified by using "net values". Attach-
ment 4 page 2 shows these net values, as well as the net present values cal-
culated for discount rates ranging from 9-19%. Residual values were taken
into account by multiplying each annual capital expenditure by a discount
factor representing the unamortized portion of that expenditure in the year
the streams are cut off. It should be noted that a negative sign indicates
that Alternative 1 has lower costs than Alternative 2.
3.        Attachment 4 page 2 demonstrates that the net present values of fuel
costs at the various discount rates are small compared with the overall net
present values, which means that for a variation in unit size (for optimization
of the development), the impact of increased or decreased efficiency will
also be small and can be discarded.
4.        Up to an equalizing discount rate of 13.6% the steam development
would be more economic than a steam/diesel development, at the intermediate
(and most likely) forecast. Because the opportunity cost of capital in Jordan
may be in the same order (12-15%) and the equalizing discount rate is highly
sensitive to actual growthrate (see Dl below), it could be argued the project
might seem to be marginal. This, of course, is only to be expected, because
the project wi]l add 7  NW (including the gasturbine) to the 1975 capacity of



ANNEX 13
Page 6 of 10 pages
some 65 IV (derated in fact to only some 55 MW) when maximum demand will
be in the order of 60 NW. However, at any time in the foreseeable future,
the ad,lition of steam plant instead of further diesel plant must also seem
marginal (see D 5 below) for the following reasons:  (i) The equalizing dis-
count rates are insensitive to the timing of actual change-over to steam
(except in the case of a sustained high growthrate) because the steam capacity
to be installed would always have to be of the same order as the total diesel
capacity already available, since steam plant once commissioned should either
operate at its full capacity or not at all. A combination of diesel and
steam would not solve this basic problem of lumpiness (and consequently of
reserve requirement); (ii) the bulk of the existing diesel capacity becomes
obsolete the moment steam plant is commissioned, since only about 50% of the
capacity is initially required as a reserve for the steam plant. For peaking
purposes only about half of this 50% would appear to be ample.
5.        The Government decision to move ahead with the conversion to steam
is based on the following practical and financial considerations; (i) The
ever increasing difficulties of operating a growing number of diesel units,
when Jordanian performance in this respect has been bad in the past due mainly
to the lack of highly skilled technicians which will become worse as the num-
ber required increases in geometric progression. (ii) the additional costs
that would be incurred in the period 1978-1988, if further diesel capacity up
to 100 MW were to be installed; this additional cost arising out of the
changed generation development pattern would be in the order of US$15 million
(see Attachment 4 page 1); because the whole country may be interconnected
around 1980, it appears highly unlikely that any market could be found to
dispose of the surplus large diesels at a realistic price; and (iii) the need
to have a more reliable source of public electrical supply to stop the waste-
ful installation of private plants in industry.
D.   Sensitivity and Optimization Analysis
Growth in Demand
1.        The sensitivity of the equalizing discount rate (i.e. the present
values of total costs) to growth in demand can only be assessed by scheduling
plant in accordance with assumed changes in growth rates. Two additional
computations have been made, the first for the low demand forecast (Alterna-
tives 1A and 2A) and the second for the high demand forecast (Alternative 1B
and 2B), as shown in Attachment 4 page 3 and page 4 (for netted values).
The equalizing discount rates, up to which the steam development would be the
least cost alternative are: 9.1% for the low demand forecast, 15.3% for the
high demand forecast, as compared with 13.6% for the intermediate demand fore-
cast (see C 4). Attachment 7 page 1 shows the relevant net present value
graphs. It appears justified to assume the high probability of the equalizing
discount rate to exceed 13.5% because (a) the benefits to the economy of in-
creased service quality are not included in the calculations since they are
unquantifiable in Jordan, (a) the probability of sustaining the "intermediate"
growth rate is high (see 8 above), and (c) the equalizing discount rate in-
creases more than linear with an increase in growth rate.



ANNEX 13
Page 7 of 10 pages
Selection of Steam-Electric Unit Size
2.        The following procedure was applied to select the optimum steam
unit size. Capital cost streams were calculated of the alternative smaller
and larger unit sizes necessary to meet the intermediate forecast demand.
These streams replaced the original capital costs streams in Alternative 1 or
Alternative 2 respectively and the new equalizing discount rates were calcula-
ted. This assumes that operating costs, including fuel, do not vary. The
resulting error will be negligable because the sensitivity to variations in
efficiency is small as concluded in C 3 above, and 0 & M cost are basically
the same.
3.        For Alternative 1 a sequence of 33, 66 and 100 MW had been assumed,
and Alternative 1C was set up by assuming a sequence of 25, 50, 75 and 125 1W.
Alternative 2 was not varied (obviously a 25 MW initial steam set would be
too small for this alternative, with demand increasing some 15 MW annually
by the end of the decade). Attachment 5 shows the relevant cost streams and
in order to simplify computations, the net present value of total costs was
calculated for a discount rate of 13% only. Because total net present value
increases considerably compared with Alternative 1/Alternative 2, the equaliz-
ing discount rate decreases accordingly, and the smaller unit size should be
rejected.
4.        Attachment 6 shows a further study, in which the 33, 66 and 100 NW
sequence in the diesel/steam development is replaced by the sequence 50, 100
and 200 MW to form Alternative 2C. The equalizing discount rate is 13.5%
i.e. practically equal to the equalizing discount rate of Alternative 1/Alter-
native 2. A further effort was made to investigate whether this development
could be optimized slightly be removing the 10 MI diesel unit scheduled for
operation in 1989 (or conceivably one more in 1988). This advances the
second 50 MW unit and other future units by one year. For this reason Alter-
native 2D was set up and compared with Alternative 1 (all steam development)
and computed. The results, expressed in net present values, are shown in a
note on Attachment 6. The equalizing discount rate decreases from 13.5% for
Alternative 1/Alternative 2C to 13.1% for Alternative 1/Alternative 2D,
slightly below the 13.6% equalizing discount rate shown for Alternative 1/
Alternative 2. This is well within the range of uncertainties and for this
reason, economically, Alternative 2, 2C and 2D should be considered to be
practically equivalent.
5.        Of course, should it be decided to go ahead with a diesel/steam
development, a future study should refine the calculation in the light of the
then prevailing conditions, but on the basis of the present study it is con-
cluded with regard to the unit size that: For an all-steam development the
initial plant should be of a capacity of 2 x 33 MW; this is about equal or
slightly below the total capacity of diesel plant available at the time of
commissioning of the steam plant. Similarly, for a diesel/steam development,
the initial steam plant (following the diesels) should be of a capacity of
about 2 x 50 MW; again about equal to the total capacity in diesel plant
available at that time.
6.        Because the alternative developments are some 100 NW in diesel
capacity "apart" and a change in this capacity (one 10 MW diesel was already



ANNEX 13
Page 8 of 10 pages
removed and a second may conceivably also be removed) does not appear to
modify the equalizing discount rate in any appreciable amount, the conclusion
may be drawn that since a change over to steam plant is necessary at some
future time, then:
- at whatever time in the future it is decided to change from
diesel generation to steam generation, steam capacity to be
installed should be about equal to the diesel capacity available
at the time of conversion;
- any such development can be expected to appear relatively
marginal because this is inherent in a complete technological
change, and
- delay in the changeover to steam will cause higher financial
requirements and will make more diesel capacity obsolete at
the time of the change;
- therefore it is prudent to make the change to steam plant with-
out further delay.
Selection of intermediate type of plant
7.        A comparison of alternative gasturbine and diesel plant is un-
necessary. In the case of Jordan the gasturbine plant having the lowest
capital cost, is the least cost alternative any discount rate because tnis
plant is not expected, except in 1974/75, to generate any appreciable amount
of energy for several years. In fact, any intermediate plant, whether diesel
or gasturbMne, will be redundant after steam plant is commissioned, because
sufficiont capacity is at present available to provide full reserve for one
of the Ziarqa steam units as well as peaking service. The gasturbine should,
therefote, be justified by assessing the impact on the economy of not instal-
ling it.
8.        Because the total longterm benefits foregone by the economy at-
tributaK1e to not installing such plant cannot be quantified from the data
available in Jordan, a practical short term cost/benefit ratio has been
calculated. The main consequence of not installing interim plant would be
that for about 2 years up to 6 MW of demand would have to be suppressed (10%
of demand in 1975) if no reserve capacity is allowed, and up to 12 MW (20% of
demand) if reserve capacity is taken into account. In view of the condition
of existing diesel plant, repeated suppression of demand of up to 12 MW is
highly probable. Any unforseen delays in the completion of the Zarqa plant
would further aggrevate the situation.
9.        The following short term consequences are quantifiable:
a)   By 1975 the refinery at Zarqa expects either to install a
third unit (a steam-electric unit with a capacity of at least



ANNEX 13
Page 9 of 10 pages
2.4 MW), or to increase its supply from JEPCO. It is understood
that, if a gasturbine in Zarqa is not installed, the refinery
will erect its own plant at an estimated cost of about US$1
million.
b)   As soon as the Zarqa plant is commissioned, JEPCO intends to
sell its older diesels to other power entities. The market
for such plant appears ample, for instance it is highly likely
that IDECO will require further generating plant by 1976/77.
Purchasing this plant from JEPCO will save those entities
about US$200 - per kW in imported plant cost. It is difficult
to estimate the savings, but assuming that about 6 IMW in diesel
capacity (50% of the gasturbine capacity) can be bought second
hand from JEPCO, the buyers are likely to save not less than
about US$0.5 million. Reconditioning costs are reflected in
this difference.
c)   Without doubt, under conditions of continued suppression of
demand and reluctance to connect new customers, captive plant
capacity can be expected to increase by several megawatts at
a minimum cost of US$0.5 million,
d)   Suppression of demand will affect JEPCO's revenue adversely.
Net revenue per klWh for this company is about 8.6 fils/kWh
(US6 2.4/kWh) and assuming that suppression would amount only
to 2% in generation during 1974/75, or about 8 CWh, the net
revenue forgone would total about US$200,000.
e)   The minimum total financial consequences as outlined above,
aggregates US$2.2 million, which is 10% in excess of the cost of
the gasturbine plant of US$2 million. The total benefit to
the economy, could it be quantified, is likely to be consider-
ably higher. Thus the gas turbine is the least cost alterna-
tive means of meeting the intermediate power requirements.
Variations in Prices and Costs
10.       Attachment 7 page 2 gives a graphical representation of the sensi-
tivity of the equalizing discount rate to growth rate, and to all cost factors
for the intermediate demand forecasts, which can be summarized as follows:
a)   Sensitivity to growth rate is high, (see D1) but the equali-
zing discount rate increases somewhat more than linear with an
increase in growth rate.
b)   Although the equalizing discount rate is rather sensitive to
either variations in diesel or in steam plant construction



ANNEX 13
Page 10 of 10 pages
costs, sensitivity to overall changes in construction cost for
generating plant (say up to 10-15%) is small.
c)   The equalizing discount rate is rather sensitive to the as-
sumptions made for either diesel or steam efficiencies. Because
the basic assumptions made for both diesel and steam were about
equally conservative, sensitivity to variations in efficiencies
should be measured more or less simultaneously for diesel and
steam. This would be equivalent to changing fuel oil prices
and from the relevant graph (which assumes increases ranging
from 10-50%) and it is concluded that the sensitivity of the
equalizing discount rate to a change in overall efficiency,
or fuel oil prices, is practically nil.
d)   The equalizing discount rate is not very sensitive to changes
in diesel operating and maintenance costs (excluding fuel) and
even less so for steam. The sensitivity to changes in the over-
all 0 & M is small, but this has little significance because
either a steam or diesel development will be selected; in this
respect steam shows a preference due to its lower sensitivity.

Assumptions for Cost Estimates for
Comparison of Alternatives
Assumptions for Capital Costs
The following assumptions were made for capital cost of plant per kW:
Diesel
1.  6 MW, first unit $200; subsequent units $183
2. 10 MW, first unit $225; subsequent units $195
Steam
3. 2 x 25 MW, $275; subsequent units $295
4.  2 x 33 MW, $235; subsequent units $255
5.  2 x 50 MI, $195; subsequent units $210
6.  66 MW, $195 (added to existing station)
7.  75 MI, $170 (added to existing station)
S. 100 IW, $160 (added to existing station)
9.  125 MW, $155 (added to existing station)
10.  150 MW, $150 (added to existing station)
11.  200 MW, $140 (added to existing station)
Casturbine
12. 15 MW, $130 (site rating 12-13 MW)
The above prices have been based on (i) Kuljian information, obtained from
representative manufacturers, (ii) Kuljian's estimate for 33 MW steam plant,
(iii) recent bids for Guatemala for 50 MW and 66 MW steam plant, (iv) con-
tract prices for JPECO's 3 x 6 MW diesel plant, (v) recent bids for diesel
plant in Honduras, (vi) consultant (Preece, Cardew and Rider) estimates for
10 IM diesel units.
Assumption for Fuel Costs
4.        Prices in Jordan are the following:

Residual oil
Ex-refinery Zarqa
6.5 JD/metric ton = $18.20/t
or 106BTU = 45.9 USi
Base Price (delivered) for the Whole of the Country
7.4 JD/metric ton = $20.72/t
or 106BTU = 52.2 USO
Price for JEPCO (Amman)
7.0 JD/metric ton = $19.60/t
or 106BTU = 49.4 US4
No taxes or duties are levied for residual oil: for JEPCO the price
includes transportation.
Diesel oil
The excise tax included in the prices is
1.5 fils/liter = 0.42 USE/liter
Because the tax is small and only a limited amount of diesel fuel is
required for starting diesels normally operating on residual oil, the
tax was not removed for calculating fuel cost.
Ex-refinery Zarga
16.16 JD/metric ton = $45.25/t
or 106BTU = 105 USI
Base Price (delivered) for the Whole of the Country
17.6 JD/metric ton = 49.28/t
or 106BTU = 114 US4
Price for JEPCO (Amman)
16.4 JD/metric ton = $45.92/t
or 106BTU = 107 US4
This price includes transportation.
Future Price for JEA
Assuming that industrial diesel oil will be made available:
9 JD/metric ton = $25.20/t

Gasturbine (at Zarga)
JD3,390/GWh = $9,500/GWh (16,000 BTU/kWh, 60% load factor)
Assumptions for Spares and Special Maintenance
Diesel Plant
For the period 1973-1975 the appraisal estimates are used, reflecting
JEPCO's historic costs. From 1976 onward: JD420/GWh - US$1,175/GWh.
Steam Plant
For the period 1976-1980 the appraisal estimates are used.
For the period beyond 1980
15% of fuel costs, which included salary and wages (see below).
Assumption for Salaries and Wages
Diesel Plant
For the period 1972-1980 JEPCO's records were used to assess manpower
requirements and salaries and wages.
Beyond 1980:
JD720/GWh = $2000/GEh



ANNEX 13
ATTACHMENT 3
Page 4 of 4 pages
However, because the bulk of the diesel plant would rapidly become
obsolete after commissioning of steam plant staff reductions are assumed
commensurate with the phasing out and retirement of diesel plant.
Steam Plant
For the period through 1980 the appraisal estimates were used (based on
forecast staffing of the Zarqa plant and JEA's renumeration schedules),
Beyond 1980:
15% of fuel cost, including spares and special maintenance by
foreign contractors; a comparison with the consultant estimates
(of 0.375 fils/kWh - 1 US mil/kWh) shows this 0 & M cost to
be about equivalent.
Assumptions for Escalation and Shadow Pricing
All prices are assumed at the 1972 price levels, without escalation
and the then ruling rate of exchange (1JD = 2.8 US$) was assumed to
reflect the cost of foreign exchange in cost of local money. Fuel
prices appear rather low in comparison with the present international
prices and for this reason are assumed to reflect actual cost in
local money. Because the number of unskilled labor employed in the
Zarqa station will be small, no shadow pricing of salaries and wages
was applied.

z/  1971 incorporates a write down of poles in stock not charged to ID1CO.  Depreciation van JD 8,000.  In all other years
poles are eharged at cost including depreciation 1972/1975 of JD 10,000 and 1976/1979 of JD 14,000.
Since JEA will be using Marqa as its standby and peaking station, the return on larqa's average net fixed assets
paid to JEECO hea been included with JEA'S Interest payable.
Under JEA's agreeent with the Goverment, all not proceeds of its relending activities to JEPZO and ID2CO
must be appropriated to Capital Reserve.
j/ Although 1979 is about 8% below the required 9% rate of return, the deficit could well be because of the
.onservative 11.6% sales grovth end cost estimates assumed.

JEPCO FINANCIAL SITUATION
Fixed Assets and Longterm Debt
1.        JEPCO's actual financial situation at 12-31-1971 was sound as shown
by its Balance Sheet on Page 3 of this Annex. The JD 4.1 million in net
fixed assets mainly represented the balance of the original cost of its three
diesel electric generating stations at Ras-al-Ain (built 1948) Zarqa (built
1958) and Marqa (first unit 1962), plus its distribution networks in and
around Amman and some 330 km. of 33 kV and 6.6 kV transmission. From 1968
to 1971 little construction took place due to financial constraints and what
was achieved was mainly self financed with the help of (continuing) short
term borrowing from the local bank. The only recent long term borrowing was
in 1969, when the municipality lent JEPCO JD 40,000 at 5 1/2% over 10 years
plus 2 years grace period for the construction of additional street lighting.
In 1971, however, JEPCO started on a 5-year construction program financed by
a JD 3.1 million (E 3.6 million) U.K. loan to the Government and relent
(via JEA) to JEPCO at 6% over 15 years including a 3-year grace period (see
2.17). JD 1.1 million of this was for 3x6 MW diesel generating sets at
Marqa (presently under construction) and the remaining JD 2.0 million for
33 kV transmission. JEPCO's only other long term debt is the JD 428,000
balance remaining outstanding from a US-AID credit made in 1961 for distri-
bution.
Equity
2.        On 31-12-1971, JD 2.7 million was paid up out of JEPCO's autho-
rized nominal capital of JD 3 million which is expected to be fully paid in
1972. Only 10% of its shares were held by the government or municipalities,
the remainder being private holdings. Total equity of JD 3.6 million in
1971 (including undistributed surplus and reserved of JD 0.9 million) is
expected to increase to JD 6.1 million by 1979 despite the annual distri-
bution of dividends at their maximum permitted level of 10% of nominal
shares capital. JEPCO's debt/equity ratio was 5:95 in 1971 and is only
expected to reach 29:71 in 1975 before declining again to 17:83 by 1979.
Current Assets
3.        By 1971 JEPCO's current assets and current liabilities were
virtually in balance with its overdraft reduced to JD 179,000, but with
its consumer accounts receivable at an abnormally high level of JD 244,000
(equivalent to 66 days billings); partly the aftermath of the late 1970
disturbances. JEPCO has improved its procedures and expects shortly to
reduce consumer outstandings to about 15% of sales or the equivalent of
55 days billings, which would be an acceptable level.



ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 6 pages
Income Statements
4.        JEPCO's income statements (Page 4 of this Annex) show that these
tariffs, which average 16 fils/kWh overall, are adequate. In 1971 the rate
of return was 11.7% and this is expected to increase to about 14% by 1974.
With the advent of JEA's Zarqa power station, JEPCO's rate of return is
expected to drop to about 8% in 1976 and 1977 before climbing to about 9%
to 10% by 1979. In estimating JEPCO's expenditure and income the contracts
with JEA described in paragraph 6.11 of the report have been assumed with
an unchanged average retail tariff level of 16 fils/kWh (USd4.9). Other
major financial assumptions are shown in Annex 14.
Estimated Generation Costs - Marqa
5.        The estimations of the amounts to be paid to JEPCO by JEA as a
result of the Marqa maintenance contract are based on JEPCO's estimated
costs of running this station plus a return of 9% on Marqa's average net
fixed assets. Page 5 of this Annex shows JEPCO's actual generation costs
for 1969 through 1971 and the estimates for Marqa from 1972. All expend-
iture has been included as "fixed costs" except for fuel, spares and materials,
which have been treated as "variable" and comprise the marginal cost paid
by JEA for kWh's generated at Marqa. The fixed cost includes all direct
salaries and wages, depreciation and 20% of general administrative overheads
which is considered a reasonable allocation for the cost of administering
Marqa as a standby or peaking station.
Sources and Applications of Funds
6.        JEPCO's future construction program through 1979 is shown in
its Sources and Applications (Page 6 of this Annex) and comprises general
extensions and reinforcements of its distribution network costing about
JD 500,000 annually. This will be additional to the cost of the 3 diesel
units and 33 kV lines mentioned in 1 above and to miscellaneous items such
as vehicles and office equipment, etc. Debt service on its 3 long term
loans (US-AID, municipality and JEA) average about JD 400,000 annually from
1974 reducing to JD 360,000 by 1979. Debt service is covered at least 2.5
times by net cash generation.
