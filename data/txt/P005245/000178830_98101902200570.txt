INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO JORDAN
FOR THE HUSSEIN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1 *        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to Jordan for the equivalent of US$10.2 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance the Hussein Thermal Power Project. The proceeds
of the credit would be relent to the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA)
for 25 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4
percent per annum. The credit would be made jointly with a loan equiv-
alent to US$10.2 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Develop-
ment, also to the Government for relending to JEA.
PART I - TIE ECONOMY
2.         An economic mission visited Jordan in November/December 1971
and its report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Jordan"
(R72-231) dated October 10, 1972, has been distributed to the Executive
Directors. Country data are presented in Annex I.
3.         Recent economic events in Jordan have been influenced by the
1967 war with Israel and the subsequent confrontation with the Palestinian
Fedayeen groups in 1970/71. In particular, the Israeli occupation of the
West Bank led to a considerable reduction in the existing poor resource
base, and added over 300,000 refugees to the already overpopulated East
Bank. The occupation of the West Bank, comprising only 6 percent of
Jordan's territory but 30 percent of its population, deprived the country
of about 35-40 percent of its GDP and severely curtailed the growth of
the most promising sectors, agriculture, tourism' and industry. These
changes made the Jordanian economy even more dependent on external
transfers, which together with net factor income from abroad, have ac-
counted for almost one-third of GNP since 1969.
4.               The fighting with the Palestinian guerrilla movements
in 1970/71 interrupted economic activities and provoked economic
sanctions against Jordan by some Arab countries.   Vulnerable because of
its landlocked geography, Jordan was particularly affected by the closure,
from July 1971 to November 1972, of the Syrian border to Jordanian trade,
cutting off the country from Europe and resulting in a decrease in the
volume of exports from $33 million in 1969 to $25 million in 1971. Dif-
ficulties were compounded by the suspension of budget support from Kuwait
and Libya.  Of the US$105 million annual subsidies Jordan had received
under the Khartoum Agreement in the period 1967 to 1970 from Saudi Arabia,



- 2 -
Libya and Kuwait, only Saudi Arabia continued its US$40 million annual
payments after 1970. However, the suspension of the payments from Kuwait
and Libya were partly compensated by increased US assistance.
5.         After a four year period of economic stagnation, signs of economic
recovery began to appear in the second half of 1971 and there was continued
improvement through 1972. There was an upturn in agricultural output in 1971
to about the level of 1969, but the recovery in industry and particularly
construction lagged due to the shortage of imported industrial supplies. With
the reopening of the Syrian border, which is a vital link to the Mediterranean,
an improved domestic political situation and the apparent revival of private
investment, the outlook for accelerated economic growth has now improved
markedly. Exports, for example, rose sharply to $48 million in 1972. Im-
portantly, the change in atmosphere and attitude within the country has
permitted the Jordan Government to give more attention to longer-term economic
policies. A Three-Year Development Plan (1973-75) was prepared which, together
with supporting financial and budgetary policies, should provide an addlt:ional
impetus to economic and social development and restore some confidence in
Jordan's future. Nevertheless, Jordan's future development is internally
constrained by the poverty of natural resources and the pressure of population,
and is linked to the fundamental problems of the Middle East situation, which
could continue to have unpredictable economic effects.
6.         The Plan calls for increased employment, high growth in output,
reduction of the trade gap, and elimination of budget support from abroad
over thie longer run. A key feature of the Plan is to step up investment to
$557 million oVer the 1973-75 period; this would be an increase of roughly
50 percent over the investment level of the depressed 1969-71 period and
would nake possible the creation of about 70,000 new jobs. This would partially
alleviate the serious unemployment problem existing around the urban centers,
partictla'rly it the refugee camps.  The Plan aims at achieving an average
annual growth in GDP of 8 percent, which is equal to the growth rate of the
Jordan-an ec;onomy for the period 1962-1 966,
7.         Of the total Plan investment, three-fourths are allocated to four
sectors:  transport (20 percent), mining, power and industry (20 percent),
construction ('19 percent), and agriculture (15 percent).  Other social sectors
claim together about 17 percent of Plan investment. In the transport sector,
the bulk of investments are for railroad construction works to connect the
Port o±' Aaaba with the existing railway network to Amman, as well as the
Hedjaz Railway Line between El-Hasa and Ma'an. In the construction sector
special emaphasis is placed on providing low-cost housing and supplying min-
istries and Government departments with adequate office facilities.  These
have become czritical needs as a result of the overpopulation in the ci.ties,
especially in Amman, and mounting pressure on Government services.  The most
important projects in industry and mining are designed to step up phcsphate
rock mining and phosphate processing which are the most promising large-
scale industrial opportunities open to Jordan at the present juncture.



- 3 -
8.         Fifty-six percent (i.e. $310 million) of total Plan investment
is envisaged in the public sector. The puiblic sector expects about 70
percent of investTnent finance to be suppi ied by foreign sources, of which fcreign
loans would contribute US$ 165 million and foreign economic and technical assis-
tance grants about US$51 million. The planned recourse to foreign borrowing
would be substantially greater than in the past. The Plan also assumes that
the 5overnment budget will provide a current surplus over the Plan period and
providde for investments of about US$32 million during 1973-75. The Plan foresees
a significant increase in domestic borrowing, mainly through the issuance of
development bonds and treasury bills, which would contribute US$1h8 million.
9.         The Plan appears very ambitious and might put undue nressure both
on the balance of payments and on the internal financial situation, if fully
implemented, but it is a good first step in the direction of the establishment of
investment priorities and formulation of policy criteria.   A NDDP Planning
Assistance Project has been set up, for which the Bank is Executing Agency.
It will help train Government planning officials in project preparation and
evaluation and linking the Plan to the annual budget.
10.        External assistance to Jordan has largely been in the form of
grants to the Government, averaging IJS$126 million per year during 1967-71.
The net inflow of long- and medium-term capital to the central and local
governments fluctuated around US$12 million during the same four years.   Jordan's
external public debt (excluding undisbursed) was about $130 million on December 31,
1971, of which debt outstanding to the Association was US$9 million. The debt
service ratio on public debt was 8f percent of exports of goods and non-factor
services in 1971, but was expected to increase to 12-15 percent in 1972, mainly
as a result of a loan for the purchase of two intercontinental aircraft.   Includ-
ing private debt, the total debt service ratio   for 1972 was estimated by the
Jordanian authorities to be over 20 percent. If export earnings continue to
increase as is expected., the debt service ratio would remain at about this same
level, despite Jordan's expected heavy reliance on foreign loans.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
11.        The proposed credit would be the seventh Bank Group operatior in
Jordan, and the first for power. It would bring total IDA lending to date to
TTS'31.6 million.  IDA lending to Jordan began in 1961, but was interrupted bv
the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 and the disturbances that followed. The projects
then under consideration were held in abeyance for some time. However, in
June 1971, the Association approved a $6 million Highway Project (Credit 262-JO),
and in 1972 a $5.4 million Education project.   My recommendation on a $8.7
million credit to finance the second Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project
is being distributed separately at this time for your consideration. Perfor-
mance under the projects is generally satisfactory.   Annex II contains a summary
statement of IDA credits as of March 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.



- 4-
12.             For FY 1974, an irrigation and rural development
project in the northern part of the Jordan Valley/East Bank is being
prepared. It is part of a comprehensive $88 million regional scheme,
of which other parts are being considered for financing by USAID
and the Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau of the Federal Republic of
Germany. A second education project and a combined urban development/
highway project for Amman are also under preparation. In addition,
attention is being given to prospects of light industry and tourism,
both sectors which offer future growth prospects and significant
employment opoortunities. An IFC mission visited Jordan in March
1973 to identify possible industrial projects; projects for phos-
phatic fertilizers and ceramics are in an early stage of consideration.
13.             The Bank Group's assistance to Jordan includes an
important element of technical assistance through project identification
and sector work and through direct assistance to the Jordanian Govern-
ment in long-term economic planning.
PART III -- THE SECTOR
14,             Jordan has few natural resources, and there are no coal
deposits or any known deposits of oil. The only indigenous energy
resour6es are a small hydro-power potential of about 5 MW, on the Zarqa
River, which is not yet being developed, and a hydro-potential of
about 46 MW at Shuneh on the Yarmuk river near the Golan Heights. The
envisaged exploitation of the latter was postponed after the June 1967
war. Oil is the main source of energy and is imported under an agree-
ment with the Irans-Arabian Pipeline Company (Tapline) from Saudi
Arabia to the Jordan Oil Refinery at Zarqa, in which the Goverment
has a majority shareholding.
15.            Jordan's total installed electric power capacity is
about 90 MW, half of which is owned by the Jordan Electricity Company
(JEPCO). The rate of growth of electricity consumption is about 13 per-
cent per annum. To meet the expected growth of demand, a 12 MW gas
turbine would be needed by 1975, two 33 MW steam units by 1976, and a
third one by 1978.



16.             The Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), was
established in 1967 to coordinate development of the country's
power resources (see also paragraphs 26-32 below). The various
regional power production companies are under its general
authority. Public electricity supplies in northern Jordan are
provided by the Jordan Electricity Company (JEPCO) and the Irbid
District Electricity Company (IDECO), both private Jordanian
companies. The number of consumers supplied by these two
companies as of January 1, 1973, was about 96,600.
17.            In southern Jordan, electricity supply is provided
by isolated undertakings, the largest public one being the Aqaba
Port Authority which supplies a peak demand of about 3 MW.
18.            Some users are generating their own energy, and
their total capacity is estimated to be 35 MW. The largest
plants are at the Jordan Cement Company (14 MW), near Amman, the
Jordan Oil Refinery at Zarqa (4.8 MW), and at the Jordan Phosphate
Company, which has a load of some 5 MW near its mine at Al Hasa
in the south.
19.            Since power has so far been developed in Jordan
almost exclusively on the basis of diesel generation, the proposed
project would start a new era of power generation in Jordan, by
utilizing the more dependable and economical steam turbine units.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
20,.        A detailed description of the proposed project is given in
the report entitled "Appraisal of the Hussein Thermal Power Project",
dated May 3, 1973, which is being distributed separately. A Credit and
Project Summary is attached as Annex III. A map showing the location
of the project is also attached.
History of the Project
21.         The Government first requested IDAj s assistance in financing
the proposed Hussein Thermal Power Station in 1969. The US Agency for
International Development (USAID) had previously assisted in financing
a feasibility study for this project, which was to be operated in conjunction
with a proposed hydroelectric power station at Shuneh on the Yarmuk River,
and a 132-kV transmission system interconnecting Amman, Jerusalem, Nablus
and Irbid. Subsequently, the envisaged expansion had to be modified because
of the June 1967 war, and the civil disturbances in 1970 and 197'.   The
project was first appraised in June 1971, but the Association concluded
that construction of the steam plant would be premature. The project was
re-appraised by the Association and the Kuwait Fund in November/December
1972, on the basis of an updated feasibility study prepared by the Kuljian
Corporation of the United States. Negotiations were held in Washington,
D.C. from Apr*l 9-16, 1973. The Jordanian delegation was headed by H.E.
Saeed Al-Nabulsi, Minister of National Economy, and included Mr. Ali Ensour,
General Manager of JEA and Mr. Hisham Hashem, Legal Advisor.
Project Description
22.         The project consists of the first stage of a new steam-electric
power station with two generating units of 33 MW each and a gas turbine unit
of about 12 MW, to be constructed at Zarqa, 42 km from Amman, and adjacent
to the Jordan Oil Refinery.   The objective of the project is to meet the
projected demand beginning in early 1976 and to change from diesel to steam
power generation, thereby providing a more reliable and centralized source
of power for future development.   The gas turbine would meet interim peaking
requirements in 1974 and 1975, and thereafter be used as standby.   Consultant
services for engineering and management, as well as studies to assist JEA
in reorganizing its establishment are alsc included.    A second stage,consisting
of a third 33 MW unit would be needed in 1978 and ultimately the capacity at
the Hussein station is expected to reach 200 MW.



- 7 -
23.        Prior to the commissioning of the steam electric plant,
JFA would construct a transmission system from Zarqa to Amman which
is essential to the Project. An arrangement acceptable to the Asso-
ciation for financing its estimated foreign exchange cost of $4 million
is a condition of effectiveness; the Government is presently arranging
bilateral financing from the United Kingdom for this purpose.
Project Cost and Financing
21X.       The total estimated cost of the proposed project is $24.7
million, including a foreign exchange component of $20.4 million.
The foreign exchange component of the project would be financed jointly
by the Association and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.
The proposed credit would be made to the Government, which would relend the
total amoLnt to JEA.  The relending terms, to be set forth in a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Government and JEA, and approved by the Association
would provide for repayment in 25 years, including a 3½ year grace period,
at 74 percent per annum interest.   The Loan of the Kuwait Fund to the Government
would bear an interest rate of 4 percent for a term of 25 years, including a
grace period of 5 years, to be relent to JEA at 6 percent for the same period.
The Government would finance the local costs of the project through loans
to JEA which would be converted to equity when the project begins operation.
25.        JEAfs total investment program through 1979 is about +lbh million.
The Government would finance the local costs of the transmission line from
Zarqa to Arman. After 1976, JEA is expected to meet all local costs of
exnansion from internal cash generation, but foreign loans of about $11
million would be needed to meet the remaining external financing of the
investment program.

Beneficiary: Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA)
26.       The JEA is responsible to the Minister of National
Economy and its principal functions are: (a) to establish generating and
transmission facilities to supply energy in bulk to distributors whose
systems are connected to the JEA system; (b) to manage and operate any
facilities transferred to or acquired by JEA; and (c) to dejelop a supply
of electricity in areas where there is an economic demand and which are
not within the area of supply designated in concessions to other companies.
Existing power stations may be designated by JEA as "selected power stations"
to operate under JEA's direction.  Subject to Cabinet approval, these power
stations may either be purchased by agreement with the owners, or tne erergy
produced may be bought by JEA at a cost suifficient to cover the o!ner's
operating costs. JEA may require that power stations connected to the
system but not designated as "selected Dower stations" and not t:onsi:aered
to be economically justified for continued generation, cease operation.
JEA may also purchase any of the other electricity undertakings al jordani
by agreement with the owners subject to the Cabinet's consent.
27.       JEA's original plans, as included in the Economic Developtcaent
Plan (1964--1970) were to construct an 88-Mf thermal power sta.tioTn at Zarqa,
a 46-MW hydro-electric generating station at Shuneh, and a i32--k-V transmis-
sion system interconnecting Zarqa with Amman, Jerusalem: N.ibi.!.s and. Irbid.
These plans had to be deferred follow:ing the June 1967 Ta.r, so that JEA has
not yet operated as an electricity supply undertakirng, although it has
supervised the expansion of generation facilities an; the 33-kV distribu-
tion networks in the Amman and Irbid concession areas.
28,        JBA is expected to sell small quantities of energy from the gas
turbine in 1974 and 1975, but JEA's operations as a. utility company will
not really start until 1976 with the coming into service of trhe ste.o
generating units.  Initially, JEA would supply power ir bulk solely Lo
JEPCO, but by 1978/79 would also-.supply I'DECO.
290        In order to prepare ror carrying out its n_w operational functions,
JEA has contracted with its consultants to train Jordanian personnel and
provide senior superv.sory staff for the Power station.
3O)        Although the Electricity Law of 1.966 and the Jordan Electricity
Authlority Law of 1967 anti numerous contracts and l.icenzes to other power
entities form a reasonably comprehensive basis for regulation of the sector,
certain aspects of its Law do not give lEA sufficient authority to carry
out its assigned functions,  Since institution building is a principal
objective of the proposed Project, thie Government has provided ass u ances
that it would initiate by September 30, 1974. appropriate legislative action
to amend as necessary the existing laws to:   (i) enable JEA to become more
fully autonomous and be subject only in specific matters of sufficient
general importance to the direction of the Minister of the National Economy,
and (2) reflect the broad principles necessary to regulate the sector in
such matters as tariffs, easements, inspection and testing, a unified ac-
counting system, the collection of stat'istics and the preparation of
technical information;  and to formulate regulations or bylaws setting out
the detailed procedures and requirements to achieve the objectives of the
law.



31.        As most of Jordan's future power generation is expected to be
thermal, wholesale and retail tariffs for electricity should include a
fuel price adjustment clause to protect the financial viability of the
operating companies. Under this caluse, all increases in the price of
residual fuel oil above a pre-determined base price would automatically be
passed onto the retail distributor and, if appropriate to the consumers.
During negotiations, the Government and JEA have agreed to set up such a
fuel price adjustment clause, and also to maintain JEA's tariffs at a level
high enough to produce an annual rate of return of at least 9 percent on its
average net fixed assets. It is expected that this can be accomplished
without requiring an increase in retail tariffs above present levels except
as needed to compensate for fuel price increases.
32.        Although JEA's proposed uniform tariff structure should ensure
adequate earnings, it may have to be adjusted to take into account the
effects of the new Hussein station and IDECO's new power station. It has
therefore been agreed that consultants will study JEA's future bulk sales
tariff, and make recommendations for a modern retail tariff structure to be
implemented throughout the country.
Procurement and Disbursements
33.       All equipment, supplies and civil works contracts would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA's
guidelines. Bid documents have already been issued with IDA's approval and
main contracts are exDected to be awarded after the credit is signed and the
Kuwait Fund loan has become effective. On the basis of the proposed joint
50/50 financing between the Association and the Kuwait Fund, all requests
for disbursements together with supporting documents would be sent to both
IDA and the Kuwait Fund, and each institution would authorize disbursements
of its 50 percent share. The proceeds of the proposed credit would finance
the CIF cost of imported equipment, the actual foreign exchange cost of
consultant's services and overseas training, and the estimated foreign
exchange component of the civil works contracts. The equipment and most
of the materials to be use:. for the project are not produced in Jordan,
and therefore no margin of preference was requested.
Justification
34.       Power development in Jordan has been on the basis of diesel
generation and the country has no significant sources of hydro-power that
can be readily developed. The alternative to continued diesel development
is steam, and the proposed all-steam project was therefore compared with a
continued diesel development for new capacity up to 100 NWj followed by
steam. The equalizing discount rate, up to which the all-steam development
would be more economic than a diesel steam development, ranges between 9



- 10 -
percent and 15.3 percent according to the power market growth rates assumed.
The market is expected to develop fairly rapidly, with a possible average growth
rate of about 14 percent per annum, and the equalizing discount rate for this most
likely growth rate is about 12.5 percent. Although the discounted rate is highly
sensitive to the growth rate of demand, it is relatively insensitive to the
actual timing of the change to steam. To delay this change would however
(i) increase the physical difficulties of operating an ever growing number
of diesels, (ii) increasingly raise the capital requirements for the eventual
change over to steam, and (iii) make more and more diesel capacity obsolete
at the time of the change. The Association, therefore, concurs with the
Government decision to move ahead with steam development at this time.
35.        The installation of an intermediate gas turbine to meet needed
peaking and standby requirements in 1974 and 1975 is justified because the
cost to the economy of not installing such intermediate plant would substan-
tially exceed the cost of the gas turbine estimated at US$2 million.
Ecology
36.       The proposed oil-burning steam plant would be located some 10 km
from Zarqa, adjacent to an oil refinery. The surrounding countryside is
largely desert. A 95 percent effective mechanical precipitator would be
installed to dispose of dust and ash. Sufficient space would be provided to
install additional exhaust gas cleaning facilities, if necessary in the future.
PART V -- LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ATD AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
the Association and JEA, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of
the Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement and
draft Project Agreement conform to the normal pattern of credits for power
projects.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agreement and
Project Agreement would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI -- RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
