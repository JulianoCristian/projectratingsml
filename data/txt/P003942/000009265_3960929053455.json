The primary objectives of the Second Forestry\n            Institutions and Conservation Project are to reduce the pace\n            of deforestation and to sustain and maximize long-term\n            benefits from forest resources. Strategies to achieve these\n            objectives include : a) better management of production\n            forest (concessions) to reduce logging damage and to sustain\n            the regenerative capacity of the forests for longer-term; b)\n            increase in resource mobilization for national development;\n            c) improve the efficiency of future reforestation\n            activities; d) improve the technical basis for reforestation\n            and concession management through adaptive research; and e)\n            improve the management of nature conservation areas through\n            better planning.  The project will include the following\n            components : 1) concession management and inspection; 2)\n            reforestation; 3) forestry research; 4) conservation; and 5)\n            policy advisory service."}, "docdt": "1990-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
