MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO INDONESIA
FOR A SECOND FORESTRY INSTITUTIONS AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$20.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 20 years including five years of
grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance a
second forestry institutions and conservation project. The Japanese Grant
Facility will provide US$0.5 million and ITTO has approved grant cofinancing
of US$0.8 million equivalent for cofinancing the project.
2.        Background.  Indonesian forests are extensive, covering an area
variously estimated at 100 to 114 million ha, or about 60 percent of
Indonesia's land area. Forestry products, the most valuable non-oil export,
account for $3 billion or 25 percent of such exports. With the rapid
development of wood processing industries, Indonesia hae become the world's
biggest hardwood plywood exporter. However, the sustainabiiity of these
exports is being questioned. Weak forestry sector management and conservation
practices are causing accelerated depletion of forest resources. In
particular, the management of Indonesia's production forest, which covers
about half of the total forest area, is causing concern. Because of poor
logging and forest road construction activities, about 40 percent of the
logged area is damaged. While concession agreements provide for caref£l
planning, and environmentally sound log extraction, the compliance by
concessionaires is poor. The long rotation (60 to 80 years) for tropical
rain-forests increases concessionaire's risk; therefore, the concessionaire
has not been willing to invest in improved management of concessions. The
Government has recently shown willingness to act against offenders, but this
effort is hampered by its inability to get timely and accurate information.
This also affects revenue collection and it is estimated that over US$200
million in revenues due to the Government remains uncollected every year.
Other significant constraints are: (a) inadequate research for Outer Island
conditions, where most of the natural forests are situated; (b) a lack of
comprehensive planning for reforesting degraded lands; (c) inadequate programs
for conservation; and (d) weakness in the policy analysis and implementation
capacity. Recognizing these deficiencies, the Government has already
designated 49 million ha of the forest area for conservation and protection
purposes, created a Ministry of Forestry (MOF) in 1983, reviewed concession
arrangements and revenues under the Bank supported Forestry Institutions and
Conservation I Project (FICP I, Loan 2930-IND of 1988), and announced a
150 percent increase in the reforestation fee in 1989. The proposed project
would build on GOI's important initiatives and address some of the remaining
constraints.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been involved in the
forestry sector in Indonesia through FICP I and an environment sector study
(Report No. 7822-IND of June 5, 1989). Although operational involvement has
been limited to the FICP, its implementation experience has been very
positive. Disbursements are ahead of appraisal targets, all covenants are in



-2-
compliance, important institutional reforms, such as the establishment of a
forestry research council, have bean implemented. Important policy actions,
such as the 1989 reforestation fee increase, and the limitation of annual
logging to 32 million cu.m. have been taken to preserve resource. While some
delays in engaging consultants were experienced due to MOF reorganization,
this problem has now been overcome. The proposed project will further enhance
the progress started through the first project, and will incorporate some
relevant lessons from Bank forestry operations in other countries, such as
paying greater attention to market and land tenure aspects in reforestation.
4.        The studies done under the first project have pointed to the urgent
need to improve concession management and revenue collection- from the forestry
sector. The experience has also pointed to the need for improved planning of
reforestation and conservation activities, and for an accelerated program in
forestry research to improve the technical basis for concession, reforestation
and conservation management programs. The proposed project will help GOI
address these emerging priority concerns.
5.        Project Obiectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project are
to reduce the pace of deforestation and to sustain and maximize the long-term
benefits from Indonesian forest resources by addressing critical needs in the
areas of concession management, resource mobilization for the forestry sector,
nature conservation, reforestation of degraded landa, and technology
development to support sectoral programs.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project will (a) strengthen
inspection, monitoring and supervision of concessionaires logging activities
on about 50 million ha of production forests to improve revenue collection and
ensure compliance with environmental regulations of the Government; (b)
develop a master plan, formulate incentives, evaluation criteria and
supervision systems for reforestation activities on about 10 million ha of
degraded lands to increase the efficiency of GOI's program for reforestation;
(c) develop a national forestry research station for Eastern Indonesia in
Irian Jaya and prepare a forestry research master plan; (d) with active
participation of local people, develop plar- and models for conservation and
multi-sectoral sustainable use of mangrove resources, and for the improved
management of ten national parks; and (e) provide a high-level and experienced
advisor and short-term experts for the Minister of Forestry to assist with
strategic planning and policy review and implementation.
7.        The project is estimated to cost about US$33 million, including
US$3.2 million in duties, taxes and US$1.2 million reserved procurement. The
proposed Bank loan of US$20.0 million equivalent will finance 70 percent of
project costs (net of duties, taxes and reserved procurement), and costs of
civil works, construction, equipment and furniture, cost of researc'n
plantations, technical assistance for planning and monitoring (inspection
service), and training. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan
is in Schedule A, and method of procurement and disbursement in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing events is shown in Schedule C, and the status of
Bank Group operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.8603-IND dated June 4, 1990 is being

8.        Actions Agreed.  The GoverNment's agreement to TORs  for the
consultancies covering con^ession management, research and conservation was
confirmed during negotiations. Additional agreements were reached with GOI
that: (a) a reforestation plan will be formulated and proposals for improved
incentives, financing and control mechanism will be completed by October 31,
1993; (b) the research council will meet at least twice a year to review
research plans and progress; (c) plans for the parks will be consistent with
environmental carrying capacity and operational and maintenance funding
realities, and the plans for the buffer zones will improve the livelihood
needs of local people; (d) participation of women forestry specialists in MOP
will be reviewed during on-going human resource development study and women
candidates will have been given satisfactory representation in the foreign
training program for forestry research; and (e) vehicles for the purposes of
the project will be provided by MO0 out of its own resources; (f) contracts
for inspection services, forestry research, resident forestry advisor, and
conservation will be signed before December 31, 1990; (g) a mid-term
evaluation of the project by GOI and the Bank will be completed by March 31,
1993; and an additional condition of effectiveness of the loan will be the
effectiveness of the Japan Grant Agreement.
9.        Benefits.  Economic and environmental benefits are expected from:
(a) improved forestry management leading to a sustained longer-term production
from the forestry sector; (b) improved resource mobilization from the sector
for national and sectoral development; (c) more efficient investment planning
and selection which would reduce investment costs while increasing benefit.,
and (d) more effective conservation of Indonesia's valuable tropical rain
forest resource.
10.       Risks. The main project ri: would be the innovative nature of the
conc,ssion management component where an inspection agency from the private
sector would be engaged to assist the Government in improving revenue
collection and compliance with environmental guidelines. While a similar
approach has been used for customs in Indonesia, this would be the first
approach in the forestry sector. The risk will be minimized by keeping the
project size small and initially starting with only three provinces. The
benefits/costs of the new system would be carefully monitored and evaluated
and the system will be expanded only after positive results are convincingly
demonstrated. There might be some delays in completing the conservation plans
that reflect adequately the views and needs of local people. The Government
will enlist the assistance of the NGO community to facilitate the dialogue on
these plans.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
