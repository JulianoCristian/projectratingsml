The underlying\n            objectives of the project were to reduce the pace of\n            deforestation in Indonesia; and to sustain and maximize the\n            flow of benefits from forest resource use. Bank's\n            performance through the project cycle was satisfactory.\n            Borrower\u2019s performance was satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned were as follows (a) the system of management,\n            coordination and reporting which was in place by the end of\n            the project should have been developed earlier; (b) as far\n            as the components which were canceled from the loan are\n            concerned, perhaps the only real lesson to be drawn from\n            this is that it may have been useful had the Bank and the\n            government cooperated on a more timely and definitive\n            approach to the decisions needed; (c ) some important and\n            basic policy issues must be dealt with by government, to\n            allow the technical and other developments from the sector\n            programs which are in Indonesia to bear fruit; and (d) large\n            gaps remained in the program, especially in the difficult\n            areas of policy and institutional reform and development\n            because of lack of communication among the stakeholders."}, "docdt": "1996-01-17T00:00:00Z"}
