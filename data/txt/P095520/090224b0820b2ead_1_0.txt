                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen Uruguay's capacity to generate, transfer and adapt knowledge and technology by supporting: (i) the
                         institutional framework for science, technology, and innovation (STI); (ii) investments in human capital and high-quality research teams; (iii) technology transfer and
                         private sector innovation; and (iv) cross-sectoral and international research collaboration and mobility of researchers between public institutions and the productive
                         sector.

                         programs. In addition to this, Component 3 also showed advances: the new Board of Directors of ANII approved three Sector Technology Centers (strengthening of the Food
                         Technology and Innovation Unit at the Chamber of Industry; creation of a biopharmaceuticals and recombinant vaccines Production Facility at the Institut Pasteur; and creation of a
                         Center focused on Innovation for Engineering) and signed the corresponding agreements. There is also a fourth proposal (Creation of a Center for Industrial Development) under
