F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The project development objective (PDO) is to strengthen Uruguay's capacity to generate, transfer,
and adapt knowledge and technology by supporting: (i) the institutional framework for science,
technology, and innovation (STI); (ii) investments in human capital and high-quality research
teams; (iii) technology transfer and private sector innovation; and (iv) cross-sectoral and
international research collaboration and mobility of researchers between public institutions and the
productive sector.

               Dropped. Indicator dropped in the 2012 restructuring. The 2012 review of the Project has
               assessed it as an input indicator rather than as an outcome as it does not refer directly to the
               Project objectives. Public R&D funding includes full financing of public research institutes
               (for example, the Technological Laboratory of Uruguay [Laboratorio Tecnológico del
               Uruguay, LATU] and the National Institute of Research in Agriculture and Livestock
               [Instituto Nacional de Investigación Agropecuaria, INIA]), as well as national programs
Comments
               aimed at stimulating education (for example, Plan Ceibal - One Laptop per Child). Given
               the infrastructure and other fixed costs associated with these institutes and programs, they
               account for a large part of total public spending in R&D. On the contrary, fixed costs
               associated with the ANII are minimal, and most of public funding administered by the ANII
               is directly channeled to finance R&D subprojects. The ANII is, for example, the main
               public institution in the country in terms of innovation grants to the private sector.

               Dropped. Indicator dropped in the 2010 restructuring. It is not possible to measure the
               indicator as designed because the National Researcher System (Sistema Nacional de
Comments       Investigadores, SNI) does not register groups but only individuals. As of 2015, there are
               1,400 individual researchers registered in the SNI, against the 1001 researchers registered
               at the moment of its creation (2009).

              Surpassed (147% achieved). The target for this indicator was changed three times. In
              2010, it was scaled down to reflect the closing of a special type of scholarship financed by
              the ANII (supporting internships in private companies), which was assumed to have a direct
              impact on the number of supported researchers inserted into industry. In 2012 and 2014,
              the target was eventually revised upward to reflect the better-than-expected results to date
              as well as the extended implementation period.

              Examples of the type of work that led researchers to find a job in the private sector include

              Dropped. Indicator dropped in the 2010 restructuring to reflect a change in the Project
              strategy. The initial plan was to set up Technology Centers offering services to private
              companies. As of 2010, that approach did not work due to low demand, and instead the
              Project focused on direct support of Alliances and Networks (more flexible instruments).
Comments      Consequently, indicators related to Technology Centers were dropped. In 2012,
              recognizing new favorable conditions for the development of Centers, the ANII renewed
              efforts to promote this activity. The instrument was officially launched to the public in
              2013, but the approved Centers are still in a too early stage of development to be able to
              measure this indicator.

              Dropped. Indicator dropped in the 2010 restructuring. Uruguay is not a member of the
              Patents Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which makes it difficult and less meaningful for
              national researchers/companies to apply for a patent which would be valid only in Uruguay.
              Under the current activities of public-private partnerships (Component 3), 1 patent
              application was submitted (preclinical evaluation of probiotic strains for dairy products,
              developed by one Alliance).

              There are several reasons why patents do not represent a good indicator of innovation
              outcome in Uruguay. First, most innovations do not lead to patents since they are more
              about the adoption of technologies new to the firms or to the country but not necessarily
Comments      new to the world or about process, organizational, or services innovation that do not lead
              to patents, by nature. This is even more true in developing economies, where patents are
              very rare and materialize only in some top and consolidated research centers. Besides,
              patents can be at the very end of an innovative process, which may happen some years after
              the beginning of a research or the creation of a public-private partnership. Finally, it must
              be noted that in Uruguay many representatives from the private sector, including those
              benefitting from the ANII's instruments under Component 3, expressed reluctance to patent
              to better guarantee the secrecy (paradoxically, patenting was seen as a way to lose
              protection) and to avoid dealing with a patents system that is costly at international level
              and still has some deficiencies at Uruguayan level.

              Surpassed (114% achieved). This indicator was introduced during the 2012 restructuring,

              ‘Strengthen capacity to transfer and adapt knowledge and technology’, and the efficacy of
              instruments under Component 3, which remained uncovered after the changes to the results
              matrix introduced in 2010. Given the renewed demand for Technology Centers, the
              indicator was designed so as to include this type of instrument (see Comments to Indicator
Comments      6). The target was revised upward in the 2014 restructuring to reflect the scale-up of
              activities and extended implementation period. Examples of innovations/process
              improvements transferred to firms include a system of molecular diagnosis of viral
              epidemics such as dengue and H1N1; a new technology for the preparation of veterinary
              vaccines; development of a ‘composed flour’ that recycles non-wheat grains not suitable
              for export (as soy and oak); quality control of national production of milk; and a new

               76% achieved. Indicator was reformulated in the 2014 restructuring. The original
               design (‘Average time to process grant proposals between call for proposals and final
               selection’) created a perverse incentive to shorten the call period, which would have
               harmed beneficiaries. On the other hand, the new design better captures the efficiency
               of the implementing agency. According to the new indicator, the reduction in time to
               process grant proposals with respect to baseline was 1.3 months (76% of the 1.7 months

               originally foreseen).

               The average time to process grant proposals would be reduced to 3.5 months if one
               excludes Sectoral Funds. The processing time is longer in this case because the selection
               of Sectoral Funds to be financed involves an external committee composed of research
               institutes and firms (Comité de Agencia). Although the Comité brings a high added

               and the extended implementation period. The definition of the indicator was
               slightly modified during the 2014 restructuring to make it more stringent. The new
Comments       definition considers only ‘operational’ Centers. The formal legal and operational
               requirements to meet this condition were specified in details in the 2014
               Restructuring Paper. Examples of operational Centers are the Center of Innovation
               in Engineering, the Center of Information and Communication Technology, Unit
               of Innovation in Alimentary Technology, and the Center of Industrial
               Extensionism. Besides the 5 operational Centers, 3 more are currently being
               discussed and approaching the contract signature stage.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Promoting Innovation to Enhance Competitiveness Project was a response to the
Government's goal of promoting scientific and technological progress (Uruguay Innovador pillar in
the Government strategy). The Project included a comprehensive set of mutually reinforcing
activities. Component 1 focused on supporting science, technology, and innovation (STI) policies,
including the development of the National Strategic Plan for STI, and the creation and institutional
strengthening of the National Research and Innovation Agency (Agencia Nacional de Investigación
e Innovación, ANII). Component 2 offered direct financing for research subprojects and scholarships
for graduate students and young researchers and strengthened the offer of graduate and technical
tertiary programs. Component 3 financed public-private innovation partnerships. If successful, the
Project would strengthen Uruguay's capacity to generate, transfer, and adapt knowledge and
technology.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.      Uruguay had experienced an impressive recovery and rapid growth since the crisis and deep
recession of 1998–2003. Real gross domestic product had been growing at an average annual rate of
5.2 percent between 2004 and 2006.1 The challenge was to sustain robust gross domestic product
growth and break with the slow-growth pattern of previous decades, by coupling the recently
achieved macroeconomic stability with increased productivity. Understanding that this would have
been possible only by finding new and better ways of doing business, the Government of Uruguay
gave high priority to innovation during 2005–2009 by including it as one of the six pillars of the
National Development Program.2

3.     At the time of appraisal, total investment in STI in the country had been modest and unstable.
STI policies and programs had evolved in an ad hoc manner, with the lack of coordination resulting
in the duplication of efforts in some areas, while other problems had remained unattended. The
country had yet to develop data collection structures and validation processes that ensure a continuous
flow of reliable STI statistics, and there was a lack of information on the effectiveness of public STI
expenditure. Uruguay lacked an adequate supply of advanced human capital, especially in terms of
graduate and technical tertiary education, and a critical mass in research. The research agenda was
not focused on the problems of the productive sector but was basically defined by researchers.
Investment in research and development (R&D) had been mainly public and concentrated in the
University of the Republic. There was insufficient capacity to transfer and adapt technology in private
companies, especially because of underdeveloped links between demand and supply of knowledge
and technology.

4.     In 2001, there was an attempt to institutionalize innovation policy with the establishment of
the National Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation (Dirección Nacional de Ciencia,
Tecnología e Innovación, DINACYT) as a department within the Ministry of Education and Culture

1
  World Development Indicators (WDI).
2
  The 2005–2009 Government’s program ‘El Gobierno de Cambio - La Transición Responsible’ introduced a new
national development strategy for the country articulated along six key complementary themes: enhancing productivity
(Uruguay Productivo), fostering social development (Uruguay Social), promoting innovation (Uruguay Innovador),
strengthening democracy (Uruguay Democrático), enhancing regional and global integration (Uruguay Integrado), and
promoting policies which consolidate and promote Uruguayan culture (Uruguay Cultural).


                                                         1
(MEC). This institutional framework had not proven effective. The MEC had been moderately
successful in supporting basic science but little progress had been made with regard to stimulating
public-private research linkages and innovation. DINACYT’s funding had been volatile, and the
implementation of innovation programs remained dispersed among other agencies.

5.      As of 2006, Uruguay relied on the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for external
financial and technical assistance on STI, through the two consecutive projects ‘Science and
Technology Program’ (1991–2000) and ‘Technological Development Program II’ (2001–2007). To
deal with the ambitious challenge of both institutionalizing innovation policy and expanding the set
of instruments to support STI, the Government looked for support from more international
organizations. The World Bank was recognized as a preferred partner, given its long-standing
international experience on STI and its encouragement of local dialogue on innovation.

6.      The Promoting Innovation to Enhance Competitiveness Project was a response to the
Government's goal of promoting scientific and technological progress to jump-start growth (Uruguay
Innovador pillar in the Government strategy). It was also fully aligned with the FY05/10 Country
Assistance Strategy II pillar to promote sustainable growth by helping increase total factor
productivity, improving access to highly skilled individuals, enhancing the competitiveness of
existing sectors, and facilitating the growth of emerging sectors (Report No. 31804-UY). In addition,
the Project indirectly aimed at supporting the creation of new and more productive jobs helping to
enhance living standards, which corresponded to pillar III of the FY05/10 Country Assistance
Strategy. Finally, the Project built on the analytical work ‘Uruguay: Sources of Growth, Policies for
the Development of Human Capital, Integration, Competition and Innovation’, June 14, 2005 (Report
No. 31737-UY).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

7.       The PDO is to strengthen Uruguay's capacity to generate, transfer and adapt knowledge and
technology by supporting (i) the institutional framework for STI; (ii) investments in human capital
and high-quality research teams; (iii) technology transfer and private sector innovation; and (iv)
cross-sectoral and international research collaboration and mobility of researchers between public
institutions and the productive sector.3

8.         These objectives were translated into the following key indicators and targets:

          40 percent of annual public R&D funding administered by the ANII (annual)
          50 research groups with more than 3 researchers registered in the national researcher
           classification system (cumulative)
          50 internationally published Science Citation Index (SCI) scientific articles (cumulative)
          240 graduates from domestic master’s and PhD programs (annual)
          40 project-supported researchers inserted into industry (cumulative)
          40 percent of variable costs of supported technology centers generated by the sale of services
           (annual)
          4 patent applications submitted by supported research consortia (cumulative)
          70 percent of beneficiaries were satisfied, as measured through perception surveys

    The statement of the PDO in the Loan Agreement (pag. 5) and in the PAD (pag. 11) are identical.


                                                            2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

9.      The PDO was not revised. Key indicators and targets were extensively revised during the
2010 and 2012 restructurings and to a minor extent during the 2014 restructuring. The following are
the revised/added key indicators (more details on the changes applied and relative justification can
be found in the Data Sheet):

      1,000 internationally published scientific articles (annual) - adaptive/opportunistic
       restructuring
      600 graduates from domestic master’s and PhD programs (annual)- opportunistic
       restructuring
      30 project-supported researchers inserted into industry (cumulative)- adaptive/opportunistic
       restructuring
      80 percent of beneficiaries were satisfied, as measured through perception surveys-
       opportunistic restructuring
      7 technological innovations/process improvements transferred to the productive sector under
       Component 3 (Centers, Networks, Stimulating Technological Demand Projects, and
       Alliances) (cumulative) - adaptive restructuring

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The direct target group were national stakeholders directly involved in STI activities: the
ANII (especially through activities of institutional strengthening under Component 1); research
institutes and researchers (mainly by supporting research subprojects and investigators, as well as
graduate and technical education under Component 2; and through links and activities generated with
the private sector under Component 3); and the private sector in Uruguay (primarily through activities
under Component 3). The indirect target group could possibly be identified with the Uruguay
population as a whole if positive spillovers with regard to increased productivity, sustainable growth,
and enhanced living standards from innovation materialize.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

11.    Component 1 aimed at supporting STI policies and institutional strengthening. It was
organized into three subcomponents: (1.1) Support the development of public STI policies; (1.2)
Support the ANII; and (1.3) Set up and support the STI Observatory. The first subcomponent is
focused primarily on offering support to draft the National Strategic Plan for STI (PENCTI),
including consultation and dissemination activities on STI policies. The goal of activities under the
second subcomponent was the creation and strengthening of the ANII as the coordinator and
implementing agency of national STI policies. Finally, the third subcomponent focused on ensuring
the setup of a strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system for STI policies, initially to be
incubated within the ANII and subsequently to be designed as an independent institution
(observatory). Overall, activities under this component were strategic to set up the institutional
framework to achieve the PDO.

12.   Component 2 intended to build human capital and high-quality research teams. This
component was also organized into three subcomponents: (2.1) Promote excellence in science and


                                                  3
technology research in priority areas; (2.2) Increase the stock of advanced human capital; and (2.3)
Strengthen priority technical tertiary education programs. Activities under the first subcomponent
provided direct funding to research projects in strategic areas identified by the PENCTI, such as
exports, information and communication technology (ICT) and biotechnology, as well as research of
high social impact. A multistakeholder, multidisciplinary approach was to be preferred.
Subcomponent 2.2 focused on the ‘production’ of young researchers. It included a portfolio of
scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the development and strengthening
of domestic master’s and doctoral programs. Finally, Subcomponent 2.3 targeted ‘production’ of
technicians, by developing and strengthening technical tertiary education programs.

13.     Component 3 focused on promoting innovation and technology transfer to the productive
sector. It included two subcomponents which, in their original design, reflected the two instruments
to be sponsored. Subcomponent 3.1 covered activities to develop Sector Technology Centers,
physical spaces gathering STI specialists able to offer/sell technology services to firms in strategic
sectors. Subcomponent 3.2 supported public-private research consortia, aimed at facilitating
collaboration between demand (private sector) and supply (research institutes and academia) of
knowledge and technology.

1.6 Revised Components

14.   The 2010, 2012, and 2014 restructurings allowed for an expanded set of activities under
Component 1 (inclusion of the Trama Interinstitucional y Multidisciplinaria de Bibliografía On-line
[TIMBO] portal to coordinate and expand access to scientific publications) and Component 3 (to
comprise Sector Technology Centers, Sector Technology Networks, Alliances, and Stimulating
Technological Demand Projects).

1.7 Other Significant Changes

15.    In 2008, as approved by the first Project restructuring, the Loan Agreement was amended to
eliminate interest waivers and include default interest and the front-end fee amount. The disbursement
table was changed accordingly. Fund allocation was further revised in 2010, with the inclusion of a
new category ‘Access to Scientific Publications’, to finance the TIMBO portal, and in 2012, when
resources from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) that were not used during project preparation
were reallocated to Component 2 to finance additional scholarships. Other significant changes
include the formal designation of the ANII as the implementing agency (second project restructuring,
2008) (more details can be found in section 2.2).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

16.     The Bank had strongly positioned itself as a supporter of innovation policy in Uruguay,
building on the analytical work Uruguay: Sources of Growth, Policies for the Development of Human
Capital, Integration, Competition and Innovation (2005, Report No. 31737-UY). First, the study
stressed the need to build an integrated system of innovation policy to improve coordination between
STI programs. This would have required a deeper institutionalization of STI policy and the
integration of STI programs under the umbrella of one single implementing agency able to ensure


                                                  4
coordination and budget sustainability. Second, the report highlighted the importance of creating
linkages between firms and R&D activities by fostering public-private partnerships for innovation
and developing a diversified set of sectoral innovation clusters. These policy recommendations were
incorporated in the Project design.

17.      The Project design also benefitted from operational experiences from the Bank-financed
projects in Mexico (P044531), Venezuela (P066749), Chile (P055481), Brazil (P038947), India
(P009895), and Korea (I P004102, II P004117, and III P004134). Experiences in Venezuela and Chile
suggested the value of strengthening domestic graduate education to reduce ‘brain drain’. The Mexico
and Brazil projects proved the effectiveness of a combined approach involving both STI-supply-
related (building human capital) and demand-related (promoting innovation in the private sector)
instruments. The Indian and Korean experiences confirmed that the Bank involvement would have a
positive impact in facilitating the creation of innovative partnerships between firms and research
institutions and that both a sound STI policy framework and a strong implementing agency were
crucial for the success and sustainability of this type of activity. All these lessons were highly relevant
for the case of Uruguay and were incorporated in the Project design. Finally, Project preparation drew
on the experience of the two consecutive STI projects financed by the IDB in Uruguay to identify
policy areas yet to be developed.

18.     Coordination among multilateral agencies was ensured to avoid overlaps and deliver the
maximum value added from collaboration. Table 1 sums up the coordination of external support by
area of work, based on the specific technical experience and resource commitment of each
multilateral agency.

19.     Project objectives were important for Uruguay, reflecting the strong focus of the Government
on promoting scientific and technological progress. The Project's innovative, comprehensive scope
was justified by the lessons learned from operational experience and analytical studies, which pointed
at the need to simultaneously build the main pillars of an innovation system, namely strengthening
the STI institutional framework, building human capital, and promoting an innovation culture within
the productive sector. The choice of investing in admittedly complex instruments, such as public-
private partnerships for innovation under Component 3, was both robustly, theoretically founded and


                                                     5
innovative in the region. Overall, the Project design was commendable in terms of fostering
innovative policy instruments. The preparation process was highly participative.

20.     Given the complexity of innovation policy as an area of intervention, clarity in the design
could have been improved by better specifying the causal links between the Project's activities, key
indicators, and the PDO, as well as the definition of the PDO itself (especially the concepts of
generating, transferring, and adapting knowledge and technology). The assessment of risk did not
explicitly take into account the lack of associative culture between the private and the public sector
in Uruguay, which contributed to slow implementation of activities under Component 3. The
assessment in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) only takes into account "potentially less
demand than expected from the private sector for technology services" of centers and consortia (PAD,
pag. 21), but not for the difficulty in setting up the centers and the consortia themselves. Although
lessons learned from operational experiences all suggested that "there is a fairly long 'learning' period
for all participants in such projects [...] it may be typical to see slow starts (reflected in slow
disbursements) in the beginning" (India Industrial Technology Project ICR, Report 18105), no
specific action was designed to mitigate this risk, which indeed materialized and required
implementation adjustments.

2.2 Implementation

21.     Although Project implementation took 2.5 years longer than planned, it is still evaluated as
satisfactory, because the extension of the closing date resulted in the scale-up of activities. The
Project was restructured five times (Level II restructuring) to continuously adapt to changing
circumstances. The PDO was never changed, but the way of achieving it was adapted. The first
restructuring (2008) allowed the inclusion of default interest and the front-end fee amount in the Loan
Agreement. The second restructuring (2008) officially designated the newly created ANII as the
implementing agency. The third restructuring (2010) allowed for financing a new activity under
Component 1 (TIMBO portal) and revised the results matrix so as to reflect the shift of focus from
promoting Centers and Consortia to smaller instruments such as Innovation Alliances and Networks
under Component 3. The fourth restructuring (2012) responded to the higher-than-expected demand
for scholarships under Component 2, as well as an increasing demand for activities under Component
3, particularly Centers. The closing date, funds allocation, and results matrix were changed so as to
assist implementation given these new conditions. The fifth restructuring (2014) approved a further
extension of the closing date to further scale up activities under Components 2 and 3. Targets and
indicators were changed accordingly. All Project restructurings were effective in meeting the
proposed PDO and supported a smoother implementation.

22.      Component 1. The elaboration of the PENCTI4, directly supported by the Project's activities,
provided a strategic framework for innovation policy. It clearly identified the priority areas to
concentrate financing efforts to promote STI, therefore contributing to better define the ANII's
institutional mandate and areas of intervention. The risk of lack of collaboration between Government

    Approved by Ministerial Decree in 2010.


                                                   6
ministries, identified as substantial in the PAD (pag. 20), was partly mitigated by the Inter-Ministerial
Cabinet for Innovation (Gabinete Ministerial de la Innovación, GMI).5

23.     The ANII was officially designated as the Project implementing agency in the second Project
restructuring (2008). Consultancy activities, workshops, and studies financed through the PPF and
Component 1 were effective in mitigating the risk of delays (modest, according to the PAD) in the
agency becoming fully operational and ensuring smooth financial and procurement management. A
proper design and quick operationalization were, in turn, crucial for the satisfactory implementation
of the Project as a whole.

24.    Initially, the Project funds allocation included the financing of the ANII's personnel, mainly
external consultants, under the category of operating costs. Subsequently, the Government opted for
a more stable organization of human resources to reduce turnover and ensure continuity of operations,
and the ANII opened staff positions to be financed with national budget resources. This choice was
rewarded by a reduction in staff turnover from 13 percent in 2007 to 5 percent in 2014.

25.     In 2008, the ANII identified a strategic opportunity to strengthen Uruguay’s capacity to
generate, transfer, and adapt knowledge and technology. Through the TIMBO portal, Uruguay aimed
at being the first country in the world to offer access to the latest scientific publications to the whole
population in the country. The Bank team prepared a Project restructuring (2010) to reallocate the
funds initially designated to the ANII's personnel under operating costs, and create a new category
‘Access to Scientific Publications’ to finance the TIMBO portal.

26.     Activities under Subcomponent 1.3 allowed for implementing the creation of a strong M&E
unit to be incubated in the ANII (see annex 2 for more details). However, the lack of political
consensus around the question of what type of STI Observatory would be needed, impeded the setup
of an external, independent institution with M&E functions, envisaged in the PAD as a successive
step in implementation of Subcomponent 1.3.

27.     Component 2. The lines of activity under Subcomponent 2.1 were grouped under two types
of instruments to avoid overlaps and multiplicity of application procedures: High Social Impact
subprojects6 and Sectoral Funds.7,8 With respect to the original design, scholarships offered under
Subcomponent 2.2 were limited to (a) support to undergraduate students willing to work in high-
quality research environments (Becas de Iniciación a la Investigación); (b) scholarships for master’s
and doctoral students in domestic programs (Posgrados Nacionales).9


5
  The GMI represents the strategic political level of the national innovation system, being responsible for formulating
innovation policy guidelines at the country level.
6
  High Social Impact subprojects, already envisaged in the PAD, constitute an instrument to financially support
research aimed at improving living conditions.
7
  Sectoral Funds provided financing for multidisciplinary research groups willing to develop knowledge and innovation
in areas of research which were underdeveloped or of strategic importance to Uruguay. Key priority areas were
identified based on the PENCTI.
8
  The scope of this last activity was increased as a result of the extension of the closing date approved in the 2014
restructuring, allowing for financing an additional Sectoral Fund in Energy.
9
  Demand for scholarships was higher than expected, especially for the Iniciación type. To accommodate this, the scope
of the instrument was increased in the 2012 restructuring, which allowed for extension of the closing date and for the
reallocation of resources from PPF funds that were not used during preparation to finance additional scholarships. The


                                                          7
28.     Initially, the Project also included the award of partial stipends for the introduction of young
researchers in the productive sector. However, the one call that was opened for this type of
scholarship received only applications from firms that were evaluated as not qualified to offer proper
training for young researchers. The instrument was hence closed down with no beneficiaries. The
strategy to introduce researchers into the productive sector shifted to a combined use of Sectoral
Funds and High Social Impact subprojects on the one hand (directing researchers' work toward
strategic areas of interest for the productive sector) and Alliances, Networks, and Centers under
Component 3 (which actively promoted constructive contact between researchers and firms).10

29.     Component 3. This was the most challenging component, given that it focused on a specific
type of activity—public-private partnerships for STI—that was highly innovative in the country and
in the region and presented higher implementation risk. Because of the lack of collaborative culture
between the public and private sector in Uruguay, especially in the field of innovation, the demand-
driven approach did not work well. As a result, disbursement under this component began only in
2010 and was slow until 2012, originally the Project closing year.

30.      Several initiatives were taken to improve implementation of this component. The set of
activities was expanded to include Alliances, Networks, and Stimulating Demand Projects so as to
offer different and more flexible options of collaboration between public and private stakeholders.11
The ANII adopted a proactive approach to promote these instruments among research institutes,
universities, and firms, pursuing potential participants and providing advice and hands-on assistance
to candidates. In particular, a special unit was created for intensifying the relationship with the
productive sector, and the agency started collaborating with Chambers of Commerce and other local
actors. The Bank also supported specific knowledge exchange activities. Thanks to intense promotion
work among firms, the demand for Alliances and Networks grew rapidly.

31.    As of 2012, several changes allowed for more favorable conditions to invest in Centers. First
and most important, two years of implementation of Alliances and Networks provided successful
examples of public-private innovation partnerships among local actors. Second, a change in ANII’s
management coincided with a renewed interest for Centers to further boost innovation in the
productive sector. Third, although the Bank team had continuously supported this type of instruments
by sharing knowledge and experience, in 2012 a special effort was made by organizing a study tour
in Spain and Denmark, to allow the Government of Uruguay to directly learn from these pioneers in
the creation of Technology Centers. In 2013, Centers were officially launched in Uruguay and



scope of Posgrados scholarships was also increased, due to the extension of closing date approved in the 2014
restructuring.
10
   Activities under Subcomponents 2.2 and 2.3 also contributed to the creation and strengthening of graduate and
technical tertiary programs in key strategic STI areas identified by the PENCTI. Implementation of these activities was
in line with the PAD design and did not encounter any implementation issue.
11
   Alliances and Networks required less financial and organizational commitment than Centers and were more suitable
for less mature firms. As such, they could serve as successive steps to build confidence around the idea of public-
private partnerships for innovation and set the basis for the creation of Centers in the future. Alliances, in particular,
represented flexible research consortia; they were created to find a solution to a specific innovation demand, and
dissolved thereafter. Networks, instead, implied more long-term relationship. Neither case, however, required the
financial and organizational structure to sell innovation and technology services that was instead demanded in the case
of Centers.


                                                            8
extremely interesting examples have emerged since then.12 Overall, the rapid catch-up observed in
terms of implementation of all instruments under Component 3 suggests that the Project built the
base for more of these activities in the future.

32.     As a consequence of implementation decisions, actual disbursement per component differed
from estimates at appraisal. Total actual cost under Component 1 was US$9.3 million (+US$6.2
million with respect to PAD estimates), US$18.3 million under Component 2 (+US$1.6 million), and
US$4.5 million under Component 3 (−US$7 million). 13 Despite the number of financed public-
private partnerships under Component 3 that largely surpassed estimations at appraisal, the financial
scale of each one was lower than expected (partly due to the requirement for firms to provide a cash
contribution equal to at least 30 percent of the total investment in the partnerships), leading to a lower
amount of funds disbursed under Component 3. On the other hand, the TIMBO (Component 1) was
not envisaged at the time of appraisal. Note that the choice to provide universal access to scientific
publications and channel it through a unique public platform has led to a higher number of downloads
and a drop in unitary costs (see sections 3.2, 3.3 and annex 3 for more details), and it has been recently
recognized as international best practice by the Global Innovation Index (GII 2015). 14 Finally,
demand for scholarships under Component 2 was higher than expected. To put this into context, it is
worth recalling that the ANII is the only provider of scholarships for young researchers to gain
experience in research institutes, and by far the major public provider of Posgrado scholarships.15
Overall, the changes introduced during implementation are positively evaluated with regard to
supporting the Project efficacy and efficiency.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

33.     Design. The M&E system had some weaknesses. In particular, a clearer results chain
explaining the causality between activities financed under each component, key indicators, and the
PDO could have better guided Project implementation. The original design of the results matrix took
into account the international literature, but in some cases it was not appropriate in evaluating the
specific country context (for example, Uruguay's position in terms of patents). Some of the described
shortcomings could be explained by the fact that the M&E system in the ANII was built practically
from scratch together with the Project itself. Additionally, to date there are no clear international
standards on which indicators better capture progress in innovation. Finally, although both the PAD
and the Results Matrix recommended the completion of evaluation studies, no specific indication was
given on the type, scope, and possible techniques to apply.




12
   The two successive extensions of the closing date (first from 2012 to 2014 and eventually to 2015) allowed for full
implementation and disbursement under Component 3, including the creation of Centers and financing of an increased
number of Alliances and Networks.
13
   The increase in funding in Components 1 and 2 does not match the decrease in Component 3 because of resources
freed from unallocated funds and unused PPF. Note that not all of this shift in funds required changes to the
disbursement categories. See annex 1 for more details.

34.     Implementation. The ANII demonstrated strong capacity and built a reliable M&E unit with
qualified staff. The appropriate data was collected on a timely basis and made available to the Bank16.
Collection mechanisms were appropriate and attention was paid to ensuring quality. The ANII
conducted/contracted 28 studies (technical and sectoral reports, surveys, and qualitative and
quantitative evaluations), among which five impact evaluations (two on instruments supported by the
Project, (Iniciación a la Investigación and Posgrado scholarships). Data for an additional impact
evaluation on Sectoral Funds is being collected at the time of writing the ICR. The M&E
arrangements appear to be sustainable beyond the Project lifespan as they were extended to other
activities and are now part of the ANII regular work program.

35.     Utilization. The ANII was proactive in promoting the utilization of the compiled data on STI.
Specific reports were sent to the Government and other relevant institutions for STI policy. The
indicators were used for project management. STI studies and a bulletin of indicators are published
online every year and events are organized to raise knowledge among the public opinion. Importantly,
the ANII has an open data policy that includes free access to STI surveys microdata.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.    Environmental and social safeguards. The Project had an environmental category C. No
safeguard was triggered by the Project.

37.    Financial Management. The financial management (FM) performance of the Project has
been consistently satisfactory and FM requirements were fully complied with throughout the entire
implementation period. Moreover, project unqualified audited financial statements were received by
the Bank on time, despite some minor delays at project inception, mostly due to the fact that ANII
was a recently established entity at that time.

38.    Procurement. All procurement was done under the provisions stipulated in the Legal
Agreement and procedures in the operational manual. For subprojects carried out by the grantee's
research institutions, procurement followed sector commercial practices approved by the agency. The
operations manual was improved during Project execution and procedures for subprojects were
improved. No serious issues were found during ex post review missions and in general, the
performance of the agency was satisfactory.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

39.     Several factors suggest that there are the lega, financial and institutional capacity means of
sustaining the reforms and institutional capacity supported by the loan. These are discussed in details
in section 4.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation


16
  The only indicator suffering from delays was the number of graduates from domestic master’s and PhD programs, the
collection of which, was the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and was usually published 12 or more months
after closing of the school year.


                                                        10
40.    Relevance of objective. Pre-2010 restructuring rating: High; 2010–2012 rating: High; Post-
2012 restructuring rating: High.

41.    The objective was strategically aligned to the country’s strategy and the operation remained
important to the achieving country. The draft 2015–2019 national development strategy reaffirms the
importance of innovation to ensure sustainable growth in Uruguay, and the National System of
Competitiveness Law Bill states that "…it is crucial to progress in areas such as human capital,
innovation, and technology” (Presidency of Uruguay, March 2015)." The Project objective is also
aligned with Objective 6 in the draft 2015–2020 Country Partnership Framework, aimed at increasing
R&D opportunities to facilitate integration into global value chains.

42.    Relevance of design and implementation. Pre-2010 restructuring rating: Substantial; 2010–
2012 rating: Substantial; Post-2012 restructuring rating: Substantial.

43.     The Project design was both comprehensive and innovative, allowing for the simultaneous
development of the strategic pillars to build an innovation system. The planned activities were
consistent with Project objectives. The restructurings allowed the Project to adapt to changing
circumstances and introduce balanced modifications to designed activities so as to ensure that the set
of instruments remained both adequate and sufficient to reach the PDO.17

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

44.     To assess the Project’s achievement, this ICR considers the following dimensions of the PDO:
(a) to strengthen Uruguay's capacity to generate knowledge and technology and (b) to strengthen
Uruguay's capacity to transfer and adapt knowledge and technology.18 Clearly, the two concepts are
highly interrelated, and the same activities and indicators may be considered when evaluating
achievement of the two dimensions. The assessment relies on the Project’s key indicators,
intermediate indicators, supplementary indicators collected at the ICR stage, and results from
evaluations published by the ANII. Split ratings have been applied to reflect the extensive changes



17
   As an example, the 2010 restructuring acknowledged the low demand for Centers and allowed for other types of
instruments (Alliances and Networks) under Component 3 to achieve the project objectives. Given the changed
circumstances documented in Section 2.2 (Implementation), the 2012 restructuring proactively sought an opportunity to
expand the set of instruments to achieve the PDO by including Alliances, Networks, and Centers.
18
   The decision to evaluate together the concepts of transfer and adaptation of knowledge and technology relies on the
following considerations. First, a review of the sectoral literature (OECD 2005; European Community 2007; Sabater
2009; U.S. Department of Energy 2011) and of the international definitions (Oslo Manual 1997, OECD 2015,
UNCTAD, GII) revealed that although the two concepts are different (as specified in footnote 25), they are usually used
to refer to the same type of innovation activity but from different angles. There is no internationally established set of
transfer and adaptation indicators suitable to be supplied in a separate way. More details from this sectoral literature
review can be found in annex 10. Additionally, there are particular considerations related to the project itself. Although
the PAD did not specify the definitions of generation, transfer, and adaptation, it usually referred to the last two
together. For instance, the country diagnostics at page 6 highlights the "insufficient capacity to transfer and adapt
technology in private companies", while the Data Sheet and components description explain that instruments under
Component 3 are designed such that they "promote technology transfer and accelerate the adaptation of new
technologies and innovations by firms" (PAD 2007). The choice of considering transfer and adaptation as one unique
dimension of the PDO has been agreed at the Quality Enhancing Review meeting of this ICR by the attending
innovation specialists.

to key indicators introduced in the 2010 and 2012 restructurings, while changes introduced in 2014
were not considered to make a material difference to the achievement of PDO.19

   As specified in the Data Sheet (section H) and discussed in section 2.2 of this ICR, the 2014 restructuring introduced
only minor changes to the results matrix.

   This is intended as the country's capacity to create brand new knowledge and technology.
21
   Although progress against this objective was very successful already from the early stages of the project (as reflected
by the intermediate indicators), the progressive change in rating reflects, on one side, the useful implementation

to 2010 were largely surpassed. Similarly, three out of four key targets effective up to 2012 were
largely surpassed, and all four key targets effective up to 2015 were surpassed. To overcome the
discussed limitations of the key indicators in fully capturing achievement of the objective, table 3
presents information on additional indicators. Overall, these data confirm that the Project's activities
contributed to increase the level of inputs in terms of (a) institutional capacity building; (b) human
capital development; and (c) incentives to promote innovation among the private sector and translate
these inputs into generation of knowledge and technology.

47.    The establishment of the ANII and its strengthening were crucial to create better conditions
to generate knowledge and technology, through offering more financial and technical assistance and
opportunities for knowledge exchange. In particular, 69 percent of the supported researchers and 73
percent of the supported firms declared that they would have not realized their STI activities without
support from the ANII (Beneficiary Survey 2013). The increase in the capacity of the ANII to
financially support STI stakeholders can be seen in the evolution of the funds executed that, in the
period 2008–2014, registered an average annual growth of 44 percent a year, to reach US$37 million
in 2014.

48.     The evaluations of the Iniciación and Posgrado scholarships offer some insights on the results
promoted by these activities. Among the undergraduate students who received an Iniciación
scholarship in 2008, 73 percent had completed the bachelor’s program as of 2011 (versus 60 percent
of the nonbeneficiaries), 62 percent obtained a research-related employment, and 34 percent of those
who were employed before the scholarships declared that their wage increased as a result of the
scholarship-financed outcome. Apart from completing graduate education, students receiving a
Posgrado scholarship had additional benefits as the production of scientific publications (in 85
percent of the cases) and the possibility to present their own research in conferences and workshops
(75 percent of beneficiaries). Nearly 74 percent of the beneficiaries enrolled in the next educational
level (PhD or Post Doctoral) after completion of graduate studies. Out of the beneficiaries who had
a job as of 2014, 95 percent declared employment in research activities. In 74 percent of the cases,
the field of research in which they were currently working was closely related to the research topic
developed under the scholarship.

49.    The impact evaluations confirm that beneficiaries of the Iniciación and Postgrado scholarship
obtained, on average, a higher number of annual publications per year as compared to with respect
to nonbeneficiaries and a higher number of publications in refereed journals. Similarly, beneficiaries
were more likely to continue their career in the research sector with respect to the control group.22 23
The econometric techniques applied allowed the conclusion that these effects are attributable to the
scholarships.24

   Both evaluation used panel data and applied a difference-in-difference methodology. The counterfactual was built
through Propensity Score Matching among the group of applicants who have not received the scholarship, that ex ante
present very similar characteristics to the group of beneficiaries. The external and internal validity of the results are
subject to the standard limitations proper of quasi-experiments.


                                                                  14
50.     It is important to highlight that in addition to the activities directly supporting human capital
accumulation under Component 2, the support for public-private partnerships for STI (21 Alliances,
3 Stimulating Demand Projects, 3 Networks, and 5 Centers) offered concrete opportunities and
demand to generate knowledge and technology specifically tailored to the private sector. Public-
private partnerships promoted knowledge and technology generation in strategic sectors such as
biopharmaceuticals, ICTs, and agro-business. Examples include research to improve quality of
primary sector exports (Networks and Alliances); development of new techniques to process
pharmaceuticals (Networks and Alliances); design of new user-friendly platforms to develop ICT
prototypes (Centers); and development of cryptography systems to improve safety in online banking
(Centers).

52.     The objective was achieved. Efficacy in achieving this dimension of the PDO has increased
from modest to high during the project implementation period, especially thanks to the strategic
implementation changes introduced in the 2010 restructuring (TIMBO, Alliances, and Networks) and
in the 2012 restructuring (Centers), and the relative changes in the Results Framework. Two out of
five key targets effective up to 2010 were surpassed,26 two out of three key targets effective up to
2012 were surpassed; and three out of three key targets effective up to 2015 were surpassed. Overall,
results indicate that the Project contributed to create the necessary environment to increase transfer
and adaptation of knowledge and technology by the private sector.

   This is intended as the country's capacity to transfer existing knowledge and technology (potentially developed in
other countries) and to adapt it to a different context in the productive sector. The concept of adaptation of knowledge
and technology is sometimes used to indicate adaptation of STI developed abroad to the domestic context despite the
concept being broader than this, capturing in general adaptation from one sector to another. In this ICR, we consider the
broader definition of adaptation but present specific examples of adaptation of STI developed abroad to the domestic
context, to further reinforce the argument supporting project efficacy.

53.     The information that innovation experts from the World Economic Forum compile each year
(GII) allows to appreciate Uruguay's performance in terms of transfer and adaptation of knowledge
and technology by firms in the whole period 2007–2015. In particular, table 4 presents results in some
key areas directly supported by Project activities. 27 Not only did Uruguay score better than the
regional average in all these dimensions as of 2015, but the improvement registered in the period
2007–2015 was larger than the one observed for the region overall.

54.      The creation and strengthening of the ANII was at the base of the promotion of transfer and
adaptation of knowledge and technology among firms. The role of the ANII in this sense increased
considerably between 2007 and 2012.28 During 2007–2009, the Ministry of Industry was the leading
institution in terms of innovation grants to the private sector. By 2010–2012, this role had been taken
by the ANII in an effort to concentrate in this institution both technical and financial support to firms
investing in STI. The share of firms obtaining an innovation grant from the ANII (over the total
number of firms obtaining an innovation grant from the public sector) increased from 20 percent in
27
   The substantial increase of the rates covered in the 2015 version of the GII has likely been capturing the spillovers of
this particular project. The sectoralpublic-private partnership for innovation under Component 3 directly target the
increase in the university-industry collaboration in R&D, cluseter development, increase in companies' spending in
R&D (see also Annex 3). Besides, the limited scale of the Uruguay innovation system makes the Bank intervention
quite relevant.

has signed cooperation agreement with 34 countries in Latin America, North America, Europe, and
Asia since 2008.

55.     The 1,138 Iniciación scholarships and the 142 research subprojects financed under
Component 2 played an important role in directing young researchers toward areas of study that were
particularly relevant for the productive sector, thus favoring the creation of knowledge that could
easily be adapted to the specific needs of firms. The evaluation of proposals for Sectoral Funds, in
particular, was subject to assessment by the Comité de Agencia, a committee integrated by the
representatives of the private sector to allow for alignment between research and productive strategy.
Posgrado scholarships also played a role: 63 percent of beneficiaries declared that research developed
under the scholarship was intended to solve specific problems in the productive sector.30 Forty-four
of the researchers supported by the Project were then introduced in the private sector. It is worth
mentioning the TIMBO portal as another activity that favored the transfer of knowledge by ensuring
universal access to international scientific publications. The number of publications downloaded each
year increased from 146,961 in 2009 to 316,078 in 2014 (+215 percent).

56.     The Project supported university-industry collaboration in R&D by 31 public-private
partnerships for STI, involving 216 firms and all the principal public research institutes of the country
(UdelaR; the National Institute of Research in Agriculture and Livestock [Instituto Nacional de
Investigación Agropecuaria, INIA]; the Technological Laboratory of Uruguay [Laboratorio
Tecnológico del Uruguay, LATU]; ORT University; Universidad de Montevideo; and Instituto
Pasteur). Flexible instruments such as Alliances and Networks (starting in 2010) attracted smaller
enterprises to be the recipients of transfer and adaptation of knowledge and technology transfers.
Thirty-eight percent of firms participating in these instruments are SMEs.

57.     Public-private partnerships for innovation also favored the adaptation of knowledge and
technology generated abroad to the Uruguayan context. As an example, the Alliance working at the
development of non-wheat bread (recycling grains not suitable for export) included the Argentinean
National Industrial Institute of Technology, which already had the experience to process this type of
flour. Another example is the Alliance patenting preclinical evaluation methods for probiotic strains
built on the adaptation and harmonization of biotechnological capacities in France, Spain, and
Uruguay. Another interesting example is offered by the Center for ICTs. The Center's work has been
crucial to transfer and adapt international knowledge in the field of smart grid management and
automatic detection of frauds in e-banking. Interestingly, the Center itself is an example of adapting
knowledge and technology, as its design was built by adapting a special flexible organizational model
already implemented in France for similar type of technology centers.

3.3 Efficiency

Project. The Economic Analysis in this ICR (annex 3) presents the estimations of the IRR and the

   The total number of firms receiving public innovation grants increased from 5 percent in 2007–2009 to 8 percent in
2010–2012, which makes the results obtained by the ANII even more meaningful.

benefit-to-cost ratio for the Posgrado scholarships and Alliances; and relevant descriptive
information on the TIMBO portal, Iniciación scholarships, Networks and Centers.

59.     The creation and management of the TIMBO portal allowed an increase in the number of
scientific publication downloads in the country (+215 percent between 2009 and 2014), halving the
unitary cost of download in five years, from US$9.78 (2009) to US$4.82 (2014) and thereby
increasing efficiency of investment in access to scientific publications.31

60.     The estimation of the IRR for Posgrado scholarships considers three scenarios, to test the
sensibility of the results to different assumptions on the impact of the program (annex 3). Even in the
most conservative scenario, the IRR is estimated to be as high as 21 percent. Considering more
optimist assumptions in line with the recent findings from Chile (Solis 2013), IRR would be 40
percent.

61.     Firms participating in Alliances were able to increase their revenues (in US$) by 148 percent
between 2010 (first year of financing) and 2013 (last year for which data are available). Employment
also grew as the number of jobs generated by these firms increased from 1,632 in 2010 to 40,154 in
2013. Comparison with nonbeneficiary firms suggests that at least 77 percent of this employment
was generated directly by activities related to the Alliances. The IRR for this activity is estimated to
be 38 percent (annex 3).

62.     Recent work by Aboal and Garda (2015) for Uruguay suggest that participating in a public-
private partnership for innovation is estimated to increase firms' investment in innovation by 52
percent compared to firms that do not participate in such collaboration. Technological innovation
output is 77 percent higher among participating firms and nontechnological innovation is 400 percent
higher. Crespi and Zuniga (2012) estimate that, for the case of Uruguay, R&D cooperation between
firms could increase intensity of investment in innovation per employee by 0.53 percentage points.

63.     The Project efficiency is rated as Substantial. The IRR estimations for those activities for
which it was feasible to estimate returns are compelling. The additional descriptive information
collected and the references from the literature review (annex 3) all support the efficiency of the
remaining Project activities. None of the information collected in this ICR seems to indicate any
potential wasteful investment nor less-effective investment than what was expected at appraisal. On
the contrary, the scale of outputs, compared to initial estimation in the PAD, suggests that the Project
may have been more effective than what was expected at appraisal.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

65.    At the macro level, a society with more human capital, higher productivity, and falling cost
of technology enjoys higher rates of long-term economic growth. Human capital accumulation and
economic growth are likely to lead to lower unemployment, higher household income, and lesser
poverty.

66.      Importantly, although the Project activities did not directly target the poor population, some
of the financed subprojects were particularly important for the more vulnerable citizens. In particular,
the high social impact subprojects financed research aimed at tackling drug addiction, boosting
economic development in smaller towns, and improving women’s health during pregnancy.
Additionally, innovative outcomes generated by some Alliances have important medical applications
(early detection of viral diseases and easier production of pharmaceuticals), which could be
particularly beneficial for the poor.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

67.     The institutional change supported has no going back, and it is clearly one of the big
achievements of this Project. The new institutional framework allowed for better coordination among
ministries (GMI), the development of a national innovation strategy identifying priority areas of
action (PENCTI), and the creation of an implementing agency (the ANII) able to execute STI


                                                            19
programs in a rapid and efficient manner. The ANII, in particular, reduced fragmentation in public
support for STI by streamlining procedures and consolidating competitive funding for innovation
from several sectors. The organization of activities of the ANII mirrored the multipillar project
design; the decision to intervene both on the supply and the demand side of STI activities proved
successful and allowed the ANII to proactively create links between private and public stakeholders
and to be better positioned to exploit synergies and avoid overlaps among STI programs. Moreover,
the ANII incorporated lessons from project operations into daily activities, starting from procurement
arrangements to M&E, leading to enhanced transparency in the management of funds for STI.
Overall, the institutional changes supported are evaluated as both sustainable and effective in filling
the sectoral gaps highlighted in section 1.1. Activities under Component 1 directly supported the
creation and strengthening of the ANII as well as the draft of the PENCTI, setting the basis for an
integrated innovation policy.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)

68.     Project activities and, in particular, the instruments financed under Component 3, induced a
long-awaited change of innovation culture among the private sector. Equally important, the
sponsored public-private partnerships had a significant role in eliminating barriers and increasing
trust between the academia and researchers on the one hand and firms on the other hand. This
outcome has been confirmed both by indicators presented in section 3.2 and interviews conducted
during the ICR mission.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

70.      Overall, the risk that the strengthened capacity to generate, transfer, and adapt knowledge and
technology might not be maintained is Low. The ANII has established itself as the reference
institution for implementing STI programs in the country, and it has proven to be able to efficiently
deal with program implementation, including adaptation to changing circumstances, hands-on
assistance, procurement, and M&E. The National System of Competitiveness Law Bill is proposing
to further reinforce the ANII management team by switching from seven voluntary directors
dedicating 20 percent of their time to the agency, to three full-time, paid directors (Presidency of
Uruguay, March 2015). The strengthening of the role of the ANII and financial support for its
programs is confirmed by the 2015–2019 Budget Law Bill,32 which would imply an "increase in the
resources devoted to research and innovation. In particular, the Government will increase the
investment in STI to be executed by the ANII by Ur$200 million in 2016 and Ur$300 million starting
from 2017".33 ANII subprograms developed under the Project will continued to be open and financed
by both national and external resources. The Government has negotiated external financial support
with the IDB to ensure the flow of resources needed to sustain the financing most of the Project's
activities. The IDB's ‘Innovation Program for Productive Development, 2015–2020 will finance

scholarships, Sectoral Funds, Alliances, Networks and Centers. Overall, Uruguay is evaluated to have
the necessary institutional capacity and financial and legislative commitment to sustain the
development outcome.

71.     Two important steps will be important in the near future to move the development outcome
further. First, the strategic legal framework for innovation policy, the PENCTI, was approved in 2010
and needs to be updated to keep up with national and international trends. Second, a more proactive
role by the GMI or relevant political actor will be needed to further strengthen coordination between
executive lines and frequently update the strategy of intervention. Importantly, both steps are likely
to happen. There is a cross-sectoral consensus among STI stakeholders in Uruguay about the
importance of these two actions that have also been recognized in the National System of
Competitiveness Law Bill.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72.    The lending instrument was appropriate and the Project's design innovative and
comprehensive. Project preparation was informed by examples of good practices and lessons learned
from projects in Latin America and other regions, as well as analytical background studies. However,
there were one moderate shortcoming. The Bank team underestimated the time needed to develop
instruments such as public-private partnerships for innovation, a risk clearly highlighted among the
lessons learned from past operational experience in other countries (more details in section 2.1). The
PAD did not envisage measures to mitigate this risk, as for instance proactive promotion initiatives
among firms and collaboration with local agencies having a strong field presence (Camaras
Empresariales, Consejos Sectoriales del Ministerio de Industria). There were, additionally, minor
shortcomings related to the Results Framework (more details in section 3.2).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     At least two supervision missions were carried out every year. There was a strong focus on
the PDO and outcome indicators as well as fiduciary policies. Regular field visits to subprojects were
organized and aide memoires were candid on the agreements between the Bank team and the
borrower. Especially important for successful STI projects, the Bank team was proactive in
restructuring the Project and adapting activities so as to ensure achievement of the PDO. A midterm
review was carried out in 2010, and lessons learned were incorporated. Knowledge exchange events
were organized to drive critical activities. In 2012, the Bank team organized a study tour in Spain and
Denmark, which was strategic in eliminating the remaining concerns about the creation of Centers.
Staff from the Competitiveness Global Practice participated in supervision, technical assistance, and
knowledge-exchange activities. The team was also formed by external consultants specialized in
trade and competitiveness.

74.   There was, however, one moderate shortcomings in the quality of supervision. The many
knowledge exchange activities, highly valued by the borrower, could have been organized at an


                                                  21
earlier stage of Project implementation. There were also minor shortcomings. Information on
progress against indicators contained in Implementation Status and Results Reports and aide
memoires were not always consistent. The 2010 Restructuring Paper, as well as the aide memoires
of that period, provide little information on the rationale behind some of the changes introduced. The
PDO could have been simplified/streamlined.

75.    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.    Taking into account the ratings of Moderately Satisfactory on both ensuring quality at entry
and supervision, the overall Bank performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

77.     The Government provided its full support for the Project as shown by the consecutive
development strategies that gave high priority to STI. Budget commitment was adequate and stable.
Importantly, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) directly pushed for the Project to keep its
focus on the links with the country's productive strategy and the private sector, notwithstanding the
early difficulties in disbursement of Component 3. The creation of the GMI provided a first attempt
to create a direct link between the Government executive branch and the implementing agency.
Nevertheless, there was probably room for better coordination among ministries that would have
ensured a more decisive action of the cabinet in setting strategic STI guidelines more frequently and
promptly.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

78.     The ANII exhibited strong ownership of the Project and commitment to the achievement of
its objectives. The agency was staffed with qualified professionals who demonstrated their experience
in dealing with complex issues. Activities under Component 3 had a slow start, but when it was clear
that public and private stakeholders needed to be proactively sought and supported, the ANII took
appropriate action. M&E and fiduciary arrangements were satisfactory. Overall, Project management
was Satisfactory, notwithstanding the difficulty in managing multiple subprojects, components, and
collaboration with national stakeholders as well as different international development agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

79.     Based on the ratings on Government and implementing agency performance, the rating is
Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned




                                                 22
80.     Strong government support is crucial for quick and smooth implementation, but
increased political coordination among executive branches may be necessary to move forward.
Strong government support for STI, both in terms of design of the national development strategy and
reliable budget allocation, allowed for rapid creation and strengthening of the innovation system and
the ANII as the implementing agency of STI programs, practically from scratch. Coordination among
ministries could be improved in the future by designing better incentives for a more proactive role of
the ministries in defining and updating the STI strategy (see section 4). Importantly, it could be worth
discussing to have one political institution that takes responsibility to coordinate at the strategic and
political level in the area of STI (for instance, the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive
Innovation, as in the case of Argentina) or simply a more direct link between the GMI and the
presidency.

81.     The creation of a single agency responsible for the implementation of STI programs
improves coordination, efficacy, and efficiency of the STI policy. The ANII represents a
successful example in this sense. The quite ‘light’ and flexible organizational structure of the ANII,
the choice to rely on a relatively small but highly qualified pool of human resources, and the constant
learning process from international cooperation, allowed for a quick start of operations,
implementation of programs in line with international standards, and the achievement of significant
results in terms of STI in a relatively short period. A new design of the ANII's Board (see section 4)
would further smooth the decision-making process.

82.     It is a good practice for STI projects to address and integrate different pillars of the STI
system, by including actions that affect both demand and supply of knowledge and innovation.
In the case of this Project, the activities simultaneously promoted institutional strengthening, human
capital accumulation, and innovation in the productive sector. This complex Project design was
successful in building the main pillars of an innovation system in the country. The integration of
different mechanisms to promote STI since the early foundation of the system allows for positive
spillovers between activities, increased knowledge exchange opportunities, reduced operative costs,
setup of a smooth system for continuous learning, and early detection of opportunities. The design of
STI policy as an organic system sets the basis for a natural upgrade of the STI policy as a key factor
in the National Competitiveness System.

83.     The Project design should envisage early proactive action by the implementing agency
to develop a partnership culture and demand, especially among the private sector. This could
be achieved by stronger coordination with other government local agencies/programs that have a
strong field presence and frequent contacts with the private sector (in the case of Uruguay, Camaras
Empresariales, Consejos Sectoriales del Ministerio de Industria, Oficina de Planeamiento y
Presupuesto).

84.    In designing a results matrix for STI projects, teams should consider the long term
usually associated with the development of innovation outcomes, as well as the country-specific
context that is likely to have a direct impact on STI through different channels—the education
system, the level of international integration, and the industrial strategy. It is particularly
challenging to design an accurate results matrix for STI projects. There is no clear international
standard, which would be the most appropriate indicator for STI outcomes (rather than inputs).
Furthermore, it is difficult to combine international guidelines with country specificities, given the
many factors that directly play a role in determining STI outcomes. Finally, outcome indicators (for


                                                   23
instance, development of innovative products and services, increase in productivity, and trade in
R&D services) may be difficult to materialize in the relative short life of a project (usually five years),
especially if the innovative system has to be built from scratch, which was to some extent the case in
this Project. The discussion on STI indicators is ongoing and recently published work (OECD;34
National Academies 2014;35 EU 201236) can be of help in designing a results matrix for future STI
operations, both to incentivize implementation of activities on time and evaluate achievement against
objectives.

85.     It may be especially important for the task team and the implementing agency to rapidly
incorporate early lessons and changed circumstances. Although this is true for all kinds of
operations, it may be even more relevant for the STI sector, which is at the same time relatively new
and rapidly evolving in developing countries. In the case of this Project, the relatively flexible design
of the activities and disbursement categories on the one hand and a very proactive approach by the
implementing agency and the task team on the other hand, allowed to provide prompt and adaptive
responses to ensure achievement of the PDO.

86.    All these lessons learned have general applicability for similar operations in the same
subsector.

Component 1. Support STI Policies and Institutional Strengthening

1.      The PDO indicator selected to monitor the achievement of this component was defined as 80
percent of beneficiaries were satisfied as measured through perception surveys. This indicator was
surpassed: satisfaction level was 92 percent among individual beneficiaries and 95.5 percent among
entities benefitting from the ANII's programs. Among other things, the survey inquired on the
suitability of the financing instrument used to achieve the individual's/firm's STI objective (reflecting
to some extent suitability of STI policies and programs) and the satisfaction with the support received
by the ANII at various stages of subprojects implementation (capturing institutional strengthening).

 Component 1 - Summary of Outputs                                                                    Indicator*

2.      This component was strategic to ensure the success of the Project as it directly supported the
significant institutional strengthening that was the necessary condition for a coherent and effective
implementation of innovation policies. In 2001, there had been an attempt to institutionalize
innovation policy with the establishment of the DINACYT as a department within the MEC. The
DINACYT assumed responsibilities for coordinating, implementing, and evaluating programs related
to innovation. In addition, the National Advisory Council on Innovation, Science, and Technology
(CONICYT) was created in 2001 to act as an advisory committee to the Government suggesting
policy guidelines. This institutional framework had not proven effective. The MEC had been
moderately successful in supporting basic science but little progress had been made about stimulating
public-private research linkages and innovation. The DINACYT’s funding had been volatile, and the
implementation of innovation programs remained dispersed among other agencies.

3.      This component financed four main sets of activities. Activities under Subcomponent 1.1
(Support the development of public STI policies) included national consultancies and workshops to
draft strategic documents and promote critical discussion among key stakeholders on STI policy
issues. Although these activities were carried out throughout the entire Project implementation
period, they were particularly frequent in the initial stage, consistent with the need to set up the policy
framework and organizational structure required for implementation of the Project itself.


                                                          26
Consultancies and workshops focused on four main topics: (a) identification and design of
instruments to improve synergies and collaboration between public and private stakeholders; (b)
periodic inventory of the national research capacity (research groups, update of the registry of
researchers, innovation capacity in the private sector, and so on) and the submission of proposals to
improve such capacity; (c) mapping of interaction opportunities with Uruguayan researchers and
entrepreneurs based in other countries, to carry out specific activities financed and promoted by the
ANII; and (d) development of training activities to improve the management of public and private
research and technology institutions, as well as the design of public STI policy.

4.       All these activities came together to form the basis for the elaboration of the PENCTI,
approved by ministerial decree in 2010. The set of objectives presented in the plan was highly
influenced by the Project's design, as it aimed at simultaneously building critical STI pillars such as
(a) strengthening the STI system and its link with the productive strategy; (b) improving private sector
competitiveness; (c) improving opportunities for inclusive access to knowledge and stimulating
research on social problems; (d) strengthening human capital; and (e) building a strong M&E system
on STI indicators and policies.

5.      Importantly, the PENCTI identifies the key areas to be targeted by investment in innovation.
It allows for improved efficacy and efficiency of STI investment, as well as its alignment with the
country's productive strategy. The PENCTI identifies (a) ICT; (b) biotechnology; (c) specific sectors
with high potential (as nanotechnology) as technological areas to be prioritized; (d) software; (e)
human and animal health; (f) agriculture and livestock production; (g) environment; (h) energy; (i)
education; (j) transport and logistics; and (k) tourism, as key sectors presenting special innovation
challenges and opportunities.

6.       Activities financed under Subcomponent 1.2 (Support the ANII) included training offered to
the ANII staff (including courses on management of technology and innovation and the elaboration
of business intelligence to ensure efficient and transparent implementation of innovation and research
programs); studies; purchase of office equipment; travel costs linked to Project implementation; and
dissemination activities. Activities (especially training, studies, and purchase of equipment) were
organized around three main objectives: (a) to develop internal and external evaluation systems to
assess the use of resources and the results achieved by the ANII; (b) to build a strong human resources
system that is able to attract qualified professionals, ensure transparent hiring procedures, and
evaluate the ANII officials’ performance; (c) to develop an IT system and an institutional website to
facilitate management of activities and external communications, respectively.

7.      These activities, combined with technical assistance throughout the Project's duration,
contributed to the creation and strengthening of the ANII. The agency executed US$162 million
between 2008 and 2014 and has gone through 40 external financial audits, all approved with no
material observation. It currently has 54 permanent staff, 7 interns and 7 consultants. Nearly two-
thirds of the staff have completed tertiary education and the remaining one-third is currently enrolled
in graduate programs.

8.     Each ANII official processes, on average, 80 STI projects per year. The average time to
process grant proposals between the closing of the call for proposals and final selection (Intermediate
Indicator 1, 76% achieved) reduced from 5.7 months in 2011 to 4.4 months in 2015 but would be
reduced to 3.5 months if one excludes Sectoral Funds. This is because the selection of Sectoral Funds


                                                  27
involved an external committee composed of research institutes and firms (Comité de Agencia).
Although the Comité represented a further step in the selection process, it brought a high added value
in terms of aligning research with the productive strategy. Furthermore, a general positive trend may
be observed among those funds awarded more than once. The evaluation time fell by 110 days for
the Agro Fund (from 353 days in 2010 to 243 days in 2014); by 53 days for the Fishery and
Aquiculture Fund (from 219 days in 2013 to 166 in 2014); and by 216 days for the Energy Fund
(from 343 days in 2010 to 127 days in 2014). A slight increase is observed only for the Digital TV
Fund (from 75 days in 2012 to 92 days in 2014).

9.     The 2010 restructuring increased the scope and spending of Component 1 to include the
financing of the TIMBO portal. The TIMBO portal was developed by the ANII with the objective of
ensuring universal and free-of-charge access to international scientific and technological
bibliography and patent databases.

10.     The Uruguayan TIMBO has been recently recognized as best practice by the GII (2015) (more
information          available       in         this      info        graphic        available       at
<http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/pressroom/en/documents/gii_2015_infographic2.pdf>).
The TIMBO portal allowed for ‘democratization’ of scientific knowledge, reduced the need for
universities and research institutes to act as intermediaries (therefore decreasing the burden on their
budget), expanded the scope of the target audience, and ultimately increased the number of
publication downloads and decreased unitary costs. In 2014, 316,078 articles were downloaded from
TIMBO (Intermediate Indicator 4). More information on the TIMBO portal is available in this video
available at <http://www.timbo.org.uy/tutoriales/10> (in Spanish).

11.     Activities financed under Subcomponent 1.3 (Set up and support the STI Observatory)
included training of staff in the ANII M&E unit, studies, dissemination events, development of
management information systems, purchase of office equipment, and travel costs of the M&E unit
officials. In particular, training activities had a clear international footprint that allowed the ANII to
develop a strong M&E system in a relatively short period, as a result of lessons learned from
international experience, and be part of international networks on this topic (especially the RICYT)
favoring continuous quality improvement and sustainability of M&E activities.

12.     The M&E unit of the ANII has performed or contracted 28 studies since its creation (technical
and sectoral reports, surveys, and qualitative and quantitative evaluations) (Intermediate Indicator 2,
140 percent achieved), among which 5 are impact evaluations. Data for an additional impact
evaluation on Sectoral Funds is being collected at the time of writing this document. The M&E unit
annually tracks 35 STI monitoring indicators (Intermediate Indicator 3, 100 percent achieved),
including STI input indicators related to human resources and financing, output indicators of
scientific production, indicators of innovation in the private sector, and indicators on STI culture.

Component 2: Build Human Capital and High-quality Research Teams

13.    The PDO indicators selected to monitor the achievement of this component were defined as
1,000 internationally published scientific articles; 600 graduates from domestic master’s and PhD
programs; and 30 project-supported researchers introduced into industry. All the indicators were
surpassed. In 2014 alone, 1,263 scientific articles were published internationally (6,835




                                                   28

Note: * KI = Key Indicator; II= Intermediate Indicator; ICR = data collected during ICR stage

14.     Subcomponent 2.1 (Promote excellence in science and technology research in priority
areas). Under this subcomponent, Sectoral Funds provided direct financing to R&D subprojects in
priority areas of interest. Strategic areas were identified using the PENCTI: software, IT services and
audiovisual production; human and animal health; agriculture and livestock production; environment;
energy; education and social development; logistics and transport; and tourism. A special financing
line was provided to subprojects likely to have a high social impact. In both cases, eligible
beneficiaries were research groups of excellence working in public or nonprofit institutions.
Preference was given to multidisciplinary and inter-institutional teams. Some call rounds favored
participation of young researchers in the teams. Financing to approved subprojects included research
inputs and material, salaries for researchers associated with the subprojects, research experience in a
foreign institution, and expenses associated with dissemination of results.

15.     The Project provided direct support to 142 specific research activities in strategic areas
(Intermediate Indicator 5, 1001 percent surpassed). Sectoral Funds financed 124 research subprojects
in agro-industry, fishery and aquaculture, digital television, energy, education, and human and animal
health. The line of High Social Impact Projects financed 18 additional research subprojects on topics
such as road safety, healthy pregnancy, drug addiction, and economic development in small towns.

16.      Subcomponent 2.2 (Increase the stock of advanced human capital). Under this
subcomponent, the Project supported the creation and strengthening of domestic graduate programs,
as well as scholarships for undergraduate students willing to get professional experience in a research
institution, and scholarships for master’s and PhD students for the completion of their graduate
studies.

17.     Support to national graduate programs included financing of activities such as the preparation
of the curricular design, training of teachers and researchers, international mobility of teachers and
researchers, purchase of equipment, and salaries of administrative staff. Applicants could solicit
financial support up to U$S40,000 per year, in the case of strengthening existing graduate programs,


                                                         29
or U$S150,000 per year, in the case of creation of new programs. Financing could be renewed for
one year, implying an overall maximum period of 24 months. Benefitting institutions were required
to cofinance the creation or strengthening of the programs in an amount that had to be at least equal
to the financing provided by the ANII.

18.     Five brand new graduate programs were created (Intermediate Indicator 8, 83 percent
achieved), including master’s in strategic areas such as Management of Technology Firms (ORT
University), Engineering (ORT University), Family and Community Medicine (Montevideo
University), and Alimentary Technology (UdelaR). Fourteen graduate programs were strengthened
with Project support (Intermediate Indicator 9, 67 percent achieved). Examples include the
strengthening of master’s in Chemical Engineering, Environmental Science, Bioinformatics,
Mathematical Engineering, and Integrated Cost Management of the Southern Cone, Clinical
Pharmacology; and of PhD programs such as Electrical Engineering, Sciences of Agriculture and
Cattle, and Biological Chemistry.

19.     Another key activity supported by this subcomponent was the award of scholarships to
undergraduate students willing to get a first professional experience in a research institution (Becas
de Iniciación a la Investigación) and scholarships to master’s and PhD students for the completion
of their graduate studies (Becas de Posgrado). Scholarships were awarded for a maximum period of
12 months in the case of Iniciación a la Investigación and for master’s students and 36 months for
PhD students. Financing included tuition fees and a monthly income support (up to a maximum
amount equal to US$350 per month in the case of Iniciación a la Investigación scholarships, US$700
per month for master’s students, and US$900 per month for PhD students).

20.      Overall, the Project financed 971 scholarships to master's and PhD students and 1,138
scholarships for young researchers (undergraduate level) willing to gain experience in a research
institution (Intermediate Indicator 10, 114 percent achieved). Seventy-eight percent of these students
completed the academic program in the allotted time frame (Intermediate Indicator 11, 97 percent
achieved).

21.    Several Project activities—among which, direct financial support for research (Sectoral Funds
and High Social Impact), the strengthening of domestic supply of graduate programs, and easier
access to scientific publications (TIMBO)—contributed to improve the performance of supported
domestic researchers in terms of international scientific publications. With respect to 2010,
researchers benefitting from Project activities increased by 33 percent the number of annual SCI
publication per researcher (Intermediate Indicator 6, 121 percent achieved), and by 25 percent the
number of annual international coauthored articles per researcher (Intermediate Indicator 7, 103
percent achieved).

22.     Subcomponent 2.3 (Strengthen priority technical tertiary education programs). This
component financed the creation or strengthening of technical tertiary programs. Applications were
admitted from institutions in both the public and private sector, including nonprofits. Preference was
given to applications aiming at developing the supply of technical tertiary programs in strategic areas
as identified by the PENCTI. Solicitants could request a maximum amount of US$200,000, and a
varying cofinancing was required to the beneficiary institution, depending on the call edition.
Financing was directed toward design of the curricular program, training and mobility of teachers



                                                  30
and technicians, purchase of equipment, human resources in charge of the administration of the
program, scholarships for interns supporting the program, and small infrastructure interventions.

23.     Overall, the Project financed the creation and strengthening of 13 technical-tertiary STI
programs, among which are Design of Sustainable Tourism, Navigation and Fishery, Intensive
Vegetable Production, Agro-Energy, Alternative Energy and Energy Efficiency, Industrial and
Mechanical Maintenance, Computer Science; and Biotechnology. Stakeholders' opinion on the
ANII'S support for the Biotechnology program is available in this video at
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4g_TzOqiDQ>. A total of 200 students benefitted from the
creation and strengthening of such technical tertiary programs (Intermediate Indicator 12, 100 percent
achieved).

Component 3: Promote Innovation and Technology Transfer to the Productive Sector

24.     The PDO indicator selected to monitor the achievement of this component was defined as
‘seven technological innovations/ process improvements transferred to the productive sector through
Centers, Networks, Stimulating Technological Demand projects, and Alliances’. The indicators were
surpassed. Examples of innovations/process improvements transferred to firms include system of
molecular diagnosis of viral epidemics such as dengue and H1N1; a new technology for the
preparation of veterinary vaccines; development and market analysis of a ‘composed flour’ that
recycles non-wheat grains not suitable for export (such as soy and oak); quality control of national
production of milk; and a new technology for the quality control of biopharmaceuticals.

25.     Activities under Component 3 supported the creation of different types of public-private
partnership for STIs. In order of increasing financial and organizational commitment, these were
identified as Alliances, Stimulating Technological Demand projects, Networks, and Centers.

26.     Alliances represented flexible research consortia. They were created to find a solution to a
specific innovation demand, and dissolved thereafter (Subcomponent 3.2: Support public-private
research consortia). Grants to Alliances permitted the financing of the purchase of goods by the
beneficiary institutions (general equipment, specific laboratory equipment, interventions to improve
health and safety in the workplace, software, and input material); infrastructure (building alterations
to allow installation of equipment); training (within the country or abroad); consultancy services (to
solve administrative and technical issues); costs associated with intellectual property rights; and


                                                          31
operating costs. Solicitants could request a subsidy from the ANII in the amount of up to US$200,000.
Beneficiaries were requested to cofinance at least 30 percent of the total cost of the Alliance in cash.

27.    Examples of Alliances' objectives include the production of a kit to detect contaminant
proteins (see beneficiaries' testimonials at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPQVVqYF3fQ>
and at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td32o8H3qvw>) or the alimentary use of composite
(non-wheat) flours (see <http://www.bancomundial.org/es/news/feature/2014/08/12/innovacion-
panaderos> for the Alliance description and results). Sixty-three entities (of which, 43 firms)
(Intermediate Indicator 20, 110 percent achieved) contributed with a cash investment of US$712,883
(Intermediate Indicator 15, 142 percent achieved) to a total of 21 Alliances (Intermediate Indicator
19, 123 percent achieved).

28.     Networks implied a more long-term relationship. The Network benefitting from the grants
offered by the ANII had a maximum of four years to implement the approved business development
plan, and arrangements had to be sustainable in the medium and long term, even after completion of
a period of ANII support. The Network had to be constituted as a legal entity, and it was the direct
beneficiary of the subsidies awarded by the ANII. These grants could be up to US$1 million,
representing a maximum of 70 percent of the total cost of the Network. Disbursement categories were
similar to those described for Alliances.

29.    The Networks put together actors from the private and public sector, which have a significant
degree of involvement in productive activities in a common value chain. Unlike Centers, the
Networks’ services were offered to Network members only and were set up to address innovation
challenges that are specific to the Network. Preference was given to Network proposals that were
oriented to the international market.

30.     Activities carried out by Networks aimed at identifying technological bottlenecks
encountered by the productive sector; finding solutions to overcome such bottlenecks by R&D
activities; designing and implementing technology transfer activities among firms; training qualified
human resources with sector-specific skills; establishing channels of communication and interaction
among Networks’ participants; and investing to create or improve the supply of technological
services to the productive sector.

31.    The progressive approach of the ANII to increase awareness of this instrument among firms
and research institutions resulted in 36 informal links (without written contract) (Intermediate
Indicator 16, 100 percent achieved) and 21 formal links (with written contract) (Intermediate
Indicator 17, 95 percent achieved) between public and private actors interested in supporting Sector
Technology Networks and in the operationalization (at least first disbursement completed) of five
Networks (Intermediate Indicator 18, 100 percent achieved). The results of the financed Networks
include the promotion of tourism in the Piriapolis Region; the creation of the business incubator
Ingenio (a video presentation can be found at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4bkbJcxDEw>);
the characterization of the national production of milk and dairy products; improvements in fruit
exports; and the genomic characterization of cattle.

32.    Between 2012 and 2014, the Project financed private joint ventures between firms that had a
common innovation objective. Three Stimulating Technological Demand projects were approved and
financed (Intermediate Indicator 21, 100 percent achieved). The objectives of the three subprojects


                                                  32
included the design and production of a special glass container; a center for selling handmade national
furniture; and the development of a new heating system. However, during implementation, the
instrument was used not as a partnership but simply to finance the acquisition of existing technology
from firms, with no generation or adaptation of knowledge and technology and very limited transfer
that could be financed otherwise. Given the low justification for public sector subsidies for this
instrument, the activity was closed down in 2014.

33.      In the period 2012–2015, the Project financed the operationalization of five Sector
Technology Centers (Intermediate Indicator 22, 167 percent achieved). The Centers are legal
institutions offering services to firms and other organizations in a particular sector. They draw on
sectoral experts who help companies/organizations identify their specific demand for technology and
develop a related action plan. Interestingly, the Centers build on the early experience encountered by
the ANII when promoting the instruments of Component 3 among the private sector. Indeed, very
often firms are not aware of their specific innovation demand or cannot identify it clearly. This is
particularly true among SMEs. The Centers personnel draw on their expertise to assist firms during
this initial, crucial stage of the innovation process.

34.      Some of the possible activities of a Center include facilitating the transfer of existing
technologies (off-the-shelf) to Uruguayan enterprises; addressing sectoral quality issues; identifying
bottlenecks and opportunities for further innovation of products and processes at the sectoral level;
conducting R&D to develop such products and processes; facilitating the commercialization of a new
product; and collaborating with other research centers and existing institutions. Importantly, the
associative nature underlying the creation of implementation of Centers, involving several public
institutions and private firms, allows to have both an advantage at the time of generating international
collaboration as well as to promote decentralization of activities behind the city of Montevideo.
Because of their direct, frequent contact with firms and the deep knowledge about their innovation
needs, the Center personnel can help in promoting the financing instruments offered by the ANII to
the private sector. Finally, the Centers produce technical publications and regularly organize
knowledge exchange events, thus contributing to the generation of knowledge and technology.

35.     As defined in the 2014 Project Restructuring Paper, a Center would be considered operational
when it meets at least three out of four of the following formal requirements, and two out of four of
the following operational requirements:

      Formal requirements:

              Signature of the contract establishing the Center
              Center defined as a legal entity
              Definition of governance by participating stakeholders
              Development of a working plan/definition of the portfolio together with the
               corresponding sector

      Operational requirements

              At least one assignment (contract) with the productive sector
              Completion of first disbursement
              Procurement of equipment (if specified in the application for the grant)


                                                  33
              Hiring technical personnel (if specified in the application for the grant)

36.     The effort to relaunch Centers (2012) was particularly successful, with five operational
Centers in only 18 months (2013–2015). The 5 Centers have been endorsed following a competitive
selection process, with a strong leadership from the private sector, and anchored in the best resources
of the national innovation system of Uruguay. These projects bring together large, small and medium-
sized companies, encouraging collaboration between competing companies. The Centers have a
similar system of governance, in several aspects, to those of the most successful technology centers
in the world, where the private sector leads and has a share of resources for operation.

37.     Examples of operational Centers supported by the Project are the Center of Innovation in
Engineering (bringing together firms and the engineering faculties of domestic universities not only
to meet the specific engineering needs in the private sector but also to promote entrepreneurial culture
among engineering students); the Center of Information and Communication Technology (a
multidisciplinary center for research and innovation in the field of ICT and its applications for vertical
sectors, such as energy, agriculture, banking and health); Unit of Innovation in Alimentary
Technology (a center collaborating with similar institutions in Spain, Costa Rica, Argentina and
Angola, to promote innovation in alimentary technology among firms); and the Center of Industrial
Extensionism (offering innovation services to SMEs in the industrial sector. A video presentation is
available at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JdUr70thik>). Besides the five operational
Centers, three more are currently being discussed and approaching the contract signature stage

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       Since the creation of the ANII, innovation and research activities have had a formal
institutional support, which was nonexistent until then. The aim of this document is to evaluate the
social returns to some of the crucial activities financed by this Project through the ANII, namely
postdoctoral scholarships (Becas de Posgrado) (Component 2) and Alliances (Component 3) 37 .
Furthermore, the analysis presents specific cost effectiveness information on the TIMBO portal
(Component 1), and a short literature review that helps evaluating the efficiency of other main Project
activities, namely Becas de Iniciación a la Innovación (Component 2) and Sector Technology
Networks and Centers (Component 3)38.

2.      For the evaluaion of Becas de Posgrado program, since information about the direct social
benefits of scholarships was not available, estimations of potential returns to higher education were
calculated using the Encuesta Continua de Hogares (ECH), the main Household Survey for Uruguay.
Regressions based on a simple version of the human capital model were estimated for 2006 – 2013,
considering the evolution of the coefficient associated with postgraduate education as a proxy of the
educational IRR for this population. Additional descriptive data from the scholarships from the ANII
were summarized.

3.     For the evaluation of the Alliances program, a difference-in-difference model was estimated.
Information about revenues for beneficiaries and nonbeneficiary firms, before and after the program,
was provided by the ANII. The before and after revenues for treated and nontreated firms were
compared in order to estimate the potential (non-conditioned) effect (incremental gains) of the
program.

Results by Component

Component 1

4.     One crucial aspect promoted by the ANII was the possibility of enabling Uruguayan citizens
to have access to bibliographic databases containing high-quality international scientific journals.
This was achieved by the setup of the online platform TIMBO. The website provides free access to
journals and databases of references among another useful sources of information for R&D activities
(Informe de Seguimiento de Actividades 2014).

5.      Table 3.1 summarizes the evolution of articles downloaded for each year (from 2009 to 2014),
its annual and cumulative variation. One can observe an increasing trend of downloaded documents
over time, especially significant in the first years of implementation of the Project and the last
available year (2014). Importantly, an increasing number of researchers are pointing at the download
of scientific articles as a good indicator of the capacity of publications to generate scientific activity,
implicitly recognizing the role of scientific articles download in promoting transfer and generation
of knowledge (Bollen et al. 2005, 2008 and 2009; Shepherd 2007).



37
  The two activities together account for 32% of total project investment.
38
  The information at disposal did not allow for a quantitative estimation of the monetary benefits arising from these
activities.

6.      One of the most promising results is the progressive reduction of the average unitary cost by
downloaded article in the period, from an average cost of US$9.78 in 2009 to US$4.82 in 2014. This
is a clear improvement in the efficiency of the system, since it was able to reduce costs while
maintaining a stable annual investment (table 3.3).

Posgrado scholarships

Descriptive Analysis

7.      In the period 2008–2014 a total of 23 percent of doctoral candidates in the country were
financed by the ANII. Apart from completing graduate education, students receiving a Posgrado
scholarship had additional benefits as the production of scientific publications (in 85 percent of the
cases) and the possibility to present their own research in conferences and workshops (75 percent of
beneficiaries). Nearly 74 percent of the beneficiaries enrolled in the next educational level (PhD or
Post Doctoral) after completion of graduate studies. Out of the beneficiaries who had a job as of 2014,
95 percent declared employment in research activities. In 74 percent of the cases, the field of research
in which they were currently working was closely related to the research topic developed under the
scholarship. The rate of successful completion of the grants has been high.

Estimation of the Social Returns of Posgrado Scholarships

Main Assumptions

      i.   In absence of information on the distribution of pre-2012 investment by single year,
           information for the period 2012-2015 was used to derive the average unitary investment per
           beneficiary, and the number of beneficiaries in each year was considered to distribute the
           variable part of the pre-2012 investment. The remaning investment can be thought as fixed
           cost, and it was assumed to be disbursed in the first year of implementation of the program
           (2008).

     ii.   Due to the impossibility to distinguish between the salaries of master's and PhD graduates,
           we assume that on average the benefits of a graduate degree start materializing after 2 years
           of entry in the program. The duration of a master’s program is two years in Uruguay and the
           duration of a PhD is four years. This assumption takes into account the high prevalence of
           students engaged in the labor market at the time of study. According to the University Census
           of Students - 2012, 88.7 percent of the postgraduate students work in Uruguay (including PhD
           students) and work weekly 39.2 hours on average.

 iii.      It is assumed that the differential return to postgraduate education with respect to graduate
           education stays constant across the working life. This is a medium scenario, as economic,
           institutional and social changes may cause this relationship to be non-linear over time, and
           the incremental return to posgraduate education may either increase or decrease with age.

Methodology

8.     Following Belli et al. (1998), Mincer equations were estimated for 2006–201339. The Mincer
equation allows estimating the postgraduate level return with respect to lower educational levels.
Once estimates of the coefficient reflecting the incremental return of a postgraduate student were
obtained, the potential per capita benefit from the program was estimated and applied to the
postgraduate scholarship holders for each remaining year of working life.

9.         The procedure could be summarized as follows:

           (a) The Mincer equation allows estimating the return to postgraduate level compared to
               complete university and the other lower educational levels. The Mincer equation
               including the level of education, differentiating postgraduates from other educational
               levels, was estimated using the National Household Surveys (Encuestas Continuas de
               Hogares) for 2006–2013. Given that the average age of beneficiaries at the time of
               obtaining the Posgrado scholarship is 29 (ANII, Informe de Seguimiento de Actividades
               2014), and based on assumption ii), the differential return of postgraduate education to
               graduate education was estimated at the age of 3140. Mincer equation could be specified
               as follows:

39
  Last year for which the National Household Survey is available.
40
  Mincer equation specifies a MCO regression model where the log of hourly wage is the dependent variable and
independent variables are dummies identifying the sex and the race of individuals, and variables that reflect the level of
education, sector of activity, and the work experience.


                                                           37
                                                                   	                    	                    	
                                	                      	                               	

             In addition to the educational levels and potential experience variables, the estimation
             considered sex, race, and occupational sector as control variables.

         (b) The coefficient of posgraduate education was estimated to be approximately 5. Results
             suggest that the incremental return of a postgraduate worker over a graduate worker is
             0.6641

         (c) Using the National Household Surveys, the average annual income among workers who
             achieved postgraduate level and the average annual income among workers with
             completed graduate education were estimated. The difference in average annual income
             is combined to the estimate of the incremental return to approximate the per capita benefits
             from the program.

         (d) This per capita income is applied to each postgraduate scholarship holder, for each
             remaning year of his or her working life42.

         (e) The sum of the benefits for each cohort in each year provides us with an estimate of
             aggregate benefits per year.

Results suggest that this program enjoys an IRR of 61%. To better get a sense of the program
efficiency, we calculate the cost benefit ratio considering two scenarios. In the first one, we apply the
social discount rate of 12% estimated by Oddone (2011) for the case of Uruguay. In the second one,
a low discount rate of 5% is applied. Table 3.4 presents the results of this exercise. For each US$
invested in this activity, 16 US$ are generated (or 26 US$ in the second scenario).

Importantly, one has to be cautious in interpreting these results. The implicit assumption here is that
in a counterfactual scenario that is in absence of the Posgrado scholarship, none of the beneficiaries
would have enrolled in postgraduate education. This assumption is not likely to be realistic given the
nature of the program and the highly educated profile of beneficiaries. Unfortunately, there is no
experimental or quasi experimental evidence that allow us to estimate the impact of this particular

41
   The coefficient for postgraduate return is statistically significant at the 5 percent level and is statistically and
significantly different from the educational level ‘completed university’.
42
   We make a conservtive assumption and assume that workers will retire at age 60, the minimum age for retirement in
Uruguay.

program in the probability of being enrolled into post-graduate education. To account for this
limitation, two alternative scenarios are considered: (1) the program increases enrollment in post-
graduate education by 50%43; (2) the program increases enrollment in post-graduate education by
20%. The IRRs estimated for these scenarios are 40% and 21% respectively. Table 3.5 and 3.6 present
the cost-benefit results for the two scenarios. The Benefit/Cost ratio is positive even in the most
conservative scenario.

Iniciación a la Investigación scholarships

10.     The evaluation of this activity conducted by the ANII (2012) shows that, among the
undergraduate students who received an Iniciación scholarship in 2008, 73 percent had completed
the bachelor’s program as of 2011 (versus 60 percent of the non beneficiaries), 62 percent obtained
a research-related employment, and 34 percent of those who were employed before the scholarships
declared that their wage increased as a result of the scholarship-financed outcome. Between 2009 and
2011, the treated group (scholarship beneficiaries) obtained on average 0.23 publication more than
the control group, and this effect is attributable to the scholarship. An increased number of
publications is well-known in sociology of science as to favor a "Matthew effect", a sort of multiplier
effect for which the higher the number of scientific publications, the easier will be to publish in
scientific journals in the future, the more profitable the career of the scientist (Merton 1968).

Estimation of the Social Returns to Alliances

Main Assumptions


43
  This scenario is in line with the impact found by Solis (2013), who estimates the effects of loosing budget constraint
by providing accesss to credit loans on the probability of being enrolled in undergraduate college in Chile.
Unfortunately, at the best of our knowledge there is no paper in the region that provides such estimate of the impact at
postgraduate level.

      i.   Due to the lack of information on the distribution of pre-2012 investment by single year, pre-
           2012 investment is allocated to each year on the basis on the number of Alliances financed in
           the same time period.
     ii.   Economic benefits are assumed to materialize within one year since the beginning of
           participation in the program.
 iii.      The period 2010-2016 is considered.

Methodology

11.     The following steps were considered to estimate the potential income estimations for firms
that are in the Alliances program:

       (a) Revenues before and after the beginning of the program were considered, for beneficiary
           and nonbeneficiary firms44;
       (b) This difference-in-differences estimator (a naïve and non-conditioned one) was used as a
           proxy of the effect of the Alliances program and applied to the cumulative number of
           firms from the year they begin to participate in Alliances onwards.
Results

The IRR for the program is estimated to be 38%. Table 3.6 shows how the Benefit/Cost ratio is
estimated to be greater than one45.

Potential impact of instruments financed under Component 3

12.     Aboal and Garda (2015) provide estimate of the production functions for private investment
in innovation and innovation outcome respectively, for the case of Uruguay. These equations include
a coefficient associated with cooperation of firms with at least one research institution, in innovation
and research activities, which is useful to understand the potential impact of the instruments under
Component 3 - public-private partnerships for innovation as Alliances, Networks and Centers.

13.    Public-private cooperation for innovation in Uruguay is estimated to increase firms'
investment in innovation by 52 percent compared to firms that do not participate in such




44
   The time of implementation of the program varies for each treated firm, according to the year they begin to
participate in Alliances.
45
   The discount rate is applied only to benefits in one year (2016), given that costs and benefits for the previous years
were already realized.


                                                            40
collaboration. Technological innovation output is 77 percent higher among participating firms and
non-technological innovation is 400 percent higher.

14.     Importantly, Networks and Centers imply not only collaboration between one firm and
research institutions, but also cooperation with other firms. Crespi and Zuniga (2012) estimate that,
for the case of Uruguay, R&D cooperation between firms could increase intensity of investment in
innovation per employee by 0.53 percentage points. This positive result is higher than that obtained
in Colombia (0.23 percentage points) but lower than the one estimated for Panama (1.34 percentage
points).

Background

1.      The need for the Project emerged as the result of a new policy initiated in 2005 to support the
research and innovation sector, which was continued by the new Government. Within this framework,
the agreement was implemented with the goal of strengthening the country’s capacity to create,
transfer, and adapt knowledge and technology, funding the following activities:
         The institutional framework for STI
         Investments in human capital and high-quality research equipment
         Transfer of technology and innovations in the private sector
         Collaboration and intersectoral and international mobility of researchers among public
            institutions and the productive sector

2.    In June 2007, the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) of the
World Bank Group and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay signed the Loan Agreement, in which the
Bank contributed US$26 million and Uruguay contributed US$6.5 million.

3.      At first, the agreement was implemented by the MEC and the National Development
Corporation (CND) until the ANII began to function, having been created by the law in December
2006. This new institutional framework was designed to bring together all the STI loans that existed
in the country.

4.     Once the agency was created, specific agreements with the Bank were made over time,
culminating with the transfer of management responsibilities to the new institution.

5.     Thus, the following milestones were achieved during the implementation of the Project:
       (a) Effective transfer of the FM of the Project to the ANII. The definitive transfer of
           administrative and financial responsibilities from the CND to the ANII was accomplished
           during June 2008.
       (b) Amendment to the Loan Agreement. On October 29, 2008, an amendment to the Loan
           Agreement was completed with the goal of updating the agreement to reflect the
           operational reality following the transfer of financial management to the ANII. The
           amendment included (a) establishment of the ANII as the program implementation agency
           and (b) clarification of the categories of eligible expenditures within the subproject
           (donation) framework.
       (c) Subsidiary Agreement. Upon transferring the administrative and financial
           responsibilities from the CND to the ANII, it was necessary to execute a Subsidiary
           Agreement between the MEF and the ANII. Therefore, an agreement between the ANII
           and the MEF was signed.
       (d) New version of the Operations Manual. On April 23, 2009, the Bank approved the new
           version of the Project Operations Manual with validity up to March 31, 2009. This new
           version of the Operations Manual reflected the new role of the ANII as a fully operational
           entity.
       (e) Second amendment to the Loan Agreement. The MEF, the ANII, and the Bank worked
           on an amendment to the Project that would allow the investment in the TIMBO portal to



                                                  46
            be recognized, as well as to update the result indicators based on the accumulated
            implementation experience that the Project had gained. The creation of the TIMBO portal
            stands out for its universal online access to international scientific and technological
            literature as well as to patent databases. The portal began functioning on January 1, 2009.
            The Bank formally sent the documents associated with the amendment to the Uruguayan
            Government authorities for their consideration and signature. They were signed by the
            MEF and the ANII.
      (f)   Project M&E indicators established in the PAD. The ANII proposed to the Bank
            modification of indicators that did not accurately reflect the Project activities. These
            changes were included in the documents that accompanied the amendment. The periodic
            measurement of these indicators is considered by the ANII to be a key element in program
            supervision. Accordingly, the following indicators were updated: (a) the PDOs and (b)
            the implementation indicators. Additionally, the ANII presented the M&E Plan for the
            various activities that the agency is undertaking.
      (g)   Project procurement issues. The ANII proceeded with the hiring of the firm Ernst &
            Young to carry out the sample-based financial and procurement audits of the subprojects.
            The Project employed a procurement specialist who was in charge of this area and whose
            principal mission consisted of developing tools to improve the conditions and the levels
            of control with which procurement is carried out, train supervisors and beneficiaries, and
            create and update the valuable information available through the ANII web page and the
            information systems in use (including the SEPA).
      (h)   Project FM. The Intermediate Financial Reports (IFRs) for each semester were received
            by the Bank without comments or observations. The financial information was presented
            correctly and the funds shown as received from the Bank matched the disbursement
            records. Consequently, the reports were acceptable to the Bank. An agreement was
            reached with the ANII to update the implementation status of the Procurement Plan each
            semester in the SEPA.
      (i)   External audit process. The audits were performed by private audit firms approved by
            the Bank using internationally recognized audit standards. These reports were accepted
            by the Bank, given that they contained the information required for Project financial
            statements and the funds shown as received from the loan matched the Bank’s records.

Promoting Innovation to Enhance Competitiveness Innovation Project

6.    The Project consists of three components:
      (a) Support for STI policies and institutional strengthening
      (b) Strengthening and guidance for research
      (c) Promotion of innovation and technology transfer to the productive sector

Component 1: Support for STI Policies and Institutional Strengthening

7.    This component is subdivided into three subcomponents:
      (a) Support for the development of public policies for STI
      (b) Support for the ANII
      (c) Creation of and support for the STI Observatory




                                                  47
8.    This component will help establish a coherent policy framework for STI, consolidating and
improving existing policies and programs.

Subcomponent 1.1: Support for the Development of Public Policies for STI
9.     In this subcomponent, various consultancies were undertaken and workshops were organized;
an analysis related to the formulation and updating of the National STI Strategy was performed;
coordination was undertaken with the key actors in the National Innovation System for the
consultation processes; the dissemination of the National STI Strategy was maintained; and seminars
and workshops were developed. These seminars and workshops dealt with the various consultancies
that had been contracted to determine the state of the art in several knowledge areas. All of these
consultancies were inputs for the development of the PENCTI, which was approved in February
2010.

Analysis of STI Topics

10.    Within the framework of this component, studies of STI indicators and the production of
bibliometric indicators were funded.

11.    The goal of this activity is to develop and foment the development of analytical works that
have strategic value for decision making with regard to STI management at the discretion of the
management committee, in addition to strengthening analytical capabilities on these topics at the
national level. Consultants were hired to analyze specific STI thematic areas. Also, researchers were
provided with access to the statistical information created and administered by the ANII for the
development of research projects related to these topics.

Analysis and Studies of STI Indicators

12.     The goal of this activity is to develop a broad dissemination strategy for the information
(indicators, studies, and diagnostics) created about the STI system that would allow it to reach
different types of users: political decision makers, researchers, information producers, and society as
a whole. Some of the topics included were results of the ‘3rd Survey of Innovation Activities in
Industry (2004–2006)’; results of the ‘1st Survey of Innovation Activities in Services (2004–-2006)’;
results of the ‘4th Survey of Innovation Activities in Industry’; results of the ‘2nd Survey of
Innovation Activities in Services’; results of the ‘1st Survey of Innovation Activities in Agriculture’;
results of the ‘National Survey of Public Perceptions of Science, Technology, and Innovation (2008
and 2011)’; the ‘2009 Survey of Public Perceptions of STI’; ‘Bibliometric Indicators’; and the
National Bulletin of Science, Technology, and Innovation Indicators, among others.

13.     An Innovation Indicators Workshop was organized at the Inter-American and Ibero-American
levels and hosted in Uruguay jointly with the RICYT. The goal was to bring together researchers,
producers of indicators, Government officials, and international organizations interested in new
developments in the field of innovation indicators, to provide a space for both reflection and general
methodological discussion of these types of indicators, as well as their analysis and potential uses as
inputs into the political process. The number of individuals who participated in the workshop was 50,
from more than 12 countries. The ANII provided the logistical inputs for the workshop, which took
place in September 2010.



                                                  48
14.     Additionally, the CVUy system was developed, along with a system for online project
evaluation: The online résumé system, known as CVUy, is fully operational. An Online Project
Evaluation System was also developed, which considered, in a general way, the varying possibilities
and necessities for the evaluation of requests for projects related to the different programs and tools
that the ANII implements.

Bibliometric Indicators

15.     The goal of the producing bibliometric indicators is to measure the results of the scientific
and technological activities developed by investigators that work in Uruguayan institutions based on
their publications in refereed scientific journals. A study of the evolution of bibliometric indicators
in Uruguay during recent years was performed.

Subcomponent 1.2: Support for the ANII

16.    The formation and operation of the agency was funded when it began to operate in 2007 and
2008. The organizational structure was consolidated as a result of the development of information
systems for the establishment of continuous improvement processes for management and the
operational optimization to meet internal and external clients’ needs. The policies related to the
implementation of frontline information tools were strengthened so that these tools would aid in the
achievement of goals related to the foundational processes on which management and operations are
based within the agency. Management processes were standardized and documented and workflows
were automated, enabling the establishment of parameters for the various tasks and their
measurement in the future.

17.    Moreover, the Project supported the training of experts from the MEC and the ANII, offering
them a master’s program in STI management from the National University of General Sarmiento in
Argentina.

TIMBO Portal

18.    In this component, the electronic publications portal (TIMBO) was also funded.

19.     The TIMBO portal, developed by the ANII during 2008 and made available to the system
beginning in January 2009, has the goal of providing Uruguayan researchers and technology workers
with universal online access to international scientific and technological literature as well as to patent
databases. It is the first tool of its type in Uruguay and consists of a Government project focused on
interdisciplinary scientific communication, ensuring equal opportunity to access the latest data in
different knowledge areas. The portal provides free access and full text for journals, reference
databases, and other publications, all selected based on their academic quality.

20.     To create the TIMBO Portal, the ANII reached agreements with the principal international
publishers, including Elsevier, for access to the Freedom Collection (1,650 journals across all
disciplines) and Scopus (references from more than 14,000 works); IEEE (more than 1.8 million
articles; 163 journals; 823 annual conferences; and 2,000 engineering, electronics, and
telecommunications standards); Springer (1,300 journals and 6,400 books), among others. Moreover,



                                                   49
in 2009, new agreements were reached with Ebsco and Dot Lib, which incorporated more than 260
specialized publications in health and the social sciences beginning January 1, 2010.

21.   With respect to the creation and support of the STI Observatory, the political timeline
exceeded the temporary nature of the Project.

22.     The implementation of Component 1 laid the foundation for the operation of the agency, the
consultancies necessary to create the PENCTI, and the construction of the TIMBO portal. In this
sense, the implementation of the program can be considered successful as a result of having complied
with its mission and supported the new institutional framework in the area of STI, which marks a
clear before and after in the country.

Component 2: Incorporation of Human Capital and High-quality Research Teams

23.    This component is divided in three subcomponents:
       (a) Promoting research excellence in science and technology in priority research areas
       (b) Increasing the stock of advanced human capital
       (c) Strengthening priority tertiary technical education programs

24.    This component will strengthen Uruguay’s ability to develop new knowledge.

Subcomponent 2.1: Promoting Research Excellence in Science and Technology in Priority Research
Areas

25.    In this first subcomponent, the following activities were funded:

26.     Projects of excellence in priority areas. These projects seek to invest in the consolidation
of research and development capabilities in priority areas. In addition, these capabilities should focus
on solving, over the medium term, the productive and/or social problems that are most relevant to the
country. Calls for projects were launched and directed to consolidated, multidisciplinary and, as far
as possible, inter-institutional groups, which proposed the creation of R&D and innovation projects
aimed at finding solutions for important limiting factors in priority sectors.

27.     In 2009, the ANII began to operate a new methodology of R&D and innovation program
development and management, using Sectoral Funds in priority areas. Accordingly, the Energy
Sector Fund began operations, created by a Board resolution with the participation of the UTE (the
state electricity firm) and the ANCAP (the state petroleum firm). In coordination with the Ministry
of Public Health, a similar fund was launched in the health sector. Additionally, the Innovagro Sector
Fund began operations, created within the framework of an agreement with the Farming Research
Institute at the end of 2008.
         Energy Sector Fund. The goal of this tool is to promote research, development, and
             innovation activities in strategic areas—as defined in each request for projects—in the
             energy sector, through the financing of projects. This tool has two modes of operation,
             one aimed at research groups and the other at firms.
         Innovagro Sector Fund. The general goal of this tool is to promote solutions for current
             problems, as well as those that are identified through forward-looking studies of the


                                                  50
           development opportunities for agro-industrial value chains, preferably export focused.
           The Innovagro Sector Fund financed projects through two modes of operation: research
           projects aimed at strategic areas defined in each public request for projects and innovation
           projects requested by the productive sector.

28.      In addition, the Social Impact Project was requested. This type of project seeks to invest in
the development of research that has as its goal, the solving of problems whose solutions are
characterized by a high level of social impact, in other words, higher levels of social well-being for
the citizens of the country.

29.    Projects in strategic areas with limited development were also funded. In this case, the goal
is to strengthen strategic knowledge areas that could contribute to the country’s productive
development and modernization but which currently lack consolidation from an academic point of
view. Within this project framework, the Health Sector Fund was financed. The goal of this tool is to
support R&D projects in Public Health and Human Medicine whose results are applicable to the
national reality. These projects are focused on some of the areas/problems defined in the PENCTI.

Subcomponent 2.2: Increasing the Stock of Advanced Human Capital

30.    The goal was to strengthen educational offerings and create human capital in the technical
and scientific fields. To achieve this goal, the subcomponent consisted of the following tools:
        Support for National Postgraduate Programs. The goal of this tool is to develop and
            strengthen national master’s and doctorate programs by designing programs, training
            professors, and improving learning infrastructure.
        National Postgraduate Scholarships. The goal of this tool is to strengthen the country’s
            human resources by funding national postgraduate scholarships (master’s and doctorates)
            in areas that have been deemed strategic by the GMI.
        Strengthening Tertiary Technical Education Programs. This tool’s goal was to create
            and strengthen tertiary technical education programs—nonuniversity—in areas deemed
            to be priorities that are driven by an institutional arrangement where public and/or private
            entities participate and that deal with an identified need in the productive and/or social
            sector.

31.    Furthermore, the subcomponent seeks to support those programs with competency profiles
that were clearly defined, developed, and monitored in consultation with private enterprise.

32.    In the same way that through Component 1 an innovative institutional framework was
supported at the country level, in Component 2, through the strengthening of tertiary technical
education programs, sectors that had not been previously addressed with programs focused on the
productive sector were supported. In addition, scholarships for national postgraduate studies in high
demand were consolidated significantly, while research projects in priority sectors with high demand
were also supported. Support for national postgraduate programs was also a new tool in the country
and entailed the creating and strengthening new programs of study in diverse areas.




                                                  51
Component 3: Promoting Innovation and Technology Transfer to the Productive Sector

33.    This component is divided into two subcomponents:
       (a) Development of sectoral technology centers
       (b) Support for public-private research consortia

34.     This component entered the implementation phase later than the others did, but it has been
seminally important for leveraging the transfer of knowledge to the productive sector. One of the
tools used to foment the transfer of technology and innovation in the productive sector was the
formation of Alliances among productive sector actors and those in the research and development
sector through a tool called Innovation Alliances. This tool was implemented from 2010.

35.    With the goal of promoting connections between the public and private sectors, the Sectoral
Technology Networks component was also implemented, which included various segments/actors
from the National Innovation System (public and private actors) concentrating and strengthening
research, development, and innovation capabilities in priority sectors.

36.    From 2012, various activities were developed with the goal of implementing Component 3 of
the program.

37.     Within this framework, it was understood that new tools must be designed that would finance
potential technological needs in the country’s priority sectors and that would contribute to technology
transfer.

38.   In this way, two tools were designed: ‘Stimulating Technological Demand’ and ‘Sectoral
Technology Centers’.

39.    The Stimulating Technological Demand tool promotes innovation and technology transfer to
the productive sector and foments relationships and connections among the various actors within the
National Innovation System, with the goal of promoting their dynamism and competitiveness,
thereby increasing their productivity and technological performance.

40.     The Sectoral Technology Centers tool aims to transfer technology to the productive sector
through diverse activities that these centers can undertake. Each sectoral technology center is a legally
incorporated nonprofit organization that is statutorily obligated to contribute to the improvement of
enterprises’ competitiveness by creating technological knowledge, undertaking R&D and innovation
activities, and developing their applications. The knowledge application function comprises, among
other things, carrying out projects with enterprises, providing innovation support services, training,
and dissemination through technology transfer activities.

41.     The goal of this tool is to strengthen Uruguay’s ability to offer specialized technology services
focused on the productive sector in established and emerging sectors (in accordance with the priorities
expressed in the national strategy) by creating new Technology Centers or improving the capabilities
of those that already exist. Each Technology Center’s activities should allow for the establishment of
new capabilities at the country level or strengthen existing ones.




                                                   52
42.     This final component was, without a doubt, the most innovative in terms of the tools designed.
In addition, it holds the greatest promise for future development. In addition to the Innovation
Alliances and the Sectoral Technology Networks, which were successful, the Sectoral Technology
Centers that are in operation are destined to close the gap between academia and the productive sector,
in this way becoming the portion of the loan from which the greatest returns are expected.

43.    The ultimate goal of the Project was to support the Government’s high-level goal of
improving the Uruguayan economy’s competitiveness and stimulating growth by adding value to
output and diversifying exports.

44.     Specifically, the Project’s development goal was to strengthen Uruguay’s ability to create,
transfer, and adapt knowledge and technology. In this sense, it can be confirmed that the Project is
satisfying its development goal, but as has been seen in the experiences of the OECD countries,
changing an innovation system is a gradual process that requires time and needs prolonged
intervention.

45.     The current Project is an important milestone in this journey and has demonstrated that the
activities implemented have been successful in terms of achieving the development goal.

Restructuring and Extensions

46.    The original loan deadline was December 15, 2012. In this instance, a restructuring and
extension of 18 months was requested, with the closing date moving to the end of June 2014.
Subsequently, mainly based on the progress in Component 3, another extension was requested,
moving the closing date to June 2015.

47.     On February 3, 2014, it was requested that the MEF present the request for the extension of
the loan implementation period to the Bank under the following terms:

48.     “In 2013, in order to increase the number of projects performing technology transfer to the
productive sector, projects were approved under the framework of a new tool, sectoral technology
centers, and with extension, these projects can be fully implemented. Additionally, the extension will
enable the research groups to complete their high quality studies and increase the amount of human
capital funded by this program.”

49.    In turn, the MEF presented the request to the Bank on February 5, 2014, supporting the ANII’s
proposal and expressing that the extension was being requested for the implementation of the Sectoral
Technology Centers and that an analysis of the extension had been undertaken with the Bank and the
ministry during the Portfolio Review in November 2013.

50.    This action extended the loan implementation period to June 12, 2015, at which point the
financial execution of the loan was completed.




                                                  53
Intermediate Indicator under the Restructuring Framework

51.    Within the framework of the restructuring, it was proposed that the ‘Average time between
the request for proposals for subprojects and their final selection’ indicator be corrected.

52.     The design of this indicator did not allow for the measurement of process efficiency in the
assignment of subprojects. On the contrary, the indicator created perverse incentives to limit the time
designated for the request for proposals. As a result, the ANII proposed considering modifications to
this indicator as part of the restructuring process.

53.    The new indicator was reformulated as the ‘average time between the close of the request for
proposals for subprojects and their final selection’.

Recommendations to the Bank and Lessons Learned

54.      The Bank joined in the first phase of the creation of the ANII with support that turned out to
be very important. Both in the loan preparation stage as well as at the beginning of the loan’s
implementation the agency received ongoing advice from the Bank, which was reflected in the rapid
start of the implementation phase.

55.     With respect to the procurement procedures, work was performed in constant coordination
with the Bank’s team to adjust the procedures to the Project’s reality, achieving the operation of a
fluid contracting mechanism and processes that did not receive objections.

56.     It is important to highlight the significant role that the Bank played in coordinating the visits
to sectoral technology centers in Spain and Denmark before defining how the concept would be
applied to the country’s reality.

57.    As a general recommendation, it is proposed that an analysis of comparable experiences be
performed for each loan component during the early stages of their implementation.

58.   The institution evaluates the borrower’s performance during the preparation and
implementation of the operation as very good.

59.    The lessons learned from the Project’s preparation comprise the following:
        Carry out prior research on the specific situation of each sector of the economy
        Analysis of the comparative experience of countries in the region to see how they can be
          applied in the country
        Coordination with other multilateral lending organizations in terms of tools to be
          implemented

60.    With respect to the implementation period, the lessons learned comprise the following:
        Prior analysis of the demand for request for tools
        Support the rise of demand
        Study of the level of maturity of the innovation system to launch specific requests for
          proposals


                                                   54
Measures Proposed for Future Operations

61.      For future operations, it will be important to undertake an analysis of the strategies included
in the five-year budget of each of the public ministries and institutions associated with the innovation-
strengthening strategies at the country level.

62.   In addition, it would be interesting to continue funding the Sectoral Technology Centers and
monitoring their progress in transferring knowledge to the productive sector.

Annex 10. The Concepts of Transfer and Adaptation of Knowledge and Technology

1.      A review of the sectoral literature (OECD 2005; European Community 2007; Sabater 2009;
U.S. Department of Energy 2011) and of the international definitions and concepts (Oslo Manual
1997; OECD 2015; UNCTAD; CII) revealed that, although the two concepts are different (as
specified in footnote 19), they are often used to refer to the same type of innovation activity but from
different angles.

2.      Transfer mainly refers to the knowledge and technology flows from the science and
technology system to the productive sector, although it may also cover the transfer from the
productive sector to other companies and markets, while adaptation is part of the adoption process
for which the companies transform the created or transferred knowledge and technology into
innovations in their specific contexts. For example, the Oslo Manual (1997) defines technological
process innovation as the adoption of technologically new or significantly improved production
methods, including methods of product delivery. Therefore, the adoption is at the core of the
innovation activity, the output in which a certain transfer from science and technology can be an input
(for example, through R&D, IPR agreements, mobility of expert technologists or scientists, linkages
with universities or other innovative firms, and so on). These inputs can be considered investments
for the firms (UNCTAD definition of transfer of technology, 2001). The adoption may also generate
transfers to the rest of the world as part of the knowledge and technology diffusion. Therefore,
transfer can be an input (the transferred or absorbed knowledge and technology from the STI system)
and an output related to the diffusion of the adopted/adapted knowledge and technology. The
concepts of transfer and adoption/adaptation are complementary, being the focus of the ‘transfer’ on
the ‘supplier’ and the flows from STI suppliers to recipients. In ‘adoption/adaptation’, the focus is
more on the internal implementation of the innovations by the final ‘user’, in particular, companies.

3.      In practice, the different concepts are interconnected and not so easy to separate in statistical-
indicators terms. The widest and more reputed statistical innovation data source is the EU Community
Innovation Survey, exported to many developing countries in the world, also in Uruguay. In this
survey, the adoption/adaptation is part of the innovation concept, and the transfer mainly comes under
the innovation expenditure where firms declare their main inputs for their innovation. In the GII, the
transfer concept is split between knowledge absorption (the transfer arriving to firms from the STI
system) and knowledge diffusion with a set of symmetric indicators (for example, payments for
royalties and licenses versus fee receipts for the same concept, high-tech import less reimports versus
high-tech expert less reexport, or FDI net inflows versus FDI net outflows) that are useful at country
level but not that much at the micro-firm level needed for an investment project. In the existing
innovation survey and data sources, it is important to notice that the concept of ‘transfer’ is rarely
used since firms often have difficulties in identifying the different types and sources of transfer and
measuring them. As a consequence, there is no internationally established set of transfer and
adaptation indicators suitable to be supplied in a separate and comparable way. In short, the concepts
of transfer and adaptation indicators separated from the innovation concept in itself, since, in the case
of the adaptation, it is part of the innovation concept in international definitions, and, in the case of
the transfer, there are many and different heterogeneous indicators but reliable data at firm level are
not so easy to obtain.
