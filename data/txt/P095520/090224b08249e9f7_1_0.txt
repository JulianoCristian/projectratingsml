                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen Uruguay's capacity to generate, transfer and adapt knowledge and technology by supporting: (i) the
                         institutional framework for science, technology, and innovation (STI); (ii) investments in human capital and high-quality research teams; (iii) technology transfer and
                         private sector innovation; and (iv) cross-sectoral and international research collaboration and mobility of researchers between public institutions and the productive
                         sector.

                         Under Component 1, a National Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation (PENCTI) has been established. The National Research and Innovation Agency (Agencia
                         Nacional de Investigación e Innovación – ANII), created in 2007, has established itself as an active agency in promoting and transmitting the science and technology policies in

                         Within Component 2, 102 research subprojects in priority areas were implemented. This type of subprojects involves research and activities in the fields of environment, health, social
                         inclusion and other areas with high social impact. In the same manner, 18 specific programs aimed at improving living conditions of low-income families have been implemented. With

                         respect to the increase of stock of advanced human capital, 933 scholarships have been awarded to young researchers, and 546 scholarships to master and doctoral students. In
                         addition, 5 graduate programs have been created and 21 have been strengthened.

                         The 2012 restructuring, together with the knowledge and experience acquired during a 2013 Study Tour financed by the Bank, supported the ANII to facilitate the creation of Sector
                         Technology Centers as an instrument under Subcomponent 3.1 . The Sector Technology Centers are legal non-profit institution offering services to firms and other organizations in a
                         particular sector. They provide sectoral experts who help companies/organizations to identify their specific demand for technology and to develop a related action plan. 2 Centers
                         have been signed (created) in the sectors of Nutrition Technology and Engineering. Both sectors are strategic in terms of Uruguay economic development, as they are crucial for
                         exports and infrastructure.

                         Also under Component 3, 5 Sector Technology Networks have been signed, working on specific innovations in high-growth and export sectors, as genetic selection for better quality
                         living stock via using technological, innovative instruments, promote touristic areas via innovative marketing and planning, improve information technology system on diary production,
                         among others.

                         There are also 3 Stimulating Technological Demand Projects. This instrument was initially designed to address the demand for innovation and knowledge of companies which do not
                         have yet the expertise nor the necessary funds to be incorporated in a Network. Nevertheless, the ANII will not open new calls for this type of subproject, given its historically low
                         demand and high operative costs. All potential demand will be directed to Alliances, Networks and Centers.

                         17 Alliances ( public-private research consortia) have been created against an initial target of 8, developing innovations related to biotechnology, animal and human vaccines, eco-
                         friendly cultivations, among others.
