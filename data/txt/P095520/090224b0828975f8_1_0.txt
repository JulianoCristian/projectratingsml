                         Within Component 2, 120 research subprojects in priority areas were implemented. This type of subprojects involve research and activities in the fields of environment, health, social
                         inclusion and other areas with high social impact. With respect to the increase of stock of advanced human capital, 1,083 scholarships have been awarded to young researchers, and
                         the number of graduates from domestic masters and PhD programs reach 806. In addition, 5 graduate programs have been created and 21 have been strengthened.

                         Under Component 3, ANII has supported the creation of Sector Technology Centers. The Sector Technology Centers are legal non-profit institution offering services to firms and
                         other organizations in a particular sector. They provide sectoral experts who help companies/organizations to identify their specific demand for technology and to develop a related
                         action plan. 3 Centers have been created in the sectors of Nutrition Technology, Industrial Extensionism and Engineering. These sectors are strategic in terms of Uruguay economic
                         development, as they are crucial for exports and infrastructure.

                         Also under Component 3, 5 Sector Technology Networks have been signed, working on specific innovations in high-growth and export sectors, as genetic selection for better quality

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A restructuring was approved on June 13, 2014, with the following changes and rationale:

                         •        Closing Date. The closing date was extended by 12 months to June 12, 2015 to allow scaling up activities under Component 2 and 3 of the Project.

                         •         Components. The proposed extension allows scaling up activities under Component 2 and 3 of the Project with the objective to satisfy increasing demand by public and
                         private stakeholders for instruments supporting research and human capital formation, as well as innovation services for the productive sector.

                         •        Results/ Indicators. Indicators was modified as follows: (i) 4 PDO indicators and/or targets were revised; (ii) 14 out of 20 existing intermediate indicators and/or targets were
                         revised.

                         •       Implementation schedule. As of the previous closing date of June 14, 2014, disbursement for some of the activities initiated under Component 3 would not have been
                         completed, for a total amount of US$ 658,000. The extension allows for the full execution of committed disbursement under this component. Furthermore, the extension will allow for
                         new commitments for an approximate amount of US$ 3.5 million under Components 2 and 3.
