to\n            generate, transfer and adapt knowledge and technology by\n            supporting: (i) the institutional framework for science,\n            technology, and innovation (STI); (ii) investments in human\n            capital and high-quality research teams; (iii) technology\n            transfer and private sector innovation; and (iv)\n            cross-sectoral and international research collaboration and\n            mobility of researchers between public institutions and the\n            productive sector. The main purpose of this restructuring is\n            to extend the closing date of the project, in order to allow\n            for a more complete realization of Project Development\n            Objectives (PDOs). In particular, there is room to fully\n            achieve the objective of 'strengthen capacity to\n            transfer knowledge and technology', by improving and\n            completing execution of activities. Taking advantage of this\n            restructuring process, additional changes encompassing the\n            three components and indicators will strengthen\n            implementation and monitoring of the project as a whole.\n            Consistent with the changes to project activities and\n            timetable, PDO indicators will change as follows: one\n            indicator will be dropped; one new indicator will be\n            created; four indicators will be revised in structure and or\n            target. Targets for eight out of eighteen intermediate\n            indicators included in the 2010 restructuring will change to\n            reflect the evolution of activities observed until 2012 and\n            two new intermediate indicators will be created to monitor\n            key activities. The closing date will be extended by 18\n            months to June 13, 2014."}, "docdt": "2012-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
