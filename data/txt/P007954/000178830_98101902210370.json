to be located in medium-sized cities, one in each of the 33\n            school zones created by the administrative reform. Ten of\n            the secondary schools would also provide facilities for\n            primary grades. These schools would be models in\n            implementing the new primary school curriculum, now in\n            experimental use, which provides for new approaches in\n            science, mathematics, social sciences and languages. The 33\n            schools will, in all, provide 21,000 additional student\n            places; (ii) construction of, and equipment for, 16 new ESEP\n            schools, which will provide training in major occupational\n            fields - agriculture, industry training, services and\n            teacher training. These schools will have a total capacity\n            of 11,500 new student places, including 1,400 boarding\n            places; and (iii) technical assistance to support project\n            institutions in introducing the new program, in particular\n            to develop the teacher training programs and curricula for\n            the first two phases of the reform."}, "docdt": "1973-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
