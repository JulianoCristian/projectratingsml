Education Project for Peru\n            will consist of: (i) construction, furnishing and equipping,\n            of 33 new lower secondary schools within the basic general\n            education level, to be located in medium-sized cities, one\n            in each of the 33 school zones created by the administrative\n            reform. Ten of the secondary schools will also provide\n            facilities for primary grades. These schools would be models\n            in implementing the new primary school curriculum, now in\n            experimental use, which provides for new approaches in\n            science, mathematics, social sciences, and languages. The 33\n            schools will, in all, provide 21,000 additional student\n            places; (ii) construction of, and equipment for, 16 new ESEP\n            (Escuelas Superiores de Educacion Profesional - Upper\n            Secondary Schools for Professional Training) schools, which\n            will provide training in major occupational fields -\n            agriculture, industry training, services, and teacher\n            training. These schools will have a total capacity of 11,500\n            new student places, including 1,400 boarding places; and\n            (iii) technical assistance to support project institutions\n            in introducing the new program, in particular to develop the\n            teacher training programs and curricula for the first two\n            phases of the reform."}, "docdt": "1973-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
