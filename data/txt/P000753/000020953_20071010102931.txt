About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroup assesses the programsand activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensurethe integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessandto verifythat the Bank's work is producingthe
expected results, and second, to help devekrp improveddirections, policies,and proceduresthrough the
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience. As part of this work, IEGWBannuatlyassesseS about 25 percent of
the Bank's lendingoperationsthrough feld work. Inselecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to those
that are innovative. large,or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations; those for
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requestedassessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interviewoperational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant.The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the tEGWE RatingSystem
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Reievance includes
relevance of objectives and relevanceof design. Relevance of objectives IS the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistentwith the country's current development prioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible rafings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (orrealized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not valuable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quafity at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangementsfor regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (includingthe government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievementof development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementingagency(ies) performance. Possibleratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) o f two projects inthe Federal
Democratic Republic o f Ethiopia: the Seed Systems Development Project (SSDP) and the
National Fertilizer Sector Project(NFSP).

Bothprojects were approved on June 13, 1995. The SSDP received an IDA Credit (Credit
27410) o f $22.0 million, o fwhich $4.8 million was cancelled midway throughthe
project. At project closure, 54 percent o f the original credit hadbeen disbursed. The
project was closed in September 2002,2 1months behind schedule.

The NFSP received two IDA Credits (Credits 27400 and 27401) with a total value o f
$164.1 million. At project closure, 89 percent o fthe combined credits had been
disbursed. The project was closed inJune 2002, 18 monthsbehind schedule.

The report presents findingsbased on review of the projects' implementationcompletion
reports, appraisal reports, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant material. In
addition, an TEG missionto EthiopiainNovember 2006, visited project sites and held
discussions with government officials and agencies, project directors and staff,
beneficiaries, key donors, and academia.

The projects were chosen for assessment for four reasons. First, Ethiopia's critical
development situation-extreme      poverty, low GDP growth, and highdependence on
agriculture-calls   for as much learningas possible from its agricultural development
experience. Second, the findings o f this assessment support IEG's review of agriculture
inAfrica, andthe ongoing CountryAssistance Evaluationfor Ethiopia. Third, an
overview o f the projects together provides an opportunity to assess the relative meritsof
single projects compared with a more integrated sector-wide approach. Finally, these
projects provide insight into why private sector participation was not successful. It is
expected that the lessons from this assessment will be valuable for future rural
development inEthiopia and for other countries embarking on a privatization program.
To these purposes, the PPAR has a results-based approach, reviewing the projects in a
broader sectora1context  .

Comments on the draft from the Bank's Africa Region have been taken into account.
Following standard IEGprocedures, copies o f the draft PPAR were sent to the
Government of Ethiopia for review, and the Government's comments have been taken
into account inthe text and are provided infull as Annex B.

Summary

        This is the Project Performance AssessmentReport (PPAR) o fthe EthiopiaSeed
Systems DevelopmentProject (SSDP) and the EthiopiaNational Fertilizer Sector Project
o\rr;SP). The projects were simultaneously approved inJune 1995 along with the 1995
Country Assistance Strategy. At that time, Ethiopiawas strugghg to rebuild itself after
nearlytwo decades o fMamistrule, acivil war, and a series of droughts. Ethiopiahad
only arudimentary institutional framework, a very limited private sector, and at all levels
of governance, a marked lack of experience inmodemeconomic and technical
management. Poverty was, and remains, extreme. One o f the poorest countries inthe
world, Ethiopia's per capita GDP isjust $150 per year, and is growing at only 1.5 percent
per year. Such slow growth is not enough for the country to emerge from its poverty trap.
About 90 percent of the poor live inrural areas and the populationo f some 70 million i s
growing rapidly-at    about 2 percent per year - and, ifunchecked, would double by the
mid-2040s (2006 CAS).

         The 1995 and 2006 CASs, as well as the government's "PIan for Accelerated and
Sustained Developmentto end Poverty" (2006) placed rural development as the firlcrum
for faster and more equitable economic growth. The rural sector dominates the economy,
contributing 40 percent o f GDP, 90 percent o f exports and 85 percent of employment. Per
capita agricultural GDP has beenlargely stagnant since the early 1990s, even though the
overall economy has been growing at 4 percent per year. All cultivatable land is now
cropped. Thus, Ethiopia's imperativechailenge is to sign$cantly enhnncegrowth in
agricultural productivity.

         Giventhe challenge to boost agriculturalproductivity, the overall aim o fboth
projects is highly relevant. Eachproject aimedto strengthen institutions inits subsector;
prioritize the development o f competitivemarkets, including private sector participation;
and promote efficient input use through the agricultural extension system. While sound in
concept, the projectswere unusual inthat each addressedoniy a single aspect o f
Ethiopia's agricultural development needs, albeit an important one. This would have been
justified ifthey had been closely coordinated with each other, and integrated with other
rural sector needs, but this was not the case.

         The Seed Systems Development Project's outcome is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. SSDP successfully achieved its main objective to decentralize and
strengthen the government seed-producing agency, the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise (ESE).
However, it failed to achieve its secondary objective to promote seedproduction by
private firms, and informal seed productionby farmers; and ESEretains a nearly
exclusive monopoly of seed production. Substantial performanceimprovementsare still
required to achieve project objectives. The performance of the Bank andborrower are
both rated moderately unsatisfactory. Policies introduced independently by government at
the beginningofthe SSDP and NFSP actively discriminated against private seed
production and the private retailingofboth seed and fertilizer. The failure to improve
private sector participationwas the result of minimal attentionby both the Bank and
government to this aspect during supervision, aproblem compounded by lack o f effective

                                                X



rural sector analysis and the absence of a comprehensive strategy. Risk to development
outcome is rated significant.

         TheNational Fertilizer Sector Project 's outcome is rated unsatisfactory. The
NFSP successfully assisted fertilizer sector institutions to strengthen capacity, but failed
to achieve its main objective to create a competitive fertilizer market with private sector
participation. Instead, the private sector left the market and the government became the
monopolysupplier. The NFSPhadsome success via the agricultural extension system in
promotingincreased and efficient fertilizer usage by farmers--but      the system's supply-
driven approach limited the impact on agricultural productivity. Some $125 million of
IDA flinds (95 percent ofthe project's total disbursements) were usedto finance fertilizer
imports through a government-monopolized market. Ifbudget support was needed, it
wouId have been better to use a more appropriate financing vehicle, such as a structural
adjustment operation rather than to risk perpetuatingmarket inefficiencies.

         Significant performance improvements are still required for NFSP to achieve a
satisfactory outcome, hence risk to development outcome is rated significant. The
performance of the Bank and borrower are bothrated unsatisfactory. The primary
weakness was that neither partner identified all o f the factors required to liberalize the
fertilizer market, or paid attention when progress was the opposite of intentions.

The experiences o f SSDP and NFSP provide six main lessons:

1.       Strategically oriented sector work is essential as a base for a relevant and
         effective rural development program. Given the critical need to increase the
        productivity o f Ethiopia's rural sector, it was particularly important to have an
         effective rural strategy. Yet neither the Bank nor the government hadthis. For the
        Bank, there was no significant rural sector work during either preparation or
         implementation of the projects; a gap that was not addressed until2005. The lack
        of sector analysis was a key contributor to the Bank's generally weak rural
         lending program inEthiopia, inquality as well as quantity. Seven out of the 10
        ruralprojects completed inthe 1980s were rated unsatisfactory, and rural lending
        shrank from 44 percent of the Ethiopia portfolio inthe 1980sto only 12 percent in
        the 1990s. The rural lending program also lacked a coherent overall thrust,
        comprising instead a scatter of largely unrelated projects.

2.      Better coordination and linkages are needed between projects and within the
        rural sector as a whole. Although SSDP and NFSP went to the Board on the
        same day, there was minimal coordination between them inconceptualization,
        design, or implementation. Eachproject and supervision team operated in a "siEo,"
        with very limited links, not onlywith eachother but also with related sectors such
        as agricultural extension. Rural development needs a comprehensive approach,
        integrating complementary actions between related programs. This unleashes
        natural synergies for a greater impact, as for example, the enhanced yield impact
        from using seed and fertilizer together.

3.      Development of a competitive fertilizer market requires actions beyond
        "Market Liberalization." Although necessary policy reforms-compnsing

                                              X I



       elimination o f subsidies, deregulation o f prices and equal access to foreign
       exchange and short-term credit-were       all implemented, these were not sufficient
       to achieve fair and opencompetition. Other constraints also needed removal: the
       private sector faced higher collateral requirements and interest rates than for the
       government agency, and more difficult access to foreign exchange and
       government storage facilities. As a result, the private sector left the market, and
       government became the sole fertilizer importer.

4.     Relianceon the public sector for input supply may create not only market
       inefficienciesbut also a shortage of inputs.Only government source inputs
       qualified for credit and were distributed by the extension service. The private
       sector could not compete against such discrimination and abandoned the
       wholesale and retail markets for agricultural inputs. Even so, ESE did not greatly
       increase production and met only a third o f Ethiopia's potential demand for seed.
       The absence of a substantial private seed sector, and the resultant "seed gap," is
       likely to have had a significant negative influence on farm productivity.

    5. Institutionalstructures and processes can restrictprivatesector
       participation. The new agricultural extension program, providing a package o f
       seed, fertilizer, and credit exclusively through government's extension agents,
       limited the participation o f private wholesalers and retailers in the fertilizer and
       seed markets. The revised seed production program left out the formerly
       envisaged informal seed production by farmers.

    6. A one-sized-fits-allagriculturalextensionsystem has limitedimpact. Support
       services for farmers need to be tailored to local conditions and specific fanner
       needs. The government's package, with a fixed combination of fertilizer and seed,
       was a top down, supply driven, one-size-fits-all formula. The impact on
       agricultural productivitywould have been greater with a more flexible demand-
       led extension service.

       Recent developments since these projects closed (in 2002) have been more
encouraging. The Bank and the government have substantially increased sector analysis
over the past two years. Several policy actions that may reduce market bias against
private fertilizer importers were taken in2006. The agricultural extension service's
linkage with research i s being strengthened and a more demand-driven approach i s being
developed. Inlending, the Rural Capacity BuildingProject (FY06) supports the broader
development strategy derived from the sector anaiysis.

1.        Project Objectives and Components

Ethiopia's Agricultural ProductivityChallenge

1.1       The Seed Systems Development Project and the National Fertilizer Sector Project
wereboth presentedto the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors on June 13, 1995,
together with the 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia. At the time,
Ethiopia was still strugglingto recover from 17 years of Marxist rule under the Derg
regime culminating in a protracted civil war and the ousting o f the regime in 1991. The
country hadbegunto rebuilditselfbut was suffering from severe droughts, and hadbeen
further set back by Eritrea's secession in 1993. A t the time the seed and fertilizer projects
were approved, a new Constitutionhad only recently been ratified (in 1994) and
Ethiopia's first national elections hadjust taken place. Thus, the context for the 1995
CAS and the preparation of the two projects consisted of considerable social flux, a
rudimentary institutional framework comprising substantial vestiges o f the past, anda
very limited private sector presence. Given this lack o f experience inmodem economic
and technicalmanagement, Ethiopia and the Bank faced an enormous challenge.

1.2         The challenge was further accentuatedbythe country's stark povertyand
underdevelopment. Ethiopia's per capita GDP of about $150 per annum and per capita
GDP growth of only 1.5 percent put it among the poorest countries inthe world. The
country's highpopulationgrowth o f 2.2 percent per annum, ifunchecked, will double the
current populationof 70 million by the mid-2040s.

1.3         The rural sector dominates the economy o f Ethiopia, contributing40 percent o f
GDP, 90 percent of exports, and 85 percent o f employment. Ninetypercent o f the poor
are located inrural areas. Thus, strong growth of the ruraI economy will be essential to
help Ethiopiareduce its extreme poverty. However, heavy populationpressure has
resulted inpractically all cultivatable landbeingfarmed, eliminating expansion o f
cropped area as the maindriver o f agricultural growth, which hadbeen the case inthe
1990s.Yet per capita agricultural GDP hasbeen largely stagnant since the early 1990s.
This means that there is a critically important need to boost agricultural productivity.

Project Objectives

1.4       Seed Systems Development Project. SSDP's overall objective supported the
productivity enhancement goal.' The objective, to help increase the Borrower 's
agricultural production through the development of a broad-based and competitive seed
industry was to be achieved through four sub-objectives. These were: (i)capacity
buildingthrough institutiona1 strengthening and humanresource development; (ii)
restructuringand strengthening o f the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise's organization,


1. The evaluated project objectives for both SSDP andNFSP are those in their respective Development
Credit Agreements. The order ofpresentation of the specific sub-objectives is adjustedto facilitate the
PPARs later discussions of the projects' achievementsby theme. For example, the first two sub-objectives
of SSDP are bothinstitution strengthening innature; and NFSP's first listedsub-objective is also
institutional.

                                                2


management andoperations; (iii)     promotion o f piivate sector participation inproduction,
processing and marketingo f seeds; and (iv) strengthening the Borrower's informal seed
exchange system. These are listed inTable 1, along with summaries o fthe project's
components and costs.

1.5      NationalFertilizer Sector Project. WSP also supported the agricultural
productivity goal. The project's overall objective was: "To achieve accelerated and
sustainable growth in agriculturalproduction with a view to improvingfood security and
1-educingpoverty. There were five sub-objectives: "(i)assistance to institutional
                    "
strengthening and humanresource development; (ii)         support to policy reforms aimed at
creating an enabling environment for a competitive fertilizer sector; (iii)   promotion of
efficient and environmentallysafe use of fertilizers; (iv) removal o f main fertilizer supply
constraints; and (v) promotion o f initiatives aiming at the improvement o f long-term
fertility o f the Borrower's soil and environmental conservation." Each o f these sub-
objectives had a corresponding component (Table 1). The project's sub-objectives were
not revised.

InstitutionalArrangements

I.6      The institutional environment was extremely challenging for bothprojects. At the
time the projects were appraised the government had embarked on a decentralization
program inwhich Ethiopia's 14 administrative regions were reorganized into 9
geographically autonomous states inwhich the Central Government retainedpower only
incertain subject areas. As part o fthis reformthere was a massiveshift of staff from
Central Government to the regions. As noted at the time o fpresentation to the Board:
"such simultaneous handling of profound systemic change in the economic, politicul,
administrative und institutional structure of Ethiopia is an effort of unprecedented
magnitude. Inevitably it will take time tofully establish effective organizationalstructures
andjinctiond relationships to sustain high levels of economic performance in a
democratic environment.'72

1.7      Responsibilityfor implementation o f the SSDP was placedwith the National
Seeds IndustryAgency and National Seeds Advisory Council that were set up one year
before project approval to implement the 1992National Seed Industry Policy. Prior to
this policy the private sector had virtually no role in the production and marketing o f
seeds, NSIA's national role was to define the role of public and private sectors in seed
industrydevelopment, and inter alia promote active farmer participationand ensure that
seedprices are determined bymarket forces. Within the project NSAC provided policy
advice while NSlA managed implementation and was responsible for all procurement in
consultation with the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise, formerly the ESECorporation. The
Ministry o f Agriculture had a supportive role to create awareness and ensure the activities
of its agencies (suchas the Secondary SeedMultiplication Scheme) were coordinated
withNSIA's plans. Both NSIAandMOA hadto establish collaborativearrangements
with the newly formed regional agriculturalbureaus.

                                                     3


1.8      NFSP. The project was implemented by the newly- created National Fertilizer
Industry Agency (NFIA) that was to coordinate fertilizer import and inland distribution
operations. Untilmid-1992 fertilizer import and marketingwas fully state controlled and
managedby the Agricultural Inputs Supply Corporation (AISCO), a monopolistic
parastatal, inconsultation with MOA. As with seeds the Central Government introduced
a Fertilizer Policy in 1993 that authorized its New MarketingStrategy of 1992.Among
other issues the policy encouraged full participationof the private sector inimportation,
distribution, wholesale andretail trade of fertilizer and set up AISCO to operate in a free
market in competitionwith the private sector and cooperatives. The strategy stated that
the private sector should supplement existing market arrangements and ensure a level
playing field for cooperatives and private traders while liberalizing access to credit.
Under these new arrangements NFIA would handle all supply-sideissues and arrange for
AISCO or other importersto fill any supply gaps. Fertilizer use romotion was to be
handledby the MOA'SAgricultural ExtensionDivision (AED.)                   P

ProjectComponentsand Implementation

1.9      SSDP. The SSDP was primarily an institution strengtheningproject, andthe bulk
o f expenditure was on strengtheningpublic sector institutions. Over 40 percent of actual
project expenditure was on the Capacity Buildingcomponent, to strengthen seed sector
relatedpublic agencies- through staff training, technicat assistance, and additiona1
equipment and fa~ilities.~Additionally, under the ESERestructuringcomponent (about
25 percent o fproject costs), government's seed producing agency - the Ethiopian Seed
Enterprise (ESE) - was decentralized and strengthened infacilities, equipment and staff
capacity (para 3.9)

1.10     SSDP encountered greater difficulties with its last two components. Under the
Private Sector Development component there was some training o f small scale
entrepreneurs, but no significant entry ofprivate seed production                      A largepart of
this was because anew extension system-the NationalAgricultural Extension
InterventionProgram - was independently set up by government at the beginning of the
project. The NAEIP was intendedto provide a package o f fertilizer, improved seed, and
credit through the agricuItura1 extension agents. However, underthe NAEIP only ESE
seed was distributed and etigible for credit. Private seed producers, wholesalers and
retailers could not compete and the ESEbecame a virtual monopoly.6

1.11     SSDP's finaf objective - to develop the "informaI" seed sector (through the
project's Secondarv SeedMultiplication Scheme component) - was effectively negated


3. AISCO is now named the Agricultural Inputs Supply Enterprise (AISE.) Since the project NSIA and
NFIAhave beenmergedand placed withinMOA'SInputMarketing Depai-tment.
4. The agencies were the National Seed IndustryAgency (NSIA), the Natioilal Variety Release Committee
(NVRC, Plant Quarantine Service, Plant Genetics Resource Center, Alemaya University of Agriculture,
EthiopianInstitute o f Agricultural Research, a new Quality Control and Seed Certification system and a
National Seed Reserve.
5. This excludes farmers contracted to produce seed by ESEand the multinational fm(Pioneer).
6. Inits comments, the Africa Regionstates that highcollateral requirements were another barrier to private
sector entry. Difficulties infinding land were another constraint.

due to a radical design change made by government at the beginning o f the project.
Under the SSMS, selected farmers were to undertake the last seed multiplication stage
andthen sell directly and informallyto other farmers inthe vicinity. The redesigned seed
production program had ESEmanaging and marketingall seed production. 'The project
was not adjusted, even at Mid-Term-Review stage, to counter the difficulties experienced
bythe private sector and SSMS components.

1.12     The SSDP's lowerthan expected project cost was primarily due to lower
expenditure on infrastructure and reduced expenditures on consultants. The project period
was extended by 21 months, due to delays incontracting and general implementation.
Project implementationprogress improved after hire o f a project coordinator. InFebruary
2001, $4.8 million ofthe credit was cancelled, and at closure IDA disbursements were
$11.8 million or 54 percent of the original credit of $22.0 million. IFAD cofinanced the
project, contributing $2.5 million to the costs for seed cleaners, threshers, fertilizer and
sacks. The government's counterpart funding amounted to $6.1 million or 30 percent of
actual project costs.

1.13     SSDP's legal covenants were largely adhered to, but some were late due to the
delay inestablishing the project coordination unit.Annual progress reviews and the MTR
were iiarrow in focus, lacked a strategic orientation andwere sIow to adjust to
implementationproblems. Inparticular, this may have contributed to the weak
performance against the project's objectives to promote the private sector and
involvement o f farmers.

component, which comprised a group o fpolicy actions intended to liberalize the fertilizer
market, enabling fair competition for fertilizer importing, wholesaling and retailing
betweenpublic and privateactors, and, thereby, the promotionof the private sector.
Institutionalstrengthening was supported by a Capacitv Buildingcomponent which
financed upgradingo f sector institutions and humanresources through provision of
equipment, vehicles, technical assistance, training and fellowships. The Fertilizer Use
Promotion component supported agricultural extension service to promote technically
sound andincreasedusageof fertilizer byfarmers, on-farmdemonstrations o f fertilizer
impacts, and strengthened the extension service throughprovision o f equipment, vehicles
and training. The Fertilizer Suoplv Management component financed imports of
fertilizer, and technical capacity (consultancies, small equipment) to improve
coordination o f the national fertilizer distribution program. Infinancial terms, the imports
dominated the project, representing over 95 percent o f total project costs. A small &iJ
Fertility Management andEnvironmentalManagement component that piloted bio-
fertilizers and other soil improvement actions, and the establishment of soil testing
laboratories, was largely successful.

I.15     NFSP's's main implementationproblem was with its Fertilizer Policy Reforms
component because constraints to development o f a competitive market were not taken


7. Inits comments, the Regionstates that although the redesignedcoinponent was heavily dependent on
government finance and not commercially oriented, it didhave the merit ofproviding major training to
government staff and the contractedseed growers.

into account. Hence, rather than enabling increased participation of private fertilizer
importers, the reverse happened leaving a government monopoly of all fertilizer imports.
Similarly, private wholesalers and retailers were driven out o f the market because, as
withthe seed sector, the NAEP distributed fertilizer to farmers with credit, whichwas
not available for privately sold fertilizer.

1.16     The project's Capacity Buildingcomponent was implementedwell, and both the
institutions and staff capabilities were improved. The Fertilizer Use Promotion
component had positive impact inupgradingknowledge o fextension staff and farmers
for efficient useo f fertilizer. But poor institutional coordination between fertilizer, seed,
agricultural extension and researchhampered full potential.

I.17     Project expenditure on incremental fertilizer imports was expected at appraisal to
be about $215 million (93 percent ofproject costs). But additional financing from IDA
and other donors raised fertilizer expenditures to $404 million (98 percent o f actual
project costs). A supplementary credit for financing additional fertilizer imports o f $44.0
millionwas approved inMay 2001, one year before the project closing date was extended
by 18 months. The extension was to complete additional soil testing laboratories and to
carry out studies on fertilizer use. `Thehuge increase in project costs (from $230.3 milliori
estimated at appraisal to $413.1 millionat completion) was for the additional fertiIizer
imports. This was financed partly through the supplementary IDA credit and partly by an
increase ingovernment's contribution (from$20.4 million to $79.1 million), but the main
increase in finding(from $89.8 millionto $202.4 million) came from other donors.*
Government's counterpart fundingwas expected at appraisal to be about eight percent o f
project costs, but increased to about 20 percent by project completion.

1-18 Although all legal covenants were reportedto have been compliedwith, the
agreed policy reform actions were incomplete and insufficient. The MTR did not
restructure the project to resolve these problems.

EvaluationApproach

1.I9     SSDP and NFSP provide a rich source of lessons, not only for the seedand
fertilizer sectors themselves, but also for the future development of Ethiopian agriculture
as a whole, not least for Ethiopia's challenge to increase agricultural productivity. To
highlight the broader evaluation findings, this PPAR adopts a results-based approach
withparticularattentionto the projects' most critical and cross-cutting issues (Section 2).
These are presented before detailed discussion o f project Ratings (Section 3) and Lessons
(Section 4).

 1.20    The PPAR, particularly inthe discussion o fratings in Section 3, discussesissues
underthree themes corresponding to the major thrusts ofbothprojects. The first theme is
Institutional strengthening as bothSSDP and NFSP have institution and capacity
buildingobjectives. The second theme is the keythrust to Develop competitiveinput

reforms fit within this group. The third theme i s Promoting widespreadand eficient

use, remove fertilizer supply constraints, and pilot soil fertility conservation

2.        Cross-CuttingIssues

I.SectorWorkisEssentialtoIncreaseProjectRelevance

2.1       TheNeedfor a Rural Strategy. Given Ethiopia's critical need for rural economic
growth it was particularly important that the government and the Bank have an effective
strategy for increasing agricultural productivity. The government, throughits Agricultural
Development-Led Industrialization strategy, placed agriculture at the center o f its
development. `The main means of carrying out the policy was the National Agricultural
ExtensionIntervention Program (para 1.10) and SSDP and NFSP were to be the
operational centerpieces o fthe program. Both the government and the Bank assumedthat
greater use of seed and fertilizer would provide a major boost to agriculturalproductivity.
Butthemeans to ensurethe effectivedelivery o fthese inputs, andthe needs and
implementationmodalities for other niral services required for agricultural growth, were
not comprehensively considered,

2.2       A Narrow Approach toRural Development. Lack of sector analysis was a
notable feature inthe Bank's approach to Ethiopia's rural sector untilnearly the mid-
~ O O O ' S .The CAS series reflects this. The 1995 CAS saw fertilizer and seed as
             ~
commodities, by themselves affecting productivity: "the expansion in the use of fertilizer
and improved seeds, supported by the IDAprojects beingpresented with this CAS,could
quickly bring about a visible increase in yields. As recently as the 2003 CAS there was

(recently closed) have set the stagefor productivity growthfor subsistencefarmers.                     "



2.3       A Historically WeakLending Program. The quality and size o fthe Bank's
portfolio o frural projects appears to mirror this limited strategic analysis. T n the 1980s, of
 10 completed rural projects, 7 were rated unsatisfactoryon outcome. After FY88, until
the SSDP and NFSP inFY96, no further rural sector projects were approved. The
Independent Evaluation Group's (IEG) F Y O 1 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) of
the Bank's program inEthiopia commented on the significant downturninthe rural
lendingprogram- from 44 percent of the Bank's projects in 1980-89to just 12percent in
1990-98.This was assessed to be a reflectionof the badproject experience inthe 1980s.

2.4       The scattered focus of the Bank's rural projects inEthiopiamight also be
questioned. Ruralprojects approved between FY82 to FY89 (there were no subsequent

9. The 2001PPAR onthe Peasant Agricultural DevelopmentProject commented: that sector work was
essentially confined to project preparation activities, and subsequently not used "Most Bank economic and
sector work i s carried out at headquarters as part ofproject preparation and is hardly ever used during
implementation to adjust project objectives and components inresponseto evolving country circumstances.
Thus, once appraised, the policy content ofprojects becomes moribund."

                                                      8


projects untilSSDP and NFSP) were a diversity of activities, eachperhaps covering it
need, but lacking inany discernible thrust. They covered a iura1bank, coffee processing,
agricultural research, forestry, irrigation, livestock and peasant agriculture. Taken overall,
they do not appear to represent a concerted drive to tackle Ethiopia's most critical
development issue -- the need for a major increase inrural productivity.

2.5      Much of the Bank's opercitional work in Ethiopia over thepast 20years had only
peripheral relevance to Ethiopia's ruralproductivity challenge. Theabsence of cin
articulated rural strategy substcintially contributed to this situation.

2.6      GoodRecent Initiatives. There has been a commendable increase instrategic
analysis byboth the Bank and government over the past two years. In2006 the
government issued its "PIan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to EndPoverty"
that included a morecomprehensive discussion o f plans for rural sector growththan in
the past (although what to do with the fertilizer and seed sub-sectors was not spelled out).
The Bank's sector analysis has also built up over the past two years." Bank documents
issued in2006 have included apolicy paper for pro-poor agricultural growth and a
backgroundpaper for a Country Economic Memorandum and an Interim CAS."

2.7      The translation ofthese policy documents into effective action is the new
challenge. This will not be easy. A number o f government officials and Bank staff
interviewed by TEG commented that the effective implementation o f new ideas has beena
major difficulty for Ethiopia. The findings o f this PPAR-especially                regardingthe lack
of success inbringingthe private sector into input markets-are                consistent with this
observation. SSDP and NFSP also illustratethat continual strategic evaluation is needed
duringprogram implementation to adjust the program as experience is gained. Hence, the
strong recent sector analysis by the government and the Bank is only the beginning of the
much needed strategic focus that should characterize the future development of
Ethiopia's rural sector.

11.Better CoordinationI s Needed

2.8      A feature o fthe two projects, inpractically every aspect and across all involved
parties, was a lack of inter-linkages and coordination; whether inconceptualization,
design or impiementation. This applied between the SSDP and NFSP; betweenthe two
projects and other sectors; within Government; and within the Bank. Government
agencies and Bank staff repeatedly drew the IEGmissian's attentionto these issues, and
the issues were also readily observable during field visits.

2.9      The Coordination Problem. Despite going to the Bank's Board o f Directors on
the same date, minimalreference is made in either appraisal report to the other project.
Neither report considered how the seed and fertilizer projects would harmonize their


10.The beginnings of this buildupare also evidentinthe completion reports for the SSDP andNFSP, both
of which include substantial strategic analysis.

activities and there was little discussion ofhow the two projects would engage with other
activities.- --such as agricultural extension, research, and credit--which would be needed
to ensure that agriculturalproductivity was increasedby the project activities.

2.10       The institutionalbase for the two sub-sectors reflects this. The umbrella agencies
for the two projects--the National Seed Industry Agency (NSIA) for the SSDP andthe
NationaI Fertilizer IndustryAgency (MIA) for the NFSP---had no institutional
linkages.       Likewise, coordination was not considered important betweenthe main
fertilizer importer, the government's Agricultural Input Supply Enterprise (AISE), and
the national seed supplier, the EthiopianSeed Enterprise (ESE). Had the seed-fertilizer
linkbeenrecognizedduringpreparation ofthe two projects, their institutions and
dimensions might have beenmore inharmony.13

2.11.      The lack o fcoordination between SSDP andNFSPcontinued throughout the
implementation period. The majority o f Bank supervisionmissions for the two projects did
not overlap. BankstaffinEthiopia reportedto IEGthat SSDP andNFSPwere seen as and
managedas entirely separate programs. This was corroboratedby former government
personnel connected with eachproject, The government staffwerejust as candid when
evaluating the degree ofcommunication fi-om the government side. They reported that formal
communication betweenSSDP andNFSP staffwas minimal, even though the management
teanis ofthe two projects were inthe same buildingand had good personal relations.

2.12       A large contributor to the coordinationproblem inEthiopia is the institutionaI
culture. Institutions are operating in"silos," communicating vertically from top to bottom
within an agency, but not horizontally across agencies. An additional factor in this
problem is atendency for centralized rather than localized decision making.

2.13        Consequences of Weak Linkages between Subsectors. As seed and fertilizer
were mostly not supplied together the impact of the agricultural extension program was
much reduced. Application o f fertilizer without improved seed has little yield impact and
may even reduce farm incornes.l4 The "seed gap" (the gap betweeneffective demand for


12. Linkages between agencies at the regional agricultural offices also appear to have been weak and may
have been as inyortant a need as for the umbrella agencies.
13. Resolving coordination problems does not necessarily require merging; but, simply, inter-linkages and
mutually beneficial cooperation to achieve conlmon goals. SSDP and NFSP involved separate institutions
and separate projects but this neednot have prevented close interaction between the agencies and projects.
What is important is to provide mechanisms, and to see that they are effective, where inter-linkages are
important. Examples from this PPAR include: (i)      extension and research to niutually informeach other o f
needs, results and experience, and the 1EG mission's field observations that this was not happening (para
2.14); (ii) seedand fertilizer distribution to be closely integrated; (iii) communication breakdown
                                                                         the
between ESE and research agencies noted in footnote 15; (iv) the need for soil testing to be linked withthe
extension system (Box 4); and (v) the largely successful coordination betweenNFIA, the PIU and regional
governments for fertiIizer distribution (para 3.19).
14. Improved seed andfertilizer should generaly be applied together to achieve significant impact, and
shouldbe supported by agricultural extension and research. Further, under Ethiopia's high-rbkclimate, use
o f fertilizer without improved seedhas little, and possibly negative, impact o n factor productivity and farm
incomes. As one government executive involvedwithNFSP commented, "Without seed, fertilizer
applicationis meaningless."

seed andproductiono f seed) mighthave received more attention ifthe necessary Iinkages
between the two inputs hadbeen given greater attention. Moreover, critical problems
mighthavebeen avoided, such as in coordination o fseedproduction betweenthe
Ethiopian Agricultural Research Instituteand ESE.l5Most importantly, the necessary
connectivity betweenrurai sector services was not there. The two inputprograms (seed
and fertilizer) could have been closely linkedand adjusted with a demand-responsive and
technically adapted extension and appliedresearch program. But this didnot happen.
Eachproject lost the opportunity for greater impact hadsuch natural synergies been
employed inharmony.

2.14      ThePotential Gainsfrom Improved Coordination. The coordinationproblem in
Ethiopia, aIthough unusually severe andparticularly acute inthe seed and fertilizer
subsectors and related services, has a positive side-it            presents a major opportunity for
improvement. Better connectivity between rural sub-sectors has the potential to unleash a
substantial increase in efficiency and productivity without significant increases in
investment or operational costs.

2.15      Recent developments inEthiopia are encouraging. The recently approved Rural
Capacity Building Project (FY06) is supporting a broader approach to rural development,
including linkages betweenagricultural research and extension. Senior extension and
research government officials inAddis Ababa were specifically targetingthe
coordination of rural services. What still has to happen, however, is to put these ideas into
effective practice, a goaI that has still not been reached at field levels.'6

2.16      Theenhancement of coordination between activities in the rural sector is an area
with likely highpay-off at low incremental cost. Hence, it would he a desirablefront-line
thrust in Ethiopia 's rural development program.

111.Liberalization of the Fertilizer Market Remains Unfinished

2.17      The core objective o fthe NFSP was to undertake policy reforms to promote a
competitive fertilizer market. The actual result was the reverse-the               private sector,
already operating ina concentrated and government-dominated market, was squeezed
out, and fertilizer importing and distributingbecame an exciusively governmentdomain.

2.18      The Fertilizer Market before the NFSP. At the beginning o f the 1990s there were
only two importerso f fertilizer: one private company andone government importer, the


15. Duringa field visit, an SSDP-financed cold storage room at a regionalbrancho f the Ethiopian
Agricultural ResearchInstitute (EARI) was found to have a broken air-conditioner; hence, it could not
hnction as a germplasmcenter. The germplasmandbreeder's seedthat EARIis charged withproducing
is the base for ESE's seedmultiplication. Despite the importance of the germplasm, and the quite modest
cost o f anew air-conditioner, actionto replace the equipment hadnot yet beentaken; suggesting a gap in
information and inthe prioritization o f activities and expenditures between agencies. Inthe ensuing
discussion, lateral communicationbetween departments at local levels was felt by regional staff o f the
various agenciespresent to need major improvement.
16. For instance, an extension teamniet by the nlission inthe fieldadvised that they hadminimal contact
with researchers(one conlment was "that only happensifyou have personal relations with a researcher");
althoughthe extension staff were keento see such linkages happen.

Agricultural Input Supply Enterprise (AISE). The private company was accounting for
about I 5 to 20 percent o f national fertilizer imports, with AISE importing the rest (Table

2.19     TheLi6eralizatiun Agenda. Tn response to the monopolistic government
domination of fertilizer importsprevailing at the beginningo f the NFSP, the Bank sought
policy adjustments that would enable more open competition. To "liberalize" the sector,
the following policy conditions were agreed under the NFSP credit:

       Elimination of all fertilizer price subsidies.
       Deregulationof retai1and wholesale prices.
       Cessation o f any direct or indirect subsidies to AISE.
       Equal access to foreign exchange for bothpublic and private sector importers.
       Equal access to any credits available for fertilizer importation and domestic
       marketing.
       Private sector representation on committees related to the implementation o f the
       NFSP.

2.20     At face value, these reforms would appear good features for open and fair
competition and this was the sentiment at the time. The NFSP's FAD states, "By the end
of the project period, it is envisaged that Ethiopia's fertilizer sector would have moved
from a state controlled to a largeIy liberalizedsystem with active participation o fprivate
sector importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers ina progressively competitive
price and trade environment."

                                                     12


 2.21      The project began with positive actions by the government, including
 implementation of the first two conditions and announcement o f the other new policies.
These steps were heralded by Bank and government policy makers as important
 achievements. The new policies were landmarks in stating the intention to pioneer
 deregulation toward a market-based economy. The reforms were also considered to
provide a practical example for other sectors to follow.

 2.22      TheRegression of Market Competition. Despite these reforms, however, the
 fertilizer sub-sector became less rather than more competitive under the NFSP, both at
the level o f wholesalers and retailers, and for importers."

        Thefertilizer wholesaling and retailing sector: Before the project there were about
        70 private sector wholesalers o f fertilizer and some 2,300 private retailers. Bythe
        end of the NFSP boththe wholesalers and retailers o f fertiIizer had virtually
        disappeared.
        Thefertilizer importing sector: At the beginning o f the NFSP (1996) there were five
        fertilizer importers: AJSE, two private firms, and two government affiliated trading
        houses. By the end of the project (2002) there were only two importers-AISE                    and
        one trading house-and       the private sector had left the market.

2.23       The Growth of Noncompetitive Markets. The reason for the reverse outcome was
the presence ofconstraints to development of a competitive market that hadnotbeen
foreseen at NFSP appraisal.

        GVholescxleand retail markets: The NAETPcreated an environment where private
        wholesalers and retailers could not compete with government distributed fertilizer
        provided on credit. Virtually all private wholesalers and retailers left the fertilizer
        business. This reversal of the intended outcome is salutary as it demonstrates the
        relatively higher level o f influence the enabling environment can have compared
        with project actions. Underthe NFSP, a commendablejob was done to provide
        extensive training of existing or prospective wholesaiers and retailers. Some 440
        retailers and over 4,000 staff from cooperatives were trained in fertilizer marketing.
        The project also started in a favorable situation, with growingprivate sector
        participation-following       issuance of the National Fertilizer Policy in 1992, by 1996
        the market expanded to about 70 private wholesalers and more than 2,300 retailers;
        but inthe ensuing several years the great majority closed down their fertilizer
        operations.

        The import market. The TEGmission foundthat stakeholders, decision makers, and
        irnplementers'' identified a number of issues that contributed to a non-level playing

18. A comment made to the IEGmissionwas that some analysis had found that the farm gate price o f
fertilizer inEthiopia was lower than the price inKenya. A paper by Jayne et a1confirms this, at least for
1999when the data was collected. However, a breakdown o f costs inthat same paper found that internal
marketing costs recorded for Ethiopia left out important costs bornpartially or totally by government, but
whichwere includedas part of costs for Kenyan importers and distributors. Ethiopia's hidden subsidies
included: no tax requirements, storage andbagging costs a fiaction o f Kenyan costs, financing costs halfof
Kenya's, and lower recordedtransport costs. (from "Fertilizer market development: a comparative analysis
o f Ethiopia, Kenya and Zambia" by T. S. Jayne, J. Govereh, M. Wanzala and M. Demeke, IFPRI, 2003)

         field inthe fertilizer import market. While the various parties differedon the
        degree, and sometimes even on the existence, of such constraints, most stated that
        more costly or onerous requirements had beenplaced on the private sector relative
        to the public sector.20The various constraints are detailed inBox 1.

 Box 1. Cited Contributorsto the Non-Level PlayingField for Fertilizer Importers

  0   HighcoIIateralrequirements:Collateralrequirements were I00percentor more for privatecompanies,
      whereas AISE and the trading houses were backedby guarantees from the central or regional governments, and
      collateral was either minimalor not required.
      Higher interest rates: The private sector had to pay rates o f 7-10percent whereas AISE paidlower or no
      interest.
      Unfavorable access to foreign exchange: Provisionof foreign exchange was less predictable and sometimes
      late for the private sector. A competitive importer need5 to be able to access foreign exchange immediately
      whenever itis necessary to take advantage o f short-tern1variations ininternationalprices.
      Less aecess to storagefacilities: Government warehousing was ownedby or provided to AISE, but was
      generally not available for private companies.
  0   Nationality restrictions: A private importer had to be either an Ethiopianor ajoint Ethiopiadforeign venture.
  0   Greater bureaucracy: Alleged to be more complicated for private f m s than for AISE.


 2.24       Completing the Liberalization of the Fertilizer Market. Although these
 constraints were a major barrier to market entry during the NFSP period, recent initiatives
 took more promising, A workshop to discuss how to bring inthe private sector was
organized by the government in October 2006 comprising representatives of all sector
 stakeholders, including the public sector, AISE, the cooperatives, the private sector, and
the trading houses. A number o f ideas to improve the environment for full competition
 resulted. Duringdiscussions with Ethiopia's National and Commercial Banks, the IEG
mission was informed of decisions about to be announced to reduce collateral, interest
rates, and service charges, most at uniform levels for all importers.

 2.25      While these steps appear to be inthe right direction, care will be needed to ensure
that these and other actions truly provide for equal treatment. For instance, under the
 October 2006 proposals, areduction inLetter of Credit guarantees has a zero percent
margin for "importers that have been inthe business for more than five years and have a

Ethiopia, Input Marketing Department, Ministryof Agriculture, AISE, private importers and wholesalers,
Chamber of Conmerce, NGOs and World Bank Staff. Reports from various sources were also reviewed, in
particular, the NFSPICR.
20. Government's comments on the draft PPAR inthemselves illustrate the difference of views that may be
found inEthiopia. Thus, inits comments, the Government states that ..... we would like to bring to your
                                                                               "
attention that issues cited in Box 1 as contributors to the non-level playingfield for fertilizer importers are
far from truth. Theseinclude higher interest rate, higher collateral requirement, unfavorable access to
foreign exchange, less access to storagefacilities and greater bureaucracy for private companies
compared withpublic enterprise. This is iiiconsistent with IEG's findings based on consultation with a
                                      "
broad spectrum of stakeholders (refer footnote above); the great majority, including the private sector and
Ethiopia's National and Commercial Banks, were inagreement on the niainconstraints. Further, the
ongoing discussions ledby Government on how to reduce such constraints (para.2.24) are a direct
recognition that the constraints exist.

proven track record.''2' Other importers presumably do not have this concession. This
couldmean that AISE has a zero margin,while a new private importer faces a more
costly situation.

2.26      Based on the lessons from the past, barriers to fair market competition are not
necessarily obvious. To complete liberalizationit would be important to continuously
monitor the fertilizer market to ensure the conditions needed for open competition and
private sector development. This could include holdingopen discussions on constraints
and any unfair practices as they occur and adapting marketingregulations and incentives
as experience i s gained. The effects o f sound market liberalization can be very positive
as Kenya's experience demonstrates, Box 2,

Box 2. Market Liberalization for Fertilizer - Kenya's Experience
Inthe nlid-1990s, Kenya liberalizedfertilizer policies, encouraging private sector participation and
eliminating explicit subsidies. In 1993, price controls on fertilizer were lifted and farmers came to rely
almost exclusively on the private sector and cooperatives for fertilizer. The private sector responded rapidly
to the new policy environment. By 2004, over 10major intporters, 500 wholesalers, amid roughly 8,000
retailers were distributingfertilizer. Kenya now has a competitive and dynanlic private sector fertilizer
distributionsystein, the average distance o f a farmer to a retailer has been halved to 4 kilometers, and
inland marketing and distributionmargins on fertilizer have fallen by 40 percent. Totai fertilizer
consumption increased from 28 1,000 tons per year in 1995 to 352,000 tons per year in 2005. The share of
smallholders using fertilizer increasedfrom 43 percent in 1995/96 to 69 percent in 2005/06. The presence
of a dense network o f small private dealers inKenya as the vehicle for input supply has resulted ina more
dynamic sector with significant benefits to farmers.

IV.Barriersto PrivateSeedProductionHaveExacerbatedthe "Seed
Gap"

2.27      Ethiopia's seed sector is dominatedby the public sector monopoly, the Ethiopian
SeedEnterprise. The ESEproduces some 90 percent of the country's seed that satisfies
only about 30 percent o f the country's effective demand, despite the institutional
strengthening providedunder the SSDP. Such a "seed gap", while its impact is not as
severe as might be implied,22will have contributed to the constraints holding up
Ethiopia's agricultural development. As inanumber of other countries, private sector
production and distribution o f seed may be able to fill this gap. For Ethiopia, this could
involve several areas o f activity: formal production by private firms, informal production
and distribution by farmers, andinthe wholesaling and retailing business.


21. Fromthe Minutes o f the Executive Management Committee o f the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia;
October 24,2006.
22. The term "effective demand" for seed means the demand ifnew seed is applied each year by farmers. In
practice, it is common for farmers using improvedseed to use their previous harvest as a source o f seed, for
possibly several years, before purchasing seed again. Yield potential will diminish for each season
following the season when fresh seed was used, but some positive impact will be present meaning that the
impact o f the seed gap will be less than the 70% shortfall that the effective demand figure might suggest.

2.28      Seed Production by Private Firms. There is only one private firm which is a
significant producer oseed - Pioneer. This was present when the SSDP began, and its
production has since grown appreciably (Box 3.) Pioneer has a number o f small private
firms it hires on a contract basis.23Seedproductionby the private firms is almost entirely
for hybrid maize, where the largest yield gains and profits can be made, and accounts for
about 5- I O percent ofnational seed 0utput.2~


Box 3. SuccessfulPrivate Sector Seed Production
The expansiono fPioneer Seed Conipany inthe seedproductionbusiness indicates thatpotential for greater
private sector participationexists and that entrepreneurs couId provide services as good as or better than
those of the government. Pioneer's annual production o f hybridmaize seed has increased from about 600
metric tons in the mid-1990s to 1,300 metric tons in2005. Pioneer distributes as well as produces seed and
provides accompanying technical advice. The firm's management advised the IEGmission that Pioneer
staff visit groups o f farmers several times a year. Seed quality appears to be good, despite a price for hybrid
maize seed about 40 percent above the ESE price; faimers were buying Pioneer seed because they found
that it give higher maize yields. However, Pioneer's success as a large firmhasnotbeen matchedby
significant market entry o f smaller firms, suggesting that barriers to entry may still remain orcontpanies
that cannot afford the initial investment inland and equipment.


2.29      The SSDP hadamodest impact on private sector seedproduction. Pioneer and
one of its contracted seed producers (Zeway farms) advised the TEG n3ission that the
government was generally helpfulinresolvingproblems. Further, the SSDP had
sponsored studies, training, and promotional activities for private sector participation.
There hasnot, however, been a significant surge in Ethiopia o fthe number o fprivate
firms involvedwith seed production -certainly not on the scale of that found inKenya
for fertilizer (Box 2), or inIndia where nearly all seed production i s private. Thus barriers
to market entry may still bepresent for smaller firms with limitedcapital.25

2.30      Informal Seed Production by Farmers. The SSDP was not successful inpromoting
informal seed productionby farmers. The original project design intended-through                        a
Secondary Seed Multiplication Scheme (SSMS)-that                    the final stage o f seed multipkation
wouldbebymoreprogressive farmers who would then sell the seed informally to other
farmers. Instead,just after the SSDP began, a new seed multiplication system was
introduced, replacingthe SSMS with a programdirectly controlled by ESEusingcontract
fmers. This program, the "Farmer BasedSeedProduction and Marketing System"
(FBSPMS), completely stopped any progress toward informal seedproduction, and also
meant that the quantity of seedproduced depended almost exclusivelyon ESE's capacity.




23. Inits comments?the Government states that there are mote than 30 registeredprivate seed growers
(Annex B).Most, however, are contracted growers for Pioneer and ESE.
24. Private seed production for traditional cereals such as tef may be muchless attractive.
25. The Government considers that entry barriers are primatily due to classic infant industry constraints: In
its comments, the Government states "The mainproblem standing in the way of creating a competitive
input market in Ethiopia is absenceor lack of capable (in terms of capital, experienceand
entrepreneurship)and committedprivate sector. Eforts are underway by Governmentto support thosewho
have interest andpassioii to engage in agricultural input business."

                                                   16


2.3 1     ESE's capacity constraint hasbeen a significant drag on agricultural productivity.
The SSMS can provide larger seed coverage than the FBSPMS as the final multiplication
and distribution system i s all done by fanners and i s not also constrained by government
distribution channels. While the FBSPMSreportedly produces better quality seedthe
SSMS couldhave supplemented this with substantial additional production.26

2.32     Private Wholesaling aridRetailing. The SSDP was also unsuccessfiil in
promoting privatewholesaling and retailing. Due to the NAEP's exclusive input-credit
package, they could not compete and withdrew from the market.

2.33     Ari Enabling Environment for thePrivate Sector wasNot Devetoped. Informal
seed productionby farmers didnot develop under the project, private wholesalers and
retailers left the market, and new seed businesses were not e~tablished.~'            Thus, there was
no progress towards SSDP's objective. Successftil seed sector privatization is feasible,
and, indeed, appears essential ifthe shortfall in seed productionis to be resolved.           *'
2.34      Based on the projects' experience, the following features appear to be neededto
create an enabling environment for a private seed sector inEthiopia:

        Removebarriers to private firms' entry into the seed business. As with the fertilizer
        sector, any "hidden" barriers need to be identified and removed.
        Ensure that input supply is de-linked from agricultural credit and agricultural
        extension to encourageprivate seedproducers, wholesalers, and retailers.
        For informal seed production by farmers, the SSMS could be reinstated, operating
        inparallel withthe FBSPMS.
        Financial incentives and other facilitating actions couIdbe considered.

V. Input Productivityis BeIow Potential

2.35     Both the government and the Bank saw increased usage o f fertilizer and improved
seed as central to the achievement o f increased agricultural productivity. Key questions
for evaluationtherefore are: (i)      didthe usageo fimproved seed and fertilizer increase? (ii)
what was the effect on productivity? and, (iii) can productivity hrther increase?
                                                      how

2.36     InputUsageunder the new Agricultural ExtensionProgram: A formidable
array of constraints need to be tackled inEthiopia ifthe fiill growthpotential o f the
agriculture sector is to be realized. These inctude the need for improved marketing,
access roads, credit, land, tenure security, technologies for enablingcultivation o f
marginal soils, liberalization of markels, agricultural extension, agricultural inputs, and
applied research.29Itwas serf-evidently beyondthe scope ofNFSP and SSDP to address

26. The IEGmission's visit witha contracted seedproducing farmer foundthat growing conditioilsare
monitoredcloselyby ESE staffand seed cleaningis better with ESE equipment.

 all ofthese constraints. However, three closely integrated elements are needed ifa
program to increase agriculturalproductivity is to be successful - agricultural extension,
 applied research, and the availability of improved seed, fertilizer, and other inputs.

 2.37     NFSPand SSDP supported improved agricultural extension (but without applied
research) throughNFSP contributionsto the financing of the National Agricultural
 ExtensionInterventionProgram. The NAEIP provided a "package" o f services to
 farmers, consisting of fertilizer and improved seed (to the extent that seedwas available),
credit, and agricultural extension. The inputs andcredit were distributedby the extension
 staff. Conceptually, the inclusiono f extension under the fertilizerheedprogram made
 sense, and marked the beginningo f a more comprehensive approach to the agricuItura1
 sector. However, several flaws inthe design and implementation o f the NAEIP reduced
 its impact and the impact of the two projects:

        Soils and farmer needs are highly variable in Ethiopia, requiringagricultural
        practices and inputstailored to local conditions (Box 4). Yield potential was thus
       reduced under NAEiP's "one-size-fits all" package approach.
        Because o f the rigid one-formula combination of the type and quantities of fertilizer
        and seed applied, this still meant that the beneficial synergies from mutually
        supportive, flexible and demand-responsive services were only partially achieved;
        The extension staff, substantially occupied with their input and credit distribution
        responsibilities, had little time left for their intended advisory functions.30
        The lack of linkages between seed and fertilizer continued.


Box 4. Moving Beyondthe "Package"-Demand-Responsive                             Soil Testing                  I
Inthe view ofseveral senior extensionandresearch staffencounteredbythe IEGmission, the soiltesting
laboratories, currently being used for mapping, hadthe potential to offer a more demand-responsive
service. Soil testing could, for a modest fee, be requestedby a farmer (or group o f farmers) onh s own
fields to determine the exact fertilizer balance best suitinghis holding. The potential impact on productivity
and farmer incomes could be significant as phosphate requirements are quite variable. Inthe case o f soils
with a low phosphate requirement, the farmer could reduce phosphate application and make a significant
saving relative to his costs ifhe had followed the standard NAElP fertilizer recommendation. Alternatively,
inphosphate-deficient soils, higher phosphate applications mightachieve better net returns than fromthe
standard recommendation.     '
                                                                                                               I


2.38      The impact ofthe NAEP and the two projects on the usage of fertilizer and
improved seed was muchbelow expectations. Annual input usage has beenhighlyerratic

distribution, ranging from minima1to nearIy the total time. Based onthe mission's discussions, between 30
and 60 percent mightbe a reasonabk assessment. However, impact on the time for extension advice may
have beenless than these figures imply, as inputdistribution is mainly done before the crop season.
31. Inits comments, the Government states that recent initiatives already embody this more soil-specific
approach. Based on a soil acidity study, lime applications are being tried on farmers' fields, andit is
intended to make the soil and seed testing laboratories fully operational.

Sources and Notes: Seed data from ESE (excludes private sector production). Fertilizer data from Input
Marketing Data, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development Seed distributed and fertilizer imported are
each taken as proxies for usage. The project Years are shaded grey.

2.39     Constraints to Greater InputUsage: Several factors constrained increased
usage o f seed and fertilizer:

0    Under the NAlEP, linkage o f fertilizer and seed sales with credit meant that farmers
     needed to reimburse the previous year's credit before they could get more credit,
     fertilizer, and seed.
     For fertilizer, the government had limited foreign exchange that it could provide for
     imports  .
     ESEwas not able to meet the effective demand for seed.
0    Farmers get only a modest incremental profit by using a single agricultural input
     (such as fertilizer without improvedseed, or vice versa). Yet the combined use of
     fertilizer and improved seed is the exception rather than the norm amongEthiopian
     farmers because o f the highlyvariable rainfall that causes farmers to be risk averse.



32. There are significant differences indata on seed and fertilizer usage depending on source, and such
differences are also manifest inthe literature concerning the seed and fertilizer sectors, includingBank
reports. The data presented here is from the original sources-ESE        for seed and IMDfor fertilizer. The
ESE data excludes seed producedby the private sector, a relatively small share (about 5-10 percent o f
overall production).

                                                          19


      incremental retuins needto be significant to makeup for the extra risk, with an
      obvious implication regardingthe advantage o fusing inputs incombination.

2.40                  Impacts on Agricultural Productivity: Viewpoints o fthe impact on agricultural
productivity of the NAEIP and its associated inputs were quite ~ariable.'~The
uncertainties arise from the lack of disaggregated field data that allow comparison o f
yields from improved and unimproved agri~ulture.~`~ the last several months,
                                                                     35 In
however, disaggregated crop data for the 2005/06 crop seasonhas become available from
the Central Statistical Agency.36

2.4 1                 Demonstrationand farmers' yields provide some indication ofNAEIP's potential
and actual impact compared with traditional farming:

           Under NAIEP demonstration conditionsthe yield impact of fertilizer and seed when
           applied together shows a two- to three-fold yield increase compared with traditional
           practices (Table 4.)
           Under farming conditions yields o fNAEP farmers are 20 to 30 percent higher than
           those o ftraditional farmers.

2.42                  With data for only one crop season, caution i s needed ininterpretation.
Nevertheless, an increase inyields through NAElP i s consistent with the views o f
government officials interviewed by TEG. The general view was that NAIEP, for which
seed and fertilizer are the major features, has made a yieId difference. One commentator


33. Views o f NAEIP's inlpact tended to be more positive from government sources, but considered with
greater caution inthe Bank.
34. Even where disaggregated, measurement reflects the combined impact o f all inputs and improved
agronomic practices. AttribPlting productivity changes solely to one input would not take account o f the
other inputs and ofother influencing factors. Nevertheless, the combinedproductivity impact o fthe
NAEP, wherein the seedand fertilizer programs were key elements, is a usefulyardstick.
35. At the national level, average Ethiopian cereal yields have remained largely stagnant over time. For the
more limited purpose o f assessinghow NAEIP farmers have fared compared with traditional farniers: the
data has limited utility.A number o f variables are at play here, and NAEIP's specific inipact on
productivity cannot be deduced fiom such aggregate data.
36. The description of the two farm types inCSA's dissaggregation is "households that are and that are not
participants of [the] extension program" Thus, extension programparticipants are a proxy rather than an
exact interpretationo fthe term "NAEIP farmers" used inthis PPAR.

also drew attention to changes noticeable inthe countryside: where NAIEP was present,
there was a greater prevalence o ftin rather than thatched roofs.

2.43    The NAEIP's Limitations.Eventhough it hada positive impact on the
productivity of the farmers participating inthe program, NAIEP was ablunt instrument
for increasing agriculturalproductivity. Itwas a supply-driven "one size fits all"
program; it made very incompleteuse o fthe synergies available fkom flexibly
coordinating applied research, extension and the two project inputs together, and the
impact of the NAEIP couldhave been substantially greater.

2.44    Much of the cause lay within the evolving political environment (para 1.6.)
Multiple actions were neededto move the nation's rural sector forward, development
experience was limited, and institutional networks were rudimentary at best. In the words
of two senior government officials: "the extension service was the only network available
to distribute inputs...we didn 't have anything else and "Eveything wus new to us
                                                           ))

then-everything was an experiment."

2.45    Significant change is now occurring. As part o f the Plan for Accelerated and
Sustained Development to EndPoverty(PASDEP), the government has targeted the
extension system for major improvement. Additional agricultural colleges are being
established, starting educational levels o f extension staff are rising, and a concerted drive
i s underway to recruit and train additional agents to increase the density of the extension
network. The objective is to go from 1,500 farmers per agent to about 800 farmers and
possibly lower. Extension agentshave mostly been divested o ftheir input supply
functions, which are increasinglybeingtaken over by cooperatives. Senior agricultural
extension and research staff also briefed the mission on their hopes of improving
research-extension linkages. The number o f technicalpackages usedby the extension
service i s also beingincreased. How successful these initiatives will be remains to be
seen, but the plans appear inthe right direction, providingthat the PASDEP emphasizes
demand-driven approaches.

IEGcriteria. Table 6 provides the projects' objectives, theratings ofrelevance, efficacy and

efficiency, and outcomes. To facilitate comparison betweenthe projects-theobjectives are
grouped under the three themes: (i) Institutionalstrengthening; (ii) Developingcompetitive
markets includingthe privatesector; and (iii)   Promotingwidespread and efficient input use.

Relevance

3.2      Relevance of Project Objectives. The two projects addressed Ethiopia's
overarching rural development need. Effective use of fertilizer andimprovedseed could
significantly change agricultural production functions, boosting agricultural productivity
to a substantiaIIy higher plane.

3.3      The 2006 InterimCAS and the government's "Planfor Accelerated and
Sustained Development to End Poverty" (October 2005)emphasized the need for a rural
growth strategy focused on agricultural productivity. The Interim CAS also considered
buildingprivate seedand fertilizer markets to be the main agricultural priority. Increasing
agricultural productivitywas also highlightedin the 1995 CAS presentedto the Board
along with the SSDP and NFSP.The importance o f seed and fertilizer was also
recognized, althoughthe two inputs tended to be described inisolation rather than linked
with other services. Given the consistent (and appropriate) priority placed on agricultural
growth andthe seed and fertilizer sectors, the "overall objective'' of each project had
substantial relevance.

Relevance of Project Designs.

3.4      Shortcomings in theprojects 'designs, and in their inzplementution, substarttially
impaired achievements.

3.5     Institutionul strengthening. The corresponding sub-objectives for both projects,
the strengthening ofinstitutions and humanresources; and for SSDP also the
restructuring of ESE - were highly relevant. But, inthe projects' detailed designs,
institutionallinkages were not established betweenSSDP and NFSP and with other actors
inthe rural sector (paras 2.8 to 2.12). Overall relevance ofthe institutional sub-objectives
ofboth projects is thus rated substantial.

3.6     Developing Competitive Markets and Including the Private Sector. Moving away
from monopolistic government supplyi s central to effective supply o f inputs, and the
relevance of the projects' sub-objectives at approval is rated as high. But not all
constraints were considered (Box 1, paras 2.23 - 2.29.) Eventhen the efficacy o f these
sub-objectives were undercut by government policies and actions independent of the
components and their relevance declined throughout implementation to negligible. This
could have beenaddressedat mid-tern review but it was not.

3.7     Promoting Widespreadand Eficient Input Use: This group of objectives most
directly responded to Ethiopia's ruralproductivity challenge. However, revisions inthe
design o f the input supply and agricultural extension system at the beginning o fthe projects
through NAEIP reduced achievement. The relevance of the design was modest for both
projects. The one exception was the objective to promoteinitiatives to improve long-term
soil fertility. This is a clear need, and the NFSP's design enabled its achievement (para
3.16). Relevance was high.

Efficacy

InstitutionalStrengthening

3.9       SSDP. Thepredominant emphasis of the SSDP and 70 percent ofproject costs
was institutional and human capacity building. The main institutional objectivewas to

restructure and decentralize the ESEto create a commercially-oriented agency. The
mission found some successwith this: ESE's six regional centers have substantial
autonomy, thoughthe decentralization programi s not yet complete. The ESE's financial
situation is satisfactory-it       has consistently made a profit, including inthe years after the
project. There has been substantial training, and field facilities and equipment have been
augmented. This included upgradingof all ESEprocessing plants and a six-fold increase
incapacity for seedquality testing. The SSDP's other institutionalobjective was for
capacity buildingmore generally. Under its corresponding project component other seed
sector agencies were strengthened through training and additional equipment, especially
the National SeedIndustryAgency.37`The efficacy o f SSDP with its two institutional
strengthening objectives was substantia1.

3.10     NFSP. The institutional strengthening objectiveofthe NFSP was alsosubstantially
achieved. The newNational Fertilizer IndustryAgency (NFIA), several departments of the
Ministry of Agriculture, the National Soil ResearchCenter, the EthiopianQuality and
StandardsAuthority, andtheregionalagriculturalbureaus were all strengthened through
provisiono f equipment, technical assistance, workshop^,^* and amajor training program.
There were 151local trainingprograms, and various study tours and international training
courses. Inall, over 6,000 personsparticipated inNFSP training.

Developing Competitive Markets and Including the Private Sector
3.11     SSDP. The SSDP was to develop the "informal" seed sector and encourage entry
o f the private sector inthe formal seedproduction and marketingbusiness.

3.12     Informal seedproduction and sales. This objective became automatically
unattainable at the beginningo fthe project period whenthe government decided, with the
Bank's acquiescence, to replace the original design of the component (the SSMS, which
informalIy involvedfarmers in seed production and marketing) with the entirely
differentIy designed FBSPMS {paras 2.30 to 2.34), exclusively managed by ESE.The
ESEbecame the only significant seedproducer inthe country, but could not satisfy the
country's seed requirements. 'The opportunitycost o f the resultant foregone yield increase
i s likely to be substantial. Hence, the efficacy of SSDP's informal seed sector objective
was negligible.

3.13     Privnte wholesalers and retailers. Under the NAEIP, private sector seed had to be
sold without credit, and without assistance of the extension system. Giventhese
disadvantages, private distributors could not compete with the public sector and closed
down. The project's impact was negative.



37. The Institute for Biodiversity Conservation and Research, the EARI, Alemaya Agricultural University,
and the National Variety Release Committee also benefited. Additionally, a seed regulation system was
establishedin 1997 and a seed certification agency in 2000.
38. A highly positive initiative under the NFSP was the holding ofannual workshopsto discuss policy issues.
These hadwide participation acrossthe fertilizer sub-sector, including the governmentagencies,regional
agricultural bureaus,NGOs,the private sector, andothers.However, at the level of government decision

  3. I4      Private seedproducers. The SSDP sponsored studies, training, and promotional
  activities for private sector participation. However, private seed production is still
  primarily from one firm, and contributes only 5 to 10percent o f nationalproduction
  (paras 2.27 to 2.29) A notable increase inprivate sector seed productionhas not occurred,
  hence, efficacy is rated modest. Taking account o f both private seed producers and
  private wholesalers/retailers, the efficacy o f SSDP's privatizationobjective i s rated
  negligible.

  3.15       NFSP supportedpolicy reformsaimed at creatingan enabling environment for
  growth of a competitive fertilizer sector. The "liberalization" agenda was intended to
  provide a "level playingfield" for open competition both at the wholesale and retail level
. as well as for fertilizer imports. The reforms were all implemented, but a number of other
  constraints to open competition were not identified. Given that the opposite ofwhat was
  intended happened-the fertilizer import sector became a government monopoly; and the
  majority o fprivate wholesalers and retailers closed their fertilizer operations---efficacy i s
  rated negligib6e.

  Promoting Widespreadand Efficient Inprtt Use
  3. I 6     Promotion of efficient and environmentally safe use offertilizers. This objective
  was centralto the overarching goal to increase agricultural productivity.39,40 It was to be
  supported by a component inNFSP to help strengthen agricultural extension activities.
  This couldbenefit bothprojects, though such mutual interactions were not articulated in
  the project appraisal reports. The original component design was straightforward--
  strengthening the existing extension service, usingdemonstration mini-kitsof fertilizer
  on farmers' fields, and leaving fertilizer to be sold to farmers by the existing and growing
  private retailer network, with initial trainingprovided to the retailers. A telling gap,
  however, was that the mini-kitsincluded fertilizer, but not improved seed.

  3.17       The de facto absorption ofthis coniponent by the NAEW shortly after project
  effectiveness meant a substantial alteration indesign. The NAIEP's "package" approach,
  providinga "one-size-fits all" combination o f fertilizer, seed, and credit, all distributedby
  the extension service, had a number of drawbacks (para 2.37). These included the rigidity


  39. This was specifically stated as an objective for the NFSP. The SSDP didnot specifically articulate a
  corresponding objective, and didnot have a supportiiig project component, but the same intent is clear in
  the SSDP's overall objective. That was, in common with the NFSP's overaIl objective and stated inboth
  appraisal documents-to    increase "agricultural proditccioon-andproductivify." The combined impact of the
  two projects was the key need. Hence, the SSDP's contribution to increasing agricultural production and
  productivity is also assessedhere.
  40. It wouldprobably not have beendesirable for bothprojects to support such activities as agricultural
  extension. The needwas that: (i)agricultural extension (and other closely linked services such as applied
  research) should be supported by some program, as an integral part o f the national program to increase
  agricultural productivity; and (ii)
                                    that agricultural extension be in synergy with input supply. inthe case o f
  the fertilizerheed programs, the decisionthat one, but only one, o f the projects shouldprovide extension
  services was appropriate. Agricultural extension was not well developed at that time, and the extension gap
  needed to be filled. Itwould have been desirable, however, for the NFSP appraisal report to have reviewed
  how the project's extension program fitted inwith the national agricultural extensioniresearch program, and
  withSSDP.The SSDPappraisal exercise would simiIarly havebenefited from consideration o fsuch
  complementary needs.

                                              25


o f the technica1 foimula, thus forgoing the potential benefits o f a more adaptive and
demand-responsive extension system; and the demands of input supply, rather than
advisory activities, inan extension agent's time, leaving little time for his advisory
functions.

3.18     Nevertheless, the NAEIP had some impact on agricultural productivity (para
2.42). The yields for NAEIP farmers increased, but yields could have beenhigher with an
improved NAEIP design. For both projects, efficacy was positive, but is ratedmodest
reIative to potential.

3.19     Removal of mainfertilizer supply constraints. This objective was to ensure that
fertilizer was distributedto reach farmers in the quantities needed and at the time needed.
The NFSP's ICR states that the percentage o f farmers complaining o f late fertilizer
delivery dropped substantially---from about 75 percent in 1995 to 30 percent in 2001.
The coordination activities of the NFIA and Project CoordinationUnit were at the heart
o f this success. The efficacy of this objective is ratedsubstantial.

3.20     TheNFSP's Fiscal Support Agenda. The NFSP's component to address supply
side constraints was accompanied by major financial support for fertilizer imports.
Project expenditure on fertilizer amounted to over $400 million, with IDA funding
$125.4 million, or 95 percent o f total IDA disbursements.

3.21     The apparent rationale for these financial transfers was balance o fpayments
support, a critical needfor Ethiopia. The question arises, however, as to why an
investment project was used as the vehicle for such financial support rather than a
Structural Adjustment Credit or other balance o f payments support project. The less
conventional choice o f the NFSP for such financial transfers riskedperpetuating market
inefficiencies. Bank experience i s that inconcentrated markets such as Ethiopia's
fertilizer import sector, prices are higher than the prices resultingfrom open competition.

3.22     Promotion of itiitiatives to improve the long-term fertility of soils. The
component supportingthis objective was implemented by the National Soil Research
Center (NSRC) andwas highly successful. Indigenous organic fertilizers were piloted and
were subsequently manufactured by a private firm; rhizobium-based bio-fertilizer was
also successfully piloted; and 17 soil testing laboratories (Box 4) were established.

3.23     Overall Efficacy of SSDP and NFSR BothSSDP andNFSP were successful in
their institutionstrengtheningobjectives, although impact couldhavebeengreater had
intersectoral linkages beenbetter. Neither project fulfilled its objectives to create
competitivemarkets includingprivate sector participation. There were no additionalprivate
seedproducers, andprivateimporters and distributors of fertilizer left the market.
Promotion ofinput use andproductivity made some progress under the NAEIP,but less
than wouId have beenpossible with amore demand-responsive extension and research
programinterlinkedwith the inputs.NFSP's soil fertility pilot programwent well, but was
very small.

                                                         26


3.24     The overall efficacy of SSDP is rated modest because, although SSDP's
achievement o f competitivemarkets was minimal, it hadsome successwith its primary
objectiveto strengthen the sector's institutional capacity.

3.25     NFSP's overall efficacy is rated negligible as it fdiled to create competitive
markets. Further, over 90 percent o f NFSP's project costs were for fertilizer imports.

Efficiency

3.26     SSDP. Without a tangible base for measuringbenefits, reliable estimation ofan
ERR isnot feasible. Instead, the efficiency o fthe SSDP has to beprimarily assessed
against the achievement o f its dominant objective-institutional                 development and
capacity building-which          comprised 70 percent ofproject expendit~res.~'Although a
competitive input market includingprivate sector participationwas not established, the
ESE and other public sector seed institutions were strengthened. Taking account o f
SSDP's institutional achievements but minimal achievement promoting the private
sector, overall efficiency is rated modest.

3.27     NFSP.There would have been some net benefits from the combinedeffect o fthe
incremental fertilizer made available under NFSP and the impact on productivity of its
application throughthe NAIEPpackage. The lCR estimated an economic benefit-cost
ratio for NFSP o f 3.6 (an ERR was not calculated). While the reliability o f data is
uncertain, a positive benefit-cost ratio can be expected, though likely Iower than this
value, as the actual incremental yields from fertilizer applicationmay havebeen smaller
than assessed at project ~ornpletion.~~The cost-effectiveness o f the N A E l P package was
low relative to what could havebeen achieved. Giventhis, the NFSP's efficiency i s rated
modest.

Outcome

3.28     Boththe SSDP and the NFSP were broadly relevant to Ethiopia's critical need to
increase agriculturalproductivity. But both projects had design and implementation
weaknesses, especially with regard to the competitive market and productivity
enhancement objectives. The SSDP made no headway developingan informal seed
production sector, and onlymodest impact in its private sector objectives. UnderNFSP,
the fertiIizer import market became more rather than less concentrated. The NFSP made a


41. The ICR appropriately emphasized the institutional development nature o f the project, and questioned
the reIevance of attempting to calculate an ERR, as had been done at appraisal. However, it assessed that if
an ERR was recalculated it might be negative if the institutiona1benefits were not included. IEGagrees
with the ICR's key point-the     need to focus on the project's institutional achievements. But attempting to
quantify benefits for this particular project is difficult, even more so given the uncertain data available.
Giventhis, the results o f any ERR calculation that includes all SSDP costs but excludes benefits fromthe
70 percent o f expenditures allocated to institution building has limitedutility. Inthese circumstances, the
effectiveness of SSDP expenditures is a better measure of efficiency.
42. According to some sources (Ethiopia, Accelerating Equitable Growth, Country Economic
Memorandum, 2006, chapter on the rural sector, World Bank), the viability o f fertilizer application can be
marginal and inpoor-yield years returns can be negative. This underscores the importance o f applying
technologies withgreater demand-responsiveness (and yield impact) than the NAEIPhas to date.

positivecontribution to the extension activities o f the NAEIP, but the rigidities o f the
NAEP resulted inlower productivity enhancementthan might havebeenpossible. The
projects also supplied the two primaryinputs for the NAEIP, hence contributing an
"enabler" role for its continuation. Inmanagement and practically all activities, each
project operated in a silo, with minimal connections between themand with other related
agricultural services. Bothprojects had some successwith their institutional objectives,
butthis couldhave been larger ifthere hadbeenbetter connectivity.

3.29     The overall outcome for the SSDP is rated moderately unsatisfactory, compared
with ratings inthe ICR and ICR Review o f satisfactory and moderately unsatisfactory
respectively.

3.30     The NFSP's overall outcome is rated unsntisficctoty, the same as inthe ICR and
ICR Review.

3.3 1 The primary reason for this assessment's lower rating for the NFSP than for the
SSDPis the particular importance o fNFSP's objective to create a competitivemarket,
andthe highly disappointing result. Creatinga competitivefertilizer market was the
fulcrum ofNFSP, while, for SSDP, institutional development was the primary goal.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

3.32     For both SSDP and NFSP institutional deveIopment is the most vuherabie
objective. The capacity o fthe ESE, Input Marketing Department, and other specialized
institutions strengthened under NFSP and SSDP will erode with staff turnover. 43
Nevertheless, despite significant staffturnover already, the agencies o f bothprojects are
conlinuing to function. A second risk might be shortfalls ingovernment fbndingo f the
agencies. However, some annual provisions have been provided inthe past, even in
difficult years.

3.33     The minimal achievement indevelopment ofcompetitivemarkets only provides
opportunity to change for the better. There is also good opportunity for improving the
NAEIP, and the government and the Bank have already taken some actions inthe
extension and research fields. Notwithstanding, the key consideration i s that substantial
improvements across most objectives are required to make the projects' outcomes
satisfactory. Thus the risks o f not achieving a satisfactory development outcome remains
significant for both projects.




43. Bothprojects have been affected by the government's practice of frequent rotations of staff between
departmentsand agencies. One source commented that, only four years after NSFP was closed, the
majority ofproject staff had transferred to other departments.The headsof other agenciesmetheld sinnlar
views regarding their institutions. A highstaffturnover rate is a general problem inmany countries.But the
mission observedthat inEthiopia the issue i s particularly acute. Resolution ofthis problem would clearly
be desirable. However, as concernsthe SSDP and NFSP, the project institutions are continuing to function,
although capacity would be better witha lower staff turnover.

                                             28


Project Monitoring

3.34    Monitoring and Evaluution. The key weaknesses inthe projects' M&E systems
were that strategic objectives were not monitored, despite the high strategic content o f
bothSSDP andNFSP.This gap applied for all aspectsof M&E---design, implementation,
and utilization.

3.35    Design. BothSSDP andNFSP developed data collection andreporting systems
that could track physical progress (such as fertilizer and seed distributed, training courses
arranged, and equipmentpurchased), and the mission found adequate data o fthis nature
both at regional and national levels. A basic management information system (MIS) was
thus established for bothprojects. But the monitorableindicators and the results
frameworks ofbothprojects contained very little to enable the measurement o f policy
and strategic achievements, inparticular, their impact. For instance, the part o f the
logframe for NFSP that was intended to assess the results o f fertilizer reforms only
referredto the agreed policy announcements or actions. All were achieved, and are duly
recorded as such, but the intended effects o f the reforms were not.

3.36    Implementation. Basic data collection (MIS) was satisfactory. Field surveys
investigating matters such as farmer views on seed and fertilizer use, yields, and incomes
under different technologies and input quantities, and on how inputs and input services
could be improved, would also have been useful.

3.37    Utilization. M&E utilization for SSDP and NFSP was a product o fthe type o f
information and analysis that the M&E systems provided. Several agency managers in
both sectors acknowledged the usefulness o f the largely MIS-type data, which i s still
beingregularly collected. However, the near absence o f more qualitative and impact-
oriented M&E, would have likely added to the orientationof the impIementers of both
projects toward physical targets rather than strategic objectives.

3.38    Rating. Overall, while development and usage o f the MIS systems were good
achievements, the inadequacies regardingthe M&Eof strategic objectives and outcomes
significantly pull down the quality o f M&E. For bothprojects, M&Ei s rated modest.

Safeguards

3.39    Safeguard compliance,fiduciary compliance, and unintendedpositivehegative
impacts. There were nusignificant negative safeguard issues for either project. There
were several minor positive impacts relative to Ethiopia's severe land erosion and soil
degradation problems. The NFSP's Soil Fertility Management and Environment
Conservation component successfully piloted use o forganic fertilizers and bio-fertilizers,
and introduced soil testing laboratories to improve nutrientrecommendations for different
soils. The SSDP provided funding to the Institute for Biodiversity Conservationand
Research, enabling better preservation of genetic resources.

3.40    Fiducialy compliance. Under SSDP there were 12 audits each of ESE and NSIA.
All reportswere acceptable. There was one qualification concerning an accounting
discrepancy for NSIA in 1999 of $177,475. Late receipt o f audit reports was a problem:

                                                  29


 five of ESE's audit reports were late by over three months, and another four were late but
by lessthanthree months. There are no outstanding special opinions. Under NFSP, NFIA
had 14audits, all of which were acceptable. There was one special opinionregarding a
transfer o f $50,000to NFIA's operations account, and misprocurenient was declaredon
one contract of $76,000, which was thus made ineligible for Bank financing. Ten audits
were received late, but all by Iess than 3 months.

BankPerformance

SSDP

3.41       Quality at Entry. Project preparation was strong in technical aspects and the
design o fthe SSDP's components provided potential for achievingthe project's overall
objective to "lay the foundation for the development o f a broad-based and competitive
seed industry.,' The mainweakness was the absence of institutionaland operational
linkages betweenthe SSDP and NFSP, and with their agricultural service cousins----
extension and research.This justifies the ratingo f moderately satisfactory on quality at
entry.

3.42       Quality ofBank Szrpewision. Supervision missions had staff strength in
technical, procurement, and other operational areas, but spategic thinking was limited,
and outcome focused M&E was not established. The Bank acquiesced to the
government's replacement o fthe SSMS by the very different FBSPMS, without critical
analysis o fwhat this would mean---the end o f the informal seed sector. Another strategic
issue was the demise of seed retailers and wholesalers because of the NAIEP. The
NAEIP could have beenredesigned to reduce such negative impacts.44Also, only modest
effort was applied to encourage private sector seed production. The mid-term-review was
not used for a major rethink o f the project. Supervision is rated unsatisfmtory.

3.43       Considering the Bank's performance both at project design and during
implementation, the Bank's overall performance for SSDP is rated moderatezy
zrnsatisfactory. The ICR and ICR Review ratedthe Bank's performance as unsatisfactory.

NFSP

3.44       Quality at Entry. The Bank performedmuchbetter than it did for SSDP in
definingthe NFSP's overall concept and development objectives. The Bank also had a
stronger strategic orientation duringproject preparation, emphasizing market
liberalization, and was firm in insistingthat new policies for liberahation o f the fertilizer
sector were declared prior to commencement o fthe project. However, two issues bring
down this otherwise good performance. First, the additional barriers to market entry by
the private sector were not comprehensively identified. Second, the NFSP was not an
ideal vehicle for what was effectively amajor foreign exchange transfer program-
through the mega-financing of fertilizer imports. A more suitable financing vehicle for


44. For instance,provision ofcredit under the NAEIP could have beenfor all inputs whether through the
government systemor purchasedfromprivate vendors. (This observation applies to both seed and
fertilizer.)

                                                30


foreign exchange transfers, such as a StructuralAdjustment Credit, could have been
chosen, especially given the price inefficiencies likely to have characterized this market.
Given these issues, the NFSP's quality at entry was moderately unsatisfactory.

3.45     Quality of Bank Supervision. Project supervision was thorough with a balance of
disciplines including inmanagement, policy, and institutional areas. But the Bank's
actions to address the key fertilizer importing, wholesaling, and retailing issues that
developed under the project were ineffective. Efforts appear to have been made by
supervision missions to address these issues. However, the bottom line i s that the
fertilizer market became less rather than more liberalized. Senior-level dialogue with the
government on marketingpolicy appears to have only beguninOctober 2000, when a
high-level workshop was held.This was four and a halfyears after the project's
effecti~eness.~~Even the workshop was ineffective; it was decided that studies wouldbe
undertaken, after which more comprehensive actions would be taken.

3.46     Another concern is the project's rating. Other than inthe second supervision
mission, all ImplementationProgress and Development Objective performanceratings
are graded "satisfactory." This may have contributed to the apparent lack o f urgency
characterizing the Bank's focus on the project's strategic issues. An M&E system to
monitor outcomes and strategic issueswas not established. The mid-term-review did riot
result inmajor changes to a project that needed significant revamping. Supervision
performance is rated unsatisfactory. The Bank's overall performance for NFSP is also
rated unsatisfactory, the same rating as assessedby the ICR and the ICR Review.

Borrower Performance

SSDP

3.47     Government Performance. The government's commitment to the SSDP was
strong. Duringproject preparation it developed a new market-oriented seed policy.
Duringimplementation it financed the project's recurrent costs to enable more IDA funds
for investment (though substantial IDA funds remained at credit closure); and seed sector
financing has been continued after SSDP's closure. However, during implementation,
strategy received only limited attention, which contributed to the project shortfalls in
achieving its objectives, especially regardingmarket liberalization. Monitoring was weak,
and problems such as the unintended impacts from the redesigned seed production
program, were not effectively addressed. Overall, the government's performance was
moderately unsatisfactory.

3.48     mplementing Agency's Performance. The performanceofthe implementing
agencieswas moderately satisfactory. The main institutions involved, NSIA and the ESE,
performedreasonably well, especially intheir institutional achievements. Nevertheless,
these agencieswere most directly in contact with the project's policy issues, and strategic
attention could have beenbetter. Taking the performance ofthe government and o fthe
implementingagencies together, the borrower's overall performance for the SSDP was


45. Inits comments, the Regionstatesthat Bank supervisionmissionstried to organize such senior-level
dialogues prior to the October 2000workshop.

                                              31


moderately unsatisfactory. The ICR and ICR rated borrower performance as satisfactory.
The downgrade is due to a closer examination inthe PPAR o fperformance against the
project's strategic objectives.

NFSP

3.49    Government Performance. The government's commitment was strongduring
project preparation. The new policy for the fertilizer sector, and the announcement or
implementation o f the policy actions as agreed with the Bank were done before
commencement of the project (although additional policy changeswere eventually
needed).

3.50    The government's performance during project implementation was much weaker.
The side-effects of the NAEP's package extension approach were not addressed. Most
importantly, the government was the most direct actor, and clearly had the most
responsibility, for implementation of the reforms inthe fertilizer import market, but the
constraints were not addressed. This failure effectively annuls the very positive policy
reforms made duringpreparation. The government's overall performance was
unsatisfiicto?y.

3.5 1   Implementing Agencies Performance. The NFIA, the Project Coordination Unit,
                                 '
the regional Implementation Coordination Units, and the NSRC were, inmost respects,
good implementers of the project's physicaltargets. The most deleterious performance
area was, as for the government, the lack of attention to overall sector performance and
progress against the project's objectives. While the government was the senior policy
maker, the implementing agencies were closest to the ground; yet there appears to have
been quite limited attention to the issues, to monitoring, and to provision o f information
and analysis to the government. Overall, the performance o f the implementing agencies
could beconsidered moderatdy unsatisfactory, their good performance against physical
targets brought downby the strategic gaps. Taking account o fboth the government's and
the implernenters' performances, and, inparticular, the failure o fthe market liberalization
program, Ethiopia's' overall performance for NFSP is assessed unsntisfactory. The ICR
and ICR Review also rated borrower performance unsatisfactory.

4.      Lessons and Opportunities

4.1     The main lessons from the experience o f SSDP and NFSP are described below.
With the possible exception o f lesson 6, applying these lessons would cost the
government very little.

I. Strategicallyorientedsectorworkisessentialasabaseforarelevantand
        effective rural development program. Given the critical needto increase the
       productivity of Ethiopia's rural sector, it was particularly important to have an
        effectiverural strategy. Yet neither the Bank nor the government hadthis. For the
       Bank, there was no significant rural sector work duringeither preparationor
       implementation o f the projects; a gap that was not addressed until2005. The lack
       o f sector analysis was akey contributor to the Bank's generally weak rural
       lendingprogram inEthiopia, inquality as well as quantity. Seven out of the I O

                                          32


    rural projects completed in the 1980swere ratedunsatisfactory, and rural lending
    shrank from 44 percent o f the Ethiopiaportfolio in the 1980s to only 12 percent in
   the 1990s.The rural lendingprogram also lackeda coherent overall thrust,
    comprising instead a scatter o f largely unrelated projects. The Bank's and
    government's approach to SSDP and NFSP exemplified these weaknesses; in
    particular concerning the projects' limitedfocus on sector coordination, on
    fertilizer and seed marketing issues, and on agricultural services such as extension
    and research.

2.  Better coordinationand linkages are neededbetweenprojectsandwithin the
    ruralsector as a whole. Although SSDP andNFSP went to the Board on the
    same day there was minimal coordination between them: in conceptualization,
    design, or implementation. Each project operated in a "silo," with very limited
    links, not only with each other but also with related sectors such as agricultural
    extension. Bank supervisionteams also operated separately. Rural development
    needs a comprehensive approach, integratingcomplementary actions between
    reIated programs (such as extension, research, and inputs). This unleashes natural
    synergies for a greater impact, as for example, the enhanced yield impact from
    usingseed and fertilizer together. Butonly 30 percent o f fertilized land in
    Ethiopia i s sown with improved seed.

3.  Developmentof a competitivefertilizer market requires actions beyond
    "Market Liberalization." A groupofpolicyreforms under NFSP was intended
    to liberalize the fertilizer import market, creating open competition and
    participationby the private sector. The reforms-comprising      elimination o f
    subsidies, deregulation o fprices and equal access to foreign exchange and short-
    term credit-were    all implemented, and were considered at the time to be a
    Comprehensive package for achieving fair and open competition. Even so, there
    were further constraints adversely affectingprivate sector participation and open
    market competition that were not considered: higher collateral requirements and
    interest rates than for the government agency, and more difficult access to foreign
    exchange and government storage facilities. As a result, the private sector left the
    market, and government became the sole fertilizer importer. The market reforms
    had seemedto be a classic and comprehensive "liberalization" agenda, borrowing
    from successes elsewhere; but the full reformneeds were snbstantialiymore.

4.  Relianceon the public sector for inputsupply may create not only market
    inefficienciesbut also a shortageof inputs.Policies introduced independently
    by government at the beginningof the SSDP and NFSP actively discriminated
    against private seedproduction and the private retailing ofboth seed and
    fertilizer. Only government sources o f the two inputs received credit andwere
    distributed by the extension service. The private sector couid not compete against
    such discrimination and abandoned the wholesale and retail markets for
    agriculturalinputs. For seed, there was an additional opportunity cost going
    beyondthe market inefficiencies that canbe expected from monopolized supply.
    Seed productionitself is likely to have suffered. ESEwas unable to appreciably
    increase seed production and produces only about 30 percent o f Ethiopia's
    effective demand for seed. ESE's limitations suggest that the public sector can

                                             33


       only bepart ofnationalseedproduction, andprobably aminoritypart. The
       absence of a substantial private seed sector, and the resultant "seed gap," is likely
       to have had a significant negative influence on farm productivity.

5.     Institutionalstructures and processes can restrict private sector
       participation. The new agricultural extension program, providing a package o f
       seed, fertilizer, and credit exclusively through extension agents, limited the
       participationo fprivate wholesalers and retailers in the fertilizer and seedmarkets.
       The revisedseedproductionprogramleft out the formerly envisaged informal
       seed productionby farmers.

6.     A one-size-fits-all agriculturalextension system has limited impact Support
       services for farmers need to be tailored to local conditions and specific fanner
       needs. The NAIEP package, with a uniform combination o f fertilizer and seed,
       was a top-down, supply-driven, one-size-fits-all formula. The impact on
       agricultural productivity could have beengreater with amore flexible demand-led
       extension service.

7.     A strategy-focused program requires performanceindicators, monitoring,
       and an adaptive approach, reflecting the strategic objectives and outcomes
       relative to these objectives. Hence: performance indicators shouldreflect the
       strategy andproject objectives; there needs to be continuous monitoring of
       progress, especially regarding outcomes, against these indicators; and there
       shouldbe a propensityto make changes to a project or policies whenever events
       show this is needed.

4.2    Recent developments since these projects closed are more encouraging. The Bank
and the government have substantially increased sector analysis over the past two years.
Several policy actions that may reduce market bias against private fertilizer importers
were taken in 2006. The agricultural extension service's linkage with research is being
strengthened and a more demand-driven approach is beingdeveloped. Inlending, the
RuralCapacity BuildingProject (FY06) supportsthe broader development strategy
derivedfrom the sector analysis.

Annex B                                          42


                     Comments on the Proiect PerformanceAssessment Report


Although this report i s prepared after about five years o f project completion during which relevant

documents might have been misplaced and staffs working on these projects have transferred to other
places, we have the impressionthat ithascapturedsignificant informationthat can serveasatoolto learn
from past experience. With this backgroundwe forwarded our comments on major issues as follows:


1. Issues relatedwith policy reformand competitiveness

    As per the agreement with IDA the government has taken significant policyreforms to allow more
    open competition infertilizer and seed marketing including liberalizingthe market, deregulation o f
    prices, elimination of subsidy and creating equal access to foreign exchange for both public and
    private importers.


    As reported in PPAR, incomplete and insufficient policy reform is the main constraint to the
    development of competitive input market. But, we have the feeling that this problem i s rather
    associated with lack o f proper assessment o f the sector during the project design so as to identify

    potential constraints that would undermine the impact of policy reforms and propose measures to
    mitigate them duringproject implementation.


    Field assessment reports have shown that limited participation o f the private sector is mainly
    associated with lack o f capital, lack of experience andpoor market infrastructure (interms o f roads
    and stores). These issues should have beenconsideredeither duringprojectpreparationor detected
    early by the supervision mission to rectify them.
    Inthisconnectionwewouldliketobringtoyour attentionthatissues citedinBox 1ascontributorsto
    the non-level playing field for fertilizer importers are far from truth. These include higher interest

    rate, higher collateral requirement, unfavorable access to foreign exchange, less access to storage

    facilities and greater bureaucracy for private companies compared with public enterprise.


    Ingeneral inacountrywhere the agriculturesectoristhebackboneofeconomy, thatisdominatedby
    subsistence farmers scattered all over the country, with limitedaccessto marketinginfrastructureand

    inputcredit, carefulactions arerequiredas tohow sustainable inputsupplysystemshoulddevelop to
    better serve the interest o f smallholder farmers.


    In order to fillthe gap createdbetweenfarmers and financial institutions andto ensure availability of
    inputsfor farmers inremoteareaswhere the privatesector arenot interestedto operate, theregional
    governments have taken the initiativeo fcoordinating inputsand credit distribution. This shouldbe

                                                43                                       Annex 3


   consideredas atemporary gap filling exercise and shouldnot betaken as the governments interestto
   moholmlize inputmarketbypublic enterprises. Haditnotbeenfor government intervention (when
   reqded) fertilizer and seedconsumptionwouldhave significantlydecreasedinsteadofthe regstered

   increasing trend.


   As cited onpage 15inbox 3 Pioneer SeedCompany is one o f live example that is successful in seed
   production and marketing in Ethiopia. The Iesson from Pioneer's success i s that there is no any
   policybarrier onprivate sector participationrathertheirproblemisassociatedwithlacko fgenerating
   initialinvestment, inabiIity to equip themselves with the necessary manpower and materials.
   There i s high level o f government commitment to bring about a healthy, vibrant, sustainable and
   conipetitive input supply system. This can be explained by policy reforms made duringthe project
   periodandcontinuous efforts to identity and eliminate barriers to market entry by the private sector
   including introducing merchandise loan credit system so as to solve problem associated with
   collateral and distributing public basic seeds to private seed companies and facilitating their

  participation to directly distribute their seeds to fanners.


   The mainproblem standing inthe way o fcreating a competitive input market inEthiopia i s absence
   or lack of capable (interms o fcapital, experience, entrepreneurship) and committed private sector.
   Efforts are underway by government to support those who have interest and passion to engage in
  agricukural input business. As a result currently there are more than 30 registered private seed
  companies engaged in seed business.




2.IssuesRelated with Capacity Buildingand Soil Fertility Management

       The capacity building component could be scored as a successfill with the exception o f the

       enablement of soil testing laboratories. The construction of the soil testing laboratories was

       completed within an acceptable range. Nevertheless, no single laboratory was sufficiently

       furnished to carry out soil testing within the project period.       There was a problem in
       backstopping for the laboratories with lab equipments and technical support.


  0    The soil fertdity managementand environnientalconservation pdrtwas also inconiplete. The use

       of bio-fertilizers, use o f indigenous nutrient resource and the soil test based calibration and

       recommendationo ffertilizers was discontinuedat itsinfant stage. These could have augmented

       the majorobjective o fachieving anaccelerated andsustainable growthinagriculturalproduction.

       Similarly most o f the equipments purchased for seed cleaning and threshing were not fully
      utilized.

      Onerecent development worth mentioningisthe study conductedbythe Ministryo fAgnculture
      and Rural Development on the acidity problems of Ethiopian soils. Based on the
      recommendationo fthe studyactivities are under way to apply limeto the affectedfarmlands. In
      addition, efforts are being made to make the Federal and regional soil and seed testing
      laboratories fully operational.



3. Editorial

      Onpage 10paragraph2.18 itisreportedthat the numbero fprivate importersat the beginningof
      the 1990'swas two. However, there was only oneprivate company at that time namely, Ethiopia
      Amalgamated Limited.


      The data shown in Table 2 i s not fkrtilizer import data. It is fertilizer consumption data with
      correction on data for 2004105 and 2005/2006. The total consumption data for years 1994-
      2003/04 are correct, while the data for year 2004105 and 200512006 should be adjusted as 346
      and 376thousands tones respectively. The same correction shouldbemade for the data shown in
      Table 3.
