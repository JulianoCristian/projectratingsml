was unsatisfactory, the\n            sustainability was unlikely, the institutional development\n            impact was modest, and the Bank and borrower performance\n            were unsatisfactory. Involvement of agricultural extension\n            agents in distribution and credit administration impeded\n            development of the private sector and undermined the longer\n            term function of extension. Financing fertilizer imports\n            through separately mechanisms of foreign exchange allocation\n            introduces inefficiencies in the fertilizer industry. There\n            is a need to move away from project based fertilizers\n            imports in favor of general foreign exchange management. In\n            a country that is highly susceptible to drought like\n            Ethiopia, use of fertilizer can accentuate the hardship\n            caused by insufficient precipitation, putting in peril large\n            numbers of farmers and the financial institutions that serve\n            them. It is important to adopt a holistic approach to input\n            market development and seek coverage in seeds availability\n            and fertilizers as one without the other cannot give optimal\n            returns. The grain market crash of 2001, and the resulting\n            hardship in credit repayments and the precipitous drop in\n            fertilizer consumption in 2002, clearly illustrate the\n            importance of focusing as much on agricultural input markets\n            as on output markets."}, "docdt": "2002-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
