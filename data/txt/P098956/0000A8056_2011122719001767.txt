                         The Second Post Primary Education Projects (PEPP2) development objective is to support the GoBF strategy to increase the number and quality of students
                         graduating from secondary school at reduced costs for parents, with increased equity of access by gender and by area (rural-urban).

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of project activities is progressing satisfactorily. Achievement of the project development objective indicators is substantial. A recent revision of population
                         estimates based on the 2006 population census affected some project indicators related to enrollment rates (i.e. accomplishment of the targets for gross intake and completion rates).
                         Progress in reaching project development objectives is considered satisfactory, since there has been continued improvement in development indicators, specifically the gross intake,
                         completion, secondary enrollment, and girls' gross enrollment rate, as well as the indicators (i) reduction in school fees; (ii) increase in the share of the MESSRS in the education

                         budget; and (iii) allocation for secondary education. Regarding the quality component, two student learning assessments were completed. The first assessment established baselines
                         for math, science and French, whereas the follow up assessment in 2009 served to monitor student progress. Procurement issues slowed down project implementation. Several
                         activities were affected by these delays, notably, textbook acquisition and distribution. Actions were taken and most of these issues have been resolved. As a result, project
                         implementation progress is expected to improve as well as the textbook/student indicator. Nevertheless, the indicators on drop out and repetition rates remain high.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Procurement issues slowed down project implementation. Several activities were affected by these delays, notably, textbook acquisition and distribution. Actions were taken and
                         most of these issues have been resolved. As a result, project implementation progress is expected to improve as well as the textbook/student indicator. Textbooks will be delivered to
                         schools by mid-March 2012, schools completed by April 2012, and IT installed in mid-May 2012.
