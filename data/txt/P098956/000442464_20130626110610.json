         Education Project (PPEP2) for Burkina Faso were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: provide a more\n            detailed and comprehensive performance (outcome) framework\n            with adequate alternatives when political and or technical\n            course corrections are needed. Provide adequate technical\n            analysis of the management and implementation capacity at\n            local levels of the education system where the reforms or\n            changes really ought to happen and analyze if appropriate\n            incentives for strong ownership are in place or planned.\n            Provide sufficient resources and management supervision for\n            government-led procurement processes and set realistic goals\n            for the results and timeframe of the procurement activities.\n            When public-private partnerships are involved in\n            construction and or school management the preparation\n            process should ensure detailed procedural agreements and\n            goals for performance by the private sector stakeholders,\n            notably when this is happening at the local level. In (sub)\n            sector reform project more detailed standards for measuring\n            school performance in terms of quality of learning and\n            teaching, and of the overall performance of the school,\n            should be developed. More attention should be given in the\n            Bank's project preparation process to the need for\n            sustainability after project closure. Project that aim to\n            improve the quality of learning and teaching at primary and\n            or secondary levels should define: to have a realistic\n            lead-time and sufficiently-detailed indicator for\n            \"quality of learning and teaching effects\" to\n            emerge and that are measurable, and can (preferably) be\n            \"cross-checked\" against other pedagogic\n            indicators. Donor harmonization was important for PPEP2\n            overall quality."}, "docdt": "2013-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
