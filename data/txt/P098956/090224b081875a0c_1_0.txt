                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Following the period from 1999 to 2005 during which development partners and national resources were focused on primary education, the pressure of students who completed
                         primary education became increasingly important in the post-primary education. Based on the satisfactory results of the Bank previous financed project (PEPP 1) and given the fact
                         that all donor partners were always focusing on primary education, the Bank and the Government agreed to fund a second post-primary project (PEPP2) in the amount of US$ 22.9
                         million. The Netherlands Embassy has joined the Bank as a silent partnership with a contribution of Euro 22 million.

                         The PEPP2 was approved in June 20, 2006 and became effective in December 19, 2006. The original completion of the project was extended three times, with the final extension
                         until December 30, 2012. The extensions were justified and requested to ensure completion of some activities, delayed mainly due to procurement weaknesses. These included (i)
                         the construction program; textbooks acquisition; and (iii) the purchase of Information Technology equipment.

                         This is last ISR of PEPP2 2 which captures the overall project implementation.

                         The project is achieving its planned objectives and has been instrumental in approving access to secondary education. The project disbursement rate is currently 100%. Five project
                         development outcome indicators, out of six, have been surpassed. These include: (1) primary gross enrollment rate (GER) in lower secondary in the 18 less-covered provinces, (2)
                         girls’ GER in lower secondary, (3) completion rate in lower secondary, (4) school fees supported by families in public lower secondary schools in the 18 less-covered provinces, and
                         (5) share of budget provided to the Ministry of Secondary and Tertiary Education (MESS) in the education budget. The 6th performance indicator (gross intake rate in 1st grade of
                         lower secondary) is on track and likely to be achieved based on current school year (2012-2013) preliminary data.
                         Eight intermediate indicators out of fifteen have been achieved or surpassed. The remaining ones are mainly related to quality improvement indicators such as the repetition rate and
                         student learning outcomes.
                         The Project has done much to improve performance in the domain of quality, even though the results show that it was insufficient. The fact that teachers’ training has greatly
                         surpassed the target (154% compared to the target of 80%) is an attempt by the project to address this quality issue. In addition, the availability of textbooks has been improved.
                         Textbook-student ratio has been exceeded for the upper secondary (6.6 textbooks per student compared to 2 per student), but the target has not been reached for lower secondary
                         education. Nevertheless, the project has helped design national textbooks, acquire copyrights, and has helped put in place a structural funding system to print textbooks when
                         needed. These actions will make textbook reproduction easier and faster. The project also funded the production of electronic teaching materials to improve science teaching.
                         However, based on evaluations financed by the project, the Government came to the conclusion that low achievements in terms of quality indicators is related to structural
                         dysfunctions requiring a more comprehensive response that goes beyond the sub-sector of secondary education. Many of the quality issues came from accumulating weaknesses in
                         primary education. A national strategy (PDSEB 2012-2021) integrating primary and secondary education was prepared with the support of development partners, including the Bank,
                         to provide global solutions to these weaknesses.

                         The output indicator related to the increase of Secondary VET training through construction of two VET CEGs (Vocational Education and Training Low Secondary School) was not
                         achieved because the construction was abandoned. During the MTR held in mid-February, 2009, the Government and the Bank have noticed that the cost of the 2 VET CEG
                         construction were too high, largely due to the cost of connecting electricity. To build at an acceptable cost, the Bank had to wait beyond the closing date of the project (December
                         2009) for electricity to be introduced into the indicated localities. Therefore, the Government committed to finance later, on its own budget, the construction of the two VET CEG, but
                         proposed that the resources that were intended for the construction of VET CEG be used to acquire TVET equipment for two existing VET centers. Following the MTR, the project
                         Steering Committee formalized this agreement. To date, the Government has built 2 VET CEG and TVET equipment has been acquired and used by the two existing VET Centers.
