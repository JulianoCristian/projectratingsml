﻿1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country Context. Burkina Faso established a strong track record on reform and growth in the
past decade. Despite this recent progress, the country remained one of the poorest countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa, with per capita income of US$350 and a poverty incidence of 46 percent in
2003. Social welfare indicators lagged behind even modest Sub-Saharan averages, placing the
country near the bottom of the Human Development Index (173rd out of 175). About 20 percent
of the population lived in urban areas (mainly the capital city Ouagadougou and Bobo-
Dioulasso). Most Burkinabe remain heavily dependent on agricultural activities. Macroeconomic
performance and progress in reducing widespread poverty remain vulnerable to exogenous
shocks, such as climatic conditions and changes in world market prices for cotton, Burkina Faso's
main export.
The GoBF defined in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the following four strategic
pillars which were supported by the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2006-09 report
#32187; World Bank; May 2005): (i) accelerating equity-oriented growth; (ii) guaranteeing
access of the poor to basic social services and social protection; (iii) expanding employment and
income opportunities for the poor; and (iv) promoting good governance. With the support of
donors, the GoBF undertook a number of policy reforms and key actions, including enhancing
social services delivery to the poor through, among others, expanding access to education.
Education Sector Context. The GoBF adopted a ten-year Basic Education Development
Strategy (PDDEB) in 2000, with support from the donor community for implementation. A
rolling, medium-term expenditure framework was introduced for planning and donor alignment,
and a decision was made to focus government / donor intervention in the 20 provinces with the
lowest primary enrollment rates. A national program was adopted to accelerate girls' education,
and public-private partnerships to expand secondary education were piloted and replicated based
on early successes (IDA financed Post-Primary Education Projectl-PPEPl). The GER in these
20 provinces was 42.2% (47.3% for boys and 36.7% for girls in 2004-05).
At the time of project appraisal the PPEP2 was strategically aligned to the following key issues in
the education sector: (i) insufficient access to education services, particularly for the poor; (ii)
low efficiency in the of use of resources; (iii) weak quality and low relevance of education; (iv)
inadequate financing of education and poor allocation between subsectors, and (v) weak capacity
for management and supervision of the sector. Although gross primary enrollment rate (GER)
increased by 7.5 points per year on average since 2000 to reach 56.8 percent in 2004 the
enrollment gap between boys (62.4%) and girls (51.0%) narrowed only modestly and the gap
between the 18 poorest performing provinces and the rest of the country widened (due to a
combination of differential economic growth and inefficient spending causes). Furthermore, the
overall primary education completion rate reached only 30 percent which remained very low
compared to the Sub Saharan average (60% in 2003-2004).
The surge in primary education enrollment and completion rates increased the need to
accommodate graduates at the lower secondary level. In 2004, more than 50 percent (mainly
from rural areas) of the 125,000 students who completed primary education were unable to enter
into secondary education. The secondary level GER increased by less than 2 percentage points
over 1999-2004 to reach only 16 percent in 2004 (20 % in lower secondary and 8% in upper
secondary). The average secondary education GER for Sub-Saharan African countries in 2004
1


﻿(44% in lower secondary and 29% in upper secondary) was about twice the rate achieved by
Burkina Faso.
The quality of education remained low, as evidenced by high dropout and repetition rates and low
examination pass rates at all levels. It took on average 9.5 years to produce a lower secondary
school graduate (2.4 times longer than necessary) and an additional 5.8 years to produce an upper
secondary graduate (1.9 times longer). In secondary schools, the instructional year is short (from
October to May). This dramatically limits student-teacher interaction and learning opportunities.
The low quality of education was further aggravated by a shortage of qualified teachers,
particularly in science and math. The relevance of the curriculum was also an issue. Exams were
(and are) used as a regulating mechanism to control student flow into secondary and to limit the
transition rate between sub-cycles. In addition inequality remained an issue. More than 75
percent o f students enrolled in tertiary education are from wealthy families from the two highest
income quintiles, with less than 2 percent from the lowest quintile. Repetition rates in tertiary
education, coupled with the high unit costs of education, limited opportunities for students from
low income families.
The project context. The PPEP2 was built on the results of PPEP1 and designed to address the
above-mentioned remaining challenges. PEPP2 was aligned with the GoBF's poverty reduction
strategy, and complemented other donor investments that focused on basic education. The
project design was the result of joint Government-Bank analytical work, discussions with
stakeholders, and lessons stemming from PEPP1. The Netherlands government decided to co-
support PPEP2 with a contribution of Euro 22 million, which was fully disbursed by June 2010.
Other IDA financed education projects / programs which were undergoing during the PPEP2
preparation and implementation referred to the Basic Education Sector Project and the DPO for
the FTI-Fast Track Initiative Grant.
PPEP1 had supported the GoBF's ten-year post-primary education development plan (Plan de
Developpement de l'Enseignement Post-Primaire -- PDEPP) (1996-2005) to address the
shortcomings of the sub-sector. PPEP1 supported: (a) the promotion of cost-effective and
equitable use of public education resources; and (b) an increase in access to, and the quality of
post-primary education. The PPEP1 Credit Agreement (DCA) was signed in December 1996,
became effective in October 1997 and closed on April 2004. The Development Objective (DO) of
the PEPP1 was to have more and better-trained students graduating from secondary school at
reduced subsidy costs, with increased equality between gender and income levels. Progress in
achieving the DO was to be evaluated on the basis of the following indicators: (a) increase the
proportion of primary school graduates who continued on to lower secondary education from
27% to 30%; (b) decrease in repetition rate from 25% to 20%; (c) reduction in total student social
subsidies in higher and secondary education from FCFA 4.8 billion to FCFA 2.2 billion; (d)
increase in the proportion of girls enrolled in secondary school from 35% to 40%; and (e)
enrollment of 8,000 additional students in the ten provinces with the highest incidence of poverty
and lowest coverage. PPEP1 performance was rated overall as satisfactory. The lessons from
PPEP1 were applied in PPEP2. The MESSR aimed to maintain the stability of its staff
composition, even though it could not prevent some turnover. The partnerships between the
GoBF and the private sector ensured a significant contribution to the development of secondary
education in Burkina Faso. PPPs also provided valuable implementation capacity-building
related to M&E and Civil Works supervision, notably in ensuring transparency and compliance
with quality and safety norms. The combined approaches in partnering with municipalities,
2


﻿NGOs, and private entrepreneurs made secondary education more affordable and
available to parents.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The PDO as stated in the DCA is as follows. The objective of the Project is to support the
Recipient's strategy to increase the number and quality of students graduating from secondary
school at reduced costs for parents, with increased equity of access by gender and by area (rural-
urban). The PDO as stated in the PAD (Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3) is identical.
The PDO was to be measured through the following indicators:

The original IDA Credit was for a total of SDR 16 million (US$22.9 million equivalent). The
project was additionally financed by a grant of Euro 22 million from the Netherlands, and US$
2. 1million from the GoBF.
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The original PDO was not revised.
However, two PDO-related key indicators were adjusted based on newly available 2006 census
data. Five out of the six PDO-related indicator targets were achieved or surpassed during project
implementation.
During the 2nd closing date extension in June 2011 two of the indicator targets related to the
PDO were adjusted, based on the 2006 census date that had become available. The restructuring
memo stated that the PDO remained achievable and was (at that time) rated satisfactory based on
good progress on key indicators. The 2006 census data showed that the previous population
estimates were too high, and led to a decrease in the end-of-project targets. Therefore, the two
PDO-related targets affected by the new population census data were revised as follows:

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary beneficiary target groups of PPEP2 identified at appraisal were the relevant age
group of secondary education students, including : (i) girls of lower- and upper-secondary
education age in order to promote their enrolment and completion rates in secondary education;
(ii) relevant school-age children and families from a relatively poor socio-economic background,
located, mainly in the 18 lowest secondary education enrolment performing provinces of Burkina
Faso, and notably eligible school-aged children from the poorer rural communities. In addition,
the PPEP2 provided capacity-building support to the central Ministry of Secondary and Higher
Education and Research (MESSRS), as well as their provincial Directorates.
The main findings of social assessments in 1997 and 2000 were economic costs, opportunity
costs particularly for girls, and a high level of mobility. Burkinabe relocate frequently (28% of
the population 10 years or older has migrated at least once, of whom more than half are females)
for employment, education, or marriage opportunities.
PEPP2 specific beneficiary-targeted activities focused on: (i) rural and poverty-stricken urban
areas and the 18 provinces with the lowest secondary education enrolment (out of a total of 45
provinces); (ii) enrolling more girls through such specific actions as improving physical access to
schools (constructing four-classroom modules so that lower secondary grades can be offered in
all 351 communes of the country), providing running water, and providing separate sanitary
facilities for girls; (iii) providing schools in more locations so persons who move about the
country will be able to continue their education; (iv) developing new approaches for vocational
education programs tailored to local needs and the economy; (v) expanding nutrition and school
canteen programs as an incentive for enrollment and retention in poor areas; (vi) providing
textbooks at reduced cost to alleviate the costs incurred by parents; (vii) reducing opportunity
costs to parents with a flexible school calendar that avoids overlap with peak rural activity
periods; and (viii) strengthening public-private partnerships while attracting other social
stakeholders (NGOs) in social services and infrastructure investments.
1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Project description (ref. PAD B.3.a, Technical Annex 4). The project consisted of four
components:
1. Increase Access to Secondary Education (US$21.7 million): supports the expansion of
post-primary education, particularly lower secondary education through: (i) the increase of
secondary education services; (ii) the promotion of greater autonomy of communes in
management and cost-sharing of lower secondary schools; and (iii) the increase of equity in
lower secondary education, especially for girls and for children from low-income families
4


﻿(reduced schooling fees and free tickets for the school canteen). The component consisted of
three sub-components:
a) Increased access to lower secondary education, especially in the 18 less-covered
provinces. This sub-component will finance construction and equipment of 80 lower
secondary schools (CEG).    The MESSRS will provide support and delegate the
management of these CEGs to communes. Based on the schema being used since the
PEPPI by the MESSRS, it will hire two teachers to be assigned to each new CEG, and
communes will hire contractual teachers to supplement pedagogical staffing needs.
Enrollment of girls and children from low-income families will be supported through
reduced tuition fees, lower rental fees for textbooks, and subsidized school canteen tickets.
b) Increased access to upper-secondary education.    This sub-component will finance
construction and equipment of 10 upper- secondary schools in provinces with a gross
enrollment rate (GER) in upper secondary education of less than 2 percent. These upper
secondary education schools will reserve 25 percent of their capacity to enroll children from
low-income families.
c) Increased enrollment in lower secondary private schools in urban areas. This sub-
component will support construction and equipment of 20 private schools (CEG) using the
public-private partnership (PPP) put in place during PEPPI. The MESSRS will build and then
transfer ownership and management of 20 CEGs to private education providers selected
through a competitive process (leasing contract).
2. Improve the Quality of Post-Primary Education (US$ 19.25 million): This component
aims to consolidate and scale up achievements from the first Post Primary Education Project
and to support and maintain Government reforms for improving the quality and efficiency o f
secondary education. In particular, this component will contribute to improving learning and
teaching in post-primary through the implementation of a new curriculum, the strengthening
of teachers' education (pre and in-service); providing pedagogical materials, monitoring
students learning outcomes and providing new learning opportunities for tertiary education
students using information and communication technologies. The component consisted of six
sub-components:
a) Secondary education curriculum reform. This sub-component will finance the elaboration
of a competency-based curriculum for each academic subject of lower secondary education. It
will also finance training of pedagogical staff (inspectors, pedagogical advisors, etc.) in
various aspects of curriculum design and implementation, including sensitization on gender.
b) Pre- and in-service teacher training reform. PEPP2 will increase the capacity and
efficiency of teachers' colleges by providing equipment and pedagogic materials. It will also
support training for pedagogic staff to ensure follow up of secondary teacher- trainees during
their one-year teaching practice. In-service teacher training programs will be supported using
a three-pronged strategy which includes direct and regular support to secondary school
teachers by inspectors and advisors in the field, intensive in-service training for teaching staff
and teacher study groups in key academic subjects (Cellule d'Animation Pedagogique).
MESSRS will elaborate and provide training materials as needed.
c) Increase availability of textbooks. This sub-component will improve the availability of
teaching and learning materials in secondary schools. The sub- component will finance the
purchase of textbooks, teaching manuals, and other pedagogic materials to achieve a target
ratio of six textbooks per student in the first two grades of lower secondary, eight textbooks
per student in the last two grades of lower- secondary, and two textbooks per student in upper
secondary. MESSRS will introduce reduced textbook rental fees for children from low
income families. Management of the textbook revolving fund and the textbook inventory
system will be strengthened.
5


﻿d) School health and HIV/AIDS activities. This sub-component will seek to improve
secondary students' and teachers' awareness regarding preventive measures against
HIVIAIDS infections, including reproductive health and rights, and other diseases in
collaboration with the AIDS Coordinating Committee (CMLS) of MESSRS. Priority
activities will include integration of school health, reproductive health and rights, and
HIV/AIDS issues into the curriculum, support for voluntary counseling and testing
campaigns, and peer education programs. MESSRS also will provide targeted support for
school health activities and for orphans and children affected by HIVIAIDS.
e) Evaluation and student assessment in secondary education. The objective of this sub-
component is to .build a reliable secondary student learning outcomes and information system
to monitor learning progress and improve education quality. This sub-component will support
a series of activities, such as provision of technical assistance to support the exam and student
assessment unit, and materials and equipments to undertake testing, studies, and training of
staff and teachers. It also will support two large-scale learning outcomes standardized testing
at the beginning and end of the project on a representative sample of students in 2nd grade of
lower secondary and 2nd grade of upper secondary in four academic subjects.
f) Information and communication technologies (ICT) in tertiary education. This sub-
component will contribute to providing new learning opportunities to students in three
regional universities through distance learning. It also will seek to improve efficiency and
cost-effectiveness using ICT (i.e., courses will be available for a larger number of students
without increasing the teaching staff). The three universities will publish some of their
courses online. This sub-component will finance the construction of three resource and
distance learning centers equipped with ICT equipment as well as other costs associated with
the digitalization of teaching courses.
3. Institutional Strengthening of MESSRS (US$9.25 million): This component aims at
improving post-primary education service delivery through enhanced sector planning and
managerial capacities of MESSRS at the school, the regional and central levels. This
component will provide support for: (i) educational planning; (ii) financial and personnel
management; (iii) education operations coordination; and (iv) studies to provide relevant
information needed for policy dialogue. This component will provide support for the
elaboration and subsequent implementation of a 10-year national strategy and plan for- post-
primary education to be designed following the education sector analysis (education country
status report) which will be supported by the Bank. It will reinforce the M&E systems of
MESSRS, including strengthening the day-to-day monitoring system at the national, regional
and school levels. It will seek to reduce the unit cost of education at all sub- levels of post-
primary education, as well as the financial burden on families, particularly for low- income
rural children in lower secondary schools in the 18 lowest covered provinces. In its strategy
to improve service delivery as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations,
MESSRS requested support to build and equip eight Directorates of General Secondary
Education (DR/MESSRS) in the regions. Finally, the component will support operational
research, coordination of activities, and project management, including procurement and
financial audits. To better monitor education investment and spending and support a more
equitable use of public resources, the project will seek to improve overall financial and
budget planning in MESSRS, including the elaboration of an MTEF for the sub-sector. This
component will consist of the following sub-components: (a) education planning; (b)
financial and personnel management; and (c) post-primary education sub-sector coordination
and policy dialogue.
6


﻿4. Expand Vocational Education and Training -VET- (US2.5 million): This component will
support the elaboration of a national policy on VET as well as the expansion of the sub-
system based on pilot experiences conducted by an NGO and other providers. The
component will finance: (i) preparatory studies and workshops; (ii) re vision of the
curriculum; (iii) re qualification of training staff; (iv) learning assessment; (v) construction
and equipping of two VET schools; and (vi) setting up of an apprenticeship fund.
1.6 Revised Components
The original PDO was not revised.
Component 2 revision. Distance Learning facilities were planned to be constructed on three
university campuses, along with the development of online courses. During the MTR in Jan. -
Feb. 2009 the GoBF decided to transfer the Ouagadougou Distance Learning Center (CEDO),
built with IDA funds, to the MESSRS to support modernization of higher education. Within this
newly developed situation it was decided during the MTR instead of constructing facilities to
rehabilitate and equip existing facilities within the universities to set-up a national network of
Distance Learning.
Component 4 revision. During the mid-term review (MTR) in February 2009, the GoBF and the
Bank noticed that the cost of the 2 VET CEG constructions were too high, largely due to the cost
of connecting electricity. To build at an acceptable cost, the PPEP2 would have had to wait too
long and would not be able to complete construction before the original closing date of the
project. Therefore, the GoBF committed to finance the construction of the 2 CEG-VET schools
on its own budget. The GoBF also proposed that the PPEP2 resources intended for the
construction be used to acquire TVET equipment for two existing VET centers. Following the
MTR, the project Steering Committee formalized this agreement. By the latest closing date
(December 30, 2012) the GoBF had completed construction of 2 CEG-VET schools, and the
TVET equipment was acquired and in use.
1.7 Other significant changes
The PPEP2 was approved on June 20, 2006 and became effective on December 19, 2006. The
original completion date was March 31, 2010 and was extended three times. In January 2010 the
first extension was approved of 15 months up to June 30, 2011. The second extension of 12
months up to June 30, 2012 was approved in June 2011. And the third extension of 6 months up
to December 30, 2012 was approved in June 2012.
The 2nd extension of the closing date. The 2nd closing date extension brought a cumulative
extension period of over two years (i.e. 33 months from the original closing date). On June 27,
2011 the PPEP2 disbursement rate stood at 60 percent corresponding to SDR 9.66 million. The
government requested the 2nd extension due to serious delays in procurement for technical and
vocational training equipment, school construction using PPP arrangements, textbooks and school
science kits. The latter two related to the quality of learning enhancing component of the PPEP2.
The longer timeframe required for procurement and dissemination of these items necessitated
according to the GoBF the closing date extension.
Also two of the indicator targets related to the PDO were adjusted, based on the 2006 census date
that had become available (see the relevant revised PDO section above). It was also agreed to
revise the target of an Intermediate Results Indicator affected by the population census. The GER
target in secondary education increase was reduced from 25 to 15%.
7


﻿The 3rd extension of the closing date (from June 30, 2012 to December 30, 2012). The GoBF
requested this extension to ensure that activities for which contracts were signed could be
completed: (i) the construction of 10 lower secondary schools (consisting of 60 classrooms) with
public-private partnership arrangements; (ii) the completion of 6 secondary schools (36
classrooms) and 31 administrative offices in remote and difficult areas; and (iii) the purchase of
IT equipment.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project preparation. The lessons and results from the first Post-Primary Education Project
(PPEPl) were a significant starting point for the dialogue between the GoBF, the Bank and other
sector donors in the preparation of the PPEP2. The decision was made to have a SIL to finance
the development of post-primary education. Also, the project team decided to actively support
the GoBF during project implementation in preparing a comprehensive education sector strategy
that would allow a more programmatic approach in future. The alternative of using a SWAP was
rejected at this time in favor of the development of a comprehensive education sector strategy.
Already two separate sub-sector plans had been prepared (for basic education and for post-
primary education). The basic education plan was under implementation. However, the post-
primary education plan (2005) was under review and PPEP2 would support the development of
an updated one. Similarly, the 2nd alternative of budget support was considered and rejected for
the same reasons. The 3 alternative of restructuring the ongoing Basic Education Support
Project to include interventions in secondary education was rejected because it was thought it
would limit the scope of possible post-primary education sub-sector interventions and delay the
development of a wider education sector strategy.
During project preparation the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF) also formulated its Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRSP), which was discussed by the Bank's Board in July 2005. The Bank's
CAS (2006-09) was aligned with the four strategic pillars of the PRSP: (i) accelerating equity-
oriented growth; (ii) guaranteeing access of the poor to basic social services and social protection;
(iii) expanding employment and income opportunities for the poor; and (iv) promoting good
governance. The CAS aimed to move away from stand-alone projects and towards more
programmatic approaches for sector support. PPEP2 project preparation also built upon the
results of PEPPI (launched June 1997 and closed in April 2004, with its outcome rated as
satisfactory). The GoBF requested additional comprehensive assistance from the Bank to support
its education sector in general, and particularly post-primary education. The result was PPEP2,
which was fully aligned with the GoBF's PRSP and supported all four major objectives of the
CAS.
The 2005 Burkina Faso Public Expenditure Review concluded that while the education sector
overall has received priority in additional budget allocations under the PRSP, most of the
additional Government and donor resources have gone to basic education, creating a growing
imbalance between primary and post-primary education. A better allocation efficiency between
the different levels of the education system was expected to result in a more balanced distribution
of educational attainment across the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. In time, this would
then allow for greater flexibility in adopting new technologies and support better economic
diversification.
8


﻿Project design. The PPEP2 design was appropriate within the context of the GoBF's education
sector strategy and the identified education sector issues. The PPEP2 design was based on the
positive results of the PPEPL. PPEP2 included innovative practices and piloted these during its
implementation period (these included gender-equality promotional measures to encourage girls
to attend secondary school, contribution to support measures for HIV / AIDS prevention and
support among secondary school students, Public-Private Partnership ventures, more
decentralization of responsibilities to the provincial Directorates and secondary schools, and the
starting-up of students assessment exercises. The PPEP2 design was successful in building upon
the achievements of PPEP1 and expanding these to further improve the secondary education
sector in Burkina Faso, notably in expanding access while there continued to be growing demand
at all education levels. However, the PPEP2 should also be considered as having been over-
ambitious. In the end it encountered significant implementation delays and three closing date
extensions. The PPEP2 design was the result of joint analytical education sector work carried out
by the GoBF and the Bank, with other major donors in the sector. The Netherlands decided to co-
finance PPEP2. It was agreed that the Bank would continue to serve as the lead-donor in post-
primary education. The GoBF also requested support from the Bank to update its education
strategy and to design a new 10-year national program for post-primary education development.
The key post-primary education issues which the PPEP2 focused on were: (i) insufficient access
to post-primary education services, particularly for the poor; (ii) low efficiency in the of resources
use; (iii) weak quality and low relevance of post-primary education; (iv) inadequate financing
education and poor allocation between sub sectors, and (v) weak education sector management
and supervision capacity. The gap between the 18 poorest performing provinces and the rest of
the country had widened, which reflected uneven economic growth and inefficiency in sector
spending. Comparatively the (post-primary) education access and efficiency indicators in Burkina
were largely behind the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore the PPEP2 focused specifically on
post-primary education support to the 18 poorest performing provinces in Burkina Faso.
The project design proved to be ambitious for the proposed 3 /2 -year SIL.      Project
implementation was severely delayed (resulting in 3 closing date extensions), mainly due to
problems with procurement and delivery of infrastructure and goods. The vocational training
outcomes were difficult to measure due to the restructuring of the component and poorly defined
indicators. The quality outcomes of the project (improving the quality of secondary and higher
education) were difficult to measure, even though the GoBF significantly improved its
Monitoring and Evaluation and management capacity during the PPEP2 life. In the end most
indicator targets were more than achieved (except for outcomes related to improved quality of
learning and teaching at post-primary education levels), but over an implementation period that
was twice as long as the originally agreed duration. Nevertheless most indicators were not
changed to take the longer implementation period into account.
Quality at entry. Based on the available evidence and data the ICR team judges the quality at
entry of PPEP2 to be appropriate and satisfactory.  Project preparation was significantly
supported through the successful results of PPEP1, the preparation of the GoBF's revised PRSP,
and the new results-based CAS, which was approved by the Board in 2005. In addition the GoBF
and the project preparation team ensured intensive donor consultation, which also resulted in
financial support from the Netherlands for PPEP2. The project preparation team also conducted
extensive consultation within the sector to ensure political commitment for the project design and
to generate strong stakeholder project ownership. Also, there was close collaboration between the
9


﻿various international donors that were active in the education sector in Burkina Faso. This
resulted in effective communication, coordination of activities and a joint approach to sector
support. However, it was not foreseen that the priority for disbursement of the Dutch project
funds could cause delays for IDA disbursement. The PPEP2 design was fully harmonized with
the GoBF's PRSP and sub-sector strategy. Project risks had also been identified and mitigation
measures were in place to deal with the risks. The project design aimed to promote long-term
sustainability in post-primary education, and improved equity for the 18 poorest performing
provinces. The technical design of the project was consistent with international practices. The
project components (construction program, teacher training, curriculum reform, management
capacity-building, and tertiary education) were prepared with the support of technical and
economic studies and using lessons learned during the PPEP1 implementation. Social
assessments in 1997 and 2000 were used to agree on project outcomes targets.
2.2 Implementation
During the project preparation process, as part of the ongoing dialogue with donors, The
Netherlands agreed to support implementation of PPEP2 with Euro 22 million. The Netherlands
and IDA agreed to a common project framework including objectives, indicators, and a
monitoring and evaluation system. It was agreed that the Bank would assume leadership and
monitor implementation of project activities. Information was shared and regular consultations
took place between the two donors to ensure common perspectives on policy decisions and
Government strategy reorientation. The Netherlands and the Bank agreed to co-mingled funds in
a pooled account opened at the West Africa Central Bank (BCEAO) and common procedures for
implementation of project activities. The additional Dutch funding increased somewhat the
workload for the project implementation team regarding financial management and procurement.
PPEP2 implementation was successful to a greater extent because of good donor coordination,
strong stakeholder involvement and ownership, improved monitoring and management capacity
of the MESSRS and strong support by the Bank's supervision team. The PPEP2 continued the
promotion of innovative public-private partnerships in post-primary education, which was the
first such approach in francophone Africa. The PPEP2 piloted and consolidated several other
innovative activities, such as moving more responsibilities to the provincial Directorates, setting
up informative dissemination mechanisms for secondary school (principals, teachers and
students), starting student assessment exercises, improving the effectiveness of M&E in the
secondary sub-sector, and working with local (district and communities) authorities and
counterparts in areas such as HIV / AIDS prevention and "reaching-out" efforts, establishing
effectively-functioning school cantinas, and reaching out to local stakeholders to make secondary
education access more affordable for prospective students from the poorer families. These actions
will remain part of the key strategy to enhance Burkina Faso's capacity to offer affordable quality
secondary and tertiary education.
However the project's implementation encountered serious delays and the closing date had to be
extended by 33 months. The delays were caused by procurement problems related to acquisition
of: (i) Technical and Vocational Training equipment; (ii) Information Technology equipment;
(iii) textbooks (a key element of improving the quality of learning & teaching); (iv) school
science kits procured through international competitive bidding and (v) school construction using
innovative public-private partnership arrangements.
10


﻿Due to the impending closure of the financial credit provided by the Netherlands by the end of
2009 it was decided to give it disbursement priority. It was fully used by the end of 2009.
However, this also contributed to a delay in disbursement of the IDA credit.
The PDO was not modified but the PPEP2 required three extensions of its closing date (originally
31st of March 2010, while it closed on the 30th of December 2012; 33 months) due to serious
delays in procurement for technical and vocational training equipment, school construction using
PPP arrangements, textbooks and school science kits. During the midterm review minor changes
were made to the project components 2 (tertiary education distance learning facilities) and 4
(vocational training infrastructure and equipment). Also 2 PDO-related targets were reset due to
new demographic data becoming available. These changes made sense and were designed with
adequate consultation of stakeholders. However, most of the target values for the PDO and
intermediate indicators were not reset to take the significant extension of the closing date into
account and targets remained at their original (2009) value.
A positive factor was the integration of project implementation into the MESSRS, which
provided effective communication and monitoring. Also lessons from the PPEP1 were applied.
For example, the MESSR prepared an implementation action for the first year before the project
became effective in December 2006. The Secretary General (SG) of MESSRS was responsible
for overall PPEP2 supervision and management and reported directly to the Minister. Project
oversight and policy guidance was the responsibility of MESSRS' Technical Steering Committee
(TSC), which met regularly (monthly) and was chaired by the SG. The TSC was supported by an
inter-ministerial committee (IC), including representatives of the MESSRS and other relevant
ministries (including finance & budget, infrastructures, economy, and basic education. The
PPEP2 also supported the development of an effective Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) system
in order to improve data collection and communication. Overall this implementation structure
worked well, and provided the desired results. Ultimately though, project performance suffered
from weaknesses in procurement, and difficulties to achieve its quality of learning targets. To
address this problem, the project hired international technical assistance to accelerate the process
and to ensure quality and cost-efficiency. This speeded things up and made the procurement
process running more smoothly.
Significantly, a number of post-primary student assessments were piloted by the PPEP2. These
provided valuable implementation capacity building for the MESSR teams and (provincial)
regional directorates. It also allowed for strengthening the link between learning outcomes
(curricula) and teacher training. The assessment outcomes were shared and discussed with the
schools and local education directorates. This represents a significant achievement compared to
other countries in West Africa.
The Midterm Review (MTR) took place in Jan.-Feb. 2009. At the end of December 2009 the
PPEP2 IDA Credit Disbursement rate was 60%, and the Netherlands Grant was fully disbursed.
At the closing date of December 30, 2012 the IDA Credit was fully disbursed (with priority
because the Dutch funding was running out by the end of 2009). By January 2010 there were
serious delays in textbook procurement, distance learning activities and TVET implementation.
However, overall implementation of PPEP2 was rated as progressing satisfactorily because three
out of five PDO-related key indicators had reached or surpassed their target values. The
remaining two indicators (the gross intake rate and completion rate at lower secondary level)
were rated as moving satisfactorily toward their target values. At the time of the MTR the PPEP2
was judged to remain on a positive trend and on track to achieve its PDO. Also, at the time of
each of the three extensions of the PPEP2 closing date, it was judged that reaching its PDO was
11


﻿still achievable. The demographic results from the 2006 census caused a relatively minor change
in two PDO-related end-targets: (1) the gross rate for lower secondary student intake was adjusted
from 40 to 38 percent; and (2) the completion rate in lower secondary (grades 7-10) was adjusted
from 60 to 56 percent.
During the MTR the GoBF and the Bank noticed that the costs of the 2 VET-CEGs construction
were too high, largely due to the cost of connecting electricity. It was concluded that in order to
build at an acceptable cost, the Bank would have had to wait beyond the (original) closing date of
the project (December 2009). Therefore, the Government committed to finance the VET-CEGs
construction on its own budget and proposed that the IDA credit resources be used to acquire
TVET equipment for two existing VET centers. Following the MTR, the project Steering
Committee formalized this agreement. By the closing date of PPEP2 the GoBF had built the 2
VET CEGs and TVET equipment had been disseminated to the two existing VET Centers.
With regard to improving the quality of education, two learning assessments were undertaken.
The first assessment carried out in 2007 established baselines for math, science and French. The
2nd student assessment was conducted in 2009. It found that there was practically no overall
improvement in the quality-of-learning output at the lower secondary level. This was to be
expected, because although the quality-related inputs were delivered to the secondary education
system the quality of incoming primary graduates remained low. Also, both the primary and
(lower- and upper-) secondary sub-sectors were under increasing pressure to expand access.
Meanwhile the PPEP2 was working on the improvement of the MESSRS management capacity at
central and decentralized levels. International experience shows that a timeframe of three years is
simply too short to result in measurable quality of learning & teaching improvement when so
many inter-linked changes are being implemented. And international experience also indicates
that "measurable quality of learning and teaching improvements" take a longer lead-time than
three years to materialize (generally only after 5-6 years an effect shows up). It was therefore a
very positive development that the secondary education assessment exercises started under
PPEP2, and that capacity in these areas was strengthened, but it is found to be over-ambitious of
PPEP2 to expect a measurable quality improvement in the secondary cycles during the original
PPEP2 lifetime. With the extensions of the closing date (and a project implementation period of
6 years) it should have been possible to see some "quality effect" emerging. The trends for this
effect appear to be positive. However, that assessment data for the 2012-13 school year will only
be available by thye end of June 2013. The lesson that can be drawn from this is: (i) to have a
realistic lead-time for "quality of learning & teaching effects" to emerge (generally 5-6 years, or
at least the length of the relevant cycle); and (ii) to define realistic and sufficiently detailed
indicators related to "quality of learning & teaching" that are measurable, and can (preferably) be
"cross-checked" against other pedagogic indicators.
From the date of effectiveness up to June 2012 the project's PDO were rated as satisfactory. In
the last ISR the PPEP2 PDO were rated as moderately satisfactory. This was done considering
that the project had been extended three times, and because the last ISR took the overall project
performance during its implementation period into account. The project's IP was rated as
satisfactory from effectiveness to June 2010 when the second extension of the closing date was
requested (except in April 2008 when the IP was rated moderately satisfactory due to delays in
procurement.) From March 2011 to December 2012 (closing date) the IP was rated moderately
satisfactory. The project team was consistently optimistic that the PDOs could be achieved, and
that the implementation delays could be successfully addressed.  The last 24 months of
implementation saw impressive gains in project outcomes and procurement procedures were
12


﻿improved. By the end of December 2012 the PPEP2 had disbursed up to 100 percent of its net
Credit and project activities were almost completed.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design, implementation and outcomes are rated moderately satisfactory and are likely to be
sustainable in the medium and longer term.
Design. The original PPEP2 design also included support for the development of Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) systems and processes. The PAD provided a well-designed and detailed
results monitoring framework, which was supported by effective data collection instruments and
reporting. The responsibilities for M&E were clearly defined and followed up twice annually by
the joint supervision missions. The M&E system was also expanded by the MESSR to its
(provincial) local education directorates and it was linked to the primary education monitoring
system (coordinating with other ministries). Sources of data were annual surveys, education
yearbooks, education databases with inputs from all stakeholders. As much as possible up-to-
date information (including the piloted students' assessment outcomes) were used.
Implementation. Under the guidance of the Secretary General (MESSR) the PPEP2 M&E was
the shared responsibility of MESSRS central directorates. Data collection, validation, analysis,
and dissemination were the responsibility of the Directorate of Studies and Planning (DEP).
M&E was guided by the PPEP2's Project Implementation Manual. The M&E was conducted
through: (1) monthly meetings of MESSRS directorates and trimester meetings of the inter-
ministerial committee; (2) joint supervision missions; (3) the joint GoBF and IDA midterm
review of project implementation; and (d) annual data collection and specific studies (i.e. learning
assessments) by relevant units MESSRS units. Twice per year the MESSRS transmitted project
progress reports to IDA that were used during the supervision missions. Additional capacities
were developed during implementation to meet the requirements for effective M&E. At the
regional level, deconcentrated units of the MESSR were organized into single regional M&E
units.  These M&E units also coordinated among local key stakeholders, prepared and
implemented field visits and surveys, and ensured communication with the central level of the
MESSR.
Utilization. The PPEP2 helped to develop an improved M&E system, including report forms,
databases, and data collection sheets. Post-primary education data were collected in a timely
manner and analyzed. The data are published on a yearly basis. In addition to the staff training at
central and decentralized level of the MESSRS, different systems, tools and software were
acquired and have substantially improved the subsector management capacity. Planned activities
and budgetary implications were monitored, reviewed and discussed during joint supervision
mission (with aide-memoire content distributed). Specific working groups (e.g., quality, access,
fiduciary and management) guided progress. However, although progress was made in school
mapping preparation, it could not be completed by the end of the project.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The project's Financial Management in the ISRs was rated satisfactory up to December 2010
(after the first extension of the closing date). FM was rated "Moderately Satisfactory from April
2011 to July 2012. After that it was rated "Satisfactory" again. . The financial management risk
rating was "Substantial" during the first year of project implementation, and "Moderate" for the
13


﻿rest of the project life. The project's accounting system was acceptable to the Bank and staffed
with an experienced "accounting officer" and "clerk accountant." However, deficiencies were
identified in the monitoring of advances given to regional directorates. In addition, the funds
granted to the ministries and implementing agencies were only accounted for in some cases with
delays. The project submitted its financial monitoring reports generally on time and these were
generally acceptable (only the financial report due in December 2007 was submitted with
significant delay). The PPEP2 is fully disbursed (as of May 2013). The project audit reports
were all unqualified, except for the 2011 audit report. The issues raised were adequately
addressed.
Procurement was rated Moderately Satisfactory because procurement of project infrastructure
was severely delayed, due to: (i) the lack of capacity in the Region to conduct sufficient
procurement reviews, (ii) the use of national procurement procedures on top of the Bank's
procedures and (iii) the limited capacity of the local private sector partners. PPEP2 supported
the recruitment of senior FM and Procurement specialists who provided required technical
expertise to the MESSRS through the project's implementation technical unit.
Safeguard. The project was classified as Category "B" and complied with all safeguard
requirements. The project triggered two safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment (OP4.01)
and Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12). Under the project, an Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were prepared
including environmental and social checklists which were adopted for the implementation of the
EMP. The checklists were used to screen the whole construction program across the intervention
sites. Prior to commencement of construction, however, there was a lack of clarity on land issues,
notably identification and documentation of school domain, but this was later resolved. Apart
from this lack of clarity no other noticeable safeguard issues were identified during
implementation and none of the sub projects or other project activities led to involuntary
resettlement.
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) consistently rated the Project as satisfactory for overall
compliance with applicable operational policies. There were no significant deviations or waivers
from Bank safeguards, fiduciary policies and procedures during project implementation and the
project's overall rating on environmental and social safeguards is deemed satisfactory. The
Government took the initiative of resolving the land issue on all project intervention sites.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Project sustainability is rated as likely. The Project successfully piloted innovative approaches to
secondary education delivery, through the public-private partnerships. It also improved the
MESSRs management capacity which led to significant improvements in Monitoring and
Evaluation. PPEP2 was successful in addressing the post-primary education equity and gender
issues by targeting the 18 provinces with the lowest secondary enrolment rates, reducing the
family contributions to school fees, and by promoting girls' education. Although the PPEP2
outcomes are successful it is likely that the GoBF will require continued support for its post-
primary education sector because of the growing demand created by the project outcomes.
PPEP2 increased secondary education enrolment.     Regarding the quality enhancements
(component 2) the project was less successful, and did not achieve its performance targets. The
GoBF stated that it saw the improvement of quality in secondary education as a wider sectoral
problem (notably the low quality of primary education graduates entering lower secondary
education) that could in the end not be successfully resolved by the PPEP2. Therefore it decided
14


﻿to integrate its quality enhancement strategy for secondary education into a comprehensive
national Basic and Secondary Education Strategy (2012-21) which was developed with the Bank
and other donors.
The MESSRS has successfully developed textbook funds, and a reserve of books to sustain the
availability of textbooks. Teachers and students are now aware of the importance of textbooks
for learning and know where to find them. Although indicators intended for measuring quality of
education are not satisfactory, the teacher-training program and the development of three regional
inspectorates (Koudougou, Bobo Dioulasso and Ouahigouya), along with new student testing
approaches have built the foundation for further quality enhancement.
Public schools built in poor provinces and schools managed by municipalities and NGOs are fully
operational and adequately financed through government subsidies and low student fees. The
government commitment and its ability to mobilize resources directed at continuing to deliver
education services is crucial to sustainability. The GoBF demonstrated its capacity to mobilize
counterpart funds to work with stakeholders (including the private sector). In addition, the
PPEP2 has contributed to improved equity through targeted interventions for vulnerable groups
(in the 18 poorest performing provinces), and particularly for girls. The PPEP2 has encouraged
the equality of educational opportunity by improved targeting of school subsidies (free school
materials or school meals) to the neediest students. Burkina is also making efforts to improve its
macroeconomic situation.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of PDO. The PDO was clear, realistic, relevant and consistent with the GoBF's long-
term objectives as defined in its PRSP (Cadre Strat6gique de Lutte contre la Pauvret6 - CLSP -
2006-09), the outcomes of beneficiaries surveys (1996 and 2003) and the results-based Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) of July 2005. The PPEP2 supported the four pillars of the GoBF's
PRSP and was fully aligned with the CAS (both as described above.) The PPEP2 contributed to
promoting poverty reduction through increased support for human resources development. The
PDOs were formulated by the GoBF with support from the project preparation team using the
results from the PPEP1, extensive consultation with stakeholders, and thorough analysis of the
socio-economic and institutional aspects of the implementation of the project. A well-structured
set of six PDO-related indicators was included to measure progress and evaluate achievement of
the PDO, complemented by a set of 15 intermediate outcomes indicators. The relationship
between the PDO and indicators was well defined in terms of outcomes, output, and input targets.
A project implementation manual, including an action plan for the first implementation year, was
prepared and ready by effectiveness.
The secondary level as a whole had experienced modest enrolment progress: the GER increased
by less than 2 percentage points between 1999 and 2004. It has since improved with support
from PPEP2 to reach 29.9 percent in 2011 (32.3 percent in lower secondary and 10.7 percent in
upper secondary). The average secondary education GER for Sub-Saharan African countries in
2004 (44 percent in lower secondary and 29 percent in upper secondary) was about twice the rate
achieved by Burkina Faso. Enrolment in TVET is comparatively modest, comprising only 4
percent of total secondary enrolment. Beyond the challenges related to access, the quality of
education was comparatively low at the start of PPEP2, as evidenced by high dropout and
15


﻿repetition rates (about 25 percent). It was estimated that 65 percent of the grade 6 students did
not acquired the basic competencies as specified in the curriculum.  Inadequate learning
achievement at the primary level was a key cause for the disappointing student performance in
lower secondary. The low quality of education was worsened by the shortage of qualified
teachers, particularly in science and math. In addition, the relevance of the curriculum was also
an issue.
Relevance of Design. The relevance of the PPEP2 design is rated to be substantial. The original
project design was well-targeted on the needs of the post-primary education sector, and was
focused on addressing clearly-defined sub-sector key issues. The PDO and indicator framework
were linked closely and coherently to the project interventions. The project appraisal document
(PAD) provided a detailed description of the Project's expected medium- and long-term benefits,
stressing the positive links between improvements in the quality of secondary education, as well
as improving secondary education for girls, in rural and poorly covered areas, and poverty
reduction. The Project drew on prior IDA experience and lessons learned in the education sector
in Burkina Faso. The GoBF (MESSRS) concluded during the MTR that the quality improvement
of secondary education (component 2 related) could not be fully addressed by the project, but
required a wider sectoral approach. One of the main problems was the low quality of the primary
education graduates who entered secondary education, which fell outside the scope of PPEP2.
The Project took an innovative approach to education issues based on the context and experiences
in other regions, particularly those in Latin America. The innovative approaches included the
Public-Private-Partnership; leveraging funding from other donors; prioritizing quality of learning
at a time when access was the main focus; mainstreaming implementation in Government
Ministry rather than setting up a PIU; and building a sustainable M&E system for the government.
PPEP2 built on the piloting of public-private partnerships to address the high recurrent costs of
secondary education the GoBF faced. The approach included the private sector, municipalities
and NGOs in supporting post-primary education management in order to reduce Government's
recurrent costs and to allow for a more efficient use of education public spending. This
partnership built on the past and current context in which the private sector had already been
involved in post-primary education. Also, the PPEP2 contributed to improving secondary
students' and teachers' awareness regarding preventive measures against HIV / AIDS infections,
including reproductive health and rights, and other diseases in collaboration with the AIDS
Coordinating Committee (CMLS) of MESSRS. This included integration of school health,
reproductive health and rights, and HIV/AIDS issues into the curriculum, support for voluntary
counseling and testing campaigns, and peer education programs. The MESSRS also provided
targeted support for school health activities and for orphans and children affected by HIV / AIDS.
In addition, the PPEP2 started up the student learning assessment exercises, which are still
ongoing. The first results have been analyzed and shared with the Directorates and schools. This
will play a significant role in improving the overall quality of learning and teaching in Burkina
Faso at the secondary school levels.
Relevance of implementation. The relevance of implementation of PPEP2 is rated modestly
satisfactory. There was an over-ambitious expectation that the PPEP2 outcomes could be
achieved in about 3 years. In fact the PPEP2 required three extensions of the closing date,
totaling 33 months. Overall implementation went smoothly and the project was successful in
starting to achieve the majority of its desired outcomes. The main causes for the closing date
extension were weakness in procurement processing, and the fact that the capacity of the local
private sector participants was insufficient to respond within the required timeframe for execution
of activities. This was addressed during implementation, but required a lot of time. The last ISR
16


﻿stated that the extensions were justified since they were requested to ensure completion of some
activities, delayed mainly due to procurement weaknesses. These included (i) the construction
program; textbooks acquisition; and (iii) the purchase of Information Technology equipment.
The PPEP2 had a satisfactory risk assessment. The PAD effectively integrated risks, difficulties,
and options to be considered during implementation, particularly those related to improving
efficient use of resources and a reduction of the contributions of the poorest families (in the 18
targeted poorest performing provinces). This acquired the support and cooperation of all key
stakeholders. The Bank assistance strategy linked the PPEP2 closely to the results-based CAS
(2006-09) and the GoBF's PRSP.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
It is important to mention that the Project achievements will be assessed based on data of school
year 2011-2012 because the current school year (2012-2013) data are not yet available.
The gains to which the PPEP2 contributed in access to secondary education for the poorest
families in the 18 provinces, the wider benefits for the secondary education system, and the
improvement in the secondary education sub-sector management compensated partially for the
more "systemic quality-related" shortcomings of the post-primary education sub-sectors. The
PPEP2 contributed significantly to improved teachers' capacity by promoting innovative
professional development approaches. This approach was comprehensive and systemic, and
targeted at teachers in classrooms and their direct support and supervisors (headmasters,
pedagogic advisors, and inspectors). More specifically, in addition to the pre-service training
reinforcement, teachers received a large variety of relevant in-service trainings, including training
on how (i) to deal with large, potentially heterogeneous groups; (ii) to better use new textbooks.
This training was completed by a teacher guide prepared; (iii) to promote girls' participation in
class and organization of remedial classes for girls; and (iv) training /sensitization on right
approach of repetition. The repetition training was completed with a legal text regulating
repetition in secondary education and forbidden repetition at primary within the same cycle. The
PPEP2 also implemented a number of learning assessments from 2007-2010 for French
Language, Mathematics, Natural Sciences and History-Geography in secondary school grades 8
(5eme), 9 (4eme), and 12 (lere). These assessments did not show a significant improvement in
quality of learning at those levels. In hindsight this could hardly be expected, since the timeframe
for quality of learning effects was too short to provide measurable impact.

The project achieved its PDOs and has been instrumental in improving access to secondary
education. Five out of six PDO outcome indicators surpassed their target values: (1) the gross
enrollment rate (GER) in lower secondary in the 18 less-covered provinces increased from 8.4 (in
2004) to 20.2 percent by the end of the project, (2) girls' GER in lower secondary increased from
17.2 (in 2004) to 31.7 percent, (3) the completion rate in lower secondary increased from 45 (in
2004) to 61 percent , (4) school fees supported by families were reduced from 30,000 FCFA per
year per student (in 2004) to 5,174 FCA in public lower secondary schools in the 18 less-covered
provinces; and (5) the share of education budget provided to the MESSRS increased from 28 (in
2004) to 39.5 percent (2012). The 6th PDO performance indicator (gross intake rate in the first
grade of lower secondary) was "on track" by the end of December 2012 and based on available
data it was judged as "likely" by the project supervision team that it would be achieved during the
2012-13 school year.
1 All baseline data calculation was based on 1996 population census while the actual value was based on
2006 census
18


﻿Eight intermediate indicators out of fifteen were achieved or surpassed. The remaining ones are
related to the quality improvement (component 2) indicators such as the repetition rate and
student learning outcomes. The PPEP2 supervision team concluded in the last ISR that the
project did much to improve performance in the domain of quality, even though the results show
that it was insufficient. The fact that teachers' training has greatly surpassed the target (154%
compared to the target of 80%) is an attempt by the project to address this quality issue. In
addition, the availability of textbooks has been improved. Textbook-student ratio has been
exceeded for the upper secondary (on average 6.6 textbooks per student compared to a target of 2
per student). However, the target of 6-8 textbooks per student was not reached for lower
secondary education. Nevertheless, the project helped to design and disseminate national
textbooks, to develop a related practical strategy, to acquire copyrights, and helped to put in place
a structural funding system to print textbooks when needed. These actions will make textbook
reproduction easier and faster. The project also funded the production of electronic teaching
materials to improve science teaching.
The PPEP2 achievement of its PDO was substantial, particularly with respect to access to low
secondary education. The project disbursement rate of the IDA Credit was 100 percent. As
stated above, five out of the six PDO indicators were achieved or surpassed their target. The
remaining one, gross intake rate of lower secondary is on track to be achieved likely in the current
school year 2012-13. The PPEP2 supervision team concluded at the time of project closing (Dec.
2012) that despite the observed delays the progress toward the achievement of the PDO was
substantial. Around 46,000 additional students could access secondary education (although
learning outcomes remain comparatively low.) A large share of the school construction program
was completed (even though the completion of the last portion was significantly delayed).
3.3 Efficiency
The project constructed 663 classrooms exceeding the initial target of 478 classrooms to be built
and the efficiency analysis points to a relatively high cost-efficiency for school construction. A
cost analysis for construction performed at the Mid-term review shows relatively low costs
compared to the average prices obtained by the construction agency Baaro Faso in 2007 and
consistency with international construction costs of classrooms in similar countries. For the
acquisition of textbooks, the project felt short of the target and the actual prices for textbooks
exceed the projected unit costs significantly. However, according to an evaluation of the textbook
acquisition the obtained prices are still considerably below catalogue prices, and the analysis
explains the exceed in costs relative to the projected by increase in inflation and particular due to
changes in oil prices, the price of raw paper, increase in the cost of maritime transport and
depreciation of the local currency.
As part of the economic evaluation, the direct benefit from construction of lower and upper
secondary schools is quantified based on the increase in future earnings for those graduating
showing a NPV for school construction of US$ 121 million and an IRR of 7% (see Annex 3 for
details of the analysis). In addition to the direct economic benefit for the additional students
graduating, several other benefits prevail from the general higher level education in the country.
The expansion of secondary education increases the foundation of people suitable for higher
education and provides important social benefits. Furthermore, the construction of school
infrastructure has helped reducing the geographic inequalities in access to education and has
increased the awareness of barriers to girls' education.
19


﻿In addition to teaching facilities the construction also includes establishment of school canteens.
The provision of food helps maintain a larger number of students in the system, as the guarantee
of a daily meal is a source of motivation for students. A survey from the parents' associations
(APE) shows that the development of school canteens has provided significant support for
reducing repetition and dropout. Less hunger and the guarantee of a meal during the school day
promotes better learning. This has a positive effect on the repetition and dropout rates. The
establishment of canteens is thus expected to positively affect internal efficiency of the education
system.
Component 2 focuses on increasing quality of learning by providing textbooks and strengthening
teachers' training. These benefits are difficult to quantify and are expected to prevail only
gradually. The higher quality of education is expected to improve skills of the graduates and
thereby increase their productivity and future income. Furthermore, an increase in quality of
education can positively affect retention rates and thereby increase efficiency of the education
system. Despite the positive outcomes provided under this component, the overall return may be
lower than anticipated at the outset, as the project did not achieve all of its performance targets
for this component.
Finally, the project enhanced the capacity of the MESSR, which amongst others have led to more
efficient management at the central and regional levels, increased capacity with respect to
planning and financial management, as well as improved data collection and analysis.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: moderately satisfactory
The overall outcome rating of the PPEP2 is moderately satisfactory. The PPEP2 financed
relevant and important improvements and capacity enhancing activities that were mostly
achieved, except for the quality-related aspects. Also, the implementation of the project had to be
extended tree times for a total of 33 months. This is an extraordinary lengthy period, which could
have been prevented if earlier and stronger action had been taken by the GoBF and the Bank,
notably during the MTR. The project PDO and implementation period were ambitious given the
originally planned timeframe, even though the project preparation team had based its assessment
on the successful outcomes of the PPEPl. The project design was appropriate, and in the end the
project delivered significant benefits for the secondary education sub-sector. Overall, the PPEP2
achieved its objectives efficiently with some shortcomings in implementation and in terms of
achieving quality gains. However, these can be considered moderate in the context of the project
as a whole and its significant achievements.  It should also be kept in mind that the
implementation environment in Burkina Faso remains extremely challenging. This puts a heavy
burden on all key stakeholders and implementers. Often these factors are not sufficiently taken
into account when assessing the achievements of projects in the region. Based on these
arguments and in summary the overall outcome rating for the PPEP2 is moderately satisfactory.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
An estimated 46,000 additional students from mainly the poorest performing 18 provinces
enrolled in secondary education as a result of the achievements of PPEP2. The cost for secondary
education students from the poorest families was significantly decreased due to project
20


﻿interventions. In terms of poverty impact the PPEP2 contributed to all four (as previously
mentioned) pillars of the poverty reduction strategy of the GoBF.
The PPEP2 used the outcomes of social assessments conducted in 1997 and 2000, the results of
the PPEP1, the Basic Education Support Project, and the PRSP. The main findings of these
assessments involved economic costs, opportunity costs particularly for girls, and a high level o f
mobility. The Burkinabe relocate frequently (28% of the population 10 years or older has
migrated at least once, of whom more than half are females) for employment, education, or
marriage opportunities. The PEPP2 activities focused on: (i) rural and poverty-stricken urban
areas and the 18 provinces with the lowest secondary education; (ii) enrolling more girls through
such specific actions as improving physical access to schools (constructing additional classrooms
so that lower secondary grades could be offered in all 351 communes of the country), providing
running water, and providing separate sanitary facilities for girls; (iii) providing schools in more
locations so persons who move about the country will be able to continue their education; (iv)
developing new approaches for VET programs tailored to local needs and the economy; (v)
expanding nutrition and school canteen programs as an incentive for enrollment and retention in
poor areas; (vi) providing textbooks at reduced cost to alleviate the costs incurred by parents (at
the time over FCFA 5,000 per student per year in lower secondary); (vii) reducing opportunity
costs to parents with a flexible school calendar that avoids overlap with peak rural activity
periods; and (viii) strengthening public-private partnerships while attracting other social
stakeholders (NGOs) in social services and infrastructure investments.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
Institutional strengthening of MESSRS has led to real changes and more efficient management at
the central (ministry) level as well as at the provincial (regional) level. The provision of
administrative blocks at the local level, close to the secondary schools, improved the supervision
and pedagogic support, as well as the M&E quality. In summary the PPEP2 substantially
strengthened the MESSRS management and M&E capacity regarding educational planning, staff
and financial management, and communication with key stakeholders on policy matters. Also,
data collection & analysis significantly improved due to PPEP2.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The focus by the PPEP2 on the 18 poorest performing provinces improved their capacity to
participate more effectively in the policy dialogue between the regional stakeholders and with the
central government institutions. Overall their capacity to formulate their own needs and planning
improved. This will impact their future participation in making improvements in their secondary
and tertiary education sub-sectors.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
The MESSRS organized several national seminars (workshops) during project implementation (in
Bobo-Dioulasso, Ouagadougou and other provincial administrative centers) with the key
stakeholders of PPEP2 (secondary school Directors, teachers, provincial education directorates,
Students Parents Organizations). These seminars (workshops) aimed to discuss PPEP2 progress,
outcomes and opinions from the local levels. These workshops had an intensive participatory
character and provided major benefits for the MESSR implementation team. The MESSRS
21


﻿provided some examples of this participatory approach, which are included here to provide better
insight.
General opinion of beneficiaries (contribution of the MESSRS)
Without the strong contribution of PPEP2, the implementation of activities and the strengthening
of institutions would not have happened so quickly. In addition, the PPEP2 has improved access,
quality, and the institutional capacity of the secondary education system.
Opinion of an inhabitant of Kp6r6 department (contribution of the MESSRS):
The Kp6r6 department is an extremely remote and difficult to access area, located in the province
of Noumbiel in the southern horn of Burkina Faso, 5 km from the border with C6te dIvoire and
Ghana. FM radio and telephone networks are those of the two countries, no secondary school
facilities were there and the nearest secondary school is 4 hours away by an all-wheel drive
vehicle depending on the seasons. Commune without educated people, the only educated person
from there, was a teacher who was the first mayor of the town. At his death, he was succeeded by
someone coming from the village and who has a Primary School Certificate (CEP). Under the
PPEP2 Kp6r6 received its first secondary school in the 2008-09 school year. The school promoted
its first cohort from the middle school's certificate (BEPC) in 2011-12 and got 10 out of 21
candidates passing. "In our view, we can say that the PPEP2 actions were fruitful and have
durably strengthened the development in Kp6r6 and in 10 other communities.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The risks identified during project preparation were mostly appropriate: all four risks were rated
moderate. There was an additional risk that was not identified: the risk of not achieving the
intended quality gains within the original timeframe due to (a) the complexity of monitoring
quality progress; and (b) the weak institutional capacity of the MESSRS to define and change
quality related factors within the education sector, and specifically at the secondary and tertiary
levels.
The fiduciary risk was appropriately rated as substantial due to the weak overall financial
management system that was in place at the time. However, the project successfully managed to
improve this capacity, building upon the results of the PPEP1 and providing additional technical
assistance through supervision support by IDA. The risk of delays in project implementation due
to the weak procurement capacity at the local level was also not recognized. During
implementation the GoBF with support of the Bank analyzed and addressed these problems to
prevent future negative effects on the development of the post-primary education sector.
22


﻿5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: moderately satisfactory
Bank Performance. The Bank preparation team included the appropriate technical experts to
appraise the PPEP2. In-depth studies and analytic work was undertaken during project
preparation to formulate the PDO and intermediary outcomes. Extensive consultation with
education sector key stakeholders and other donors were assured and contributed to the quality of
the project design and monitoring indicator framework. PPEP2 preparation took several months
and was closely coordinated with the MESSR at the technical and political levels. This
contributed to broad political commitment to the project concept and design. PPEP2 was
appropriately aligned with the PRSP and the results-based CAS. However, the complexity of
quality improvement was underestimated, and the procurement weaknesses played a large role in
the significant implementation delays. These bottlenecks were insufficiently addressed at an
early stage during implementation (i.e. during the MTR), and caused problems later down the line
that could have been prevented. It can also be concluded that the design of PPEP2 was slightly
over ambitious to expect measurable outcome quality results at such a short timeframe.
(b) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
Quality of Bank supervision. The Bank recognized the need to provide intensive supervision
support to the GoBF and focus the scope of its efforts narrowly on the project activities, while at
the same time maintaining a productive policy dialogue on restructuring the post-primary
education sector. Bank supervision also linked the indicator results framework explicitly to the
PPEP2 investments, and it worked closely with the Netherlands (as participating donor). The
Bank also conducted 13 supervision missions over the implementation period from the 3 1st of
March 2006 to 30th of December 2012 and provided an adequate supervision and reporting of the
project's progress to achieve its intended outcomes. However, as mentioned previously, the
substantial implementation delays linked to procurement weaknesses should have been
recognized earlier and addressed more vigorously, notably during the MTR. In the end the
extension did also create too little alarm among the senior Bank management.
There were two TTLs during project implementation, both based in Burkina Faso, and having
both built excellent relationships of trust and respect with their government counterparts. This
facilitated the communication and relevance of interventions, and increased the productivity of
the supervision mission. The supervision team composition was also comprehensive and stable
and always included education, procurement and financial management, and M&E specialists.
This continuity helped maintain consistency in advice to the GoBF over the implementation
period. Minor project restructuring changes and the three extensions of the closing date were
aimed at addressing issues encountered during implementation as well as those that would
enhance the development impact of the project.
However, the Bank could have done a better job of systematically documenting the weaknesses
of each component and sub-component and analyze their quantitative and qualitative effect on the
implementation progress of each component in the supervision reports. It is the opinion of the
23


﻿ICR team that this could have been done more rigorously and more detailed. Also the quality and
extent of detailed coverage of project progress of the aide-memoires was fluctuating too much
over the lifetime of the project. It was difficult for the ICR team to easily follow component
progress based on reading the aide-memories. This made it difficult to follow progress of the
project. Moreover, it was not clear if and how often the joint Bank-GoBF-donor supervision
missions visited the regional (local) MESSRS offices to inform the local management officials,
and if these key stakeholders were regularly provided with copies of the aide-memoires.
However, there is no doubt that the PPEP2 achieved substantial results under difficult and
complex implementation conditions.  The Bank's supervision support and, especially, the
excellent relationships of the two TTLs with the GoBF institutions and key sector stakeholders
contributed in no small measure to this success.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
Based on the discussion of the Bank's quality at entry and the quality of its supervision support,
and in addition the outcomes of the project and the Bank's overall support for the preparation
process and project outcomes, the overall Bank performance is rated as moderately
satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The Borrower's performance during the PPEP2's preparation is rated as satisfactory. There was
close cooperation between the GoBF and the Bank's project preparation team. Also, the GoBF
actively promoted donor harmonization. The MESSRS was involved the preparation of PPEP1
and other education sector project over the previous years and this practical experience helped the
MESSRS to be effective in the preparation process. The project implementation was well
prepared by ensuring that the implementation manual was ready and by putting forth one year
action plan. The GoBF and notably the MESSR participated in updating the PRSP and provided
inputs for the results-based new CAS (2005). In addition, technical studies were done for the
project's targeting ion the 18 poorest performing provinces. The GoBF and the Bank participated
jointly in sessions organized around the country to inform all key stakeholders about PPEP2, its
objectives, components and the expected outcomes (indicator framework baselines and targets).
However, the implementation of PPEP2 was delayed severely and the GoBF (MESSRS) should
have taken stronger action at an earlier stage to address the underlying problems for the delay
(procurement issues and weak management & implementation capacity at the local levels).
During the MTR both the GoBf and the Bank did not come up with sufficiently effective changes
to speed up project implementation. And after the first extension of the closing date, this
situation continued.  There appear to have been some political bottlenecks during the
implementation, but this should not have prevented the MESSRS to take appropriate measures at
the technical level. By the end of the project, all agreed activities post-restructuring were
implemented and the project had adequate resources available for these activities. Based on these
conclusions and taking into account what has been presented in the earlier sections of this ICR the
rating for the Borrower's performance is moderately satisfactory.
24


﻿(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
The PPEP2 was implemented by the Ministry of Secondary and Tertiary Education and Scientific
Research (MESSRS). At the central level PPEP2 activities, monitoring of performance and
political guidance was under the direct responsibility of the Secretary General (SG). The project
implementation unit was integrated into the MESSRS services (units). At the regional level
(provinces) a Regional Steering Committee (CRP) was set up. For coordination between the
various Ministries an Inter ministerial Committee (IC), chaired by the Minister of MESSRS was
providing coordination guidance. This worked very well and provided effective information
exchange and prompt decision-making mechanisms.
In general, the implementing MESSRS was successful in ensuring the day-to-day operation,
coordinating the communications with the 18 targeted provinces, and monitoring the
effectiveness and outcomes of PPEP2. The coordination activities included the operational
services at the central and decentralized levels of the MESSRS. Although the MESSRS
experienced staff turnovers it continued to be effective in executing the required project activities.
The three project closure extensions were needed mainly because of procurement delays and
capacity problems in the 18 provinces. There were also some social disruptions in the country,
which could have played a minor role in delaying implementation, but this could not be verified.
There were no financial management and audit issues pending. PPEP2 complied with all its
covenants. The M&E system was functioning well and provided sufficient detail of information
that was relevant for project performance. Data collection, analysis and dissemination in the
secondary education sub-sector improved significantly during the PPEP2 implementation period
and the project was instrumental in this change. Available data show positive trends and point to
satisfactory sustainability for the project key activities and objectives. This is one of the
significant achievements resulting from PPEP2 in which the MESSRS played a critical role.
However, the processing of this information in the aide-memoires and the ISRs was from time to
time "uneven" and did not always provide the same level of detail as was desirable for measuring
detailed project performance per component and activity. In addition, even though data for the
2012-13 school year would be available by the end of June 2013, they are not available at the
time of the completion of this ICR. Moreover, the project implementation was delayed by the
shortcomings in procurement managed in the Implementing Agency. Based on these
arguments and on information provided in other sections of this ICR the implementation agency
performance was rated as moderately satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
In light of the GoBF performance and its impact on implementation as discussed above, the
overall performance of the Borrower is rated as moderately satisfactory. The PPEP2's PDOs
were achieved and five out of six key indicators were achieved. The results exceeded in some
cases the outcome target values. Eight out of the intermediary indicators were also achieved as
previously mentioned in other sections of this ICR. However, in terms of quality improvements
in secondary education learning outcomes the project fell short, even though a number of quality-
25


﻿related inputs were successfully delivered. On the one hand the expectation that learning quality
progress can be measured over such a short time frame was too optimistic. On the other hand,
with three extensions of a total of 33 months, the project could have delivered better results in the
quality enhancing areas of secondary education. Secondary education teacher performance
improved, the curriculum reform was undertaken (but fell short of its desired results), textbooks
were delivered, and two assessments were executed during the project implementation period.
These project achievements did not translate into a measurable quality improvement in learning.
Also, the repetition rates in lower and upper secondary education did not significantly decrease
and remain comparatively high. In summary, the PPEP2 was an innovative project and was
executed in a challenging political and physical environment. This should also be taken into
account, as previously mentioned. Based on these arguments the overall Borrower performance
is rated as moderately satisfactory.
6. Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)
The PEPP2 design, preparation and implementation took into account the following lessons from
the performance of IDA-financed projects in Burkina Faso and other relevant projects, as well as
sector work on post-primary education. This included the lessons learned from the PPEP1, upon
which the preparation and design of PPEP2 was based.
Lesson 1. Provide a more detailed and comprehensive performance (outcome) framework
with adequate alternatives when "political and / or technical course corrections" are
needed. Sub-sector reforms are as challenging as sector reforms, notably in Sub-Saharan
countries where the stakes for stakeholders (both from the demand as from the supply side) are so
high. This argues for: (a) a more intensive and detailed action plan at the start of the project, with
more specific indicators, notably when there is limited capacity among the local and decentralized
levels, where the reform impact should actually happen; (b) a more intensive Monitoring &
Evaluation effort, with appropriate detailed technical studies before, during and at the end of a
project; and (c) a realistic time frame for implementation in view of the complexities of
measuring real progress in learning quality outcomes.
Lesson 2. Provide adequate technical analysis of the management and implementation
capacity at local levels of the education system where the reforms / changes really ought to
happen and analyze if appropriate incentives for strong ownership are in place or planned.
The decentralized levels in general in the poorest countries need a lot more careful study to see
how the incentives to reform can be strengthened. Their capacity and "ownership" of project
implementation is too often over-estimated and the availability, deployment, and utilization of
key resources at the regional, district, and school levels are often too scarce. A project design
with fewer and more focused components would have been better for the post-primary education
sector especially since the decentralization policy was not yet fully formulated at the time of
project preparation.
Lesson 3. Provide sufficient resources and management supervision for government-led
procurement processes and set realistic goals for the results and timeframe of the
procurement activities. The necessity of three extension of the closing date of the PPEP2
project demonstrated the need to take a closer look at the procurement bottlenecks during project
preparation (notably when this takes place with limited capacity at the decentralized local levels).
It would also argue for an independent review process that can decisively take action when delays
occur.
Lesson 4. When Public-Private Partnerships are involved in construction and / or school
management the preparation process should ensure detailed procedural agreements and
26


﻿goals for performance by the private sector stakeholders, notably when this is happening at
the local level. Since many government agencies are not too familiar with the procedures and
(real) objectives of the private actors, the project preparation should involve extensive technical
exchanges between the public and private partners, and integrate this into the project performance
and incentives structures.
Lesson 5. In (sub) sector reform project more detailed standards for measuring school
performance in terms of quality of learning and teaching, and of the overall performance of
the school, should be developed. This would involve technical and standardized agreements on
some type of "school Development Report", with appropriate monitoring indicators.
Additionally there should be adequate aggregated monitoring and reporting to the district,
regional and central levels, so that the decision-making process regarding the enhancement of
quality can be improved. In most cases the complexity of these mechanisms is under estimated in
bank projects and insufficient provisions (indicators, technical studies, reporting of outcomes,
follow-up decision-making) are planned.
Lesson 6. More attention should be given in the Bank's project preparation process to the
need for sustainability after project closure. This could be first and foremost a more technical
dedicated section in the PAD and in the Borrower's project implementation plan that deals with
the technical and political issues involved in ensuring adequate sustainability. Such information
should discuss in detail the implications of sustainability and how the project implementation can
contribute to this over time. Additional "sustainability-linked" indicators should be part of the
performance indicator framework. At present the sustainability factors are too often presented as
an "afterthought" and not given enough technical underpinning.
Specific lessons from PPEP2
Lesson 7. Project that aim to improve the quality of learning and teaching at primary and/or
secondary levels should define: (1) to have a realistic lead-time for "quality of learning &
teaching effects" to emerge (generally 5-6 years, or at least the length of the relevant cycle); and
(2) to have realistic and sufficiently-detailed (PDO and intermediate) indicators related to "quality
of learning & teaching" that are measurable, and can (preferably) be "cross-checked" against
other pedagogic indicators. Overall the monitoring and evaluation of quality improvements (in
learning, teaching as well as management) should be better documented and based on measurable
realistic outcomes. More often than not the complexity of "measuring quality impact" is under-
estimated in Bank education projects.
Lesson 8. Donor harmonization was important for PPEP2 overall quality. However, this may
lead to more complex coordination mechanisms and cause delays due to the specific donor-
related administrative requirements (such as financial management, disbursement and financial
performance reporting). IN the case of PPEP2 the lead donor was IDA. However, the Dutch co-
financing required priority with disbursement. These different priority-conditions may cause
delays in implementation.

﻿Annex 2. Outputs by Component
The baseline and subsequent values were calculated based on population estimates from the 1996
population census. These population estimates were recently revised according to the 2006
population census, leading to a decrease in the original indicator of the secondary GER value due
to an increase in the absolute population figures.
The key features of the project that helped in the achievement of the outcome indicators
were:
Component 1. Increased Access to Secondary Education. The construction program has been
implemented as agreed, as well as activities to influence the demand for education. The
construction of equipped CEGs in all departments and in big villages and in peri-urban areas
throughout the country and the reduction of school fees supported by parents are also key
achievement of the project. Bringing CEGs to villages is a key factor for improving girls'
participation in post-primary education as they are often deprived of secondary education because
of distance, for various reasons. Based on evolving needs of classrooms, the Bank and the
Government have modified the types of construction. Overall the number of classrooms built is
more than expected. 122 CEG were built, including 10 CEG for the private sector in urban areas
as planned. In addition, 145 classrooms were built for the expansion of existing schools, five
high Secondary education schools (lyc6es) were built. These classrooms have received about
46,000 additional students in secondary education. 42 boreholes (compared to an expected target
of 50, were completed. The other 8 were not built due to an unsuccessful search for water on the
identified sites. In addition to classrooms construction, awareness-raising/sensitization activities
were organized to boost education from the demand-side, particularly for girls. On an
experimental basis, 460 schools received subsidies to finance their operating cost. In 18 regions
with less than 13% of GER in lower secondary, canteens were established along with students'
parents associations.
Component 1 (Increased Access to Secondary Education) achieved its overall objectives. These
classrooms have received about 46 000 additional secondary education students. A total of 42
boreholes (compared to an expected target of 50) were completed, the difference was due to an
absence of water at the designated sites. In addition to classrooms construction, awareness-
raising/sensitization activities were organized to boost education from the demand-side,
particularly for girls. On an experimental basis, 460 schools received subsidies to finance their
operating cost. In 18 regions with less than 13% of GER in lower secondary, canteens were
established along with students' parents associations.
Component 2.     Improve the Quality of Post-Primary Education.      Regarding quality
improvement, achievements of some sub-components have been noticeable, but overall they
remain less than expected. Four of the six sub-components have been executed with more
success, but one of the remaining two, the curriculum reform was marginally implemented,
mainly due to lack of institutional capacity. The expected trainings in this area were fully
completed. With regard to the last sub-component, notably the provision of information and
communication technologies (ICT) in tertiary education, it was only partially executed.
29


﻿Under component 2, the project provided 955 500 lower secondary textbooks and 362 694 upper
secondary textbooks, which is below the target of 1,400,000 and 600,000 books respectively. The
unit costs for textbooks were US$4.6 (FCFA 2 205) for lower secondary textbooks and US$9.7
(FCFA 4 697) for upper secondary textbooks. These prices are relatively high and substantially
above the projected costs for textbooks, which were based on the prices from PEPPI. However,
according to an evaluation of the textbook acquisition the obtained prices are still considerably
below catalogue prices, and the analysis explains the exceed in costs relative to the projected by
increase in inflation and particular due to changes in oil prices, the price of raw paper, increase in
the cost of maritime transport and depreciation of the local currency. 2  However, the
implementation of key activities was delayed over the project's life span mainly due to lack of
procurement capacities, and subsequently required three closing date extensions.
Regarding the quality enhancements (component 2) the project was less successful, and did not
achieve its performance targets. As stated above, during the MTR the GoBF came to see the
improvement of quality in secondary education as a wider sectoral problem (notably hampered by
the low quality of primary education graduates entering lower secondary education). It concluded
that in the end the quality problem not be fully resolved by the PPEP2 as expected and decided to
address it through a comprehensive national strategy (PDSEB 2012-2021) integrating primary
and secondary education. This strategy was prepared with the support of development partners,
including the Bank.
Component 3.     Institutional strengthening of MESSRS.    Implementation of the third
component has substantially strengthened the capacity of MESSRS n: (i) Educational planning,
(ii) Financial and personnel management and (iii) Post-primary education sub-sector coordination
and policy dialogue. Moreover, the project has helped developing an improved M&E system,
including report forms, databases, and data collection sheets. Education data are collected in a
timely manner, analyzed, and statistics are published on yearly basis. In addition to the personnel
training at central and decentralized level, different systems, tools and software were acquired
and have substantially improved the subsector management capacity. However, despite progress
in school map preparation, it was not completed.
Moreover, the project contributed to an improved M&E system, including improved data
collection, analysis and reporting procedures.  This substantially improved the subsector
management capacity.
Component 4. Expand Vocational Education and Training -VET. The national policy of
TVET was prepared and adopted. A competency framework and new professional training
courses were adopted and teachers trained as planned. However, the pilot of an apprenticeship
fund to establish a partnership with private enterprises was not carried out and the plan to
construct 2 VET CEG infrastructures was dropped for reasons mentioned above. Corresponding
resources were used to acquire technical equipment for existing TVET centers.
As described above the output indicator related to the increase of secondary VET training through
construction of two VET-CEGs (Vocational Education and Training lower secondary schools)
was not achieved due to high construction cost. Changes were proposed by the GoBF, which
2 Resume du rapport et analyse des manuels
30


﻿constructing the two schools on its own budget and use the designated PEP2 resources for VET
equipment for existing schools.
Originally a total of 478 classrooms of various designs were to be constructed. Due to changes in
access regulations (less costly access and enrolment at secondary level) the architectural design of
the constructions was adapted. This allowed for the construction of more infrastructure which
increased the capacity of student places to be accommodated in the system so that the growing
demand could be better met. In total PPEP2 delivered 663 classrooms (see table below) for
secondary education.

The costs variances between the different types of infrastructure are presented in the table below.
It shows that the average unit costs for construction of municipal colleges (lower secondary),
decongestion colleges and forages was respectively 16, 13 and 22 percent, which can be
explained by price increases for various materials and inflation over the life of the project.

Pedagogic materials and textbooks acquisition. In total PPEP2 acquired for the secondary
education level learning and teaching: (a) 80 pedagogic kits; (b) 2 million textbooks (including
teacher / teaching guides) (note ICR team: however the PPEP2 output fell short on this, see
efficiency analysis); (c) and put in place a mechanisms for delivering less costly textbooks to
students, notably those in the 18 poorest performing provinces). The planned costs for the
acquisition of 2 million textbooks for lower and upper secondary schools (respectively grades 6-
10 and 11-13) amounted to FCFA 3.634 million. The real costs after implementation amounted
to FCFA 3,811 million (5.3 percent higher). Based on data analysis the PPEP2 achieved a
coverage of slightly less (19 percent) than 6-8 textbooks per student for lower secondary, and for
the upper secondary level the project surpassed its indicator of 2 textbooks per student. These
numbers were based on the actual numbers of secondary school student enrolled in the 2011-12
school year.
31


﻿The PPEP2 component 2 (Improve the Quality of Post-Primary Education) partially
achieved its objectives. Four of the six sub-components were executed with more success, but
one of the remaining two, the curriculum reform was marginally implemented, due mainly to the
short timeframe and lack of institutional capacity, even though the related staff training and
technical assistance in this area were fully completed. The last sub-component (2f: tertiary
education distance learning facilities), notably the provision of information and communication
technologies (ICT) was only partially executed due to changes proposed by the GoBF.
Fiduciary management. The project financial management was rated satisfactory throughout
the project life. Procurement was rated moderately satisfactory. The project has supported the
recruitment of senior FM and Procurement specialists who provided required technical expertise
to the Ministry of Education through the implementation Technical Unit.
Safeguard. Within the project, the Ministry of Education has developed and disclosed an ESMF.
An Environmental Assessment Policy (OP/BP 4.10) and involuntary resettlement Policy (OP/BP
4.01) were triggered under the project, no specific safeguard occurred during the implementation.
Main results achieved per component (as reported in the GoBF final report on project
implementation results).
Component 1: improving access to secondary education. The review of the implementation of
these activities is as follows:
1) 122 CEG built out of the 122 planned, that is to say 100%;
2) 5 high schools out of the 5 planned, that is to say 100%;
3) 139 classrooms built out of the 145 planned, that is to say 95.86%;;
4) 42 to 50 positive water points were built, that is to say 84%;
5) quickset hedges and trees were planted around the schools constructed by the project;
6) out of 103 applications for land ownership for the purpose of preserving the environment
and securing land, 94 applications have been approved and 9 cases are being processed ,
that is to say a completion rate of 91.26%;
7) site visits and environmental monitoring have been made;
8) six (06) firms were hired to supervise the construction of the infrastructures (CEG, high
schools and waterpoints);
9) members of regional Commissions for Contracts Awarding (CAM) were trained in
assembling and analyzing bids;
10) a grant for the running of private contractual schools was made: between 2006 and 2011,
5080.75 (million) out of 5117.4077 (in million) were granted to private contractual
schools, that is to say 99.28%;
11) social mobilization campaigns were made in the following areas: participation in General
Meetings of Associations of Parents (APE) and meetings of the school ; students' follow
up (collecting schools records, and others); enrollment of children, especially girls ; the
construction of infrastructures (bringing rubble, building, support in funds, support for
the organization of exams, etc.) ; payment of contributions for EPA;
12) 57 schools built out of 110 were provided with school canteens, that is to say a coverage
rate of 51.82%
32


﻿The implementation of these activities enabled the project to achieve very significant
outcomes. Thus the outcomes achieved between 2004/2005 and 2011/2012, with the support
of PPEP2 are:
1) GER in post-primary and secondary schools has increased from 15% in 2004/2005 to
20.10% in 2008/2009. It was 25.7% in 2011/2012;
2) GER in post-primary increased from 20% in 2004/2005 to 26.4% in 2008/2009. It was
34.9% in 2011/2012;
3) GER in secondary schools increased from 8% in 2004/2005 to 10.2% in 2008/2009. It
was 11.3% in 2011/2012;
4) GER for girls in post-primary education in the least covered 18 provinces increased from
5.5% in 2004/2005 to 10.7% in 2008/2009. It was 15.9% in 2011/2012.
In view of these outcomes we can say that the objectives of this component were achieved. Apart
from the GER in secondary schools where the expected target of the indicator has not been
reached (-1.7), all the other indicators have their targets beyond what was expected.
These outcomes are partly the result of different social mobilization campaigns, the establishment
of school canteens and measures taken for free registration according to the final evaluation
report on the impact of access and accessibility conducted with the implementation of the PPEP2
access component.
Component 2: Improving the quality of post-primary education. Review of the achievements

The main activities mentioned have resulted in the following:
1) the average repetition rate in grades 6, 5 and 4 increased from 25% in 2004/2005 to
25.27% in 2009/2010. In 2011-2012 the rate was 21.47%;
2) the average repetition rate in 2nd and Terminal (final year) increased from 18% in
2004/2005 to 20% in 2008/2009. In 2011/2012, the rate was 13,76%;
3) between 2007/2008 and 2009/20 10, the average score in the first cycle increased from
2.06 points in French and decreased in other subjects: in maths (-1.14), Life Science (-
0.52) and history and geography (-0.5);
4) the average score in the second cycle of high education was not achieved in any subject.
However, the average score improved by 0.4 points in French and mathematics in
2007/2008 and 2009/2010;
5) for an expected rate of 80% (the initial number of 4500 teachers who had to receive a
follow up visit) 154.08% (that is to say 6,934 teachers) received at least one follow up
visit;
34


﻿6) a ratio of 2.5 textbooks per student was reached in grades 6 and 5 for an expected ratio of
6 textbooks. For grades 4 and 3, a ratio of 3.5 books per student has been reached for an
expected ratio of 8 textbooks per pupil;
7) the ratio of 6.6 books was achieved for an expected ratio of two textbooks per pupil in the
second cycle of high education;
8) four (04) programs (Life Science, physical sciences, French and civic education) were
reviewed out of five initially planned;
9) In view of the implementation of the e-learning (FOAD), instead of the construction and
equipment of three (03) UVA centers, 13 Regional Directorates / Ministry of Secondary
and Tertiary Education (MESS) and IDS have been equipped with computers.
In this component we can see that the best results were achieved in the inset training of teachers,
namely in the teachers' follow up visits.
Regarding the staffing of students in textbooks, in the first cycle there is a deficit in the ratio
which needs to be solved. However, the second cycle could benefit from this allocation of
textbooks with a very satisfactory ratio. The greatest weakness in terms of results achieved lies in
the results of standardized tests where only a good score was recorded in French in the first cycle.
Component 3: Institutional Reinforcement of the Ministry of Ministry of Secondary and
Tertiary Education (MESS). Review of the activities for this component is as follows:
1) 08 RD/MESS were built and 2 RD/MESS were extended;
2) 50 vehicles and 100 motorcycles were acquired;
3) 110 computers have been acquired;
4) 127 reprographic machines were acquired;
5) 860 MESS workers out of 1200 received training locally and abroad;
6) the new statistical information system of the Directorate of Studies and Planning (DEP)
was set up with technical assistance from the ISU;
7) support for the 2010-2025 sub-sector policy development of the Secondary and Tertiary
Education and Scientific Research, adopted by Decree 2010-560/PRES/PM/MESSRS in
September 21, 2010;
8) the RESEN /CSR entitled "The challenges of the education system in Burkina Faso to
support economic growth" has been developed and has been published in 2010;
9) a management chart for post-primary and high education for the school years 2006/2007,
2007/2008, 2008/2009, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 was published. The management chart
for higher education in 2010/2011 was also published for the first time;
10) the training plan for the staff of the Ministry has been developed;
11) The master plan for the computerization and management of the ministry has been
developed and is operational for central structures housed within the ministry;
12) the tuition fees have been reduced to 10 000 CFAF in public schools in 2008-2009;;
13) school canteens were set up in the 18 provinces with less than 13% of GER;
14) 460 public schools were funded in the form of assigned funds;
15) 516 schools (GSE and TVE) received a grant for their running;
16) a survey on the evaluation of academic, administrative and financial management of
universities was conducted by the AUF and the implementation plan is underway;
35


﻿17) an adequate sub sector MTEF was developed.
At this component, two of the three major expected results have been fully achieved. Indeed eight
regional offices of MESS were built and equipped and the extension of the Sahel and West RD /
MESS is effective.
It is the same for the MESS budget in the education budget, which increased from 28% in 2005-
2006 to 45.9% in 2011-2012 and the budget of the high education in the MESS budget which
increased from 310% in 2005-2006 to 56.6% in 2011-2012.
On the development of the master plan for the computerization and management of the ministry,
a computer network linking the central directorates of the MESS has been developed and is
operational for central structures housed within the ministry. Those outside of the building do not
qualify.
As for the establishment of an integrated assessment system of the staff, collection, processing,
production, publication and annual dissemination of statistical data, it has been abandoned in
favor of a fragmented system (corresponding to the sub-systems: databases of the post-primary
and high, higher education, science and technology, non-tertiary post-secondary, textbooks
management).
Thus, we can report the implementation by the DSP of a collection and computerized processing
system for statistical data; the installation of software for the inventory management of textbooks
and the installation of a computerized integrated management system for the staff respectively at
the CENAMAFS and Human Resources Directorate.
Component 4: developing and Vocational Education and Training-VET. Review of the
activities of this component is as follows:
1) development of a national policy for technical and vocational education adopted by
Decree 2008-584/PRES/PM/MESSRS/MEF in September 19, 2008;
2) 09 systems of reference of 9 promising new employment sectors have been produced;
3) equipment were acquired for nine sectors of VET out of five (05) originally planned;
4) 373 VET teachers were trained;
5) 427 VET teachers have received at least one follow up visit in the year;
6) 03 systems of reference for training and certification out of 15 were reviewed and
updated, that is to say 20%;
7) Tools for the transfer of the achievements for the preset training to the inset training were
not developed;
8) a survey on the need for labor in formal and informal companies in a number of cities
was conducted;
9) two surveys within the scope of the search for quality were conducted;
10) 84 TVE teachers' supervisors were trained;
11) 250 VET teachers were trained in the use of systems of reference;
12) A survey on the effectiveness of the different programs has been completed;
36


﻿13) the two surveys within the scope of the search for quality have been achieved. A study
tour out of three (3) initially planned was made in Ghana, that is to say 33.33%;
14) 11 public technical and vocational education schools received grants for their running
over the two years 2007-2008 and 2008-2009.
Overall, most of the expected results were achieved. However, the construction and equipment of
Vocational Education and Training schools (VET) in Manga and Garango were abandoned in
favor of the equipment of 09 paths of VET (LPRC 03 paths and LTN/ASL 06 paths). However
the so-called VET have been constructed thanks to the 2011 national budget and are operating.
Impact of the project on the implementation of the MESS sub sector policies
The PEPP II which continued efforts done by the first PEPP project contributed to the
development of post-primary and high education. It has provided invaluable support to the sub-
sector, whose one of the objectives to give each department a CEG has been fully achieved.
Moreover the achievements have enabled the coverage of forty (41) large villages. This
expansion in access has reduced disparities related to gender, regional and socio-economic status
of students. Therefore, the conditions of access to education, teaching and student learning have
been improved thanks to:
1) the construction and equipment of post-primary and high education schools;
2) the availability of teaching and learning materials (textbooks, teaching kits, etc.).
3) support for the preset and inset trainings of teachers and teachers' supervisors;
4) support for the training of management and administrative staff in schools (principals,
directors, supervisors, and bursars);
5) training and awareness raising of parents' associations (APE);
6) institutional support through the allocation of IT and peri-computer equipment, logistics
and moving means etc..
The implementation of all project activities contributed to the achievement of the following
major outcomes:
1) the gross intake rate in grade 6 increased from 21.5% in 2004/2005 to 25.1% in
2008/2009. It was 35.7% in 2011/2012;
2) the completion rate in post-primary education increased from 11% in 2004/2005 to
15.8% in 2008/2009. It was 20.3% in 2011/2012;
3) the gross enrollment rate (GER) in post-primary education in the 18 least covered
provinces increased from 8% in 2004/2005 to 16% in 2008/2009. It was 20.25% in
2011/2012;
4) the gross enrollment rate (GER) for girls in post-primary education increased from 16.6%
in 2004/2005 to 16.6% in 2008/2009. It was 31.7% in 2011/2012;
37


﻿5) The tuition fees paid per student by families in public post-primary schools in the 18
least covered provinces increased from 30 000CFAF from 2004/2005 to 10 000 CFAF in
2008/2009. Their average in 2011/2012 was 51743;
However, supply remains insufficient in view of the strong demand for education related to the
dynamics of the population (the population growth rate increased from 2.3 8% to 3.1% according
to the 2006 population general census and housing) and the increasing number of primary school
leavers due to the effect of the PDDEB implementation. It would be suitable to renew and
consolidate the capacity building activities for the staff and to diversify and renew periodically
the purchased learning materials.
Total project cost (source GoBF final report on PPEP2 implementation). The Post Primary
Education Project Phase II was jointly financed through a Sector Investment Loan (IDA Credit
4196-BUR) of the World Bank, a Grant Agreement No. 13753/OUA0077247 (and its
amendments) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and a national counterpart, during its
implementation the project has received an additional donation of 3 million Euros by the
Netherlands.
With a total cost of U.S. $ 56,54 million, which is 29.400 billion CFAF, this funding is broken
down as follows:
1) U.S. $ 22.9 million for the World Bank, that is to say 11.908 billion CFAF;
2) 25 million Euros (22 million initially and 3 million additional) equivalent to U.S. $ 31.54
million for the Kingdom of the Netherlands that is to say 16.398 billion CFAF;
3) U.S. $ 2.1 million for the Government of Burkina Faso that is to say 1,092 billion CFAF.

﻿Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)
The economic analysis provides an assessment of the cost-efficiency for school
construction and acquisition of textbooks as well as an overall economic evaluation of the
project components. The efficiency analysis points to a relatively high cost-efficiency for
school construction, whereas the actual prices for acquisition of textbooks exceed the
projected unit costs significantly. As part of the economic evaluation, the direct benefit
from construction of lower and upper secondary schools is quantified based on the
increase in future earnings for those graduating showing a satisfactory positive return
from the investment. Finally, the financial analysis provides an analysis of the fiscal
impact of the project during implementation and after implementation.
Cost-efficiency
As part of the activities under component 1, the project constructed 663 classrooms
exceeding the initial target of 478 classrooms to be built. The composition of construction
types was revised during the project in order to increase capacity. The project constructed
122 lower secondary schools (CEG) with four classrooms each, five upper secondary
schools with six classrooms each, and 145 additional classrooms for lower secondary
schools, cf. Table 1.

The total cost of the 122 lower secondary schools amounts to US$ 14 million (FCFA
6,761 million). Depending on the type of construction, unit costs for construction of the
schools vary between US$ 81,349 and US$ 168,154, cf. Table 2.

﻿Source: Programme d'Infrastructure PEPPII - document d'6valuation finale.
The projected costs for the CEG complet and the CEG d6congestion exceed the initial
forecast with 16% and 13% respectively, which is primarily due to cost of materials. The
total cost of the five upper secondary schools amount to US$ 672,818 (FCFA 325
million), which is 8% less than initially projected. A cost analysis for construction was
performed at the Mid-term review of the project in January 2009, which showed
relatively low costs compared to the average prices obtained by the construction agency
Baaro Faso in 2007 and consistency with international construction costs of classrooms in
similar countries.4
In general, it can be difficult to systematically compare efficiency across construction
projects as constructions vary in standards, quality, and common premises included. But
even for projects undertaken in the same country using the same design and technology,
unit cost varies widely due to e.g. procurement and management methods. A recent
World Bank project in C6te d'Ivoire constructed lower secondary schools each with 12
classrooms at a unit price of US$ 1.2 million (FCFA 595 million) per school. Although
this comparison points to a high cost-efficiency for this project's construction of lower
secondary schools (measured in price per classroom), the differences in common
premises included as well as lack of detailed data and information makes it difficult to
draw a firm conclusion.
Under component 2, the project provided 955,500 lower secondary textbooks and
362,694 upper secondary textbooks, which is below the target of 1,400,000 and 600,000
books respectively. The unit costs for textbooks were US$ 4.6 (FCFA 2,205) for lower
secondary textbooks and US$ 9.7 (FCFA 4,697) for upper secondary textbooks. These
prices are relatively high and substantially above the projected costs for textbooks, which
were based on the prices from PEPPI. However, according to an evaluation of the
textbook acquisition the obtained prices are still considerably below catalogue prices, and
the analysis explains the exceed in costs relative to the projected by increase in inflation
and particular due to changes in oil prices, the price of raw paper, increase in the cost of
maritime transport and depreciation of the local currency.
Economic evaluation
The PEPPII activities primarily target secondary education students from the 18
provinces with the lowest secondary education enrolment, specifically focusing on
increasing enrollment for girls and children from poor areas. The project has expanded
school canteen programs as an incentive for enrollment and retention in poor areas and
has provided textbooks at reduced cost to relieve the costs for parents.
4 Average cost of construction for the project was FCFA/m2 75,300 compared to an average price of
FCFA/m2 85,700 obtained by Baaro Faso in 1007 for similar primary school constructions. Source:

﻿Component 1 focuses on increasing access to secondary education. Gross enrollment in
secondary education has been increasing during the project implementation and was
25.7% in 2011.6 However, despite the increase in gross enrollment, the education system
in Burkina Faso is characterized by a lack of capacity while the school population is
growing. The construction of new secondary schools is thus expected to lead to a
corresponding increase in access and thereby to raise the overall education level. For each
individual the increase in skills is expected to lead to a higher earnings capacity and at the
country level the increase in skills and knowledge supports higher productivity among
firms and workers, which helps reduce poverty. The World Bank's Enterprise Survey
shows that in Burkina Faso nearly 40% of the firms consider lack of skills a major
obstacle to their operation7. This fact points to an existing demand to accommodate the
increase in supply of the educated workforce.
The direct benefit from construction of lower and upper secondary schools can be
quantified based on the increase in future earnings for those graduating as the increase in
access allows more students to enroll and complete secondary education. The economic
effect from additional education is quantified based on expected wage benefit for those
graduating. As in many low-income countries, the level of education and training
influences the size of income significantly, cf. Table 3.

Note: Income levels have been changed from 2003-prices to 2012 prices based on inflation rate.
The wage benefit going from one level of education to the following is largest going from
primary education to lower secondary education. However, data is from 2003 and the
lack of recent information on income dependent on education level may impose some
uncertainty in the calculations. A high share of the adult Burkinabe population is working
and in 2007 employment rates for people with lower or upper secondary education were
83% and 87% respectively.
Assuming that the new schools can be used for 20 years, the NPV of constructing 122
lower secondary schools, 5 upper secondary schools and 145 additional lower secondary

﻿classrooms is US$ 121 million and the IRR is 7%.8 The evaluation of the direct economic
benefit prevailing from the increase in access to secondary education thus shows a
satisfactory positive return from the investment.
In addition to the direct economic benefit for the students graduating, several other
benefits prevail from the general higher level education in the country. The expansion of
secondary education increases the foundation of people suitable for higher education and
provides important social benefits. The social effects may include dimensions such as
mortality, health, population growth, and civic life (more educated individuals are better
able to participate in an organized community life and to make informed policy choices).
These benefits are however difficult to quantify in monetary terms. Furthermore, the
construction of school infrastructure has helped reducing the geographic inequalities in
access to education and has increased the awareness of barriers to girls' education.
In addition to teaching facilities the construction also includes establishment of school
canteens. The provision of food helps maintain a larger number of students in the system,
as the guarantee of a daily meal is a source of motivation for students. A survey from the
parents' associations (APE) shows that the development of school canteens has provided
significant support for reducing repetition and dropout.9 The establishment of canteens is
thus expected to positively affect internal efficiency of the education system.
Component 2 focuses on increasing quality of learning by providing textbooks and
strengthening teachers' training. These benefits are all difficult to quantify and are
expected to prevail only gradually. The higher quality of education is expected to
improve skills of the graduates and thereby increase their productivity and future income.
Furthermore, an increase in quality of education can positively affect retention rates and
thereby increase efficiency of the education system. An evaluation of the provision of
teachers' training shows that the project has exceeded its target in terms of the number of
teachers trained, and a study on the impact of training conducted in November 2011
shows that more than 98% of principals and around 84% of the teachers were satisfied
with the content of training the competence of trainers. Despite these achievements, the
overall return from this component may be lower than anticipated at the outset, as the
project did not achieve all of its performance targets for this component.

﻿Finally, the project enhanced the capacity of the MESSR, which amongst others have led
to more efficient management at the central and regional levels, increased capacity with
respect to planning and financial management, as well as improved data collection and
analysis.
Financial analysis
The total public spending on education accounted for around 14% of total public
expenditure in Burkina Faso in 2012 corresponding to 4% of GDP, cf. Table 4.

Total spending under the project was US$ 59.4 million (FCFA 28,671 million), of which
the IDA grant constitutes US$ 23.2 million (FCFA 11,210 million).10 The IDA Credit
was fully disbursed by the end of the project, and the co-support from the Netherlands
Government of Euro 22 million was fully disbursed by June 2010.
The fiscal impact from the project has been relatively limited accounting for between
0.3% and 4.8% of the total public expenditure on education over the project period, cf.

The primary fiscal impact after project implementation stems from the higher cost of the
expanded lower secondary education, i.e. the recurrent costs associated with the
additional number of students accommodated as well as maintenance costs for the
schools. In order to sustain all achievements from the project, the MESSRS estimates
total yearly recurrent costs to be US$ 4.5 million (FCFA 2,183 million), which
corresponds to 7.6% of the total project costs. 1 The estimated recurrent costs are
presented in Table 6.

GOVERNMENT OF BURKINA FASO (04/2013)
SUMMARY OF THE PPEP II COMPLETION REPORT
The Second Post-Primary Education Project (PEPPII) follows the Post-Primary Education Project
(PEPPI) which was launched in June 1997 and ended in April 2004. Based on the satisfactory
outcomes of PEPPI, the Government has confirmed their interest in a more meaningful and
comprehensive support from the World Bank to support the education sector in Burkina Faso in
general, and particularly post-primary education.
LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES
Overall, the development objectives of the project were achieved. Details on performance
indicators and intermediate performance indicators are listed in Annex 1.
I- OUTCOMES ACHIEVED FOR THE COMPONENT <<ACCESS TO POST-PRIMARY
EDUCATION>>
At the time of the project implementation in 2005-2006, 18 out of the 45 provinces in Burkina
Faso had been identified as the ones having the poorest rate of enrollment in junior high school
because they were having less than 13% of gross enrollment rate (GER). One of the specific
objectives targeted by the project was to improve by 5 points this GER by 2008/2009 in each of
the eighteen (18) provinces.
The evolution of the gross enrollment rate (GER) in junior high school as well as the GER for
girls in these 18 poorly served provinces is satisfactory.
The number of additional students enrolled between 2004-2005 and 2009 in these eighteen (18)
provinces increased from 68.18%, moving from 170,556 students to 286,850 students, which
represents 116 294 new enrolled students.
The focus of the project on girls' education, especially in these areas was also successful. Out of
172 246 new enrolled students in high school, 75,642 were girls among who 48,851 are coming
from the provinces with the lowest enrollment rates, which represents 64.58% of the total number
of girls enrolled in the eighteen (18) provinces.
The tables on the evolution of the gross enrollment rate (GER) in junior high school as well as the
GER in the 18 poorly served provinces are in annex 2.
On the whole, the outcomes achieved between 2004/2005 and 2011/2012 are very significant:
1)  the GER at post primary in high education increased from 15 % in 2004/2005 to 20,10% in
2008/2009 and to 25,7% in 2011/2012;
2)  the GER at post-primary education increased from 20%  in 2004/2005 to 26.4%  in
2008/2009 and to 34.9% in 2011/2012;
3)  the GER in high education increased from 8% in 2004/2005 to 10.2% in 2008/2009 and
11.3% in 2011/2012;
4)  the GER for girls at post-primary education in the 18 poorly covered provinces increased
from 5.5% in 2004/2005 to 10.7% in 2008/2009 and to 15.9% in 2011/2012.
These outcomes can be justified by the actions implemented by the project and the government,
but also by the influence of the following factors:
61


﻿*  the project has contributed significantly to improving access to high education and reduce
inequalities between regions and between the sexes (see Annex 2), by building 122 General
Education Colleges (CEG), 145 classrooms and 5 high schools of 6 classrooms, thus
increasing significantly, the access to general high education, especially in areas with poor
coverage
*   The construction of these new schools in areas with limited coverage has significantly
reduced distances between school infrastructures and families, thus improving access and
reducing significantly some of the direct costs paid by the parents.
*   The same applies for the implementation of the public-private partnership that enabled to
build and equip ten (10) general education colleges (CEG) to lease to private developers. This
option helped reduce the recurrent costs of the Government (teachers' salaries, maintenance
and operating costs), increase the reception facilities and improve access to high education.
*   The reduction of tuition fees paid by families which moved from 30,000 CFA F in 2004-2005
to 10,000 CFAF in 2008-2009 and to 5174 CFAF in 2011-2012 helped reduce the costs of
high education paid by households. The implementation of the reform with the introduction
of free education in the 45 departments selected, aroused particular enthusiasm of the
beneficiaries to enroll more their children. These two factors have a positive impact on
children's access to high education and more particularly that of girls in thel8 poorly covered
provinces,
*   The establishment of endogenous canteens with the participation of the EPA has increased
school attendance and retention, thus contributing to reduce the risk of abandonment and
improve the gross enrollment rate in junior high schools in each of the eighteen (18) poorest
provinces.
II- OUTCOMES ACHIEVED FOR THE COMPONENT <<QUALITY AT POST-
PRIMARY EDUCATION>>
Despite the implementation of the main activities at the level of the component "quality at post-
primary education" the objective of lowering the repetition rate has not been reached.
Indeed, the average repetition rate in grades 6, 5 and 4 moved from 25% in 2004/2005 to 25.27%
in 2008/2009 and to 21.47% in 2011-2012. Although this rate has decreased, the expected goal
which was 16% in 2009/2010 has not been reached.
The same applies to the average repetition rate in 2nd and Terminal (final year) which moved
from 18% in 2004/2005 to 20% in 2008/2009 and to 3.76% in 2011/2012, while the target was
11% in 2008/2009.
This fact can be explained, in part, by the sudden increase of the enrollment rate and achievement
at primary school which put some pressure on the post-primary and caused overstaffing and
massive repetition during the project implementation.
The implementation of the evaluation and testing system for school learning has also had limited
success.
Indeed, achievement tests administered in the core subjects (math, French, Life sciences, history
and geography) gave the following results:
1) between 2007/2008 and 2009/20 10, the average score in junior high school increased from
2.06 in French and decreased in other subjects: math (-1.14), Life Sciences (-0.52) and
62


﻿history and geography (-0.5), while the objective was to increase by 2 points the average of
the standardized scores;
2) the average score in senior high education has not been achieved in any area. However, the
average score improved by 0.4 in French and mathematics in 2007/2008 and 2009/2010,
while the target was 1.5.
In view of the evaluation report and the results of initial tests published in the various public and
private media, the implementation of the evaluation and testing system of students is
encouraging. However, further analysis should be carried out to allow a better understanding of
the impact of these results on the system.
Other factors that have influenced these two indicators of "quality" can be linked to the many
consecutive disturbances of classes which happened during the social unrest in schools and which
have affected the delivery of education services. These disturbances have had a negative impact
on the performance of students and teachers and the standardized test scores of students in
general
Apart from these unanswered challenges, the other results in this component were satisfactory:
1) The project has contributed significantly to the teachers' capacity building in the educational
field and improve their classroom practice through the inset training and educational follow
up and monitoring.
2) In fact, out of a total of 4,500 teachers in 2004-2005, 9,937 core subjects teachers of the 13
regions got a refresher training through various educational and emerging themes, which
represents a coverage rate of 220.82% , higher than 80% which was the target in 2008-2009
3) For a planned number of 4500 teachers in 2004-2005, 6,934 teachers received at least one
class visit as support /guidance by an education supervisor, a coverage rate of 154.08% which
is higher than 80% which was the target in 2008-2009.
4) The level of achievement of objectives related to the availability of textbooks in terms of
ratio, in junior high school (6 to 8 textbooks per student) and senior high school (2 textbooks
per student) is satisfactory even if the needs in junior high school are not fully covered
5) In fact, in the junior high school, the lack of disaggregated data by textbook and by level, the
number of textbooks available for 2009/2010 was 2,516,846 textbooks for a total of 456,743
students in the public and private sector, that is to say a manual /student ratio of
5.5 1textbooks for a target of six textbooks.
6) In the senior high education, the number of textbooks available for 2009/2010 was 362,694
textbooks for a total of 81,816 students in the public and private sector, that is to say a
textbook/student ratio of 4.43 textbooks for a target of 2 textbooks.
7) Details of the results, the calculation and comparison of the costs, the impact estimates and
the calculation of the cost-effectiveness ratio of textbooks, are in Annex 3.
8) The project has conducted six (6) surveys within the scope of the search for quality education
and a survey on the evaluation of academic, administrative and financial management of
universities has been conducted with the help of the AUF plan and the implementation is
underway.

﻿III- OUTCOMES ACHIEVED FOR THE COMPONENT << INSTITUTIONAL
CAPACITY BUILDING >>
At this component, the main expected outcomes were:
1) the capacity of management of the MESSRS is enhanced with a GIS (including planning and
budget management, management of textbooks, human resources management, monitoring
and data analysis, the students' learning management);
2) eight (8) High Education Regional Directorates (HERD) are built and equipped;
3) the share of high education in the budget of the MESSRS increased from 31 % in 2004-2005
to 55% in 2008-2009.
Two of the three major expected outcomes were fully achieved. Indeed, eight regional offices of
the MESSRS were built and equipped and the extension of the RD/MESSRS in the Sahel and the
South-West is effective.
This applies to the share of high education in the budget of the MESSRS which increased from
31 % in 2005-2006 to 55.9% in 2009-2010 to 56.6% in 2011-2012. At the same time the share of
the budget of the MESSRS in the education budget increased from 18% in 2005-2006 to 43.5% in
2009-2010 and to 45.9% in 2011-2012.
As for the establishment of an integrated assessment system for the staff, collection, processing,
production, publication and dissemination of annual statistical data, it has been abandoned in
favor of a fragmented system (corresponding to the sub-systems: databases in post-primary and
high, higher education, science and technology, non-tertiary post-secondary, management of
textbooks).
IV- OUTCOMES ACHIEVED FOR THE COMPONENT <<DEVELOPMENT OF
TECHNICAL EDUCATION >>
At this component, the key performance indicators were:
1) a national policy on technical and vocational education is adopted;
2) standards for five (5) new programs are developed;
3) TVE increases by the construction of two (2) TVE schools.
Overall, the outcomes achieved are satisfactory. Although, in the project, the construction and
equipment of the Technical Education Schools in Manga and Garango were abandoned in favor
of the equipment of 09 TVE paths (LPRC 03 paths and LTN/ASL 06 paths), these CET were
finally constructed with the Government 2011 budget and are operating.
The   overall physical realization  of  this  component  is  estimated  at  111.20%.
The main activities conducted are:
*  the development of a national policy for technical and vocational education adopted by
Decree 2008-584/PRES/PM/MESSRS/MEF in September 19, 2008;
*   09 standards for 09 employment promising new paths have been produced
*   workshop equipment were acquired for nine (9) TVE paths for five (05) initially planned;
*   373 TVE teachers were trained in various educational themes, 250 teachers in the use of
standards and 427 TVE teachers have received at least one class visit in the year;
*  tools for the transfer of the achievements for the preset training to the inset training were not
developed;
64


﻿*   three (3) surveys within the scope of the quality research were conducted, among which one
was on the labor needs of formal and informal companies in a number of cities;
*   84 TVE education supervisors have been trained;
*   A survey on the effectiveness of different programs has been completed.
These results have been achieved thanks to the implementation of most planned activities.
In general, the activities planned in the project appraisal document were performed satisfactorily
as reflected in the overall physical achievement rate estimated at 102.45%. However, this rate
could not be achieved if the project had not received three (03) extensions. Indeed, the
implementation of some activities has been delayed due to difficulties in the procurement
procedures.
V- DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO PROCUREMENT
The post-primary education project phase II, is a Category A project, in this context, those
responsible for procurement are all from the civil service (the procurement specialist and an
assistant at the central level, and HERD stewards at the regional level). Procurement had several
types of problems which include:
*   The mobility of the staff trained on procurement at the regional level: at least two stewards
have been moved during the project implementation;
*   the new procurement regulations occurred in 2008 which increased the procurement at the
level of the projects: use of two procedures (national and TFP);
*   difficulties in the development of the technical specifications of the equipment and terms of
reference of the surveys, by the beneficiaries. The implementation of the various procurement
plans is hampered by lack of quality technical specifications and which arrive late. Some
activities after two treatments up to the assignment proposal, were abandoned because the
proposed technical specifications are not well developed;
*   failure to comply with the government's commitments in relation to the project appraisal
document: the exemption for procurement in the region has not been met;
*   external departments such as the procurement directorate of the ministry, the procurement
specialist in the ministry, financial control, taxes and customs were the threats to the
procurement and performance of contracts;
Finally, despite the availability of funds and the easy terms the majority of companies and
suppliers did not meet contractual deadlines. They were the lowest bidders and had financial
difficulties (problems with their bank).
VI- OPERATION OF THE PROJECT STEERING UNITS
The Second Post-Primary Education Project (PEPP II) is a Category A project, with an integrated
management with the civil service departments and implemented under the administrative
responsibility of the Ministry of High and Higher Education (MESS).
The mechanism is as follows:
* the Secretary General (SG) MESSRS will be responsible for the supervision and overall
project management and will report directly to the Minister.
65


﻿*   responsibility for overall project management will be provided by the Technical Coordination
Committee of the MESSRS, which is chaired by the SG, and includes the main central
directorates and RD/MESSRS.
*   coordination of project activities will be provided at all operational levels (central, regional,
and community/school).
*   under the authority of the Secretary General (SG), the beneficiary departments of MESSRS
are responsible for the coordination and execution of daily activities for which they have
primary responsibility.
*   The Directorate of Administration and Finance, through its six specialized units, is
responsible for the financial management of the project, the preparation of accounting audits
and compliance with systems and procedures acceptable to IDA.
The steering units experienced a period of relative lethargy in the first six months of the life of the
project (2006) and disturbances in late 2007.
Indeed, the mechanism set up has encountered many difficulties identified during the assessment
mission conducted by the World Bank from March 27 to April 4, 2007, including:
* inefficiencies to drive forward the process resulting, among other things, from the lack of
clear division of tasks to the different DAF officers;
* - misunderstandings with financial control over the nature of checks and documents to be
produced to obtain a signature;
* - the lack of control of the accounting system
All these deficiencies were causing huge delays in the implementation of the project activities.
That is why, according to the implementation mechanism, a Support Unit in charge of the
implementation of the PEPP II, housed within the Office of the Secretary General was created by
decree No. 2007 - 160/MESSRS/SG/PEPP II in August 3, 2007.
In order to adapt to the requirements of the decrees on the general regulation of projects or
programs implemented in Burkina Faso, the various committees for the project implementation
have been replaced by Order No. 2008 - 126/MESSRS/SG/DEP establishing the PEPP II steering
committee which meets each semester.
Since the entry into force of the new steering committee all the meetings were held regularly
without major difficulties enabling to make appropriate decisions oriented towards greater
efficiency and effectiveness in the project management.
VII- ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE
*   Most government contractual obligations have been     met throughout the project
implementation:
*   Despite the difficulties inherent to any innovation, the risk of bureaucracy, the lack of a clear
division of labor, the risk of delays from the beneficiary departments to own the project,
assume responsibility and take decision, the Government is committed, in terms of
institutional responsibility, to make the project integrated into the management departments
of the MESS. This willingness to make the Second Post-Primary Education Project (PEPP II)
an integrated project has been effective by the Decree 2007-776/PRES/PM/MEF in
66


﻿November 22, 2007 on the organization and operation of Category A projects and programs
development and by the joint Order No. 2008/MESSRS/MEF December 31, 2008 on the
classification of development programs or projects being implemented in Burkina Faso. The
advantage of such an option, compared to stand-alone units that are often cut off from reality
and tend to move away from the administrative supervision missions, is that it is possible to
use the abilities and skills of the beneficiary technical departments themselves to solve their
own problems and, ultimately, promotes the transfer and capitalization of acquired skills to
ensure a monitoring and a continuity of actions undertaken by the projects for their
sustainability.
*   The Government is committed to reducing the tuition fees paid by families. These fees
increased from 30,000 CFA francs in 2004-2005 to 10,000 CFA francs in 2008-2009 and to
5174 FCFA in 2011-2012. The fulfillment of this commitment has helped reduce
significantly the costs of high education paid by the households. This has had a positive
impact on children's access to high education and more particularly that of girls in thel8
poorly covered provinces ,
*   The government has increased education spending at 5.58% per year from 2006 to 2012. This
enabled increasing the share of the budget of the MESSRS in the education budget from 18%
in 2005-2006 to 43.5 % in 2009-2010 and to 45.9% in 2011-2012 and that of the share of high
education in the budget of the MESSRS from 310% in 2005-2006 to 55.9% in 2009-2010 and
to 56.6% in 2011-2012.
*  However, with the sudden increase in primary school enrollment and completion and the
implementation of the education reform that has generated particular enthusiasm to educate
children, the number of students exploded in high education and remain a heavy burden for
the government in terms of requests for reception facilities which must be faced with the need
for additional funding.
*  The Government is committed to implement endogenous canteens with the participation of
EPA. This measure was taken and endogenous canteens are operating in all schools. They
had a positive impact on school attendance and retention and helped reducing the risk of
abandonment and improving the gross enrollment rate in junior high schools and particularly
in the eighteen (18) poorest provinces.
*  Despite the natural disasters which occurred during the period of the project implementation,
including poor harvests in 2007 and 2008, the great famine and floods in September 1, 2009
that they faced, the government has demonstrated its ability to mobilize counterpart funds.
Indeed for a forecast of one billion ninety-two million (1 092 000 000) CFA francs estimated at
around U.S. dollars two million one hundred eighty-four thousand (2,184,000), the government
was able to disburse directly to the benefit of the project, seven hundred and fourteen million
eighty-six thousand (714 086 000) CFA francs estimated at around U.S. dollars one million four
hundred twenty-eight thousand (1,428,000), representing a disbursement rate of 65.39%
compared to the estimated amount.
At this direct contribution it must be added the salaries and wages due to the public staff assigned
to the project during its lifetime management amounting to two hundred and forty two million
(242 million) CFA francs estimated at U.S. dollars four hundred eighty-four thousand (484,000).
With regard to the total amount spent, the disbursement rate is about 87.54% of the amount owed
by the government under the national counterpart, which is very significant.
67


﻿VIII- ANALYSIS OF THE WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall, the World Bank performance in the project preparation and implementation was
satisfactory.
The presence of the Bank in the identification, assessment and involvement process of some key
issues in the project preparation was remarkable.
Indeed, the Government and the Bank jointly organized workshops on policy development,
strategic and financial planning, and investment planning.
In the implementation phase and during supervision missions, the Bank was able to put its
expertise to the project in the form of support/counseling that was very beneficial to all the staff
of the ministry involved in the daily project management tasks.
The project supervision missions were carried out normally and regularly during the
implementation. These missions have enabled raising in a timely manner, many difficulties and
obstacles associated with the good management, and provide adequate guidance as new
recommendations and even proactive measures to address these management problems.
Finally, we should note the very good and frank cooperation that existed between the Ministry,
the Project Leader and the procurement specialists' team in the World Bank.
The positive impact of the good cooperation has been observed towards the end of the project and
during weekly meetings where appropriate solutions have been found for the treatment of recent
suffering cases.
Through exchanges and support /ad hoc counseling, the project unit could also benefit from the
expertise of the Bank procurement specialists which has allowed some specific contract bids to
have a happy end.
IX. OPINION OF BENEFICIARIES
The opinion of the beneficiaries is very favorable in terms of the positive impact the project has
had on the education system, teachers, students, parents and rural and urban communities of the
thirteen (13) regions of Burkina Faso in general. The testimony of two beneficiaries, in annex 4
illustrates this satisfaction.
X- KEY LESSONS LEARNT
1) The need to prepare in anticipation the heads of the beneficiary departments to ownership of
the integrated projects activities (Category A) and the implementation of strategies to involve
them more in the diligent treatment of their cases.
2) The need to reduce the deadlines for the execution, publishing of the procurement and
signatures of the Procurement General Directorate (DGMP), financial control and no
objection notice from the TFP;
3) Taking into account the transverse components (environmental and social) at the beginning of
the projects implementation throughout action plans relating thereto;
4) The development on time of tools related to project management (administrative, financial
and accounting procedures manual, formal monitoring and evaluation system) in order to
overcome the problems of communication between central structures and the RD/MESSRS;
68


﻿5) The need for the Government to improve the mechanisms for the disbursement of the national
counterpart to honor its commitments to the project running;
6) The need for substantial financial support to strengthen the projects monitoring and action
control systems for the consulting engineers at all levels;
7) The capacity building of projects' administration and management members, and regional
stewards in financial management and accounting;
8) The need to better control the mobility of officers trained in project management procedures,
and who are subsequently replaced by new ones who are not trained;
9) The effective taking care of the recurrent costs of the project by the Government to ensure
continuity in the implementation of activities.
