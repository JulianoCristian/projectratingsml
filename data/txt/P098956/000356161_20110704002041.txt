                         Extension of Closing Date
             BURKINA FASO: POST-PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
                          P098956 - CR. 4196-BUR

                                  Restructuring Paper

1.    The closing date for Burkina Faso, Post-Primary Education Project (Cr. 4196-
BUR) will be extended from June 30, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2.      The project was approved in June 2006 and reaching Project Development
Objectives (PDO) remains achievable. The 2006 census, however, brought to light new
numbers which have affected the baseline and the current targets for some indicators,
reducing some of the current percentage figures. However, the project remains on a
positive trend and on track to achieve all remaining indicators. As part of this extension
request, the results framework and associated target values will be adjusted accordingly.

3.      Based on 2009-2010 data, three out of the six PDO indicators have reached their
target. These include (i) the Average Gross Enrollment rate in lower secondary in the 18
less covered provinces which increased from 8.4 percent in 2004 to 16 percent for a
target of 13 percent; (ii) School fees supported by families in public lower secondary
schools in the 18 low-covered provinces was reduced from 30,000 FCFA to 10,000
FCFA/year per student as expected; (iii) the Share of MESSRS in the education budget
was increased from 28 percent in 2004 to 42.73 percent for a target of 40 percent. The
three others progressed substantially and are likely to reach the target with the extension.
These include (i) the completion rate at lower secondary which increased from 45 percent
in 2004 to 53.1 percent for a target of 60 percent; (ii) the GER of girls in lower secondary
increased from 17.2 percent in 2004 to 25.8 against a target of 28 percent; (iii) the Gross
intake rate in first grade of lower secondary increased from 22 percent in 2004 to 31.4
percent for a target of 40 percent (based on previous census data, the indicator would be
35.8 percent). In terms of improving the quality of education, two learning assessments
were carried out. The first assessment established baselines for math, science and French;
and the second student assessment in 2009 was to follow up on and monitor student
progress. Slight progress was noted in performance, even if the target is not reached:
from 2007 to 2009 at grade 2 of low secondary (“cinquième”), the average score in math
increased from 8.1/20 to 9.1/20, in Science from 9.1/20 to 9.5/20, and in French, it
remained at 10.4/20.

4.     However, project implementation has been slowed down by procurement
processing issues, affecting several activities. Project implementation delays because of
procurement issues affected five major activities in the 2010 Action Plan: (i) acquisition

                                             4
of Technical and Vocational Training equipment; (ii) Information Technology
equipment; (iii) textbooks (which constitutes one of key elements of the strategy to
improve the quality of teaching and learning); (iv) school science kits procured through
international competitive bidding and (v) school construction using innovative public-
private partnership arrangements. The difficulties were addressed through a combination
of technical assistance provided by the Bank and national experts. With regard to the
procurement of textbooks, the last supervision mission recommended the recruitment of
international technical assistance to accelerate the process and to ensure quality and cost-
efficiency. The consultant was hired and the procurement process is proceeding well.
However, despite the progress made thus far, it is unlikely that procurement will be
completed by to the closing date as another 10 months is needed to complete the process.
This one-year extension should be sufficient as the Bank and government teams have put
in place the necessary technical assistance (especially in terms of procurement support) to
alleviate the difficulties encountered in the past and which had significantly slowed
project implementation.

5.      Furthermore, the public-private partnership pilot is also a key policy reform to
support quality and expansion of secondary education. The completion of the public-
private partnership pilot is therefore critical to the success of the secondary education
reform and improvement program in Burkina Faso. However, given the time left, this
reform would not be implemented and would thus negatively affect the PDO. Therefore,
granting an extension of 12 months from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012 would ensure
that these critical activities will be completed in time.

The Government and the Bank have taken appropriate actions by engaging the necessary
human resources and by adopting adequate procurement methods that helped solve the
identified issues. Therefore, implementation progress should improve, including
textbook/student indicators since textbook acquisition was heavily affected by the slow
procurement process. Furthermore, the 2006 census data has shown that the previous
population estimates were too high, which has led to a decrease in end-of-project targets.
Therefore, the team agreed with the Government during the June 2011 supervision
mission to revise the two targets of the PDO that are affected by the new population
census data, as follows:

                                                                     Current

                                                                                         Target
                                                                               Initial
                                                                               End



                                                                                         End




1   Gross intake rate in first grade of lower secondary   22%        31.4%     40%       38%
    rises from 22% in 2004 to 38% in 2012.
2   Completion rate at lower secondary rises from 45%     45%        53.1%     60%       56%
    in 2004 to 56% in 2012.


6.      It was also agreed to revise the target of an Intermediate Result Indicator affected
by the population census, notably, the GER in secondary education increase, which will
be reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent.



                                               5
7.      The extension of the closing date satisfies OP 13.30, paragraph 3 on Closing Date
which provides that (a) the project objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the
performance of the Recipient and other project implementing agencies is satisfactory; and
(c) the Recipient has prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the World Bank to
complete the existing contracts and agreements. No other changes to the project are
proposed.
