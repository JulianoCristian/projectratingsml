                         Implementation Status Overview
                          The implementation of project activities is progressing satisfactorily. Achievement of the project development objective indicators is substantial, despite a recent revision of
                         population estimates based on the 2006 population census, which affected some project indicators related to enrollment rates, and thus affected accomplishment of the targets for
                         gross intake and completion rates. Progress in reaching project development objectives is considered satisfactory, because of continued improvement in reaching development

                         implementation has been slowed by procurement issues, affecting several activities including textbook acquisition. Actions were taken and most of these issues have been resolved.
                         Therefore, implementation progress should improve as well as textbook/student indicators. Drop out and repetition rates remain high.
