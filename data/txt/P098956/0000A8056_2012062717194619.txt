                         The Second Post Primary Education Projects (PEPP2) development objective is to support the GoBF strategy to increase the number and quality of students graduating

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project achievement is substantial, particularly with respect to access to low secondary education. The project disbursement rate is currently 90%. Five out of the six PDO
                         indicators have already been achieved or surpassed their target. The remaining one, gross intake rate of lower secondary is on track and likely to be achieved by project closing. Half
                         intermediate indicators have been achieved or surpassed while the remaining ones, related mainly to quality improvement indicators such as the repetition rate and student learning
                         outcomes are lagging behind. The low achievements on quality indicators underline structural weaknesses that call for comprehensive response. A planned study focusing essentially

                         To ensure that activities for which contracts have been signed are completed, the project closing date was proposed to be extended by six months, from June 30, 2012 to December
                         31, 2012. These activities include: (i) the completion of school construction using innovative public-private partnership arrangements; (ii) the finalization of school construction in

                         remote and difficult areas; and (iii) the purchase of Information Technology equipment. Delays in project completion are explained by the need to revise the arrangements for public-
                         private partnership in school construction and difficulties in finding contractors capable of building schools in remote areas.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Delays in project completion occurred mainly due to a need to revise the arrangements for public-private partnership in school construction and difficulties in finding contractors
                         capable of building schools in remote areas. These issues have been resolved, but the project closing date was proposed to be extended by six months, from June 30, 2012 to
                         December 31, 2012, to ensure that activities for which contracts have been signed are completed.
