of a two-year program of structural adjustment\n            of the economy supported by four single-tranche balance of\n            payments support loans.  The first loan in the series, the\n            Finance Companies Restructuring Loan (FCRL) approved by the\n            Board in December 1997, supported measures toward the\n            resolution of the suspended finance companies and committed\n            the Government to comprehensive reform of the financial\n            sector over the next two years.  The proposed loan, while\n            further deepening the restructuring of the financial sector,\n            supports measures to strengthen the corporate sector.  It\n            paves the way for two more adjustment loans that will\n            continue to trace reform of the financial and the corporate\n            sectors but with a sharper focus on strengthening the\n            competitive foundations of the economy."}, "docdt": "1998-06-16T00:00:00Z"}
