sustainability,\n            and substantial institutional development impacts,\n            accompanied by highly satisfactory performances by both the\n            Bank, and Borrower. The success of this operation, thus\n            provide important lessons. The experience reinforces project\n            design as paramount in addressing the most critical road\n            sector needs, and its sustainability, with a project concept\n            kept simple and manageable. Lessons drawn from previous\n            projects were applied during project preparation, and\n            include: up-front technical assistance to supplement and\n            enhance borrower's capacity; careful planning and\n            review of the civil works final design, and budgeting; and,\n            a manageable scale of investments. The preparation of the\n            project transferred technical knowledge to Lao counterparts,\n            facilitating its successful implementation. The project was\n            completed within the planned time and budget. Strong and\n            committed leadership proved essential in achieving outcomes,\n            which given the project inherited a committed, competent and\n            experienced leadership, helped with trouble-shooting\n            throughout the implementation period, and, promoted the\n            development of local contractors, and strengthened\n            government institutions in procurement, and contract\n            management. Mainstreaming project implementation into the\n            Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction\n            proved beneficial, through the creation of the Project\n            Monitoring Division, consolidating all coordination units,\n            supported by donors in the road sector. It succeeded in\n            integrating all functions including, project monitoring and\n            reporting, donor coordination and staff professional\n            development. Other lessons address the effectiveness of\n            technical audits, as instruments for enhancing quality, and,\n            the success of gradual introduction of competitive bidding practices."}, "docdt": "2004-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
