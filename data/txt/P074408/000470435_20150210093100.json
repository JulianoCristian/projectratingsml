There, she presented\n            a piece of paper to an official, pronounced her name and\n            received 120 new Turkish lira (roughly 90 dollars) from the\n            state. The amount was modest but for Turk it meant\n            everything \u0096 a critical helping hand to send her two teenage\n            daughters and 9-year-old son to school. \u0093It\u0092s money we can\n            spend on pencils, shoes and uniforms, so the children don\u0092t\n            feel humiliated at school,\u0094 she says, recalling the\n            transaction. Just back from school, her daughter Sarga, 13,\n            hands neatly resting on her grey pleated skirt, sits proudly\n            by her side. In an effort to tackle poverty and improve\n            living standards for the next generation, the Turkish\n            government has helped tens of thousands of mothers cover\n            essential child-rearing expenses under the Social Risk\n            Mitigation Project, financed by a World Bank loan. The\n            handouts known as Conditional Cash Transfers go to the\n            poorest six percent of households, provided parents send\n            their children to school or have them vaccinated when\n            they\u0092re young. As of October 2005, this assistance had\n            reached 1.9 million (roughly nine out of 10) of the poorest\n            children in Turkey. The Social Risk Mitigation Project\u0092s\n            initial goal was to soften the impact of Turkey\u0092s 2001\n            economic crisis on poor households with emergency\n            assistance, and improve their capability to cope with\n            similar risks in the future. In the process, the project has\n            strengthened a network of 931 state-run Social Solidarity\n            Foundations that are now better able to reach out to the\n            poor, identify their needs and improve their prospects.\n            Foundations, which used to distribute food and other\n            benefits on an ad hoc basis, now have access to a\n            computerized system and a clearly defined target group."}, "docdt": "2006-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
