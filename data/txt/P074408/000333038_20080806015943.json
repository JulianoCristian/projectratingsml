outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the most prominent and positive message is\n            that, with the strong ownership from government leaders and\n            civil servants, in both the center and regions, and with\n            sustained and adequate budgeting, conditional cash transfers\n            (CCT) can succeed in reducing the vulnerability of poor\n            households and in maintaining their investments in their\n            children's health and education. Even in situations\n            like Turkey's in which specific income/consumption data\n            is not available at the outset, proxies can be rapidly\n            developed that lead to an overall good targeting outcome.\n            The project implementation experience also offers an\n            interesting lesson regarding the use of policy\n            conditionality linked to investment operations. The use of\n            such conditionality, especially when it comes to emergency\n            type operations like the SRMP, will need to be carefully\n            weighed with respect to both feasibility and operational\n            implications. For the SRMP, the originally specified\n            disbursement condition (the restructuring of the\n            implementing institution), turned out to be not a binding\n            restriction for the successful start-up of the program. The\n            other notable lesson concerns the costs of not monitoring of\n            the most meaningful outcomes, in particular in challenging\n            areas such as small loans and employability training. The\n            project did not measure outcomes, such as profitability of\n            the income-generating activities, so there was no reasonable\n            basis to discuss mid-course changes in this component with\n            the government. The project did not follow graduates after\n            they were placed in employment, which leaves little basis\n            for discussion of changes in, for instance, types of training."}, "docdt": "2008-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
