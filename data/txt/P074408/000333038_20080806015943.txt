F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the SRMP was to mitigate the impact of the February
2001 economic crisis on poor households (social risk mitigation) and to improve their
capacity to cope with similar risks in the future (social risk management). The SRMP
will achieve these objectives through: (i) an adjustment portion, providing immediate
support to the poorest affected by the crisis (social risk mitigation); and (ii) an investment
portion, which consists of three components (a) building up the capacity of state
institutions providing basic social services and social assistance to the poor (social risk
management); (b) implementing a social assistance system (Conditional Cash Transfers -
CCT) targeted to the poorest 6 percent of the population conditional on improved use of
basic health and education services (social risk mitigation and prevention); and (c)
increasing the income generation, employment opportunities and social service access of
the poor (social risk prevention).

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Macro-economic.      The Social Risk Mitigation Project (SRMP) was part of the Government's
response to a series of shocks that culminated in the economic crisis of 2001. The earthquake
that struck the Marmara region in August 1999 and killed, according to official numbers, about
15,000 people lies in the background to the economic crisis. The immediate cause of the crisis
was poor quality loans, which undermined the banking system. In November 2000, a medium-
sized bank experienced a liquidity crunch. The financial turmoil that resulted undermined
confidence in the crawling peg exchange rate system. In February 2001, a political conflict led
foreign investors to repatriate capital, sparking a full fledged currency crisis; this obliged the
Government to abandon the disinflation program and float the Lira. During the crisis, the value
of the Lira in foreign exchange fell by about half while nominal interest rates doubled; the
banking system was damaged and scores of enterprises went bankrupt. A drought and the impact
of September 11, 2001 attack on tourism complicated the crisis. The crisis harmed production
and employment: over 1998-2001, per-capita GDP in constant Turkish Lira contracted by 7.5
percent, in 1998 prices, while the unemployment rate rose by 1.7 percentage points from end-
October 1998 to end-2001. Appraisal of the SRMP took place in this troubled context.

Sectoral. In 2001, the project team conducted a qualitative social assessment to assist the
Government in the preparation of the project. The assessment showed evidence of withdrawal of
children from school following the economic crisis. The assessment found that out-of-pocket
school expenditures were larger than anticipated because of informal fees.            The poorest
households resorted to child labor and cut back consumption of meat, fresh fruit, vegetables, and
tea to cope with the contraction of incomes.

Looking back to 2002, the Poverty Assessment (DIE & World Bank, 2006) confirmed that
children, and families with children, were particularly likely to be poor. Moreover, the Poverty
Assessment showed that poor children were particularly likely to miss basic education and health
services. The Assessment presented evidence from regression analysis that participation in post-
primary education is strongly and negatively associated with poverty. Turning to health, the
Poverty Assessment showed that inability to pay often prevented poor families from using health
services: 95 percent of the poor said that their reason for not seeking care when ill is that it was
not affordable.

While children absorbed much of the shock of the crisis, the social protection system focused on
pensions for the elderly, even though, in 2002, about 62 percent of poor households had children,
but no elderly people. The Government's task, with assistance from the World Bank team, was
to find ways to deliver quick support to the program to stabilize social conditions and poverty in
Turkey.

Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The updated CAS for Turkey of July 12, 2001 stood on
three pillars: (i) structural policies to correct the weaknesses underlying the crisis and
establishing a sounder basis for disinflation and growth over the medium-term; (ii) strong social



                                                 1

policies including enhanced social dialogue to achieve price and wage policies consistent with
macroeconomic stability, and increased emphasis on the protection of the most vulnerable
groups of society; and (iii) fiscal and monetary policies geared toward restoring financial
stability and resuming the disinflation process. The SRMP formed part of the second pillar
because it protected vulnerable groups (through activities listed in Section 1.4).

Rationale for Bank assistance. The severity of the economic crisis of 2001 justified World Bank
support for the SRMP, considering Government requests for assistance in mitigating the impact
of the crisis on poor and vulnerable groups. Further, the Bank did have international experiences
and implementation knowledge to share precisely regarding the use of conditional cash transfers
to reach poor families and children

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

Objectives. The development objectives of the SRMP were to mitigate the impact of the
February 2001 economic crisis on poor households (social risk mitigation) and to improve their
capacity to cope with similar risks in the future (social risk management). The SRMP achieved
these objectives through an:

    (i)     Adjustment portion, providing immediate support to the poorest affected by the crisis
            (social risk mitigation); and
    (ii)    Investment portion, which consists of three components
            a. Building up the capacity of state institutions providing basic social services and
                social assistance to the poor (social risk management);
            b. Implementing a social assistance system (Conditional Cash Transfers - CCT)
                targeted to the poorest 6 percent of the population conditional on improved use of
                basic health and education services (social risk mitigation and prevention); and
            c. Increasing the income generation, employment opportunities and social service
                access of the poor (social risk prevention).

Main indicators. These were.
    Approximately 1.05 million poor children helped back to school in 2001.
    SYDTF / SYDVs expenditures of YTL 550 million in 2001.
    Functioning management information system (MIS) for SYDTF / SYDVs and Social the
    Social Services & Child Protection Organization (SHÇEK).
    Beneficiary satisfaction with SYDTF programs.
    Strong public information campaigns implemented by SYDTF and SHÇEK.
    Household income and expenditure survey undertaken by the State Institute of Statistics
    (DIE), beginning in 2002.
    Number of CCT beneficiaries (target 1.1 million people).
    Net increase in school attendance rates for poor beneficiary population.
    Net decrease in school drop-out rates for poor beneficiary population.
    Increased vaccination coverage for poor beneficiary population
    Increased usage of health facilities by poor beneficiary population.
    Number of income-generating sub-projects started by project beneficiaries.
    Number of micro-businesses started by the poor beneficiary population.
    Number of illiterate adults becoming functionally literate.


                                                  2

    Number of unemployed youth trained.
    Number of person-days of temporary community employment created.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification.

There were no changes to the PDO and the key performance indicators. However, the indicators
identified at appraisal measure, for the most part, outputs rather than final outcomes. Therefore,
the Government and the World Bank project team agreed to focus on two indicators that better
reflect project success: (i) establishment of a functioning poverty monitoring system and (ii) the
impact of CCT on net school enrollment.          There was also agreement to focus on a few
intermediate outcome indicators.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The Project supported the following component interventions:

Component 1 -Adjustment: Rapid assistance to the poorest people (Estimated Loan disbursement
and estimated total cost of US$ 100 million). The aim of the adjustment component was to
deliver rapid relief to vulnerable groups through existing government mechanisms since it was
impossible to establish new mechanisms instantly. The component financed delivery of school
attendance packages (shoes, uniforms, books, & stationary), pharmaceuticals for poor members
of existing social insurance programs, and social assistance in cash and kind (including food and
heating support).

Component 2 - Investment: Institutional development. (Estimated Loan disbursement of
US$ 32.9 million and estimated total cost: US$ 41.5 million). The aim of this component was to
build up the capacity of the main institutions which protect and assist the poor. The component
delivered extensive training, equipment, furniture, support to monitoring and evaluation and to
policy research, in the institutions that manage social services to vulnerable groups. These are
the SYDTF and its 931 SYDVs and the SHÇEK. The component also supported the statistical
survey work of the DIE (TurkStat).

Component 3 - Investment: Conditional Cash Transfers (Estimated Loan disbursement of
US$ 261.3 million and estimated total cost US$ 559.7 million). The objective was to prevent
poor households from becoming poorer and to improve their children's future productivity and
incomes. The CCT program identified eligible households through a formula built up from
indicators of wealth and consumption..        The program made payments to women in poor
households on condition that they send their school-aged children to school and bring pre-
school-aged children to clinics for regular health visits and inoculations. The CCT program
provided an extra incentive for households to send their girls to secondary school.

Component 4 - Investment: Local Initiatives (Estimated Loan disbursement of US$ 99. 7 million
and estimated total cost $US 134.7 million). The aim of the Local Initiatives component was to
finance activities, proposed by districts and local communities, to promote sustainable
employment among the poor. The component invested in small loans for income-generating



                                                 3

 activities, and grants for employability (skills) training, social service sub-projects, rehabilitation
 of schools, and temporary employment.

 There was also a front-end fee of US$ 5 million.

 1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable). None.

 1.6 Other significant changes

 There have been four amendments to the Loan Agreement and none of these made any
 fundamental changes in project design or operation. The Amendment of
 i. January 31, 2003 was geared to start disbursement of the CCT component. It postponed the
     application of the condition that Turkey adopt a law reorganizing the SYDTF as a condition
     for disbursement for the CCT and local initiatives components;
 ii. August 7, 2003, and given the fiscal situation of Turkey, delayed the programmed increase in
     the share of Government's share of funding for CCT and adjusted CCT education grants;
iii. December 30, 2003 reallocated relatively modest sums, mainly to consultant's services and
     training;
iv. July 29, 2004, delayed the programmed increase in the Government's share of funding of
     CCT again, and extended and adjusted the health and education grants.

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 2.1 Project preparation, design, and quality at entry.

 Upon request from the Government, the World Bank team supported the development of a quick
 policy response to the economic crisis, which resulted in the Adjustment - Rapid Assistance
 component of the Project. Similarly, the team also supported Government in the design of a
 medium-term response, through the CCT, local initiatives, and capacity building components.
 The Government asked for the income-generating sub-projects and skills training sub-
 components of the Local Initiatives component, seeing these, as a way of durably reducing
 poverty. Many countries struggle to succeed with small / micro credit and skills training projects.
 Given the record in the fields, Turkey would have benefited from the inputs of World Bank staff
 specialized in these areas. But it would have been inappropriate to prolong preparation to
 achieve a better design of the Local Initiatives during a crisis.

 2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

 Economic context. Following the economic crisis, Turkey recovered vigorously. Per capita
 GDP in constant Lira rose by over 27 percent over 2001-2005 and grew again in 2006 and early
 2007. This good outcome is a result of the Government's overall economic and policy program,
 of which the SRMP forms a small part. The economic recovery set a favorable macro-economic
 environment for implementation of the Project.

 Government ownership. Strong Government ownership for the Project speeded implementation,
 except for a pause when administrations changed in 2002. The Government budgeted adequately,



                                                    4

and took on an increasing share of responsibility for financing, as mandated in the Loan
Agreement.

Delay in rapid assistance component. Under the Rapid Assistance component, the World Bank
planned to transfer US$100 million to the state budget quickly so that the SYDTF could deliver
support to vulnerable groups without waiting for the CCT and local initiatives to start-up. The
priority objectives were to deliver assistance in the form of fuel during the severe winter of 2001-
2002 and to deliver school packages to children who might not otherwise be able to attend school.
However, the World Bank could not disburse in 2001because the Government did not meet the
macro-economic conditions (Annex 2, Tables 1 and 2). Nevertheless, the SYDTF received an
advance from the Treasury and began delivery of assistance in September­October 2001,
reaching over a million school children near the start of the school year, and then it delivered fuel
assistance. In April 2002 the World Bank reimbursed the Government for these expenditures.

Delay in the implementation of investment components.             Implementation of the Capacity
Building, CCT, and Local Initiatives components started only 14 months after the project's
effectiveness because the Parliament did not pass the draft law to fully define the legal status of
the SYDTF, which was a condition of disbursement.              However, the SYDTF functioned
adequately even before passage of the Law, so this condition may not have been as important as
the Bank had originally thought. The first Amendment to the Loan Agreement, on January 31,
2003 delayed the application of this condition of disbursement and allowed the Government to
start implementation of the medium-term programs. Parliament adopted the Law on December 1,
2005.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

MIS. The Project envisaged development, delivery, and use of an integrated MIS to manage
activities implemented by the SYDGM and its 931 local SYDVs. But work on the new MIS did
not start until the final year of the Project and the software development phase was only started
in October 2007. One of the reasons for the delay is that the sub-contractor did not understand
the SYDGM's requirements, in part because of staff turnover and in part because they did not
allocate sufficient staff. These delays hampered integration of the records of the SYDGM's
programs. The subcontractor subsequently went out of business and, at present, the contractor is
completing the work from the government's own funds. The SYDGM will use this software to
manage implementation of CCT, small loans for income-generating activities, training, and other
activities.

The MIS and IT systems for the SHÇEK have been delivered and are functioning. These
systems connect Ankara headquarters with 81 provincial directorates and 600 delivery points.

TurkStat. The Project directly supported the household income and consumption expenditure
survey conducted by TurkStat (formerly, the DIE) in 2002 and supported the 2003, 2004 and
2005 surveys through investments in computer equipment and training. The survey of 2002
formed the basis for the Joint Poverty Assessment (DIE & World Bank, 2005), which set forth
the characteristics of poverty in Turkey.




                                                  5

Project monitoring & evaluation.        The Project supported an independent and good-quality
evaluation of the CCT by the IFPRI. (Ahmed, et al. 2007). Moreover, the Project supported
evaluations of the Local Initiatives component by the national consulting companies ESDA1
(2006), SURKAL2 (2006), PAR Consulting (2006), and GENAR4 (2006). The reports, however,
                                  3

did not evaluate the profitability of the income-generating activities or track graduates of project-
sponsored training to see whether they remained employed. So it is not possible to conclude,
based on these reports, whether the income-generating sub-projects or skills training led to any
sustained benefits.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The Government of Turkey considers CCT a core part of its social protection program. It has
continued implementing the CCT program through the SYDGM since March, 2007.
Impressively, the Government budgeted YTL 450 million (US$ 366 million) for CCT for 2007
and about YTL 500 million (US$ 407 million) for 2008. While the Government plans to
continue to implement CCT in future years, there is internal discussion of ways to phase-out
CCT over the longer-term and switch to a program that helps households work their way out of
poverty.

Turning to the Local Initiatives, the SYDGM continues to implement many of these activities.
The SYDTF Board established a preliminary evaluation commission to quickly evaluate the
small-loans (revenue-generating activities) and employability training programs, and also the
social service sub-projects.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives. The Project objective is to reduce vulnerability among poor households,
an urgently relevant objective in the aftermath of the earthquake of 1999 and the economic crisis
of 2001. The project team's social assessment confirmed that the education, health, nutrition,
and income status of many poor households diminished following these shocks.

Relevance of design. The social assessment used in preparing the Project showed that poverty
was worsening among children; later, the Poverty Assessment of 2006 showed that poverty was
concentrated among households with children. So the largest component, CCT, identified poor
households and protected their children from loss of education and basic health, and thus reduced
their vulnerability.  Turkey achieved relatively high primary school enrollment rates, but
enrollment rates in secondary schools were lower, and girls' enrollment rates ran below boys'
rates' (Annex 2, Table 5).

                                                 6

The design of the CCT program responded to Turkey's needs by paying higher benefits for
attendance at secondary than at primary schools and by paying higher rates for girls' than for
boys' attendance. Making payments of transfers conditional on use of health and education
services introduced an investment aspect. Beneficiaries are now more able to confront a future
shock because the better health and education resulting from CCT enables them to earn more. In
addition, receipt of CCT transfers reduced pressures on beneficiaries to run down savings and
sell productive assets, such as cattle, so that they are better positioned to confront future shocks.

The design of the Local Initiatives component also sought to reduce poverty permanently, for
example, through investments in income-generating sub-projects, in skills training, and in school
rehabilitation. It is possible to imagine a stronger design: the employability training might have
been tied more explicitly to employer needs and contributions and the small loans to support
income-generating activities could have been designed to evolve into a financially sustainable
micro-credit institution. The SYDGM sees the small loans as a form of social assistance that
would increase the productivity of the target groups rather than as micro-credit.

Relevance of approach to implementation. The Project's approach to implementation was
relevant to Turkey's need during the economic crisis. It built up a project unit as a way of
delivering quickly, while it invested in capacity of central and local government capacity. It also
improved Turkey's tools for addressing vulnerability to respond to the concentration of poverty
among children by launching CCT.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

PDO 1: "Mitigate the impact of the February 2001 economic crisis on poor households." The
Project addressed the consequences of the February 2001 crisis on poor households through the
rapid assistance component.

Under the Rapid Assistance Component, the Government of Turkey delivered school attendance
packages, food, fuel for heating, and pharmaceuticals to poor households quickly after the crisis
of February, 2001. Since disbursement of the component was delayed, the Government financed
the assistance quickly and ahead of disbursement from the Bank Loan, as part of its broader
recovery program. The Government delivered education assistance to 1.05 million poor children
in about 400,000 households, meeting the target for indicator 1. (This was confirmed from
administrative data from the SYDGM.) The SYDTF disbursed YTL 486 million in 2001,
approaching the target of YTL 550 million for indicator 2.

The Assessment study of the Middle East Technical University (2002) found that most qualified
applicants received assistance and were satisfied. (The SYDGM commented that the sample size
of 1,061 beneficiaries was insufficient to reach firm conclusions about Turkey as a whole, but
that the survey's conclusions were probably not far from the truth.) The survey found that the
Muhtars (the traditional village heads) were the most important source of information about the
assistance and may not have informed some poor households ­in effect, excluding them. This
was a weakness in a generally successful program.




                                                   7

PDO 2: "and to improve their capacity to cope with similar risks in the future." The Project
addressed the capacity of the poor to cope with similar risks by investing in institutional
development, CCT, and the Local Initiatives.

Institutional Development. The component built the capacity of the SYDTF and its SYDVs: the
proof of success is that the SYDTF and SYDVs were able to deliver the CCT to beneficiaries.
To implement the CCT, the SYDTF and SYDVs extended their software systems. Delivery of
the unified MIS appears as indicator 3. However, the Project delivered part but not all of the
unified MIS before the project closed. About $US 1 million of the Loan budgeted for this
purpose was cancelled.

In all assessment studies, the beneficiaries expressed satisfaction with SYDTF programs,
meeting the target for indicator 4. The impact of the public information campaigns is mixed,
since some potential beneficiaries reported that they were not aware of SYDTF program, so the
component partially meets the target for indicator 5.

The component strengthened the capacity of the Project Coordination Unit through an extensive
training program. The original intent was to integrate staff from the SYDGM into every stage of
project execution. The difficulty in transferring capacity to the SYDGM can be explained in part
by the need to pay market-based salaries to attract and hold high quality staff in the Project Unit.

However, during the one-year period prior to the closing of the Project, the staff of the SYDGM
worked closely with the Project Unit to harmonize implementation processes. Moreover, the
SYDGM recruited support staff from the Project Unit after the Project closed. At present, the
SYDGM is carrying out procedures and works formerly done by the Project Unit.

Importantly, the component built the capacity of DIE-TurkStat: the proof of success is that, with
project support, it began monitoring poverty through annual household surveys in 2002,
satisfying indicator 6. The institutional component also supported delivery of an MIS and IT
system for the SHÇEK.

CCT. The Government of Turkey greatly exceeded the target coverage 1.1 million people of the
CCT program, under indicator 7. By end-January, 2007, it had extended coverage to 2.63
million people.

It's possible to reach firm conclusions on the outcomes from the CCT program from the final
evaluation report by Ahmed, et al. (2007) of the IFPRI team. The girls' secondary school
attendance rate rose by an impressive 5.45 percentage points. Moreover, the CCT program was



5Please note: the change in enrollment rates from the IFPRI study are on an entirely different statistical basis and
not comparable with the enrollment rates from the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). The former are the
coefficients derived from estimation of an econometric regression equation; the later are changes in gross enrollment
numbers.    The regression equation holds several variables that influence enrollment rates constant in the
background; in contrast the gross enrollment rates are unadjusted. Moreover the rates from the IFPRI study are
computed from cross-section data sampled over a short time period; the gross enrollment rate data are a series over
years.



                                                         8

associated with an increase in the girls' secondary school enrollment rate of 10.7 percent.
Ahmed, et al. did not find evidence of an effect on the boys' rate. Yet the girls may be a more
vulnerable population. The superior response of girls education to the introduction of CCT may
well reflect the superior benefit paid for girls' attendance.

Ahmed, et al. found that CCT increased the net girls' primary school attendance rate by 1.3
percentage points. They found that the CCT raised the net total primary school attendance rate by
0.8 percentage points. The effect of CCT on primary enrollment rates was modest because these
rates were high before the introduction of CCT and because enrolment is mandatory. On the
strength of the results at the secondary level, the Project satisfied indicator 8, which requires a
"net increase in school attendance rates for the poor beneficiary population."

Indicator 9 concerns the school drop-out rate. There is no data on drop-out rates but Ahmed et al.
collected information on a related rate, the primary to secondary school transition rate.

Turning to health, the IFPRI team found that health transfers from the CCT program were
associated with an increase in the immunization rate for beneficiary preschool children by a
statistically significant 13.6 percent ­satisfying indicator 10.      The IFPRI team found no
difference between the rate of visits by beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries to health centers
when they are sick. Regarding indicator 11, the IFPRI report did not present evidence on
whether CCT increased the use of health facilities.

The estimates above probably understate the responses of school attendance and immunization to
the introduction of CCT. IFPRI conducted the survey that underlies the evaluation report
between December, 2005 and March, 2006.                At that time, a large proportion of CCT
beneficiaries had been in the program for a short time: 44 percent of education and 63 percent of
health beneficiaries joined the CCT program in 2005. This means that Ahmed et al.'s results
reflect only the short-term response of beneficiaries. Thus, the IFPRI results probably
underestimate the impacts of CCT on use of health and education services.

CCT: Targeting. The CCT program aimed to target, that is to reach, the poorest 6 percent of the
population. From the outset, it was unlikely that the target group could be reached with exact
precision as the accurate income (consumption) of household could not be directly measured.
Hencem the Government and Bank teams worked on a proxy for such welfare indicators (Proxy
Means Test) which was then successfully employed.

Therefore, the CCT program identified beneficiaries through proxy means targeting.            This
method relied on indicators that were highly correlated with household consumption expenditure,
but were easy to measure. This method assigned a score to each applicant, and those below the
pre-determined cut-off receive benefits. The formula was determined by estimating a regression
equation of households' consumption expenditures against observable demographic, geographic,
housing, and asset variables. A household's score was computed by multiplying the estimated
coefficients by value of the observable variables for the household. In practice, classifying
families through proxy means tests leads to some errors of inclusion of non-poor households and
exclusion of poor households. A good program is one in which most households are in the




                                                   9

bottom quintile (20 percent) in the distribution of consumption expenditures and few are in the
top three quintiles.

The IFPRI team found that 78 percent of all health beneficiary households and 62 percent of
education beneficiaries were in the poorest quintile of households. This compares quite well to
CCT programs in Latin America (Lindert, et al., 2006). About a third of all transfers went to the
poorest quintile under Argentina's Household Heads Program, and about 35 percent of transfers
when to the bottom quintile under Mexico's famous Opportunidades (Progressa) program. The
only Latin America country to approach Turkey's performance was Chile, where the unified
family subsidy and Solidario programs delivered 58 percent of benefits to the poorest quintile.

For Turkey's CCT, the IFPRI authors found that 83 percent of the education beneficiaries and 92
percent of the health beneficiaries are poor, when households are defined as poor if they fall in
the lowest 30 percent of the income distribution. Impressively, the IFPRI authors found no
leakage of health or education benefits to the richest two quintiles of households, and almost no
leakage into the middle quintile.

The IFPRI team found that only 13 percent of applicants in the bottom 10 percent of the
distribution of expenditures were rejected ­a relatively low rate of exclusion of very poor
households. This is the most relevant available measure of errors of exclusion, since the CCT
program targets the bottom 6 percent. About 59 percent of applicants that were rejected were in
the bottom 30 percent: the figures are 21.4 percent for the second decile and 24.4 percent for the
third decile.

CCT: Fiscal sustainability. The Government demonstrated its will to sustain funding of CCT by
absorbing an increasing proportion of financing.        Over time, the government financed an
increasing share of CCT expenditures through domestic sources instead of international sources,
leading to a complete domestic financing in 2008 (amounting to 0.6% of GDP). As such, the
CCT became an integral part of the Governments' social assistance strategies and programs.

Local Initiatives. There are four evaluation studies of the component: PAR (2006), GENAR
(2006), ESDA (2006), and SURKAL (2006). Short summaries of these reports appear in Annex
3. These studies draw on surveys of thousands of beneficiaries and key informants and on
hundreds of investments. In general, the studies view the outcomes from the component as
favorable. But the studies lack clear indicators of the components' impact on poverty and
vulnerability. Moreover, the studies do not track beneficiaries over the months or year following
their participation in Project-supported activities, so it is unclear whether there are any lasting
benefits.

Local Initiatives: Small loans for income-generating activities. This sub-component supported
5,242 income-generating activities that benefited 45,549 people (indicator 13). There is no
information on number of private businesses started (indicator 12). The purpose of the income-
generating sub-projects and the skills training is to avoid dependency on transfers and limit
future fiscal costs by helping poor households become self-supporting.            The loans were
originally for a maximum of $1,000 for rural areas and $2,000 for urban areas; this was revised
upward in Amendment #4 to $3,000 and $5,000.



                                                10

It is difficult to evaluate the outcomes based on the data available from project monitoring and
the evaluation studies. The compilation of accounts for a sample of the income-generating sub-
projects would reveal whether the sub-projects were profitable --but this was not done. The
evaluation reports do tabulate responses to questions about the success of the activities from a
qualitative survey, and these suggest that outcomes were mixed.

Based on these responses, the evaluation report on urban income-generating activities ESDA
(2006) estimated that a third are economically sustainable, a bit more than a third are fragile, and
the rest are not sustainable. Some types of urban income-generating activities were particularly
troubled: more than a quarter of street vending and more than half of sewing-embroidery
activities failed.

Turning to rural areas, PAR (2006) reported on the small loan supported dairy cattle, sheep-
raising, and bee-keeping income-generating sub-projects. The report found, in a survey of more
than 4,400 beneficiaries, that 21 percent said that they earned no income from their small loan
financed activity and a further 43 percent reported that they earned very little. Bee-keeping
activities failed at a particularly high rate: 68 percent reported that they couldn't carry out the
activity. About 45 percent of beneficiaries of other agricultural activities, such as gardening and
orchards, reported that they did not gain any income from their project-supported income-
generating activities.

The ESDA (2006) report on urban income generating sub-projects found that about half of the
beneficiary households did not earn any net monthly income from their activity, after paying
expenses. Moreover, about 42 percent said they did not have money (in effect, operating capital)
to purchase the inputs necessary to continue operation. On the basis of these results, ESDA
(2006) estimated that 34 percent of the income-generating activities were "economically
sustainable," 36 percent are "fragile," and 31 percent were "not sustainable."

The small loan program is financially sustainable, from the SYDTF's point of view, if repayment
rates replenish loans so that it can make new loans. Since the nominal interest rate on the loans
is zero, the real amount of repayment has been declining. The record on repayment of Project-
supported small loans remains unclear since most beneficiaries were not yet obligated to repay at
the time of the evaluation study. That is, it's too early to reach a firm judgment on the rate of
repayment.

There is some limited evidence in the evaluation reports. According to the ESDA (2006) report
on dairy, sheep breeding, and bee-keeping activities, about 14 percent of those obligated to pay
have failed to do so; according to the SURKAL report on crop farming and agricultural tool
activities, about 23 percent of beneficiaries that owe repayments say they cannot pay; the results
reported in PAR (2006) are unclear. Still, these repayment rates may suggest that most of the
underlying revenue-generating activities are successful. But these repayment rates would be a
ruinously unsatisfactory for a micro-credit institution because the institution would eventually
exhaust all its reserves.

Local Initiatives: Skills training. This sub-component supported 387 skills training
(employability training) sub-projects skills that trained 12,453 people, mainly youth (indicator


                                                 11

15). The ESDA (2006) evaluation reports that about 12 percent of trainees dropped out, and
about 43 percent of graduates were placed in jobs or started a business. There is no information
on whether the graduates who were placed remained employed or whether they increased their
income over time. There is also no information on the number of adults who became literate
following project-supported education (indicator 14).

Public training centers delivered most training supported by this sub-component, although the
best practice is to contract out training to the private sector. Moreover, there was little mention
of any collaboration with Chambers of Commerce and Industry to identify types of training and
to place graduates. Surprisingly, there is little mention of the adult literacy training that is
prominent in the description of the sub-component in the Project Appraisal Document.

Local Initiatives: Pilot social services. The Project supported 2,480 social services sub-projects.
The ESDA (2006) evaluation reports that almost 96 percent of their sample of beneficiaries said
that their social service sub-project was successful. But the report does not apply any further
criteria for assessing success of the sub-projects. For example, the Project might have measured
success in achieving the PDO in terms of preventing loss of health or income among
beneficiaries, or in piloting new methods which are later adopted by others. The piloting of new
concepts, such as the shelter for abused women in Istanbul, may contribute to the protection of
vulnerable people by influencing social service delivery in Turkey. The dissemination of results
from this part of the Project apparently contributed to replication of these pilots, but there is no
detailed information on this.

Local Initiatives: Temporary employment, social infrastructure, and my beautiful school. The
Temporary Employment sub-component generated wages in poor areas by supporting 735 labor
intensive public works, such as tree planting and supported hiring of 5,125 people (indicator 16).
The Social Infrastructure sub-component invested in areas such as water & sewerage and
environmental clean-up. The My Beautiful Schools sub-component supported light repairs to
1,300 schools.

The GENAR (2006) evaluation report draws on these sub-components concludes that, although
there were clear standards for targeting at the center, the local SYDVs did not apply any
systematic standard to selection of investments in civil works and in hiring laborers. While most
beneficiaries were probably poor, the data on housing and assets point to significant leakages to
middle-income groups. The GENAR (2006) report discusses the weak capacities of the local
SYDVs and the need for training in every stage of project activities and management. The My
Beautiful School sub-component seems to have strengthened parent and students' ties to their
schools: in particular, it arranged for parent participation in school maintenance. In general, the
investments in civil works were valued by the local populations and officials. But, there was
little monitoring of measurable benefits, such as consumption of laborers or of economic spill-
over in the regions.

Local Initiatives: targeting. In most cases, the SYDVs did not use the scoring formula developed
for targeting CCT to select beneficiaries for the income-generating sub-projects and for skills
training. In the income-generating (sub-component, this occurred even though the project unit




                                                 12

required used of the CCT scoring formula. Instead, each SYDV seems to have applied varying
criteria.

The PAR (2006) evaluation reports that two-thirds of the small loans for income-generating sub-
projects in rural areas went to households who reported incomes under YTL 380 per month ­a
relatively poor group.     Yet beneficiaries sometimes understate their incomes ­in order to
maintain their access to benefits. The indicators of housing quality (mud brick, concrete, wood,
etc.) and assets owned (TVs, refrigerators, etc.), when available, suggest that some beneficiaries
are better off than the income data would indicate.

The distribution of the small loans seems inequitable in the sense that the credits are so large that
they can be distributed only to a quite small proportion of the poor. Another source of inequity
could be that information about the availability of micro-credits was not made generally
available. Most beneficiaries report that they receive information about the availability of small
credits from Muhtars, rather than from mass media, and Muhtars may have tended to inform
their supporters.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Satisfactory.

The Project outcome is rated Satisfactory on the strength of its success in mitigating the effect
of the economic crisis of 2001 on poor households and in building the capacity of poor
households to cope with similar shocks in the future (the PDOs). The rapid response was
successful in delivering quick assistance to poor people, thanks to the Government's agreement
to advance funds quickly to the SYDGM. CCT were highly successful in building the education
and health of poor children, which can be reasonably expected to strengthen their ability to resist
future shocks. The impact of the Local Initiatives component is less clear ­ a systematic impact
assessment would be necessary to establish whether the micro projects have improved the long-
run earnings capacity of beneficiary households.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty. To summarize, the Rapid Response component alleviated poverty in the aftermath of
the economic crisis of 2001 by financing the delivery of school packages, fuel for heat, and other
assistance to the poorest families. The CCT component reduced vulnerability to poverty by
helping children, and especially secondary school-aged girls, attend school, and by promoting
immunization (Section 3.2).

Gender. The CCT component empowered poor women by transferring benefits directly to them.
It also promoted girls' school attendance by paying a premium subsidy for girls attendance,
compared to boys'. Furthermore, more than half the beneficiaries of employability training (in
the Local Initiatives component) were women. The benefits of the social service sub-projects
also appear to have been concentrated among women.



                                                13

Social Development. An important aspect about the information flow and access to the project is
reported in the evaluation reports. Here, the crucial role of village headmen becomes apparent ­
both in their role as informing the village population as well as in their role of making decisions
on access to program benefits. Local dynamics and relationships can hence have well influenced
the distribution of, and access to, project resources.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional development component strengthened the SYDTF, its 931 SYDVs, the SHCEK,
and the DIE-TurkStat (see Section 3.2 above). The proof of the improvement lies in the success
of the SYDTF and its SYDVs in delivering the CCT program, and in the DIE-TurkStat's
completion of the household income & expenditure survey of 2002 and its other work on poverty
monitoring (Section 3.2).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Several Turkish policy-makers asked the World Bank project team whether the CCT
component's child-based benefit structure might induce beneficiaries to have more children. The
IFPRI team found that the CCT program had no effect on pregnancy of child bearing-aged
women from participating households. Ahmed, et al. (2007) estimated that the receipt of
transfers actually reduced the probability of a woman of child-bearing age become pregnant by
2-3 percent.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The IFPRI team surveyed beneficiaries of CCT and the companies that authored the four reports
on the Local Initiatives component surveyed beneficiaries.          In general, the beneficiaries
expressed satisfaction with the CCT and the local initiatives. Most felt that these activities had
improved their economic well-being. (The results from each of the consultants' studies of
beneficiary views, as well as economic and financial results, are summarized in Annex 3)


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Low risk.

The risk to development outcomes for the CCT component is low because the Government has
committed itself to the program and is fully financing the program with domestic resources.
Moreover, the Government, through the SYDTF, is continuing most of the activities that were
supported by the Local Initiatives component. The sustainability of the skill training and small-
loan supported income generating activities could be further enhanced by evaluating specific
design components (e.g., beneficiary selection, application of sustainable micro-finance rules)
against international experiences and best practices.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
   Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank performance during preparation of the SRMP was excellent.                The Bank team
responded quickly to the economic crisis of 2001 and engaged effectively with the Government.
The Government and the Bank team jointly prepared a sensible and workable design for the CCT
that could be implemented quickly. The team arranged to speed funds to the Government, under
the rapid assistance component, to finance quick relief for vulnerable households. There was
probably room for improvement in the agreement reached between the Government and the
Bank teams on the disbursement conditions and on the design of the income-generating sub-
projects and skills training sub-components (Section 3.2). But it was not appropriate to prolong
preparation to achieve a better design during a crisis.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)
    Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of supervision was satisfactory, and with regard to the CCT, excellent. The team
was flexible in gaining a waiver of the condition of disbursement (for legislation reorganizing the
SYDTF). It was successful in supporting the Government's expansion of delivery of CCT and
helped roll out the Local Initiatives component. It conducted repeated field visits. Moreover, the
team advised the Government in technically difficult areas, especially with regard to targeting
CCT and with capacity building in poverty monitoring. The area for improvement would have
been in working with the Government to improve design and monitoring of the income-
generating activities and skills training.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory.

Based on the rating for quality at entry and supervision, the World Bank's performance is rated
Satisfactory. In retrospect, the Bank should not have set adoption of a law reorganizing the
SYDTF as a condition for disbursement of the CCT and Local Initiatives components since this
delayed disbursement, and the law was of modest importance for improving operation of the
SYDTF.




                                                15

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory.

The Government of Turkey's performance is rated `Satisfactory' because it rolled out the CCT
program quickly following the start of disbursement for the component in early 2003. The main
responsible agencies were the SYDGM, the SYDTF and its local SYDVs. The SYDGM made
its first payments of CCT in April-May, 2003. By May, 2004, it had rolled out CCT in all
provinces, and by the spring of 2005 had met the project objective of delivering CCT to 1.1
million people. By January 2007, Turkey had far exceeded this objective by delivering CCT to
2.63 million people. The difficulty of delivering the benefits, in a well-targeted manner, and
without significant leakages to middle and upper-income groups should not be underestimated.
Turkey covers a large physical territory, and many rural areas, especially in the East and in the
mountain chains, are difficult to reach. The Kaymakams and SYDVs have limited staff. In this
context, their achievement is even more impressive.

The Government demonstrated commitment to sustaining the CCT, by financing an increasing
proportion of the component, and most recently, by financing 100 percent of program costs from
the national budget, which can only be described as highly satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory.

The SRMP project unit was highly successful in supporting the SYDGM and the SYDTF. In
particular, the project was highly successful in organizing and arranging for financing of
complex programs, such as CCT, and rolling them out through out a large country. This was a
remarkable performance, considering the volume of work and the logistical difficulties that the
unit faced.

The project unit was not as successful in transferring skills to personnel at the SYDGM, as
mentioned above. The most likely obstacles in transferring skills and personnel from project
units into Government ministries are the lower salaries paid to civil servants and also difference
in reporting structures.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory.

Based on the good performance of the Government and the project unit, overall Borrower
performance is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

The most prominent and positive message is that, with the strong ownership from Government
leaders and civil servants, in both the center and regions, and with sustained and adequate



                                              16

budgeting, CCT can succeed in reducing the vulnerability of poor households and in maintaining
their investments in their children's health and education. Even in situations like Turkey's in
which specific income/consumption data is not available at the outset, proxies can be rapidly
developed that lead to an overall good targeting outcome.

The project implementation experience also offers an interesting lesson regarding the use of
policy conditionality linked to investment operations. The use of such conditionality, especially
when it comes to emergency-type operations like the SRMP, would need to be carefully weighed
with respect to both feasibility and operational implications. For the SRMP, the originally
specified disbursement condition (the restructuring of the implementing institution), turned out to
be not a binding restriction for the successful start-up of the program.

The other notable lesson concerns the costs of not monitoring of the most meaningful outcomes,
in particular in challenging areas such as small loans and employability training. The Project did
not measure outcomes, such as profitability of the income-generating activities, so there was no
reasonable basis to discuss mid-course changes in this component with the Government. The
Project did not follow graduates after they were placed in employment, which leaves little basis
for discussion of changes in, for instance, types of training.

A further lesson from the Local Initiatives component was the importance of learning from
international best practices in program design. For instance, best practice in the micro-credit
movement is to lend at market rates of interest, and certainly at a positive real rate of interest. In
contrast, the SRMP supported no-interest loans, that inflation made the real interest rate strongly
negative. Another best practice is for financial institutions to make micro-loans, while the
SRMP used government agencies. Turning to vocational education, the best practice is to link
training to industry.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

The following agencies of the Republic of Turkey sent the following comments on this report,
when it was in draft (which can be found in the project files):
        Directorate General of Social Assistance and Solidarity (SYDGM), Prime Ministry
        State Planning Organization (SPO)
        Under Secretariat of Treasury, Prime Ministry
        Social Services and Child Protection Organization. (SHÇEK)

In its comments, the SYDGM stressed that it now delivers the CCT to beneficiaries and is
improving the program. It increased benefits in 2008 and continues to pay a higher rate for girls'
school attendance than for boys'. Moreover, the SYDGM intends to improve the scoring
formula for CCT in response to changes in the poverty profile.            The SYDGM expressed
skepticism about the adequacy of sampling practices in the statistical evaluation of CCT and
warns against concluding that CCT strongly promoted girls' attendance in secondary schools,
although the evidence from the IFPRI report appears strong.




                                                  17

Furthermore, the SYDGM continues to implement some of the Local Initiatives activities. It
views the small loan program for income-generating activities as a form of social assistance that
is designed to promote sustainability by requiring repayment, and does not view the program as
micro-finance.

The SPO commented that SYDGM staff should have been integrated into implementation of
every stage of the Project, as originally intended. Moreover, it commented that the quick start of
operation of the CCT and Local Initiative obliged the Project Unit to use its own software
program rather than establish a data processing infrastructure, and this made it harder for the
SYDGM to implement the Project. Turning to the CCT, the SPO sees the lack of evidence that
beneficiaries visit health centers more quickly as counterbalancing the conclusion that CCT is
associated with a strong rise in inoculation rates. In the view of the project team, the IFPRI
report understates the long-term impact of CCT on use of health centers because many health
benefit recipients joined the program right before the IFPRI survey. The beneficiaries did not
have much time to understand the program and visit centers at the time they were surveys.

The Under Secretariat of Treasury made several corrections to the text. The comments from
SHÇEK stress the significant contributions of the SRMP to the Organization's investments in
early childhood education, equipment of computer rooms, and its education and skills
development programs for target audiences.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Rapid response component.

The adjustment, or rapid response, component, disbursed US$ 100 million to the Government to
deliver quick assistance following the crisis of 2001. The Bank disbursed the funds late in 2002,
because the Government had not met the disbursement condition (Annex 2, Tables 1 and 2).
However, the Treasury advanced funds against the expectation of Bank disbursement. Using
these funds, the SYDTF spent TL 52.5 trillion in 2001 to provide a TL 50 million allowance for
education to 1.05 million poor children in about 400,000 households. The children were chosen,
over September-October, 2001, by local committees comprised of school principals, teachers and
SYDV staff.

The SYTDF also spent TL 90 trillion on food and heating support for the 0.4 million of the
poorest households in October through December 2001.            Moreover, it delivered medicine,
medical treatment, and medical equipment to poor people.

Cash Transfer Program in Turkey: Final Report", "International Food Policy Research
Institute (IFPRI):Washington, DC and Ankara, Turkey, March 16.

The CCT program in Turkey is a targeted social assistance program that is designed to provide
support to the poorest 6 percent of the Turkish population. CCT is a sub-component of the
Social Risk Mitigation Project (SRMP) of the General Directorate of Social Assistance and
Solidarity (SYDGM). The specific objectives of the CCT in Turkey are to increase school
attendance rates for the poor, decrease dropout rates, increase immunization coverage, and
enhance the utilization of health facilities for the 1.1 million target beneficiaries.

The program uses an indicator-based administrative targeting method to identify ultra-poor
households with children aged 0-6 years, school-aged children 6-17 years, and child-bearing-age
women.

This final evaluation report on the impact of the CCT program is a synthesis of three studies: The
First Qualitative Assessment (Kudat et al. 2006), the Quantitative Assessment (Ahmed et al
2006), and the Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study (Adato et al. 2007).

The evaluation study encountered several methodological, technical, and physical constraints.
These affected the efficacy of the impact assessment mainly in two ways. First, in order to
measure program impact, it is necessary to construct a counterfactual measure of what might
have happened without the program. The most powerful way to construct a valid counterfactual
is to randomly select beneficiaries from a pool of equally eligible candidates. However, a
randomized approach was not feasible for the CCT evaluation, as the program had already been



                                                   25

implemented before the evaluation, and it is national. Thus, there is no immediately obvious
comparison group in areas without the program. As a result, the evaluation had to employ
somewhat weaker, nonrandomized approaches for impact assessment. Second, the impact
assessment was based on a cross-sectional household survey and a two-round panel survey. The
surveys were delayed due to problems in locating sample households, the Bayram holidays, and
winter conditions that affected the speed of the field survey work. The delay in carrying out the
first round of the panel survey shortened the elapsed time between the first and the second survey
rounds, which was not sufficient for measuring the impact of the CCT program on a number of
outcomes.

Further, some institutional factors limit the potential impacts of the CCT program. The main
institutional issues and constraints are summarized below.

Institutional Issues and Constraints affecting Program Performance

Operational Performance of the CCT Program. The CCT program has been fully operational
across Turkey since 2004. However, the results of the Quantitative Assessment based on a large
household survey that was nationally representative of the CCT program suggest that, about 44
percent of CCT education beneficiaries and 63 percent of health beneficiaries joined the program
in 2005.

CCT payment delays have been common and there have been large fluctuations in payment
levels. On average at the time of the household survey, CCT education and health beneficiaries
received about 64 percent and 57 percent of the total amount entitled at the time of the survey.
The Government was successful, however, in catching up with payments.

Nevertheless, the survey data also suggest that the regularity of CCT payments has been
increasing over time. Since CCT payments are conditional on school attendance and regular
visits to health clinics by the beneficiaries, the relevant institutions must give this information to
the local SYDVs. Moreover these data must be entered into the MIS to verify the maintenance
of beneficiary status for the disbursement of payments. Apparently these obstacles are being,
gradually, overcome.

The quantitative and the two qualitative studies suggest that some CCT beneficiaries and non
beneficiary-applicants don't understand the program conditions or the application and selection
criteria. This knowledge is essential in ensuring that the program functions as intended.
Successful communication is expected to be especially challenging in a social program targeting
the poorest six percent of the population, where levels of education and literacy are low. Some
beneficiaries are women who belong to a generation where education was less common for girls
than it is now. Some beneficiaries have little experience dealing with formal state institutions,
and CCT programs are procedurally complex. Some degree of misunderstanding is thus expected,
and many program staff have made an effort to communicate program procedures. However, the
research finds that this effort has not been sufficient for the successful transmission of necessary
information.




                                                  26

The First Qualitative Assessment found that staff shortages, and fear of job losses, challenged the
expansion of program coverage and the attainment of full program impacts for current
beneficiaries. The CCT staff had a heavy workload was often asked to assist with other equally
pressing workload peaks faced by non-CCT programs carried out by the SYDVs.

SRMP headquarters staff report that, in order to reduce the workload of the SYDVs and
accelerate the implementation process, two steps were taken since the First Qualitative Study.
First, the received 5,894 person/month of staff employment services, and second, 282 social
workers were employed for the provinces/sub-provinces with a population over 50,000 with
SRMP financing. Employment of some of these social workers was financed by the own
resources of SYDVs.

Sources of Program Information. Household survey data indicate that social networks and
educational institutions played key roles in helping poor families access the CCT program.
Schoolteachers were the most common source of information on education benefits.

During the Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study, schoolteachers, neighbors and
relatives, the muhtars and the Foundation offices were cited by beneficiaries as the main sources
of program-related information. Beneficiaries do not have a single channel for information about
the CCT program, and find it difficult to get reliable information.

Knowledge of Benefit Packages. Most beneficiaries did understand the differences by sex or
type of benefit within their packages. Beneficiaries on the whole understood that the money was
given to poor families, and many also recognized that part of the package is designed to be
education support. In contrast, few people knew about the health component.

Understanding of Conditionalities. The Quantitative Assessment found that the majority of the
beneficiaries did not know the conditions they are required to meet in order to maintain their
eligibility. About 90 percent of the education-beneficiaries and 87 percent of the health-
beneficiaries claimed that no one informed them of the program rules. These findings were
supported by both qualitative studies.

Opinion about CCT and Program Conditions. The Second Qualitative and Anthropological
Study found that beneficiaries and key informants were enthusiastic about the benefits of the
CCT program, emphasizing that the transfers helped them to feed their families and send their
children to school. Key informants were more uniformly positive about the conditional nature of
the benefits than the beneficiaries are. There was a strong provincial dimension to this finding:
almost all the `negative' responses to conditionality came from Van.

Community Liaison. Beneficiaries wanted a liaison to help with the resolution of problems and
doubts: where was their money? How much should they receive? When could they collect it?
Key informants suggested that a promoter should educate beneficiaries about program goals and
the conditional nature of the program and health and nutrition issues. Both key informants and
beneficiaries were keen on the idea of inviting health and education personnel to liaison meetings.




                                                 27

Among beneficiaries, opinions about a liaison showed great variation across the three provinces.
Objections raised were based on gender (inappropriate activities for women) and insufficient
social capital. Key informants were also ambivalent about the idea. The majority of respondents
agreed that the (paid) liaison should be a woman. Other important qualities included: literacy,
honesty, religion (Muslim), independence, speaking ability, propriety, and knowledge of
institutions. Opinions about whether the liaison should be a local person were divided.

Some beneficiaries said their husbands or mothers-in-law would not allow them to attend
meetings, or else their household responsibilities would make such meetings impossible. These
respondents said that they would prefer to meet with the promoter in their own homes.

Targeting Issues

Targeting Effectiveness. The Quantitative Assessment concluded that the CCT program was
well targeted to the poorest. The income distribution of CCT education and health beneficiaries
was highly progressive. High percentages of all beneficiaries belonged to poorer income groups,
particularly the health beneficiaries. Half of all health-beneficiary households and over one-third
of all education-beneficiary households were among the poorest 10 percent of all households in
the income distribution at the national level. Indeed, no education beneficiaries and health
beneficiaries belonged to the richer 30 and 40 percent of all households, respectively.

In any form of targeting, there are problems of exclusion (i.e., leaving out those who are needy)
and inclusion (i.e., providing benefits to those who do not need them). The evaluation results
suggest that, while the CCT program effectively reached the poorest, a considerable number of
non beneficiary-applicant households were also among the poorest but excluded from the
program.

The First Qualitative Study concluded that the CCT appears to have succeeded in targeting the
poorest segments of the Turkish society. At the regional level, this is reflected in the fact that the
least developed regions and provinces receive the bulk of the benefits. The comparison of
beneficiaries with non-beneficiary applicants systematically shows that the former were more
disadvantaged in terms of assets and well-being.          The comparisons of these two groups
conducted in February and September 2005 also showed that the poverty focus of the program
has sharpened as it continued to mature.           Stakeholder discussions and interviews with
beneficiaries revealed that a low level of leakages (that is, program benefits accruing to non-
needy population) existed and, to a large extent, this resulted from issues pertaining to the
application form; continued improvements made in the application form appear to have reduced
leakages over time.

The Targeting Process at the Community Level. The Second Qualitative and Anthropological
Study finds that, in all communities prospective beneficiaries were assisted in the preparation of
their application materials by some combination of Foundation officials, teachers, health
personnel and shopkeepers. Applications were then sent to Ankara for final selection. While this
process on the whole seems to have worked well, some concerns were expressed by some
stakeholders, particularly related to over-centralization and the public's perception of them as
program gatekeepers.

Understanding of the selection process. Most beneficiaries and non beneficiaries identified
poverty as the main criterion for selection. Education needs were also cited as important. Most
key informants across Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study communities who
addressed this issue felt that people did not understand the selection criteria.

Fairness: Errors of exclusion and inclusion. Although a significant minority of household
informants believed that the targeting process had not been completely fair, in no community
was there a strong tendency for non-beneficiaries to believe it had been unfair. Several key
informants felt that targeting had not been fair.

Tension because of selection. The majority of respondents said that there were no tensions
between households which had been selected for the program and those which have not.

Selection appeals. Program documentation outlined an appeals process, which applies both to
non-beneficiaries who wish to appeal a targeting decision and to beneficiaries who have been
suspended or expelled from the program. Foundation officials and local authorities say that such
a process indeed exists and that they encourage unsuccessful applicants to re-apply for the
benefits. Some of the beneficiaries interviewed had been able to join the program because their
appeals were successful.

Why some do not apply. Among key informants, the most commonly cited reason for not
applying to the program is lack of knowledge. This is followed by lack of support or inability to
handle the application procedures, honor, transportation costs, and a belief that only a limited
number of applications will be accepted. Some people did not apply because they felt that they
would be financially ineligible. One man mentioned his disability as a reason: he was bedridden
and did not hear about the program. It was suggested by a small number of interviewees that
legal marriage was an obstacle to their applications.

Impact on Education

The CCT program's foremost objective was to increase school attendance rates, for the poor in
general and for secondary-school girls in particular, and to decrease dropout rates.         The
Quantitative Study estimated impacts of the CCT program using a regression discontinuity
design (RDD). RDD is an impact evaluation method that estimates the effect of participating in
the CCT program by comparing average outcomes between beneficiary and non beneficiary
households whose proxy means test score is near the threshold score used to determine program
eligibility. Key results of the RDD estimates are highlighted below.

        The CCT program raises secondary school enrollment for girls by 10.7 percent.
        The CCT program raises primary school attendance for girls by 1.3 percentage points.
        In secondary schools, education transfers from the CCT program raised girls' attendance
        rates by 5.4 percentage points.

The CCT program appears to have improved the quality of education, in terms of test scores, for
children enrolled in primary school. Given the relatively small size of the impact of the program



                                                 29

on primary school attendance, this effect was not likely to be caused by increased time in school.
Instead, the education transfers may have helped beneficiary households to make better use of
the schooling inputs, by increasing attention on schooling within the family and allowing
families to provide children with more time to study or to focus on their school work.

RDD estimates however suggested that the CCT program had no positive impact on primary
school enrollment rates. The absence of an effect of the program on primary school enrollment
is due in part to the already high enrollment rates at that level of education.

Further, estimates show no evidence that the CCT program affected the rate of progression from
primary school to secondary school. One likely explanation for this result is that, children often
had to commute to other communities to attend secondary school due to the low concentration of
secondary school relative to primary school, which increases education costs and time to attend
school. The demand-side intervention of CCT alone may not be sufficient to overcome this
supply-side constraint.

Factors Affecting Schooling Decisions and Impact of the CCT. Parents place a strong priority on
educating boys in all study areas, but are much more ambivalent about girls' education.
However, even where they are supportive of education, there are many different factors
influencing their schooling decisions.

The CCT helps many households overcome constraining factors. Across the study areas,
households were evenly divided between those who say that the CCT affects their education
decisions and those who say it does not. However, even in many cases where they say it does not,
it appears that it does but that it is not always considered appropriate to acknowledge that
children are sent for money.

For parents who value education, the CCT was not a causal factor but it helped make the expense
manageable. However, many other households said that they could not afford to send their child
without the CCT. The financial assistance also helped to better supply and dress the children,
making them more willing to go.

In some households, including a majority in Van, CCT money could not compete with the socio-
cultural factors constraining education particularly in the village, even at the primary school level.
In the household studies, eighteen categories of factors influencing schooling decisions were
identified in the Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study, and are outlined below. These
mainly involved economic, social, and cultural dimensions, There are important regional
differences.    The role of education in children's future loomed large in parents' schooling
decisions. For boys, education was seen as necessary for getting employment and better
employment. However, high unemployment rates made people cynical about the value of
education, particularly in rural areas where people work in the fields and see this as honorable.
Nevertheless, there are also those in the village who appreciated education.

The main role of education in girls' futures was seen as freedom from ignorance. Literacy
enables them to go out freely and provides them with the ability to interact with people outside




                                                 30

their home. Some also see education as opening a door to better living conditions and a better
husband.

Unfortunately, many parents only see the value of primary school for girls, particularly in the
Van study areas. In Diyarbakir and Van, it was generally seen as inappropriate for girls to work
once they become mature. Even in Samsun where girls do work, secondary school was not seen
as a priority.

Gender issues were the second highest-ranking factor in schooling decisions across the study
areas. There are several dimensions to this gender category. The first and most prevalent relates
to honor, reputation and sexuality--the perceived threats to girls and their families' honor posed
by boys at school and men on the street, if girls go to school after they have reached maturity.

The other main gender dimension is the expectation that girls will get married, and that their
primary role in life will be as wife and mother therefore, the value of education is questioned and
in some regions seen detrimental. There are also economic dimensions that weigh in favor of
marriage vs. education.

Transportation to school, and the closely related issue of the location or lack of secondary
schools in some areas, was another significant constraining factor in all study provinces,
particularly in the rural villages as well as in some urban areas. Schools were often far from
people's homes and there was no transportation, affordable transportation, or transportation
considered safe for girls. People would prefer secondary schools in their communities, not only
to alleviate transportation problems and costs, but also to enable parents to keep an eye on their
children and preserve their honor.

Children's performance at school was a surprisingly strong criteria influencing whether parents
continued sending them. Those who did well in school were seen as more likely to be able to
take advantage of their education. Parents whose children perform well tend to be enthusiastic
about education, whereas for failing students they do not force them to continue.

Children's preference for school --whether they like school or not-- was another weighty factor
in whether they continue.

Safety was another significant factor in parents' decisions, primarily in Diyarbakir. Some risks
include; men and boys, disciplinary problems, drugs, and violence. Parents feel it is the
responsibility of the state to provide safety; some teachers said they felt powerless to control
these problems and asked for state intervention.

The cost of school expenses, and the broader state of poverty, is the most frequently cited factor
of all. This is significant because this is the main factor the CCT responds. Burdensome expenses
included transportation and books, followed by school supplies, food, and pocket money. There
were regional variations in costs.




                                                  31

Poverty also results in boys being taken out of school to help earn money. Another factor related
to cost is the reliability of the grant--whether it can be counted on to regularly arrive and thus
cover school expenses.

Complementary Support for Education. The First Qualitative Study shows that, CCT support for
education largely overlapped with support from other sectors with respect to the specific target
population. The national mobilization in 2001/02 within the education sector to meet the goal of
increasing minimum education to eight years for all provided the sector with substantial
additional financing. Moreover, the military, the municipal sector, the private sector, civil
society organizations as well as individual citizens provided support to universal education and
much of this support was directed at poor communities and poor families. As a result, CCT
became one of the many different types of support for education in the period 2003-05.

The SYDVs themselves provide either in kind or cash support to poor students at the outset of
each school year. The Ministry of Education provided free schoolbooks for grades 1-8. Poor
students in boarding schools have all their expenses, including meals met, but cannot benefit
from CCT. A large number of students were provided with full scholarships from the Ministry of
Education or from organizations such as the Turkish Education Foundation. Again, those who
receive scholarships from state institutions cannot benefit from CCT. NGOs, such as Chose Your
Own Sibling match needy students with the wealthier one to provide direct assistance for
education. Nationwide organizations such as Mimetic (Soldier) Foundation and Deniz Feneri
(Lighthouse) also provided similar support.

Impact on Health and Nutrition

Vaccinations. The CCT program aims to increase immunization coverage of children from poor
families and to promote usage of health facilities. RDD estimates of the Quantitative Assessment
reveal that health transfers from the CCT program was associated with an increase of 13.6
percent in the full-immunization rate for preschool children. For children below 6 years of age,
the rate of full immunization against tuberculosis (BCG); diphtheria, whooping cough, and
tetanus (DPT/triple); polio; and measles jumped from 43.8 percent to 57.4 percent as a result of
participating in the health component of the CCT program.

The Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study found evidence of the (incorrect) belief that
CCT benefits are related to vaccination in two study provinces, Van and Diyarbakir. In a small
number of cases, it was evident that vaccination was regarded with suspicion, as a potentially
harmful practice. Another suspicion was that vaccination caused infertility. Intra-household
discrimination, i.e. vaccinating some children and not others, was also not in evidence.

The Socio-Cultural Context for the Health Component of CCT. Traditional approaches to illness
and healing coexist with `biomedical' responses. The most important factor underlying each
decision which a family takes about what kind of medical care to seek is severity.

Quality of Service and Opinions about Health Services. The majority of informants who spoke
about their experience with doctors, clinics and hospitals referred to very negative experiences.
Compounding these problems is the issue of shame and body-centered embarrassment. A point



                                                32

which comes up again and again in the interview data is that people do not go to hospitals for
check-ups: they go when they are seriously ill.

Health Controls: Beliefs, Attendance and CCT. Data from household interviews suggests that
few if any people know about the check-up (`health control') conditionality. Where people did
acknowledge or recognize that there was a condition for receiving CCT, they believed that this
concerned vaccination and not check-ups. One doctor also noted that, once applications to the
program had been made, people made a conscious effort to attend the clinic regularly, in the
hope that this behavior would be observed and taken into account, enhancing their prospects of
being accepted as program beneficiaries.

Nutrition. Although increasing food consumption was not an explicit goal of the CCT program,
the income from program transfers and increased interactions with health services may have
increased food consumption for beneficiary households. In the Quantitative Assessment, RDD
impact estimates for the full sample of beneficiaries found no average impact of the CCT
program on per capita calorie consumption.            However, for a subsample of beneficiary
households who received transfers from the CCT program on a more regular basis, the CCT
program increased their per capita calorie consumption by 22.6 percent relative to a comparison
group of non beneficiary-applicant households.

The First Qualitative Assessment found that beneficiary families' allocation of CCT money for
food improves nutritional standards and contributes to children's school performance. Mothers
generally believe that their ability to provide better food to children makes a difference in their
school performance.

The Second Quantitative Assessment showed that CCT money allowed beneficiaries to increase
amounts of food bought and purchase food items that previously they would not have been able
to afford. However, this change did not translate into better perceived household nutrition.

Impact on Pregnancy

Over the course of the program, concerns developed, particularly among some health providers
and Foundation staff, that the CCT program, and in particular the pregnancy component of the
program, might be creating incentives for families to have additional children. There was
concern that this program might be undermining some of the progress that the health sector has
made to strengthen family planning. The quantitative and qualitative studies both set out to
investigate this issue to determine whether or not it was creating these unintended consequences.

The RDD impact estimates show no evidence to support these claims. Quite the contrary, the
estimates show that receipt of education or health transfers from the program actually reduces the
probability of a woman of child-bearing age (16-49) becoming pregnant by about 2-3 percent. It
is somewhat surprising that the program appeared to discourage pregnancy, though this may
reflect in part the effect of the additional income from the program and visits to health clinics on
household fertility decisions.




                                                 33

The CCT Pregnancy Benefit: Fertility Decisions and Questions on Incentives. In all study areas
of the Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study, the vast majority of beneficiaries and non-
beneficiaries consistently said that no one would get pregnant to get money. Among those who
answered the question, 32 people said they did not know anyone who did this; while 3 said that
they did. About half of the key informants in Diyarbakir and Van thought that the pregnancy
benefit was causing more pregnancies and thought the birth rate had risen.

The Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study listed several reasons why it seems unlikely
that people would get pregnant in order to receive the CCT. These are outlined below:

There are very strong social pressures on women to get pregnant in all three provinces, from
their husbands and especially their families. Having a son continues the family lineage. Having
many children, especially many sons, is an indicator of power and makes a family less
vulnerable. Birth control is widely viewed as a sin. In this environment, getting a cash grant is
not needed as an incentive to get pregnant.

There are also economic reasons. Many children mean more labor and greater income earning
potential. This is especially true in rural areas where livelihoods are agriculturally based, though
families are smaller now that fewer people depend on the land. Despite these pressures, many
women discussed the reasons why not to have more children. They were expensive, expenses are
high, and women become exhausted.

In all three provinces, rumors spread that the CCT is much higher than it is, e.g. 120 YTL per
month, or 500-1000 YTL in some unspecified time period. This might explain why there was
some incentive affect under those circumstances. However, the majority of people said that `no
one would get pregnant for money,' and many found the question to be humorous, absurd, or
offensive. The unreliability of the grant in terms of amount, frequency, and duration also make
people less likely to depend on it, especially to make a lifetime decision. Although the CCT is
unlikely to be at the center of a fertility decision, it may be that with people caught in the middle
and deciding--the CCT could tip the balance. But this does not appear to be the main scenario.

The larger issue is the more diffuse perception that the state will take care of people's children,
from birth through adulthood--but this raises a challenge to the entire CCT concept, not the
pregnancy benefit, which most people do not know about. However, again we think that there is
stronger evidence that fertility decisions will largely be made on considerations other than a cash
grant.

CCT Externalities: Household Dynamics and Women's Status

CCT did not appear to have any impact on work patterns among adults. They generally followed
similar work patterns as they did before the implementation of the CCT program. The impact of
the CCT on child labor appears modest. Children continue to value work in the same way they
did before, and adults continued to rely on it not only as a coping strategy but as a way to
increase the marketability of their children.




                                                   34

Clothes were the most frequently bought item, followed by food, and school supplies. There is
an understanding that CCT money should not be used for food purchases, but primarily for
school expenses.

Control and decision-making of CCT money is not always left to the woman, although some
women do have an important role to play in decisions related to nutrition and health. By giving
women ownership of the CCT money, the program has opened opportunities for women to
participate in the public sphere and make gender-specific roles less restrictive. Benefits from
this change reported by women include independence, freedom, and confidence. In general,
there were few reported changes in spousal relations.

The First Qualitative Study suggests that CCT had a positive impact on the increase of women's
participation in society. With few exceptions women during interviews recount with pride their
participation in the application process and their use of funds disbursed to them, especially to
feed the household and educate their children. CCT helps women formally register their marriage
and obtain birth certificates for their children. CCT has helped change people's mind-set about
female education. Parents as well as female students benefiting from the program recognized
that without CCT there would have been greater reluctance to send girls to school beyond the
first eight years level of basic education.

Overall Views of Stakeholders

In the First Qualitative Assessment, stakeholders held mixed but generally positive views
concerning CCT and suggest specific improvements. Beneficiary households argued in favor of
nutrition and education impacts. Fathers generally were content with the enhanced integration of
their wives into the broader society and supportive of the education of their daughters. Girls were
particularly happy about the support, especially if they are over 10 years of age. Educators invite
greater inclusion and support CCT despite the additional burden it imposes upon them.

In the Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study, beneficiaries and key informants were
mostly enthusiastic about the benefits of the CCT program, emphasizing that the transfers help
them to feed their families and send their children to school.

Some adverse program impacts were also raised, particularly in the First Qualitative Assessment.
Official stakeholders and social commentators h expressed concern that the CCT: (i)
significantly increased the burden on health and education institutions; (ii) increased antagonism
against local government institutions when issues arise in CCT implementation; (iii) spread
expectations throughout the country that the poor could rely on the state, one way or the other.
However, such expectations were not reflected among actual beneficiaries, and where it was, was
expressed as appreciation that the state is there to give them a little bit of help.

With respect to the issue of whether the program should continue, the First Qualitative
Assessment found that there was a general belief that the program is useful and should continue,
with improvements in implementation arrangements, to ensure that beneficial outcomes are
achieved. Beneficiary families stated that they could not afford to send their girls to schools
outside their communities unless CCT support continues; this is especially so for high school. A



                                                  35

large number of "destitute" families had no access to regular financial support so that CCT is
often a unique and vital factor in their lives. In these cases, CCT support is used mostly for food
and basic needs.

Most officials and Foundation staff believed that the program contributed to increased schooling
and preventive health care and added that it should not have been initiated if it were to
discontinue within a few years, as this would mean local protests against the Foundations.

Many stakeholders, including beneficiary and non beneficiary applicants, believe the widespread
lack of employment opportunities in the least developed regions makes it imperative to continue
to have CCT or a CTT-like mechanism to support the poorest.

The overall conclusion of the Second Qualitative and Anthropological Study was that the CCT
program is an important, valued program that is having an impact, and should be continued.
However, the program faces two major sets of challenges: the first is operational--the need for
much stronger communications across all levels of program operations and primarily between
program staff and beneficiaries, so that beneficiaries understand the basic logic of the program--
their obligations and entitlements. The second challenge is social and cultural, and these factors
are harder to respond to. This requires at a minimum intersectoral cooperation and
complementary approaches. With respect to both challenges, patience is also required--an
understanding that social change takes time--but persistence and dedication to resolving
problems from central to local levels will be needed for the program to succeed.

Summary of PAR Consulting (2006) "Evaluation of Local Initiatives Sub-Projects: Final
Report," October 31. (This is an evaluation of the small loans for dairy-stock, stock-breeding,
sheep-farming, and bee-keeping).

The report is drawn from a survey of 4,416 beneficiaries of small loan-financed agricultural
income generating activities, in 64 provinces of Turkey, and also from interviews and focus
group discussions. The report does not investigate whether the well-being of beneficiaries
improves as a result of the loans, for example, in terms of household nutrition, ability to pay for
clinic visits and medicines, and secondary school attendance of the household's teenagers.
Moreover, the report does not compute the profitability of the small loan-supported revenue
generating activities, or repayment rates of beneficiaries. Therefore it is difficult to draw strong
conclusions regarding the success or failure of the micro-credits. Nevertheless, the PAR report
includes much valuable information.

Targeting to poor households. The small loans were not targeted using the relatively tight
scoring formula applied in distributing CCT, even though the project unit required use of the
formula but instead using the SYDVs' own criteria. PAR reports that "...there is not any
description for poverty and poor people, which can by used by foundations as a criterion" (p
105). In the PAR survey, almost half of the beneficiary households report income under YTL
200 per month and over two-thirds report income below the minimum wage of YTL 380 per
month -this suggests adequate targeting to the poor. But self reported data on income are not
entirely reliable, so some uncertainty remains. Furthermore, the Project imposed conditions on



                                                 36

beneficiaries, such as having a barn to keep animals and these conditions must have prevented
some poor households from participating in the small loans sub-component.

Benefits. The report does not set criteria for evaluating the success of the income-generating
activities.  It does report that 64% of households said that the activities fulfilled their
expectations.    Almost all indicated they would continue their income-generating activity.
However 21 percent of beneficiaries report that they earned no income and further 43 percent
reported that they earned very little. (It is unclear if this is because the households are still at an
early stage of implementation of their activity.) Over three-quarters of beneficiaries reported that
they didn't encounter problems, and when they did, the main problem was inadequate fodder.

Procurement. There are no reports of corruption, but there are reports of procurement of
livestock at above local market prices. For example, beneficiaries in Mersin say that they were
given sheep that the Project values at YTL 192, while the local price was YTL 130, and that
some of the sheep they received were sick or barren.

Role of headmen. There are also reports of political favoritism by the headmen (mukhtars).
About 85 percent of beneficiaries say that they were informed about the project by headmen.
PAR reports that "...in locations where there is an intense political structures, many families
could not participate in the projects since their political ideas were different than (the) political
ideas of the headman" (p 19). The SURKAL (2006) study reports that headmen play the
dominant role in selecting beneficiaries and types of activities.

The beneficiaries often request larger herds: it's unclear whether this is because more is better or
because herding becomes profitable at a larger scale. Another theme is that poor beneficiaries
fail because they cannot buy inputs such as fodder. Beneficiaries asked for the loans to be made
in cash rather than kind.

Lack of technical skills. One of the main themes of the Report is that beneficiaries frequently
lack the technical and entrepreneurial skills to produce and market milk, wool, and honey. The
Report recommends increasing the number of follow-up visits to beneficiaries, training of
agricultural staff, hiring of external agriculturalists, and establishment of links with district
offices of the Agriculture Ministry.

Summary of the SURKAL (2006) report: "Evaluation of Income Generating Sub-Projects
und Local Initiatives Component of Social Risk Mitigation Project: Crop farming and
agricultural tools and machines: Final Report," August.

For this study, SURKAL surveyed 257 income-generating activities, 144 district SYDVs, 257
consultants, and 3,459 beneficiaries.

There is no information on incomes of beneficiaries that would aid in assessing whether the
activities were targeted to the poor. The report does mention that 35 percent of beneficiaries
lived in concrete houses, which suggests higher income than residence in a mud or adobe house.
The village headmen (Muhtars) were the most important source of information about the



                                                  37

availability of small loans. The report concludes that the muhtars received information from
their SYDV or from the district governor and then assumed an important role in selection of the
beneficiaries and the type of activity to be finance. However the SYDVs did verify, and around
60 percent of cases, whether a beneficiary qualified for the small loans.

The evidence on outcomes is rather mixed. About 50 percent of beneficiaries reported that their
activity had not yet reached maturity; a further 25 percent said that their household income had
increased or that the activity had improved household nutrition, and 21 percent said that there
was no impact at all. There is no information about whether production was profitable for those
beneficiaries that did receive income or nutrition. For greenhouse garden activities, 39 percent
of beneficiaries reported that their income increased, 24 percent that their activity had not yet
matured to full production, and 24 percent reported no impact on their income at all. For fruit
culture activities, over 90 percent reported that their activity had not reached maturity and 98
percent reported that they received no income from the activity.

Almost 30 percent of beneficiaries said that they did not receive any technical support. This also
emerged from focus group meetings.

Summary of the ESDA (2006) report: "Evaluation of LI Sub-Projects: Revised Final
Report," September. (This is a report on the small loan supported urban income-generating
activities, employability training, and on the social services sub-projects.)

In this report, the consulting company, ESDA, evaluates the non-agricultural activities of the
Local Initiatives component. For this report, ESDA surveyed 312 income-generating activities,
35 employability training sub-projects, and 106 social service sub-projects. The survey extends
over a relatively large sample of interviews with beneficiaries and with local offices of the
SYDVs in geographically dispersed areas.         Nevertheless, the results of the evaluation are
ambiguous because it does not pose key questions. ESDA does not attempt to measure the
revenues and costs of small enterprises started by beneficiaries of the income-generating
activities, so it difficult to draw conclusions about their profitability, rate of return, and hence,
economic sustainability. There is no tracing of graduates of the employability training to
determine whether they are still employed 6 months or a year after graduation. And there little
on availability of operating budgets to sustain functioning of the social service sub-projects. But
the report does present much useful information, and this suggests mixed results for the Income-
generating activities and employability training.

Income-generating activities. There is no clear explanation of the selection of beneficiaries.
ESDA does report that almost 70 percent of beneficiaries said that they earned income of less
than YTL 500 per month, identifying them as poor.              Self-reported income is, of course,
somewhat unreliable. The ESDA report does not present data on housing or consumer durables,
which would help assess the income of households.

About 42 percent of beneficiaries report that their activities yielded regular income. But about
half report that they did not earn any net monthly income from their activity, after paying
expenses. About 42 percent said they did not have money (in effect, operating capita) to



                                                 38

purchase the inputs necessary to continue operation. Importantly, ESDA reports that 26 percent
of street vendors and 54 percent of the sewing-embroidery activities were closed; but only 14
percent of small service sector activities, 15 percent of small commercial activities, and 17
percent of home manufacturing activities are closed. The report finds that about a third of the
income-generating activities never started or were not continued.             Using an undefined
methodology, ESDA estimates that 34 percent of the income-generating activities are
"economically sustainable, although the methodology seems unreliable, 36 percent are "fragile,"
and 31 percent are "not sustainable."

Employability training. The report does not explain whether or how beneficiaries were targeted.
It seems that the Project selected employability sub-projects, in effect, by evaluating requests for
training from localities. The subcomponent was highly successful in reaching women: 40
percent of the training was in occupations largely occupied by women, such as carpet weaving,
machine knitting, and sewing and embroidery; an impressive 54 percent of beneficiaries of all
training sub-projects surveyed were women.

Public training centers carried out most training supported by this sub-component. The standard
in training projects is to contract out training to the private sector, rather than to use public
providers. Moreover, there was little mention of any collaboration with Chambers of Commerce
and Industry to identify types of training and to place graduates. Surprisingly, there is little
mention of the literacy training that plays an important role in the description of the sub-
component in the Project Appraisal Document.

It is not clear how to evaluate the component without clear criteria for success ­a point raised in
the ESDA report (p 86). The drop-out rate was about 12 percent. About 40 percent of
graduating students were then placed in jobs or in self-employment, but it's not clear whether
that employment lasts.

Social service sub-projects. The method used to select sub-projects is not clear: the report says
that most were selected because of a study showing "demand" or because a request from a local
SYDV or some other administration. Of the 106 social service sub-projects surveyed, 32 were
implemented by SHCEK, 19 by the local SYDVs, and 22 by NGOs.

Almost 96 percent of beneficiaries say that their sub-project is successful. But aside from this,
there are no criteria for assessing success of the sub-projects, for example, in preventing loss of
health or income among vulnerable beneficiaries, or in piloting new methods which are later
adopted by others. This is regrettable, since piloting of new concepts, like the shelter for abused
women in Istanbul, are probably influencing social service delivery in Turkey.

Summary of the GENAR (2006) "Evaluation of the Local Initiative Sub-Project: The Final
Report: Temporary Employment Sub-Projects (Infrastructure, Sewerage System, Water
Supply, etc.), Social Infrastructure, and My Beautiful School." October 31.

The methodology is a reasonably broad survey of beneficiaries, of the staff of the SYDV, and of
other key informants. The study concludes that, although there were clear standards for targeting



                                                39

beneficiaries at the center, the local SYDVs did not apply any systematic standard to selection of
investments in civil works and in hiring laborers. While most beneficiaries were probably poor,
the data on housing and assets points to significant leakages to middle-income groups. There is
repeated mention of the role of muhtars in disseminating or withholding information, and in
hiring. The investments were valued by the local populations and officials, but there was little
monitoring of measurable benefits, such as the increase in consumption of laborers. A further
theme was the weak capacities of the local SYDVs and the need for training in every stage of
project activities and management.

Temporary employment activities. The temporary employment sub-component carried out labor
intensive public works, such as tree-planting, to provide short-term employment and wage
income in poor areas. The evaluation study refers repeatedly to the dominant role of muhtars.
Beneficiaries reported receiving most information on the sub-projects from headmen. Interviews
showed little beneficiary participation in choice of sub-projects.          Almost 40 percent of
beneficiaries surveyed didn't know who chose the sub-project and 27 percent thought it was the
district administrator.

A further issue is that the SYDVs (the local social solidarity foundations) did not apply the CCT
scoring formula when selecting beneficiaries for employment at temporary employment sub-
projects. According to the report, "ït is seen that every foundation make their own preferences
with their own methods or with daily decisions" (p. 68). The beneficiaries were poor, judging
from the survey: almost three-quarters of the reported monthly income of less than NTL 300.
But it's difficult to judge the reliability of self-reported data from beneficiaries who must report
low income to obtain this temporary employment. The GENAR survey presents some evidence
of leakages: it finds that almost 25 percent of beneficiaries' houses were made of mud-brick, a
sign of severe poverty, but 23 percent were made of reinforced concrete and 22 percent of wood.
More importantly, the GENAR survey found that 91 percent of beneficiaries owned at TV set
and 85 percent owned a refrigerator, and that 6o percent owned a mobile phone. Very poor
people, or course, do not own expensive consumer appliances.

The outcome of this sub-component was probably positive, but this is difficult to evaluate
without clear criteria for success and without better information. This sub-component was
successful in that it paid wages. About 72 percent of opinion leaders interviewed affirmed the
success of their sub-projects and 85 percent of beneficiaries thought the sub-projects had a
positive impact on economic conditions in their region. Turning to sustainability of benefits,
most beneficiaries respond that they would report any damage to sub-projects, such as felling of
trees planted. But there is no suggestion that beneficiaries would maintain the sub-projects;
apparently they expect local government to maintain everything.

Social infrastructure. These were often investments in community water supply and sewerage,
floods and erosion control, and in environmental clean-up. Again, most beneficiaries were
probably poor: almost 60 percent reported income of less than NTL 300 per month.
Beneficiaries rarely participated in selecting the infrastructure financed by this sub-component.
Beneficiaries said that, in 62 percent of cases, sub projects were selected by headmen (muhtars),
and in a further 22 percent of the cases, by district administrators. However, about two-thirds of




                                                   40

beneficiaries reported that they volunteered on the operation of the social infrastructure ­and
unusually high rate.

About 90 percent of beneficiaries said that they had benefited from the social infrastructure,
mostly in terms of a cleaner environment, an adequate supply of water, and better health. A
majority agreed that the investments had improved social solidarity. However 91 percent said
that the investment had not improved local economic conditions. The long-run influence of this
sub-component on poverty remains unclear.

My Beautiful Schools. The sub-component rehabilitated 1,300 schools in the regions with the
largest number of CCT beneficiaries. There is however no data on whether the sub-component
successfully targeted schools that served poor localities. At the center, there were standards for
selection of schools for rehabilitation, but GENAR reports that these do not seem to have been
followed by the local SYDVs. In practice, nearly all the schools that applied received money for
rehabilitation.  The GENAR evaluation reports that the sub-component was successful in
rehabilitating schools and in convincing parents to participate in maintaining the schools. The
report finds an increased bond between the community, and especially parents and student, and
the school. Over all, the component was much appreciated by beneficiaries.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Government of Turkey's evaluation report is a 192 page hard bound book and was prepared
by the SRMP Project Unit. The full report is available in PDF format in the Project files. The
conclusions are summarized in the introductory sections by Prime Minister Erdogan, State
Minister Atalay, and General Director of Social Assistance and Solidarity Bilici.

From the Prime Minister's Speech Delivered in 3rd International CCT Conference, Istanbul
(26 June 2006)

We have launched significant initiatives in eradicating the obstacles before the participation of
women in social, political and economic life and solve the educational and economic problems
behind the discrimination exposed by women. We have achieved important steps in this direction
and we hope we shall continue to do so.

One of the most important initiatives is CCT program which was rolled out all over the country
in 2003. As you well know, we directly transfer the CCT grants to the accounts of mothers. Thus,
mothers spend this money, which is under their responsibility, for the expenses concerning care,
health and education of their children, which is an important step for them in increasing their
status at home and in the society.

As of today, under this program, we provided 2.6 million children with the equal opportunities in
the fields of education and health services, through our mothers.

Actually, with CCT, we impose discrimination practice. But a positive discrimination practice.
We offer a higher amount of grant to our girls on the condition that they regularly attend school.
We have already started to obtain the outcome of this practice. At the moment, girls constitute
50% of the CCT beneficiaries in the grade 1. Our objective is to increase the school enrollment
and attendance rate in other grades as well.

Providing our children with equal opportunities enjoyed by the children of highly developed
countries is an issue of responsibility and perception. With this consciousness, we believe that
our children representing our future will shape the future with the strength they will take from
past and Turkey will assume important roles to establish a world in peace with our children.
--Mr. Recep Tayyip ERDOGAN BASBAKAN, Prime Minster


Mr. Besir ATALAY Devlet Bakani, State Minister.

Our government, considering the state as means of service to the public, has been implementing
important reforms in every field and developing policies to raise the welfare and happiness of all
citizens since it took office.

Economical growth in 2004 was realized as 9.9 % due to the strong steps we took and success of
policies we implemented; and Turkey became the second fastest growing country after China.



                                                 45

GNP per capita increased from US dollar 21 60 to more than US dollar 5000 and Turkish
economy has enjoyed negative inflation for the first time ever in her history. Inflation rate
decreased to single-digit and at the end of December 2004, lowest inflation rate of the last 31
years has been caught.

The inflation in 2006 was realized as 65 % according to the consumer price index. Together with
the decrease in inflation, negative effects upon our poor citizens have been decreased by price
decline in widely-used items such as energy.

With the effects of improvements which were provided in macro economic level, decrease in the
interest rate of internal and external borrowings has shown its positive effects upon income
distribution. Therefore, sense of confidence in the society has strengthened and the poor citizens
have become more optimistic about their future.

Agriculture which has an important place in Turkey's economy has been enlivened by means of
direct income support to the farmers and villagers.

Social Solidarity Fund is the most important social assistance institution in Turkey. In this
context, the structure of the Fund, performing its functions without being a public legal entity
until 2003, was strengthened.      To this end, General Directorate of Social Assistance and
Solidarity was established in 2004. Therefore, a much more powerful institutional structure has
been developed, so that our citizens could benefit from social assistances much more effectively.

As an indicator of the government's having high opinion of combating poverty, budgetary cuts
from the Fund which had been transferred to the general budget from the fund because of its
fiscal deficit since 1986, have been abolished. For the first time since the establishment of the
Fund, some amount of the resources has been allocated from the general budget.

Periodical share, which was allocated to 931 Social Solidarity Foundations in provinces and sub-
provinces, has been increased in order to meet the daily urgent needs of citizens. Thus,
constraints of various natures that stem from resource short fall have been forestalled.

In addition to the programs which were put into practice, Social Risk Mitigation Project (SRMP)
has been initiated in order to decrease poverty. By means of this project, a new concept in
combating poverty has been implemented. With this project, studies to increase the human
resources and the technical capacity of General Directorate of Social Assistance and Solidarity,
Social Solidarity Foundations, General Directorate of Social Services and Child Protection
Organization and Turkish Statistical Institution have been conducted in order to increase the
efficiency of these institutions which officiate in the field of fight against poverty.

A computer network has been established between 931 Social Solidarity Foundations and
General Directorate. Moreover, process of using common software has been completed and
Management Information System has been started. By this way, citizens who take assistance
have been registered and an important step has been taken for the standardization of the
implementation in the Foundations.




                                                  46

Conditional Cash Transfer Program and Local Initiatives Program, which are the basic
components of the SRMP, are being implemented at the web-based software. As a result of this,
objective methods have been used in selecting the citizens who are eligible to benefit from the
social assistances. This system makes it possible to form a common database between General
Directorate and Foundations and to update the data of the citizens that have already been
registered by the Foundations.

The citizens, who are not registered in the database despite being needy, have been reached by
the means of the state. Thanks to this new system, a database, which consists of demographic
information of 2 million people with low income, has been formed up to that time and the poor
citizens have been made to benefit from various social assistances following their registration to
the database.

In this scope, programs have been completed about the professional development of the
personnel who work in the Foundations. In-service training of 2.500 personnel, who are in one-
to-one communication with the target population, has been completed.

The hardware and software needs of General Directorate of Social Services and Child Protection
Organization and related institutions have been met. In service training of 3923 personnel has
been completed. Moreover, by means of 184 social service projects, quantity and quality of the
institutions such as child care centres, affection houses, orphanages, community centres, women
guest houses, family-consultation centres, asylum for the aged have been strengthened.

In the scope of Conditional Cash Transfer Program, health support is provided monthly to the
families who can not have their children of 0-6 age group checked regularly at medical clinics.
To this end, a total of 197,167,000 M L health support has been allocated for 944,103 children.

Education support is provided monthly to economically vulnerable families, who cannot send
their children to school. For this purpose, 534,502,000 YTL education support has been allocated
for 1,659.71 3 children.

Only mothers can apply for Conditional Cash Transfer Program. Payments are transferred
directly to the accounts of mothers and higher amount of money is paid for girls comparing to
the amount paid for boys. These factors have reinforced the impacts of the program. Besides
registering the marriages and children, this program affects positively the participation of the
women to the social life and increases the school attendance rate of girls. This indicates that the
program aims at not only increasing the access of the poor citizens to the education and health
services, but also making positive change in behaviour of the citizens, reinforcing the women's
status and removing the socio-cultural obstacles which prevent girls from going to school.

Increasing the employment is one of the most effective means in income distribution and
combating poverty. Towards this end, project supports have been provided for developing the
labour-intensive sectors. Our policy of assistance places emphasis on permanent project support
which tends to gain sustainable income and could make the citizens be active, instead of making
them be passive by providing ad-hoc assistance.




                                                 47

In accordance with this policy, significant improvements have been made in the project
implementations and projects, which foresee repayment basis and provide sustainable income,
have been supported during our government. Although 2% of the fund resources have been
allocated to the project supports before our government, the share allocated to the project support
was reached to 20 % in 2006. It is one of our targets to raise this share up to 50 % in the
following years.

In the scope of the Local Initiatives Project supports, 127 million YTL for 5,452 Income-
generating Subprojects; 6,4 million YTL for 735 Temporary Employment Projects; 9,7 million
YTL for 378 Employability Training Projects; 44,6 million YTLfor2,480 Social Service Projects
and 3,9 million YTL for 12 Community Development Projects have been allocated, thus being
191.5 million for a total 8886 projects.

526,338 people in total including 45,549 people from Income-generating Su b-projects; 5,125
people from Temporary Employment Projects; 12,453 people from Employability Training
Projects; 460,707 people from Social Service Projects and 2,504 people from Community
Development Projects have benefited from Local Initiatives Project supports.

These project supports are provided directly to the citizens throughout the country. Thanks to
these projects, project implementation knowledge and experience of the personnel in General
Directorate and Foundations, poor citizens and non-governmental organizations, which apply for
project, have been strengthened. Therefore, the capacity in the fields of .projects, preparation
implementation- monitoring and evaluation has improved.

Impact evaluation studies have been conducted in order to survey the impacts of activities
implemented in the scope of Social Risk Mitigation Project. Thus the extent to which
Conditional Cash Transfers and Local initiatives project supports achieved their objectives was
founds; and these studies have been a guide for our works to increase the efficiency of social
assistances and social policies to be developed.

2003 and subsequent years were mobilization years for solving the social problems emerged due
to poverty and economic crisis. This mobilization will be maintained with the same spirit, with
more systematic and more participatory understanding in 2007 and in the following years.

Social Risk Mitigation Project has achieved its goals determined at the beginning, and has
contributed to Turkey's economic and social development in revising our social assistance
policies and in implementing effective programs in order to combat poverty.

I avail myself of this opportunity to express my best regards to the presidency of Social
Solidarity Foundations, relevant Ministries and all institutions, citizens and non-governmental
organizations which work in the field of social assistances and I also would like to emphasize
that we will continue to work ever increasingly and enthusiastically for a brighter, well-off and
happier Turkey.

Mr. Mevlut BILICI, General Director of Social Assistance and Solidarity.

Our state is a social state of law as it was declared in the Constitution. This makes it necessary to
overcome the imbalance in income distribution, to develop the social policies for supporting the
poor segments of society, to reinforce the social solidarity and to protect the social peace.

Social Assistance and Solidarity Fund was founded in 1986 with the Act # 3294 and is primary
institution implementing the social assistance programs in our country. Therefore, the Fund and
General Directorate of Social Assistance and Solidarity (SYDGM), which carries out the
activities of the Fund, are in charge with providing social assistance to the needy citizens,
contributing to the improvement of income distribution by taking measures for furtherance of
social justice and promoting social assistance and solidarity.

Social Assistance and Solidarity Foundations were established in each province and sub-
province in Turkey. Through these Foundations, SYDGM fulfills the basic needs of the citizens
who are in socio-economical deprivation, contributes to education and rehabilitation expenses of
the disabled and support projects to increase and sustain the income of the citizens.

The latest economic crisis occurred in 2001 worsened the poverty, increased unemployment and
imbalances in income distribution. As a result, poverty became one of the most significant
problems of Turkey. Under this framework, a loan agreement was signed between the
Government of Republic of Turkey and the World Bank on September 14, 2001, and Social Risk
Mitigation Project (SRMP) was initiated on the basis of this agreement.

The project basically aimed at decreasing the effects of the social crisis caused by the economic
crisis and strengthening the capacity of households' to cope with similar crisis in future.

Social Risk Mitigation Project has been implemented under four basic components: Rapid
Response, Institutional Development, Conditional Cash Transfers and Local Initiatives.

Within the framework of Institutional Development, activities to strengthen the capacity of
human resources and technical hardware of the Foundations have been completed, and a
computer network has been established between 931 Social Solidarity Foundations and the
General Directorate. Also, works to reinforce the institutional capacity of Turkish Statistical
Institute and General Directorate of Social Services and Child Protection Organization have been
supported.

The other important components of the project are Conditional Cash Transfers and Local
Initiatives.

In the scope of Conditional Cash Transfers Program, health or education supports are provided
monthly to the poor families on the condition that they take their children of 0-6 age group to
regular health check at medical clinics, or on the condition that they send their children to school
regularly.

Local initiatives Program aims at promoting the efforts in poor segments of society to increase
the opportunity of having regular income and employment. Therefore, with this program, our
citizens now have the opportunity to become individuals making a living on their own efforts.

Moreover, objective methods have begun to be used in selecting the citizens who would benefit
from Conditional Cash Transfers and Local initiatives Programs.

SRMP has provided supports for many beneficiaries with its components since 2001, and it has
helped to take steps in the field of reinforcing the social assistance system, selecting the target
group with objective criteria, strengthening the human development by focusing on education,
health and employment.

In this respect, I would like to express my best regards to my colleagues, Social Assistance and
Solidarity Foundations, public institutions and organizations, which made efforts to complete
SRMP successfully, non-governmental organizations, which works in the field of social
assistances, and universities.
