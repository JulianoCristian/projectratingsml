"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Zhejiang Urban\n            Environment Project (ZUEP) for China were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was modest, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the 'Tianziling method of landfill\n            operations', developed by Hangzhou Solid Waste Company,\n            Limited (HSWC), controls surface water runoff entry and\n            ground water entering the landfill by introducing a High\n            Density Polyethylene (HDPE) membrane cover instead of the\n            generally used soil cover. This method reduces leach-ate\n            generation and cost of land-filling, prevents odor, and\n            increases the life of the landfill. Inclusion of industrial\n            pollution action plan (IPCAP) in ZUEP addressed pollution\n            control in a comprehensive manner, and included: a licensing\n            and permit system for industry pollution control; database\n            of pollution types and sources; industrial pollution\n            monitoring program; water conservation; and catchment\n            pollution control plan. The project experience in China has\n            found that local communities, especially the poor, often\n            have little appreciation for what tourists want or need.\n            Services and souvenirs are generally of low quality and\n            provide only small incomes. Related training provided by\n            government entities/Associations often lags the most current\n            approaches. In order to generate sustainable economic\n            opportunities based on cultural heritage conservation and\n            tourism, project planning and design should include specific\n            attention to useful training, sound planning and realistic\n            investments. Sustainable historic city revitalization\n            requires a holistic approach, and the Bank has the unique\n            ability to assemble multi-disciplinary task teams to design\n            and supervise projects using this approach. The Bank is also\n            distinct from most conservation and tourism organizations in\n            its ability to set projects within a development and poverty\n            reduction context."}, "docdt": "2011-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
