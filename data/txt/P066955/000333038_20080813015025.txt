Preface 
I. The objective of Resettlement Action Plan 
1
This Resettlement Action Plan is formulated on the basis of the laws, regulations and 
policies of the People’s Republic of China, and Local Government as well as the 
Guidelines of the World Bank (Operational Directive for Involuntary Resettlement OP 
4.12). The purpose of this document is to set out an Action plan for the Resettlement and 
Rehabilitation of the Displaced persons (DPs) to ensure that they will benefit from the 
project and their standards of living will be improved or at least be restored after the 
project impact. 
II. Definition of Relative Terms 
DPs 
2
Criteria for Eligibility. Displaced persons may be classified in one of the following 
three groups: 
a
those who have formal legal rights to land (including customary and traditional 
rights recognized under the laws of the country);  
b
those who do not have formal legal rights to land at the time the census begins 
but have a claim to such land or assets—provided that such claims are 
recognized under the laws of the country or become recognized through a 
process identified in the resettlement plan; and 
c
Those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are 
occupying. 
3
Persons covered under 2(a) and 2(b) are provided compensation for the land they lose 
and other assistance. Persons covered under 2(c) are provided resettlement assistance 
in lieu of compensation for land they occupy and other assistance, as necessary, to 
achieve objectives set out in this policy, if they occupy the project area prior to a cut-
off date established by the borrower and acceptable to the World Bank
1
.
Those who 
encroach on this area after cut-off date are not entitled to the compensation or any 
other resettlement assistance. All persons included in 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c) are provided 
compensation for loss of assets other than land.
 
Compensation and Resettlement Measures 
4
In order to address the impacts caused by compulsive land acquisition resulting in (i) 
relocating or loss of shelter; (ii) lost of assets or access to assets; (iii) loss of income 
source or means of livelihood, whether or not the affected persons must move to 
another location, an RAP or Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) should be 
prepared that covers the following:  
a
The resettlement plan or resettlement policy framework includes measures to 
ensure DPs are  
i
Informed about their options and rights pertaining to resettlement; 
ii
Consulted on, offered choices among, and provided with technically and 
economically feasible resettlement alternatives; and  
1
Normally, the cut-off date is the date the census begins. The cut-off date could also be the date the 
project area was delineated, prior to the census, provided that there has been an effective public 
dissemination of information on the area delineated and systematic and continuous dissemination 
subsequent to the delineation to prevent further population influx. 
Page  3
II 
iii
Provided prompt and effective compensation at replacement cost
2
for losses 
of assets attributable directly to the project.  
b
if the impacts include physical relocation, the resettlement or resettlement policy 
framework should include measure to ensure that the displaced persons are 
i
provided assistance (such as moving allowance) during the relocation;  
ii
provided with residential house, or house sites, as required, agricultural 
sites for which a combination of productive potential, locational 
advantages, and other factors is at least equivalent to the advantages of the 
old site. 
c
Where necessary to achieve the objectives of the policy, the resettlement plan or 
resettlement policy framework also include measures to ensure that displaced 
persons are 
i
offered support after displacement, for a transition period, based on a 
reasonable estimate of the time likely to be needed to restore their 
livelihood and standards of living;  
ii
Provided with development assistance in addition to compensation 
measures described in paragraph 4(a) (iii), such as land preparation, 
credit facilities, training, or job opportunities.   
5
cut-off date: the date in this project refers to the date that bulletin of land acquisition 
and house demolition is issued. DPs are not allowed to build new house, expand the building, 
rebuild, change the usage of house and land, lease land, or rent/bargain the house. Besides, 
persons moving into project areas after this date are not entitled to be compensated. 
 
2
Replacement Cost
 means the method of valuing assets to replace the loss at market value plus any 
transaction costs. When this method is adopted, the depreciation of construction and property is left out 
of account.

indirect economic benefits. 
The contents of Ningbo Jiangnan Waste Water Treatment plant and supported 
pipeline network project include: 
1
Jiangnan Waste Water Treatment plant subproject 
Jiangnan Waste Water Treatment plant project belongs to WB financed project 
and will be implemented by municipal level. The short term disposal scale is 160 
thousand m
3
/d, and 400 m
3
/d in the long run (considering the long term development 
of some buildings, the trunk pipeline to the plant and tail water drainage project is 
designed base on 400 m
3
/d). Service areas include some part of Sanjiang area and 
Beilun area. Of which, Sanjiang area consists of High-tech Zone, some part of eastern 
new city, Yinzhou central urban area (the area on the east of Tongsan national 
highway), East Qianlake area (include Dongwu town, Wuxiang township, and Hengxi 
township); Beilun area include Jiangnan area and Xiaogang area on the west of the 
hill body. The total service area is 230k m
2
.
Page  9

The Waste Water Treatment plant planned location is 300m south of Jiangnan 
highway and on the west of Yubei city-circled Highway (Xinzhou crossroads). The long 
term planned total land acquisition of this project is 27.2hm
2
401.1mu
and the land 
used in the near future is14.8hm
2
.
Land acquisition in this project would be conducted 
according to the long term land use area. 
2
Supported pipeline network subproject 
Supported pipeline network consists of 3 components: trunk pipe (municipal city 
implementation), Primary and secondary pipeline (district level implementation) and 
sewage midway pump station. Pipeline network would use domestic supported capital. 
Supported drainage pipe network include: 
¾
As for trunk pipeline of Jiangan highway, south Waihuan, external city-circled 
highway and east waihuan, the planned newly-built trunk sewage pipeline is 
19.4km
¾
As for Primary and secondary pipelines of West Beilun district, high-tech 
district, east new city, Yinzhou district (the area on the east of Tongsan 
National highway), East Qian Lake, the total length of short term construction 
is 170km. 
¾
To match the construction and alternation of the pipeline network, 9 midway 
pump stations should build outside the plant.

According to the fund source and implementing plans, the WWTP is to be 
financed by the WB, while the supported pipelines including truck pipelines, primary 
and secondary pipelines and pump stations will be constructed with domestic 
counterpart funds, which are linkage projects. Ningbo Municipal Engineering Prophase 
Office perpared the RAP for the WWTP and truck sewage pipelines. Meanwhile,since 
the resettlement impacts induced by the primary and secondary pipelines and pump 
stations Ningbo cannot be identified in this stage, Municipal Engineering Prophase 
Office designed a Resettlement Policy Framework for the potencial resettlement 
impacts . In the implementation of supported pipeline network, if land acquisition and 
resettlement are involved, the resettlement policy framework would be triggered. The 
resettlement policy framework is shown in 
annex 1.

Measures Taken to Decrease Affects 
Project planning period 
In the period of project planning and designing, in order to decrease the 
impacts to local socio-economic induced by the project; some effective measures 
are taken by designing institution and project owner: 
A. In the period of project planning, while choosing and comparing 
optimization options, they tried best to consider the impacts on local socio-
economic, and took it as key factor for comparing optimization options; 
B. Optimize designing to acquire wasteland and state owned land as possible to 
decreases plowland acquisition. 
According to 
Ningbo development overall planning
 (2004-2020) and 
Ningbo 
central city drainage special planning
 as well as opinions of Beilun district planning 
department and environmental evolution report, the site selection area is in the central 
of city biological band. There are 2 schemes as follow: 
Scheme One: Situate to the east of East Waihuan and the south of Jiangnan high 
way. The south border is planning high pressure aisle and river way, the land is 
roughly agricultural land. There is a 220kv power line started from the Zhenhai power 
plant and Xinle transformer substation get through this area. To the south of Scheme 
One is railcar section and the south 220KV high pressure, land quality is relatively 
single, which are all city establishment planning land. Because it is in the central of 
biological band, it has relatively effects to the overall layout as well as to the function 
of biological band. 
Scheme Two: Situated about 300 meters south of Jiangnan highway and the west 
of Yubei city-circled highway, the land of scheme two is mainly agricultural land in 
current situation. Scheme Two is divided into three land area (1#, 2#, 3# from 
southwest to northeast) due to the widening planning (30 m) of Wangjiagang branch 
river with 20m wide green belt on both sides and reservation for 70m wide railway 
land for the planned small ring railway. Between 1# and 2# there is a river 
(Wangjiagang river); a planning small ring railway between 2# and 3#. 
See the details of comparison between the two schemes in Table 0-4

Demolition 
quantity 
On the northwest corner there are some 
enterprise brick houses; there will be some 
demolition in the long run. There is a220kv 
power line which started from Zhenhai 
power plant to xinle transformer substation, 
so in short term land use layout can avoid it. 
Enterprise house and high pressure line 
would not move in short term. 
There is nearly no demolition and 
only some pipelines to be moved.

People 
troubling 
problem 
Demolition quantity is relatively small and 
only some power line need to remove, so 
people troubling is relatively a small 
problem 
Only some pipeline need to be 
moved, so people troubling is 
small. 
According to project feasibility report, from the point of land use, the location of 
Scheme two is on the empty land between planned Xinzhou crossroad and hill body. 
The landscape was divided into three area by planned river and planned railroads, so 
the land use efficiency can be greatly raised if these empty land areas can be used as 
Waste Water Treatment plant. From the point of rational distribution of land resource 
and the planning development in Beilun district, Scheme Two is better. So it is 
recommended that Scheme Two should be adopted and the land between Xinzhou 
crossroad and hill body. 
Resettlement action plan and implementation period 
In the period of resettlement action plan and implementation, once land 
acquisition and house demolition cannot be avoided, following measures should be 
taken to decrease affects on local community: 
A. To strengthen collection of basic information, and make further analysis of 
local socio-economic actuality and future development, and formulate feasible 
resettlement action plan combining with local real condition, so it can guarantee 
DPs don’t make a loss due to project. 
B. To encourage public participation and accept the supervision from the 
mass. 
C. To emphasize internal and external monitoring, and set up effective and 
smooth feedback mechanism and channel, try all best to shorten the period of 
Page  19

information treatment, in order to safeguard all kinds of issues, emerging in 
construction implementation, would be settled timely.

Project Impacts 
Project Impact Survey 
In December 2007 to January 2008, according to the requirement of World 
Bank, Ningbo Municipal Engineering Prophase Office (NMEPO) and Design Institute 
organized together a special investigating group to investigate the impacts of land 
acquisition and house demolition caused by Jiangnan Waste Water Treatment 
Plant Project. In May, 2008, a complementary investigation of social-economic 
situations and Resettlement Plan was carried out in the affected area. 
The mode of combination of investigating households one by one and 
interview are adopted. It covers the quantity of affected households, family 
population, condition of affected enterprises and institutes, condition of shops and 
resettlement option. When the survey was carried out, displaced persons 
participated in the whole process. The opinions on land acquisition and 
resettlement of village committee and villagers are taken into consideration and 
wide discussion is carried out also. 
Project Impact Scope 
Land acquisition and house demolition in this project will involve 2 villages of 
Dashimen village and Xinmin village of Xiaogang street committee, Beilun district. And 
the construction of truck pipelines will involve Yinzhou Distirict, Beilun District and 
Dongqian Lake town. See details of project impact scope in Table 0-1.

households, 374 persons affected.  
The details are shown in Table 0-2. See the current situation of affected land in 
Figure 0-1. 
According to field survey, social and economic development in affected area is 
relatively high, especially industry and the tertiary industry. Although, most of the 
acquired land is agricultural land, it is in out of cultivation. The affected households 
would not cultivate their land and result in no farming income losses .

Permanent State-owned Land Occupation  
3.3mu state-owned lands are occupied permanently, which is mainly river surface 
and land used for highways. Among which river surface 2.9 mu and land used for 
highways 0.4 mu. 
Temporary Land Occupation 
According to project planning, land occupation of the Waste Water Treatment 
plant comes in bulk. Therefore, much space can be released after land acquisition and 
house demolition where can be used to pile construction materials and build 
temporary work shed during the project implementation period. And the need of 
business management on the spot can also be satisfied. So it is unnecessary for 
temporary land occupation or house demolition.  
As for the supported sewage pipelines, 19.4km trunk sewage pipelines, 170km 
primary and secondary sewage pipelines and 9 pump stations will be built. According 
to the project implementation plan, the sewage pipelines will be constructed together 
with the related road contruction of Ningbo municipality synchronously. The trunk 
pipelines are scheduled to be finisnhed in the year of 2008. The primary and 
secondary pinelines and pump stations will be contructed before the year of 2012. 
For the construction of the trunck sewage pipelines, the implementing methods 
adopt the pipe pushing. The resettlement impacts therefore are not serious. The 
construction situation of trunck sewage pipelines is shown in Table 0-3. The designs of 
primary and secondary pipelines and pump stations are optimizing further, the 
resettlement impacts are pending. For the resettlement caused by primary and 
secondary pipelines and pump stations construction, it should be complied with the 
resettlement policy framework.

development level in project are is relatively high, and non-agricultural industries are 
relatively developed. Affected rural labor force are mostly engaged in non-agricultural 
industry and relatively fewer in agricultural production (less than 10%). Although most 
of the villagers are registered as agricultural persons, their income are not mainly 
from agricultural production, which only accounted for 4.3 %(mainly livestock breeding 
income) , the affected land is in out of cultivation status. The affected households 
would not cultivate their land and result in no farming income losses .

The Notice on the Further Reformation of the Land Administration by the 
State Council stipulate 
III
Improve the System of Land Acquisition Compensation and Resettlement  
(12) Improve the measures of land acquisition compensation. The government 
above the county level should carry out pressing measures to ensure that the DPs’ 
living standard is not decreased due to land acquisition. Land compensation, 
resettlement subsidy, ground attachment and green seeding compensation should 
be paid sufficiently and timely. If land compensation and resettlement subsidy paid 
legally can’t maintain DPs’ former living standard or even not enough for land-lost 
farmers to pay social insurance, government of province, autonomous region or 
Page  38
 
29 
municipality directly under the Central Government should approve to increase 
resettlement subsidy. When the sum of land compensation and resettlement 
subsidy has reached the legal upper limit and still can’t maintain DPs’ former living 
standard, local government assists with income from state-owned land using-with-
pay. Government of province, autonomous region or municipality directly under the 
Central Government should draw and proclaim uniform AAOV of relevant 
city/county or integrated land price of different location. One principle in land 
acquisition compensation is same land same price. Land acquisition compensation 
must be listed sufficiently in budgetary estimate in national key construction 
project. Compensation rate and resettlement measures in large and medium water 
conservancy and hydropower projects should be regulated by State Council 
additionally.   
 (13) Resettle land-acquired farmers appropriately. The government above the 
county level should draw out detail measures to safeguard land-acquired farmers’ 
long-term living. For profitable projects, farmers can buy a share by land use right 
of construction land approved legally. Within urban planning district, local 
government should bring the land-lost farmers into urban employment system and 
establish social insurance system; while out of urban planning district, when 
collective-owned land is acquired, local government should put apart necessary 
cultivated lands within district for land-lost farmers, or offer them with work 
positions. For those landless farmers who have no basic productive condition and 
living condition, relocation in other place should be adopted. Labor and social 
insurance department, combining with relevant departments, should put forward 
directive opinions on establishing employment training and social insurance 
system for land-acquired farmers.  
 (14) Strengthen land acquisition procedure. During land acquisition, the 
ownership of collective-owned land and land contract right of farmers’ should be 
maintained. Before legal report and approval of land acquisition, the use, location 
and compensation of planned acquired land; and the resettlement approach 
should be known by farmers. The investigation results of planned acquired land 
condition should be confirmed by village collective economy organization and 
villagers. If necessary, hearing of witnesses should be organized by land and 
natural resource department. And the material about land-acquired farmers’ known 
and confirmation is necessary material for land acquisition report and approval. 
Page  39
 
30 
Coordinating and arbitrament mechanism on solving dispute in land acquisition 
compensation and resettlement should be established and improved as soon as 
possible, so as to maintain legal rights and interests of farmer and land user. 
Approved item of land acquisition should be open except special condition.   
 (15) Strengthen supervision during land acquisition implementation. If land 
acquisition compensation and resettlement are not fulfilled, planed acquired land 
can’t be used forcedly. Government of province, autonomous region or 
municipality directly under the Central Government should draw out method of 
land compensation allocation within village collective economy organization at the 
principle that land compensation is used for land-acquired farmers. Village 
collective economy organization affected by land requisition should proclaim the 
income and expense condition of land compensation to its members, so as to 
accept supervision. Departments such as agriculture and civil administration 
should strengthen the supervision on the use condition and allocation of land 
compensation within village collective economy organization. 
¾\03
Guidelines on Improving the Institutions for Compensation and Resettlement 
of Land Acquisition (MLNR) stipulate 
Article 1 Regulations on “acquired-land compensation rate”  
 
(2) Confirmation of uniform times of AAOV. The times of AAOV in land 
compensation and resettlement subsidy should be decided legally on the principle 
that DPs’ living standard is not decreased due to land acquisition. If land 
compensation and resettlement subsidy calculated by legal uniform times of AAOV 
can’t maintain DPs’ former living standard or even not enough for land-lost farmers 
to pay social insurance, times of AAOV can be increased with the approval of 
government of province level. When the sum of land compensation and 
resettlement subsidy is calculated by 30 times AAOV and still can’t maintain DPs’ 
former living standard, local government can assist with income from state-owned 
land using-with-pay. Capital farm land acquired legally should be compensated at 
upper limit price issued by local peoples’ government.   
(3) Enaction of integrated land price of land-acquired areas. In well-
conditioned areas, land and nature resource department of province level, 
combining with relevant departments, can enact integrated land price of land-
acquired areas of each county/city within popedom. And the land price can be 
Page  40
 
31 
publicized and implemented after approval from Peoples’ Government of province 
level. When integrated land price of different areas is enacted, factors such as 
land sort, land output value, land location, rank of farm land, cultivated land per 
capita, supply and demand condition of land, local economy development level 
and lowest living safeguard level of rural resident should be take into account.  
Article 2 Regulations on “resettlement approach of land-acquired farmer”   
 (5) Resettled by agriculture production. When collective-owned land out of 
urban planning district is acquired, collective mobile lands, contract lands handed 
voluntary by contractor, circulated contracted lands and added lands by land 
development should be used to ensure land-acquired farmers obtain necessary 
cultivated land and continue their agriculture production.   
 (6) Resettled by re-employment. Opportunity of free training on skills should 
be provided to land-acquired farmers, and so are corresponding positions. Under 
the same condition, land-acquired farmers have priority to be employed by land-
using unit. When collective-owned land within urban planning district is acquired, 
land-lost farmers should be brought into urban employment system and social 
insurance system.   
 (7) Resettled by benefits from share. For profitable projects, farmers can buy 
a share by land compensation or by land use right of construction land approved 
legally at the premise that the farmers are voluntary and that land-acquired 
collective economy organization have coordinated with land-using unit. Collective 
economy organization and farmers can contract to obtain interests by preferred 
stock.  
 (8) Resettled by relocation in other place. For those landless farmers who 
have no basic productive condition and living condition within former areas, 
relocation in other place can be adopted at the premise that the opinions from 
collective economy organization and farmers have been taken into account.   
Article 3 Regulations on “land acquisition procedure”   
(9) Be told the condition of land acquisition. Before legal report and approval 
of land acquisition, the use, location and compensation of planned acquired land; 
and the resettlement approach should be known by land-acquired collective 
economy organization and farmers in written form. The ground attachments and 
Page  41
 
32 
green seeding planted or constructed after being told will not be compensated in 
land acquisition.  
(10) Confirm the investigation results of planned acquired land condition. 
Local land and natural resource department should investigate the property, sort 
and acreage of acquired land, and investigate the property, sorts and quantity of 
ground attachments. The investigation results should be confirmed by village 
collective economy organization and villagers.  
(11) Organize hearing of witnesses for land acquisition. Before legal report 
and approval of land acquisition, local land and natural resource department 
should tell village collective economy organization and villagers that they have 
rights to apply hearing of witnesses on land compensation rate and resettlement 
approach. If person concerned applies for hearing of witnesses, hearing of 
witnesses should be organized according to the procedure and request regulated 
in
 Hearing Of Witnesses Regulations On Land And Natural Resources.

Resettlement Scheme 
Resettlement Objectives 
The displaced persons should be ensured to gain compensation for all of their 
loss, to share project benefit by proper resettlement and good restoration, to provide 
subsidy for their temporary difficulties, and to increase their income level, living 
standard or at least to restore them. Enterprise production, profit making abilities 
should be improved or at least equal level prior to the beginning of project 
implementation. 
Resettlement Principles 
Principle of Reducing Resettlers as much as possible 
Optimize project design to decrease the affected area so as to reduce affected 
people as many as possible. 
Principle of Equally Compensating 
1. As for agricultural land acquired, all the damages should be compensated 
properly and the compensation is to be paid to representative collective 
organizations to develop collective economy without embezzlement.  Those 
resettlers who work in agriculture should be co-arranged by local government, PMO 
and Village Committees to be employed in principle of “resettling in site and being 
on position in multi-channels” to keep their living standard from affecting. 
2. Resettlement family shall gain resettlement house whose transportation, all 
kinds of affiliated facilities and surroundings is equal to the original house or the 
same value of original house. 
4. Public facilities will be restored fully and their functions should not lower than 
original level at least to guarantee unmoving residents’ natural living in the 
surroundings of project.  
5. Those who do not affected temporarily and those whose property has been 
damaged partly but no need to move, equal compensation will be allocated too. 
Page  59
 
50 
Principle of Focusing on Emphasis 
1. Project will pay attention to the vulnerable groups (such as the old who has 
no adult children living together with, widows, single family, the handicapped, 
chronic patients and poor families). In movement, the preferential policies including 
housing, employment will favor them. Meanwhile, after movement regular re-visit will 
be done too for help to particular difficulties until transferring them to local civil 
governmental departments. 
2. Project will plan exploitative movement to mobilize local governments’ power 
to carry out resettlers’ employment training and create employment opportunity as 
much as possible to accustom resettlers to resettlement environment in short time, 
therefore to transfer the responsibilities of resettlement from resettlement 
organizations to resettlers themselves. 
3. Project will try its best to maximize cost and benefit of resettlement to 
develop resettlement ability of the organizations, to standardize resettlement 
behavior, to establish perfect inside control system, to prevent fund wasting, cutting, 
embezzling and corrupting to utilize resettlement funds well to reach best 
resettlement effect; that is to say, in indicators of enacted resettlement effect, project 
is to try best to reduce resettlement cost. 
Resettlement for Permanent Land Acquisition 
¾\03
Impact analysis on land acquisition 
Planned site of Jiangnan sewage plant permanently occupy rural collective land 
404.1 mu. 374 persons of 148 households in two villages of Xiaogang street committee 
are affected, i.e. Dashimen village and Xiaogang village. From field survey, the affected 
villages are rapid developing pre-urban areas which located within the Ningbo economic 
and technology development zone, Ningbo tariff zone, Ningbo export processing area; 
and Ningbo High-tech industrial garden. social and economic development level in 
project is relatively high, and non-agricultural industries are relatively developed. The 
mainly incomes sources of the villages are mainly from non-agricultural , the affected 
labors are all engaged in enterprises with the wages of 1000yuan~2000yuan per month 
.Although most occupied land is agricultural land, the affected labors are all out of 
Page  60

.  
¾\03
Resettlement plan 
On the basis on the Enforcement Opinions on Collective Land Acquisition, 
compensation  and Personnel Resettlement in Beilun District. 
After agreement of 2/3 
villagers, land compensation which can be used for the welfare of all villagers or paid for 
endowment insurance ; resettlement subsidy will be given out to the labor force affected by land 
acquisition. After get resettlement subsidy, they may continue their current career, engage self-
employment business or pay for their endowment insurance. 
After land acquisition and use, economic cooperators in administrative villages can enjoy 
endowment insurance if their land is occupied. After the endowment insurance is fully paid, 
male of 60 or older and female of 55 or older can get endowment insurance money. Due to 
Enforcement Regulations on Pension Guarantee of Land-occupied Persons of Beilun District
, 
insurance fee is set according to the age and classes. For man younger than 60, and female 
younger than 55, the standards of each class are 46000 yuan, 33000 yuan and 20000 yuan and 
after meeting the requests of enjoying endowment insurance money, they can get monthly 300 
yuan/month, 250 yuan/month or 200yuan/month respectively. At the same time, the standards 
would be raised can be raised in accordance with the economic development. The insurance 
money of land occupied persons should be jointly paid by 3 parties: individuals, collective and 
the government. The proportion is: district government 30%, collective 30%, individuals 40%. 
Calculated based on the highest standard of 46000yuan, the payment is 138000yuan, 
138000yuan and 184000 respectively ,which would be paid by land compensation from village 
collective, local government fiscal income and resettlement subsidy from affected labors.
 
¾\03
Training program  
To provide aid to affected villagers, perfect labor (including the women) service 
system has been established. Before land acquisition, relevant resettlement service 
agency has been established to provide aid for affected persons through various 
channels, such as free openness of employment market and professional training 
program ( including the programs for women , such as housekeeping,
\03
sewing , etc) 
Resettlement for Rural House Demolition 
According to the environmental request, 10750
of rural residential house within 
the environmental protection line should be demolished. 108 households of 35

As for displaced people, compensation policy of optional property rights exchange 
resettlement or cash resettlement. In optional property rights exchange resettlement, 
affected persons can get houses in resettlement community of the same acreage of the 
demolished houses; in cash resettlement, they can get house compensation at the 
replacement price. Displace persons can also get moving subsidy, temporary transition 
subsidy and awards. As for the move of facilities, such as telephone or CATA, moving 
cost will be compensated according to actual standard. 
This project have build relocation houses for the affected persons, which situated in 
the east of Dukou Road and the south of Xiaojiajiang Road, no further than 3km from 
Dashimen village. Based on the investigation, the affected households know the site for 
the relocation houses. In order to meet the requirements of the demolished households, 
many door types are build, they are: 45
(one room, one halls and one bathroom), 
55
(two rooms, two hall and one bathroom), 85
(three rooms, two halls and one 
bathroom), 95
(three rooms, two halls and one bathroom), 105
(three rooms, two 
halls and two bathrooms), 115
(three rooms, two halls and two bathrooms). The 
ground floor small door types are prepared for the old. Supported facilities, such as 
water supply, electricity supply, transport, gas supply, communication and CATA, all are 
built according to designing. And around relocation community, infrastructures, such as, 
schools, post office, saving bank and vegetable markets, bus stops and hospitals are 
also built to facilitate the living of the residents. At Gaohetang bus stop, No.702 bus and 
other middle size buses. It only takes 20 minutes to travel to urban area. Displaced 
persons can choose new houses by their option. The displaced person who choose the 
option of property right exchange can get the compensation including replacement price 
compensation for their demolished houses, the difference between basic costand 
average rate set by government of the affected street committee, township or district for 
commercial residence in relocationg area (brick-concrete structure(620+1500-
550Yuan/
)); relocation house within the relocatable area (no more than 250
), will be 
average rate set by government for commercial residence in relocationg area 
1500Yuan/
. So after they get the compensation money, they would get enough money 
to buy the relocation houses. Relocation house will be completed by 2009. 
Affected Infrastructure and Ground Attachment  
The affected infrastructure and ground attachments should be compensated to 
ownership enterprises by project organizations and then reconstructed by the 
Page  62
 
53 
ownership enterprises.   
The rehabilitation measures on demolished facilities should be planned and 
disposed in advance. And in the actual implementing, due to different conditions 
different measures should be made for safety, high efficiency, being in time accurate 
to reduce bad effect on the surrounding groups as much as possible.    
As for the affected municipal public facilities, the demolishers should demolish 
according to project’s stakes map on the principle of no impact on project 
construction to reduce movement as much as possible. As for movement of the 
affected pipelines, demolishers should reconstruct (or remove) before demolish to 
ensure nature living of residents along the lines including the residents who do not 
need to move.

Monitoring and Evaluation 
To ensure a smooth implementation of RAP and achieve the aim of properly 
resettled, according to the requirements of the World Bank Operational Policies 
OP4.12 <Involuntary Resettlement> and <Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation of 
the World Bank Loan Projects in China Business Guide>; the project will monitor and 
evaluate the implementation of land acquisition and house demolition and 
resettlement activities regularly. Independent monitoring bodies have two parts: 
internal monitoring and independent external monitoring. 
Internal monitoring is carried out by, Ningbo Urban Construction and 
Environmental Protection WB Project Office, Ningbo Municipal Engineering Prophase 
Office and implementation institutions to ensure that land acquisition and house 
demolition is implemented according to the principle and timetable of RAP. The 
purpose of internal monitoring is to make resettlement agencies keep good functions 
in implementation process. 
Independent monitoring and evaluation is the one that is regularly carried out by 
independent monitoring agency on land acquisition and house demolition. 
Independent monitoring of the project is done by experienced agency with rich 
experience. The content of independent monitoring is as follows: 
¾\03
Functions of resettlement network; 
¾\03
The implementation progress and compensation of land acquisition, house 
demolition and resettlement; 
¾\03
The resettlement and restoration of the demolished residents and enterprises and 
institutions; 
¾\03
Survey and analysis on the living and production level of re-settlers. 
The purpose of independent monitoring is to provide an evaluation of 
resettlement by an organization independent from the project implementation 
agencies, and to inspect the overall implementation from a broader, long-term view. 
Independent monitoring agency will follow the resettlement activities to evaluate 
whether the goals of resettlement are achieved through observing <1> the application 
of the laws of P.R.C. concerned on resettlement; <2> compliance with the principles of 
the World Bank’s Operational Directive O.P. 4.12 on 
Involuntary Resettlement
; and 
Page  87
 
78 
<3>an improvement in the standards of living of the DPs or at least maintenance of 
the former living standards. The Independent Monitoring Institution provides 
suggestions to the institutions for demolition implementation, so as the problems 
encountered in the implementation can be resolved in time. 
Internal Monitoring 
Ningbo Municipal Engineering Prophase Office operates an internal monitoring 
mechanism to detect resettlement activities. The project office builds a basic database 
of land acquisition and house demolition and resettlement and uses it to work out 
RAP, monitor all the resettled households and demolished agencies, and carry out 
internal monitoring on the whole preparation and implementation process. 
Implementation Procedures 
During Project Implementation, resettlement information will be gathered and recorded 
by Ningbo Municipal Drainage Company Ltd according monitoring samples, which will be 
timely pass to Ningbo WB Prophase Office to keep consecutive monitoring record. Ningbo 
Municipal Engineering Prophase Office will do regular inspection on implementation. 
Information tables of prescribed form will be used in above mentioned monitoring 
operational mechanism to keep consecutive information current from Ningbo 
Municipal Drainage Company Ltd to Ningbo WB Project Leading group. Regular 
checkup and verification should be done by Ningbo Urban Construction and 
Environmental Protection WB Project Office, Beilun land and natural resource bureau 
as well as Beilun house demolition management office, which are all important 
components of internal monitoring system.

Ningbo Municipal Engineering Prophase Office will retain independent monitoring 
institute to carry out external monitoring and evaluation. 
Independent monitoring institution will periodically monitor and evaluate the 
implementation of RAP, including the progress, quality of resettlement, utilization of 
funds. It will give advice and suggestions. After tracking monitoring DPs’ living 
standard and production condition, the independent monitoring institution will submit 
monitoring and evaluation reports to Ningbo Municipal Engineering Prophase Office 
and the World Bank.

3. 
In the above two subprojects, Ningbo Municipal Engineering Prophase 
Office has compiled Resettlement plan for Jiangnan Waste Water Treatment plant project 
to meet the requirement of WB Operation policy (OP4.12 involuntary resettlement). The 
borrower has prepared this Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to establish principles 
and guidelines to be used in resettlement preparation and implementation due to design 
alteration of the projects and supported pipeline network. If land acquisition or house 
demolition causes due to project design alternation or supported pipeline network, 
resettlement plans which in accordance with the RPF must be compiled before WB 
evaluation and ratification. 
B. 
Objectives, Definitions and Key Principles 
4. 
In World Bank-assisted projects, borrowers are expected to take all 
necessary measures to mitigate adverse social impacts, including those associated with 
land acquisition.  World Bank Operational Policy 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement, 
provides essential guidance on objectives and principles that are applicable in projects 
generating land acquisition and resettlement-related impacts.  
5. 
Every reasonable effort is to be made to avoid or minimize the need for 
land acquisition, and to minimize all resettlement-related adverse impacts.  If land 
acquisition and associated adverse impacts cannot be avoided altogether, the principle 
objective of the RPF is to ensure that all persons subjected to adverse impacts (“displaced 
persons” as defined below) are compensated at replacement cost (as defined below) for 
lost assets and otherwise provided with any rehabilitation measures or other forms of 
assistance necessary to provide them with sufficient opportunity to improve, or at least 
restore, their incomes and living standards.  
6. 
“Displaced persons” refers to all the people who, on account of the 
activities listed above, would have their (1) standard of living adversely affected ; or 
(2)right, title, interest in any house, land (including premises, agricultural and grazing 
land) or any other fixed or movable asset acquired or possessed temporarily or 
permanently; (3) access to productive assets adversely affected, temporarily or 
permanently; or (4)business, occupation, work or place of residence or habitat adversely 
affected; and “displaced person” means any of the displaced persons.  
7. 
"Replacement cost" is defined as follows: For agricultural land, it is the 
Page  97
 
88 
pre-project or pre-displacement, whichever is higher, market value of land of equal 
productive potential or use located in the vicinity of the affected land, plus the cost of 
preparing the land to levels similar to those of the affected land, plus the cost of any 
registration and transfer taxes. For land in urban areas, it is the pre-displacement market 
value of land of equal size and use, with similar or improved public infrastructure 
facilities and services and located in the vicinity of the affected land, plus the cost of any 
registration and transfer taxes. For houses and other structures, it is the market cost of the 
materials to build a replacement structure with an area and quality similar to or better 
than those of the affected structure, or to repair a partially affected structure, plus the cost 
of transporting building materials to the construction site, plus the cost of any labor and 
contractors' fees, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes. In determining the 
replacement cost, depreciation of the asset and the value of salvage materials are not 
taken into account, nor is the value of benefits to be derived from the project deducted 
from the valuation of an affected asset. Where domestic law does not meet the standard 
of compensation at full replacement cost, compensation under domestic law is 
supplemented by additional measures so as to meet the replacement cost standard. Such 
additional assistance is distinct from resettlement measures to be provided under other 
clauses in OP 4.12, para. 6.  
8. 
World Bank’s OP 4.12 establishes key principles to be followed in 
resettlement planning and implementation. Of particular relevance for this RPF are the 
following:  
World Bank’s OP 4.12 establishes key principles to be followed in resettlement planning 
and implementation. Of particular relevance for this RPF are the following:  
a)
\02
Wherever possible, project designs and RPs should be conceived as 
development opportunities, so that displaced persons may    benefit from the 
services and facilities created for, or by, project activities.  
b)
\02
All displaced persons are entitled to compensation for lost assets, or to 
alternative but equivalent forms of assistance in lieu of compensation;   Lack of 
legal rights to the assets lost will not bar displaced persons from entitlement to 
such compensation or alternative forms of assistance 
c)
\02
Compensation rates as established in an RP refer to amounts to be paid in 
full to the individual or collective owner of the lost asset, without deduction for 
any purpose. In China, individual owners receive compensation for affected 
structures and other fixed assets, and villages receive compensation for acquired 
land in rural areas.  
Page  98
 
89 
d)
\02
When cultivated land is acquired, it often is preferable to arrange for land-
for-land replacement through collective land redistribution. In some cases, as 
when only small proportions of income are earned through agriculture, alternative 
measures such as payment of cash or provision of employment are acceptable if 
preferred by the persons losing agricultural land.  
e)
\02
Replacement house plots, sites for relocating businesses, or redistributed 
agricultural land should be of equivalent use value to the land that was lost.  
f)
\02
The resettlement transition period should be minimized. Compensation for 
assets should be paid prior to the time of impact, so that new houses can be 
constructed, fixed assets can be removed or replaced, and other necessary 
measures can be undertaken prior to initiation of construction activities.  
g)
\02
Displaced persons should be consulted during the process of RP 
preparation, so that their preferences regarding possible resettlement 
arrangements are solicited and considered; RPs is publicly disclosed in a manner 
accessible to displaced persons.  
h)
\02
The previous level of community services and access to resources will be 
maintained or improved after resettlement.  
i)
\02
The borrower is responsible for meeting costs associated with land 
acquisition and resettlement. Financial and physical resources for resettlement 
and rehabilitation will be made available as and when required.  
j)
\02
Resettlement program will include adequate institutional arrangements to 
ensure effective and timely design, planning and implementation of resettlement 
and rehabilitation measures.  
k)
\02
Adequate arrangements for effective internal and external monitoring will 
be made on implementation of all resettlement measures. 
l)
\02
Methods by which displaced persons can pursue grievances will be 
established as necessary, and information regarding these grievance procedures 
will be provided to displaced persons. 
C. Legal 
Framework 
9. 
The primary purpose of this RPF is to ensure that resettlement planning 
and implementation in activities identified in Para. 3 meet the requirements of World 
Bank OP 4.12. Additionally, resettlement activities should be designed in accordance 
with relevant laws, codes and decrees of the PRC, Zhejiang Province and relevant 
districts or counties involved in this project. Definitely, the laws and policies shall be 
updated according to the development of society and economy. 
D. 
Preparing and Approving RPs 
Page  99
 
90 
10. 
Responsibility for preparation and implementation of RPs (including 
responsibility for meeting all costs associated with resettlement) rests with the borrower. 
The agency with overall responsibility in this project is the NingBo Government; 
executing agency is Ningbo Urban Construction and Environmental Protection WB 
Project Office; enforcement body is Ningbo Municipal Drainage Company Ltd. 
11. 
Once it is determined that land acquisition is essential to complete any 
of the activities identified in Para. 3, and once sitting criteria establish the land area to be 
acquired, resettlement planning should begin. The borrower will carry out, or cause to be 
carried out, a socioeconomic survey to determine the range and scope of adverse impacts 
in the affected area as well as the identity and number of displaced persons.  The survey 
will determine whether a full RP or an “abbreviated” RP (as defined in OP 4.12, Annex 
A) is necessary. When the number of persons affected by the component exceeds 200, a 
full RP is necessary.  Where impacts on the entire affected population are minor, or fewer 
than 200 people are affected, an abbreviated RP may be prepared.  Impacts are 
considered “minor” if the affected people are not physically displaced and less than 10% 
of their productive assets are lost.  
12. 
If a RP is necessary, it will be prepared in accordance with the policy 
principles and planning and implementation arrangements set forth in this RPF. The RP 
is based on accurate baseline census and socioeconomic survey information, and 
establishes appropriate mitigation measures (e.g., compensation for assets, transitional 
assistance, economic rehabilitation assistance) for all categories of adverse impacts. 
Depending on the categories of impacts, the RP specifically addresses the following: 
a)
\02
Description of the activity causing land acquisition;  
b)
\02
Range and scope of potential adverse impacts; 
c)
\02
Socioeconomic studies and baseline census information;  
d)
\02
Review of relevant laws and regulations relating to land acquisition and resettlement;  
e)
\02
Specific compensation rates (or alternative measures) for all categories of affected assets;  
f)
\02
Other measures, if any, necessary to provide opportunities for economic rehabilitation of 
displaced persons; 
g)
\02
Eligibility criteria for compensation and all other forms of assistance;  
h)
\02
Relocation arrangements, if necessary, including transitional support;  
i)
\02
Site selection and site preparation, if necessary;

13. 
If an abbreviated RP is to be prepared, it also must be based on 
principles and planning and implementation arrangements established in this RPF. An 
abbreviated RP normally includes the following contents:  
(a)  a census survey of displaced persons and valuation of assets;  
(b)  description of compensation and other resettlement assistance to be provided;  
(c) eligibility criteria;  
(d)  consultation and disclosure arrangements;  
(e)  organizational arrangements for implementation  
(f) timetable and budget;  
(g)  monitoring arrangements;  
(h) grievance procedures. 
E. Eligibility 
Criteria 
14. 
The purpose of resettlement planning is to ensure that displaced persons 
have sufficient opportunity to replace assets they will lose, and to improve or at least 
restore their incomes and living standards. To achieve these objectives, it is essential to 
ensure that all displaced persons are identified, and to ensure that all displaced persons 
are deemed eligible for mitigation measures included in the RP. With regard to major 
categories of impact (e.g., loss of land in rural areas, loss of structure, and loss of 
income), the following measures normally apply: 
15. 
Displaced persons losing agricultural land will be entitled to the 
following types of compensation and rehabilitation measures:  
a)
\02
Typically, collectively-owned cultivated land remaining after acquisition 
will be reallocated among all members of the collectivity by the village committee.  
Page  101
 
92 
Under these circumstances, all displaced persons are eligible for a share of 
reallocated land, and to benefit from collective investment of land compensation.  
b)
\02
According to the Land Administration Law, in situations where land 
reallocation is not possible, displaced persons losing agricultural land must be 
identified. In some instances, they may be provided with employment with wages at 
least equivalent to income lost. In other cases, they may be paid a resettlement 
subsidy normally equivalent to at least six times the average annual production 
output value of the land in the previous three years. If this is not sufficient to restore 
livelihoods, the subsidy may be raised to as much as 15 times  the average annual 
output value;  
c)
\02
If land compensation and resettlement subsidies paid are still insufficient, 
the resettlement subsidies may be further increased upon approval by the municipal 
government;  
d)
\02
Land compensation and resettlement subsidies are paid to the village 
committees whose land is affected and will be used for (i) increasing land areas 
under cultivation if land is available; (ii) intensification of agriculture through 
provision of irrigation, improved agricultural practices, etc.; and (iii) development of 
non-agriculture based income generation activities.  Individual displaced persons 
will be compensated at replacement cost for the loss of standing crops, fruit or 
industrial trees, as well as any fixed assets;  
e)
\02
Displaced persons whose land is temporarily taken to facilitate project 
construction will be compensated for their loss of income, standing crops and for the 
cost of soil restoration and damaged infrastructures. 
16. 
As for land acquisition, the compensation rate should be as follows at 
least: 
a)
\02
Land compensation fee: cultivated land including paddy land and dry land should be 
compensated at 25800yuan/mu, non-cultivated land should be at the half that of the 
cultivated land. 
b)
\02
Resettlement subsidy: will calculated on the base of agricultural population need to 
be relocated. The rate should be 19200yuan/peson. 
c)
\02
Compensation for Young crops and attachment: it should be compensated at 
replacement price on the basis of real situation. 
17. 
Displaced persons losing house and auxiliary structures will be entitled 
to the following compensation and rehabilitation measures: 
a)
\02
Provision of replacement housing of equivalent value; or  
b)
\02
Compensation at full replacement cost; and  
Page  102
 
93 
c)
\02
Compensation for replacement or restoration of all facilities and services (e.g., 
electricity, telephone, cable television, school enrollment fees); and  
d)
\02
Transitional allowances as necessary to move all belongings, or to obtain temporary 
housing if necessary. 
18. 
For the house demolition on collective land, the following principle 
should be taken: 
Options of cash resettlement and property right exchange are adopted in this project. 
Besides, movement subsidy, temporary relocation subsidy and bonus can be provided. 
a)
\02
Optional property rights exchange resettlement 
Optional property rights exchange resettlement refers to the mode of paying to 
affected people house purchasing fund, with it they can optionally to buy commercial 
residential houses on the market from real estate developer which are priced by the 
government.  
(1) The same acreage of demolished house with relocatable acreage (no more than 
250 
 ) can be compensated according to replacement price.
 The replacement price 
for concrete-brick structure is 620yuan/
 .
 
(2) Optional house purchasing fund is calculated through the multiplying the 
relocatable acreage with the difference between basic cost (550yuan/
 ) and average 
rate set by government of the affected street committee, township or district for 
commercial residence in relocationg area(1500yuan/
 ). As for the demolished people 
relocated with the low limit, the low limit acreage can be regarded as their reloctable 
resettlement acreage. 
(3) If the legally demolished house acreage exceeds the relocatable construction area, 
the exceeding part will not be relocated, which will be compensated at the standard of 
130% of the replacement price. 
(4) With house purchasing certificate, the demolished people can purchase 
government priced commercial houses on the market operation from real estate 
developers. If there is a surplus of house purchasing fund provided by the demolisher, 
it will belong to the demolished people; if the actual house purchasing fund exceeds 
which provided by the demolisher, the demolished people should be responsible for 
the exceeding part. 
(5) Contract tax can be exempt for the same acreage of purchase commercial houses 
with relocatable acreage. 
b)
\02
Cash compensation 
Compensation should be offered to demolished people for their optional house 
purchasing by the demolisher. Cash compensation can be conducted as follows: 
(1) As for the same acreage of demolished legal house with relocatable acreage, 
Page  103
 
94 
demolished people would be compensated by the demolisher at the replacement price. 
The replacement price for concrete-brick structure is 620yuan/
 .
 
(2) Compensation fund is calculated through the multiplying the difference between 
basic cost (550yuan/
 ) and average markect rate for commercial residence in 
relocationg area (2500yuan/
 ). As for the demolished people relocated with the low
 
limit, the low limit acreage can be regarded as their reloctable resettlement acreage. 
(3) If the legally demolished house acreage exceeds the relocatable construction area, 
the exceeding part will not be relocated, which will be compensated at the standard of 
130% of the replacement price. 
(4) Added compensation fund with 10% of the total amount of item 1-3. 
(5) Compensation fund should be paid to demolished people by demolisher within 
five days after the compensation agreement is signed and demolished house 
delivered. 
(6) Within 5 years after the day of compensation agreement is signed. If the 
demolished people purchase houses in Beilun district, the same mount of contract tax 
with compensation fund can be exempted. 
c)
\02
Other compensation 
 1 Moving subsidy: It is given out to house leaseholder or owner at the standard of 
100 yuan/person, no less than 400 yuan/ household. As for those select optional 
property rights exchange resettlement, if temporary transition period is necessary, 
double of moving subsidy should be paid by demolisher. 
 2 Temporary transition subsidy: It is calculated according to family permanent 
people. In optional property rights exchange resettlement, transition period is from 
the day of house demolition to 4 months later after the commercial residence 
buildings delivery. If transition period over 24 months, from the 25th month, 2 times 
of transition subsidy should be paid by the demolisher. In moving and rebuilding 
resettlement or cash resettlement, 6 months of transition period should be paid by 
demolisher. The standard of transition subsidy is 160 yuan/ person*month, no less 
than 400 yuan/ household*month. 
19. 
If partial acquisition would render a house or structure unsafe or no 
longer functional, it should be acquired in its entirety.  
20. 
A displaced person losing business income (or employment income) 
will be entitled to the following rehabilitation measures:
 
 
a)
\02
Mitigation measures for loss of business typically include: (i) the provision of 
alternative business site of equal size and accessibility to customers; or (ii) cash 
compensation to the owner for lost business structure reflecting full replacement 
cost of the structure and all fixtures; and (iii) transitional payment for all moving-
Page  104
 
95 
related expenses and for loss of sales or income during the period in which the 
business cannot operate. 
b)
\02
Mitigation measures for loss of employment typically include: (i) provision of 
alternative employment at equivalent wages; or (ii) cash settlement equivalent to at 
least three years of lost wages; and (iii) transitional payment for re-training, 
relocation or other measures necessary for obtaining new employment.  
F. Implementation 
Process 
21. 
A detailed implementation schedule of all activities to be undertaken 
will be included in the RP. Payment of compensation and furnishing of other 
rehabilitation entitlements (in cash or in-kind), and relocation if necessary, should be 
completed at least one month prior to land acquisition. If it is not possible to make all 
compensation payments, or to provide other necessary forms of assistance, prior to land 
acquisition, additional transitional allowances may be required.  
G. Funding 
Arrangement 
22. 
As established in Para.10, Ningbo Urban Construction and 
Environmental Protection WB Project Office and Ningbo Municipal Drainage Company 
Ltd bear responsibility for meeting all costs associated with land acquisition and 
resettlement. Any RPs prepared in accordance with this RPF requires inclusion of 
estimated costs and budgets. All persons adversely affected by land acquisition are 
entitled to compensation or other appropriate mitigation measures, regardless of whether 
these persons have been identified at the time of resettlement planning, and regardless of 
whether sufficient mitigation funds have been allocated. For these reasons, the budget in 
the resettlement plan includes contingency funds, typically 10% or more of the estimated 
total resettlement costs, to meet unanticipated resettlement costs.  
23. 
Compensation rates included in the RP provide the basis for calculating 
compensation amounts due to displaced persons. Compensation must be paid in full to 
the individual or collective losing land or other assets. No deductions from compensation 
will occur for any reason. The RP should describe the procedures by which compensation 
funds will flow from ZUDCO to the displaced persons. As a general principle, the flow 
of funds should be as direct as possible, reducing the number of intermediary agencies to 
a minimum.  
H. 
Consultation and Disclosure Arrangements 
Page  105
 
96 
24. 
The RP must describe measures taken, or to be taken, to consult with 
displaced persons regarding proposed resettlement arrangements, and to foster their 
participation in activities essential to improvement or restoration of incomes and living 
standards. To ensure that opinions and preferences of displaced persons are considered, 
consultations should begin prior to finalization of project designs and mitigation 
measures. Consultations should continue throughout the period in which the RP is 
implemented through external monitoring arrangements (see below).  
25. 
The project office also discloses the RP, in draft and final stages, to the 
displaced persons and the general public in the project area, in a language and location 
accessible to them. Disclosure of the draft RP should occur at least one month prior to 
Bank review. Disclosure of the final RP occurs following Bank acceptance. 
I. Grievance 
Procedures 
26. 
Since the resettlement work will be carried out in consultation with 
displaced persons, major grievances are not likely to arise. However, to ensure that 
displaced persons have avenues for redressing grievance related to any aspect of land 
acquisition and resettlement, resettlement plan must give grievance procedures in details 
which should be suitable for the local reality. 
J. External 
Monitoring 
27. 
RAP implementation will be monitored by a qualified agency 
independent of the project office. The RAP should establish the scope and frequency of 
monitoring activities. External monitoring reports must be prepared for simultaneous 
submission to the Ningbo Municipal Engineering Prophase Office and the World Bank.
