                         The project's objective is to enhance the efficiency and equity of waste management in Ningbo (wastewater) and Hangzhou (solidwaste) municipalities and the
                         redevelopment of the historic inner city of Shaoxing and Cicheng, thereby facilitating the sustainable development of these cities and establishing a model for
                         conservation of cultural heritage in other Chinese cities.

                         Two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been operating in Ningbo since 2007, treating wastewater at their design capacity of 160,000m3/day and 76,000 m3/day,
                         respectively. Construction of one additional WWTP in Ningbo, with a design capacity of 100,000m3/day, has been completed. The plant was commissioned early this calendar year
                         and is currently in trial operations. The sanitary solid waste landfill site at Hangzhou has been operating since 2007, having received a total of 4.4 million tons of solid waste to date.
                         Together these works are enhancing waste management services in Ningbo and Hangzhou. Implementation of the cultural heritage component in Shaoxing has also been completed,
                         with the last project subcomponent, i.e., the construction of a museum complex and landscaping of a surrounding park, completed at the end of 2010. The second, much smaller
                         cultural heritage component in Chicheng (part of Ningbo) had to be somewhat downscaled relative to the original plan due to resettlement difficulties. All five capacity building
                         components are substantively completed, and they have contributed to improved management of the sector, as evidenced inter alia by the gradual commercialization of urban
                         environmental management services in Ningbo and Hangzhou and the introduction of good practice methods of cultural heritage conservation in Shaoxing. These activities together
                         have contributed to supporting the sustainability of the project.
