Environmental\n            strengthening is considered a critical component of the\n            project, and a detailed technical assistance program is\n            being developed to address such needs. This includes\n            training in management, and operations, in a wide variety of\n            disciplines. Water quality standards in river systems,\n            lakes, and reservoirs should be raised by 5-10 percent\n            points, while standards on the basis of functional zoning of\n            lakes and reservoirs should be raised over 70 percent. Water\n            quality indicators should be controlled in the offshore sea\n            areas according to the functional zoning requirements, and\n            improved year by year. By 2005, the discharge amounts of\n            SO2, dusts - smoke, and industrial ashes - COD, NH3-N,\n            industrial solid wastes, and other main pollutants should be\n            ten percent less than those in 2000, while major\n            environmental protection cities should meet a standard of\n            100 percent in surface water quality. Similarly, centralized\n            urban wastewater treatment rates should raise standards by\n            45-60 percent, while urban domestic treatment rates (with no\n            harmful effects) should meet a 90 percent acceptance\n            standard. Public green surfaces should be above 8 square\n            meters per capita in cities, planning to reach new green\n            surface, and landscape coverage rates, by 30-35 percent."}, "docdt": "2009-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
