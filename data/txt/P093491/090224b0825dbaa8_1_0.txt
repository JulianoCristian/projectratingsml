                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project would help reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding, through a mix of physical, institutional and financial measures. It will be the second phase of an
                         APL, planned over the next 7 years. While phase 1 of the program develops a risk management program for the City of Buenos Aires, phase 2 develops a risk
                         management program for six provinces complying with the selection criteria, and undertakes preparation of the future operations. The measures will aim at improving
                         the security of economic assets and persons living in flood-prone areas by constructing defense facilities to reduce future losses due to floods, and by strengthening
                         national and provincial institutions and systems for dealing with future floods. These provinces (Chaco, Corrientes, Misiones, Santa Fe, Formosa and Entre Rios), are
                         located along the two main rivers, the Paran? and Paraguay, constituting the Argentinean region most vulnerable to flooding. The provinces have started to develop a
                         risk management strategy under the current Flood Protection Project (4117-AR), and they succeeded in achieving positive results in risk identification and mitigation. In
                         addition, the provinces will build on the achievements and experience from the City of Buenos Aires in phase1.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is financing structural and non structural measures in the provinces of Corrientes, Chaco, Santa Fe and Entre Rios to reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding. All
                         work contracts have been signed and are expected to be finished before the end of the project (December 31st, 2014). Finished works have benefited 287,000 people (72 percent of
                         the goal), and have made possible to protect 3,680 ha of land against flooding (exceeding the project the goal). The participating provinces have made great progress in

                         implementing non structural measures. Eight municipalities have published ordinances with information on risk and land uses. Approximately 3.6 million people are now protected by
                         flood risk contingency plans surpassing the PAD target of 2.5 million. Eighteen communication campaigns for municipal stakeholders were carried out. Five monitoring systems of
                         drainage and wastewater effluent quality were implemented. And two provinces are now equipped with contingency plans and have carried out simulations. Finally, the
                         implementation of the resettlement plan in Resistencia is helping 207 families that lived in flood prone areas. Implementation of the Resistencia resettlement plan is considered best
                         practice.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The extension of the closing date of the Project, from March 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014, was approved by the Bank on November 21, 2013. The extension is allowing to
                         complete three contracts in Chaco, including those related to the resettlement in Resistencia, and one contract in the Province of Santa Fe for the protection of the coastal area of
                         Cayasta. According to the information received during the last supervision mission in May and the closely monitoring it is expected to finish all works before the end of the Project.
