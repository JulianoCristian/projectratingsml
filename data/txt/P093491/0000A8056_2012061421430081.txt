                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project would help reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding, through a mix of physical, institutional and financial measures. It will be the second phase of an
                         APL, planned over the next 7 years. While phase 1 of the program develops a risk management program for the City of Buenos Aires, phase 2 develops a risk
                         management program for six provinces complying with the selection criteria, and undertakes preparation of the future operations. The measures will aim at improving
                         the security of economic assets and persons living in flood-prone areas by constructing defense facilities to reduce future losses due to floods, and by strengthening
                         national and provincial institutions and systems for dealing with future floods. These provinces (Chaco, Corrientes, Misiones, Santa Fe, Formosa and Entre Rios), are
                         located along the two main rivers, the Paran? and Paraguay, constituting the Argentinean region most vulnerable to flooding. The provinces have started to develop a
                         risk management strategy under the current Flood Protection Project (4117-AR), and they succeeded in achieving positive results in risk identification and mitigation. In
                         addition, the provinces will build on the achievements and experience from the City of Buenos Aires in phase1.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation is significantly delayed from the Project's early years (due mainly to delays in the effectiveness until 2008 and in the signature of subsidiary loan agreements with
                         provinces). An extension of 18 was approved in March 2011 to enable commencing of planned works and activities. During the last two missions undertaken in late November 2011
                         and April 2012, the Bank team reviewed implementation progress in every participating province.

                         The two infrastructure sub-projects proposed by the province of Santa Fe are delayed in the award phase of the public bidding process, in one of the cases due to a legal action that
                         has put a freeze in the award process. In the Province of Entre Rios, there have been delays in the finalization of technical studies for the works (designs and EIA), meaning that the
                         specific sub-projects proposed by this province have not yet finalized preparation to be advertised for public bidding. The housing project in Resistencia using the self-construction
                         methodology, in the Province of Chaco, was significantly delayed with only 10% execution rate to date, and a new strategy has been designed and approved to complete the project
                         as part of a drainage infrastructure contract.

                         Ongoing urban drainage works in two of the provinces (Corrientes and Chaco) are being executed with overall good implementation progress and quality and are scheduled for
                         completion by June 2012. TORs for three additional municipalities for specific studies related to urban planning, land use regulation and flood risk management have been approved
                         for funding under the institutional strengthening component of the Project.

                         The Project expected to benefit 400,000 people with reduced vulnerability to flooding. With the ongoing works it is estimated that about 195,000 people will benefit (including ongoing
                         works in Corrientes and all works in Resistencia). It is important to conclude planned works in the provinces of Chaco, Santa Fe and Entre Rios to maximize Project impact. In terms
                         of the Project Development Objectives, it is equally important to finalize the non structural measures planned in the different provinces (provide housing in safe areas for those people
                         that may be resettled from flood prone areas; and urban planning, land use regulation and flood risk management studies).
