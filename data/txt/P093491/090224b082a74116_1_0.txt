Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project would help reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding, through a mix of physical, institutional and financial measures. It will be the
 second phase of an APL, planned over the next 7 years. While phase 1 of the program develops a risk management program for the City of Buenos
 Aires, phase 2 develops a risk management program for six provinces complying with the selection criteria, and undertakes preparation of the future
 operations. The measures will aim at improving the security of economic assets and persons living in flood-prone areas by constructing defense
 facilities to reduce future losses due to floods, and by strengthening national and provincial institutions and systems for dealing with future floods.
 These provinces (Chaco, Corrientes, Misiones, Santa Fe, Formosa and Entre Rios), are located along the two main rivers, the Paran? and
 Paraguay, constituting the Argentinean region most vulnerable to flooding. The provinces have started to develop a risk management strategy under
 the current Flood Protection Project (4117-AR), and they succeeded in achieving positive results in risk identification and mitigation. In addition, the
 provinces will build on the achievements and experience from the City of Buenos Aires in phase1.

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 The project closed in December 31st, 2014. The project acheived its objectives. The project has financed structural and non structural measures in the
 provinces of Corrientes, Chaco, Santa Fe and Entre Rios to reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding.
 Most important results included :
 1.       the protection of 445,000 people (exceeding the target of 400.000) and 4.570 ha of land (exceeding the target of 3.124) against flooding. The
          participating provinces have made great progress in implementing non structural measures. Eight municipalities have published ordinances
          with information on risk and land uses (exceeding the target of 5).
 2.       Approximately 3.6 million people are now covered and protected by flood risk contingency plans surpassing the PAD target of 2.5 million.
          Eighteen communication campaigns for municipal stakeholders were carried out. Five monitoring systems of drainage and wastewater effluent
          quality were implemented. And three provinces are now equipped with contingency plans and have carried out simulations.
 3.        The implementation of the resettlement plan in Resistencia has helped 207 families that lived in flood prone areas. Implementation of the
          Resistencia resettlement plan is considered best practice.
 4.       Two videos were prepared by the project to document 20 years of Argentina Flood Risk Mitigation Program http://we.tl/greoWIRy2s
          and Argentina Housing Sub-Programs: http://we.tl/QSSJZFCSdI
 The closing supervision mission took place from December 2 to 3, 2014 and included a project stakeholders workshop.
