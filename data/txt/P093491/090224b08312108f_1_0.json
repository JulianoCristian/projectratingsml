      Lending Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage Project for\n            Argentina were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            programmatic bank engagements in a specific sector and\n            region can lead to substantial and continued gains. The\n            scale of financing and time required to address issues like\n            regional flood management exceeds the capacity of a single\n            project. The context in each province was different, some\n            works in Santa Fe were already completed with Borrower funds\n            due to economic growth, while counterpart funding was not\n            easily available in Entre Rios for the land acquisition.\n            Flexibility in project design to respond to Borrower\n            priorities increases local ownership and allows counterpart\n            institutions to play to their strengths, leading to more\n            effective implementation. The project was unable to\n            replicate its predecessor\u2019s success with self-construction\n            of housing given that the involuntarily resettled persons on\n            average had neither the time nor the incentive to complete\n            construction within the strict timeline required to keep\n            works construction for the project intervention (that\n            required the resettlement) on track."}, "docdt": "2015-08-18T02:28:04Z"}
