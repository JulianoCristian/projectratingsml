Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
(From Loan Agreement) The objective of the Project is to reduce the Participating Provinces'
vulnerability to flooding, through: (a) the strengthening of their flood emergency and risk reduction
capacity; (b) the implementation of a housing program for the benefit of the lowest-income
population living in urban flood-prone areas; and/or (c) the strengthening of flood defenses in
geographic areas with strong economic activity and vulnerability to recurrent flooding. 1

                Revised target 160 % achieved. The 8 municipalities included in this indicator
                (in Santa Fe, Chaco, Corrientes and Entre Rios Provinces) have gained land use
                tools and risk management knowledge through project support, strengthening
Comments        their flood emergency and risk reduction capacity. New or adapted risk
(incl. %        management laws (that serve as land use planning tools) and practices adopted in
achievement) each province during the Project period include a new pluvial risk map for land
                use in Resistencia, Chaco; Both, the directly PIDU-financed province-level
                regional land use law implementation in Santa Fe, and the Land use law under
                development in Corrientes include risk mapping.

 PDO formulation in the PAD Annex 1 is slightly different: Reduce flood vulnerability by introducing a
comprehensive risk management and mitigation program in the Argentine Littoral Provinces. As per the ICR
guidelines, the PDO from the Loan Agreement will be used as a basis for this evaluation.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.        Flooding is the major natural hazard to threaten Argentina, resulting in death tolls, loss of
livelihoods, and large-scale economic impacts. Unsustainable urban planning and territorial management
practices, as well as climate change impacts, have increased exposure of people and assets to floods.
According to the world’s second-largest reinsurer, Swiss-Re, Argentina is among the top ten emerging
economies with the highest flood hazard exposure. Out of the eleven major floods in Argentina since 1957,
at least five have caused direct damage in excess of US$1 billion each: US$1.5 billion in 1983, US$2 billion
in 1985, US$2.5 billion in 1998, US$3.3 billion in 2001, and US$1.2 billion in 2003.

2.       The Parana-Paraguay river basin, where the project was focused, is the country’s most at-risk area
for flooding, socio-economically one of Argentina’s most vulnerable regions, but at the same time home to
some of the country’s most developed agricultural and industrial zones. In 1993, major flooding caused by
the ENOS phenomena led to approximately 100,000 people being evacuated and about 3 million hectares
flooded in the Parana-Paraguay river basin.

3.       Argentina’s flood management approach in the nineties focused mainly on reconstruction of
damaged infrastructure. However, over time and with Bank support, this gradually shifted from pure
recovery/emergency response towards a more integrated flood risk management approach (see Table 1
below). Argentina developed, with the support of the 1993-1998 Flood Rehabilitation Project (PREI), a
Water Basin Management Study2 that generated a flood risk management strategy for the Parana-Paraguay
River Basin covering the seven littoral provinces.3 This strategy was then used to design the activities of
the 1997-2006 Bank-financed Flood Protection Project (PPI). After the PPI’s scope was reduced in the
aftermath of the flood of 1998 and the macroeconomic meltdown of 2001, which slowed project
implementation and redirected funds to health programs, the Argentine government requested a second
stage of the PPI to continue the complex and complicated flood risk management process. The Bank
responded with the preparation of an APL to improve disaster risk management through better urban and
territorial planning, as well as flood mitigation investments to protect households from disaster-induced
poverty.

4.     The APL1 focused on the City of Buenos Aires, while the APL2 (the Project) continued the
implementation of the Parana-Paraguay River Basin strategy.

5.       The APL2 (PIDU by its initials in Spanish) aimed to expand the results of the first loan to a broader
region, building on priority activities identified by the Water Basin Management study developed under the
Bank-financed Flood Rehabilitation Project, PREI (P006051) and the provincial risk management
strategies initiated under the Bank-financed Flood Protection Project, PPI (P006052), which had achieved
positive results in risk identification and mitigation. PIDU’s project approach integrated structural and non-
structural flood management measures, including physical and institutional components.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

6.      Project Development Objective (PDO), Loan Agreement:5 The objective of the Project is to reduce
the Participating Provinces’ vulnerability to flooding, through: (a) the strengthening of their flood
emergency and risk reduction capacity; (b) the implementation of a housing program for the benefit of the
lowest-income population living in urban flood-prone areas; and/or (c) the strengthening of flood defenses
in geographic areas with strong economic activity and vulnerability to recurrent flooding. 6

7.     Key Indicators. (i) The size of the urban area protected by the proposed works in the selected
provinces; and (ii) The number of municipalities for which land use planning includes risk mapping.

  The Project has been evaluated against the PDO version included in the Loan Agreement.
6
  PDO formulation in the PAD Annex 1 is slightly different: Reduce flood vulnerability by introducing a
comprehensive risk management and mitigation program in the Argentine Littoral Provinces. The PDO was not
formally revised, despite issues with inconsistent wordings. Due to Argentina’s political situation, the World Bank
Board did not discuss any Argentina-related projects for a period of 3.5 years between 2011 and 2014 (see Factors
affecting Implementation), during which period no document related to Argentina (including Level 1
Restructurings) was submitted for approval to the Board of Directors.

8.      Key indicators were revised during the March 2011 restructuring, as follows:

           Target value for PDO Indicator No. 1 (Size of area protected by proposed works in selected
            provinces) was updated from 2,630 Ha to 3,099 Ha, based on the revised implementation plan
            and subprojects under execution and preparation;
           PDO Indicator No. 2 was re-worded to include elements that need to be present in a risk
            mapping exercise (Number of Municipalities for which land use planning includes risk
            mapping, including identification, location, quantification and characterization of population)
            and its target value was changed from 13 municipalities to 5 municipalities to reflect the revised
            implementation plan;
           A new PDO indicator No. 3 (Population with reduced flood vulnerability as a result of proposed
            works in participating provinces) was introduced to permit tracking of total project
            beneficiaries.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

9.      The project expected to benefit around 0.3 million people directly, and 2.2 million people indirectly.
The direct beneficiaries, those living in flood prone areas, would experience the most tangible impacts of
structural measures (protection against flooding, thereby limiting asset losses, casualties and negative health
impacts), while the entire population in targeted municipalities would benefit from uninterrupted access to
services and economic activities, as well as the reduction of casualties and losses from the implementation
of non-structural measures.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.     Component 1: Non-structural measures (US$2.773M in Loan resources planned at Appraisal,
US$0.870M disbursed). This component aimed to provide provincial institutions with flood risk
management instruments to assist with the implementation of specific institutional development activities.
The activities would thus benefit the agencies involved in flood emergencies and prevention. To strengthen
these institutions, the proposed activities were accompanied by communication actions, implementation
plans or other institutional actions to involve provincial agencies in the use of the instruments and further
development of these activities. Technical assistance was to be provided to:
         Develop and implement provincial or municipal contingency plans to prepare for emergencies.
             The plans included implementation modalities and proposed simulation exercises involving the
             provincial agencies, municipalities and local communities;
         Propose regulations for the Land Use Laws approved during the previous project. The effects
             of regulations were analyzed and developed with the municipalities, and a communication
             program developed to inform all communities and private sector on the impacts.
         Prepare an environmental program for the municipalities involved, including environmental
             management plans, rapid urban environmental assessments, and solid waste management plans
             (included in the environmental management plan); and
         Develop and disseminate the next steps of flood prevention investments, through regional
             master plans and feasibility studies for future flood risk reduction activities, to ensure that the
             products of non-structural measures were disseminated and implemented through local
             institutions and community-based participation and work with key stakeholders.

11.      Component 2: Emergency social interventions (US$12.50M in Loan resources planned at
Appraisal, US$10.162M disbursed). This component provided housing in safe areas for those families
resettled from areas required for works and for lower income families living in flood prone areas in their

                                                       3
immediate proximity. The housing component originally followed the same principles as in the previous
project, providing funding through vouchers for a program of self-construction of houses by the community.
The self-help and mutual aid housing component had been highly successful in the Flood Protection Project
(PPI) and was considered a valuable alternative housing solution for the population with the lowest income.
Component 2 included, in addition to the purchase of construction material, the training of the selected
beneficiaries in the sector, as well as technical assistance and non-formal environmental education for the
beneficiaries and the municipalities’ representatives.7

12.     Component 3: Development of Key Defense Facilities (US$52.152M in Loan resources planned
at Appraisal, US$54.092M disbursed). This component financed works to protect important urban areas
against flood effects. It consisted of minor rehabilitation of existing schemes and included fortification of
flood defenses in geographic areas with strong economic activity and the greatest vulnerability to serious
repeated flood damage. Works were expected to concentrate on the improvement of existing drainage
channels, the construction of new ones, embankments, raising bridges, small flood control works, and urban
drainage.8

13.     For each work, the implementation units at the provincial level were to prepare an Operation and
Maintenance Plan, providing information on the agency in charge of works maintenance as well as the
financial resources necessary to accomplish this task.

14.     Component 4: Project Implementation and Administration (US$2.391M in Loan resources
planned at Appraisal, US$4.694M disbursed). This component comprised technical assistance to help
implement the project. The implementation units, integrated into existing national and provincial structures,
were divided into province and national-level implementation units, both financed through loan proceeds.9
The implementation units were expected to comprise 8 staff per province and 12 at the central level, to be
financed from the loan proceeds.

1.6 Revised Components

15.     Components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes.

16.     A total of four Project Restructurings were carried out. The Results Framework was changed only
during the second restructuring in March 2011, incorporating relatively minor changes to indicators to better
capture the Project’s results and revising targets to be in line with implementation realities. The details of
each of the restructurings is presented in the Datasheet.




2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes




7
  The self-help and mutual aid housing component had been highly successful in the current Flood Protection Project
(PPI), although did not prove to be so for PIDU (see Section 2.4: Resettlement), so was replaced by contractor-
constructed housing.
8
  Raising of bridges was also planned at appraisal, but not included in interventions actually executed.
9
  By project closing almost all SUEP staff were full-time staff contracted by their respective provinces.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

17.     The project preparation went well and built on the successful experience and achievements of
previous projects. Success factors included: i) the knowledge, tools and capacity developed over the long
term partnership between Argentina and the Bank on flood risk management such as a basin-wide strategy,
regulatory frameworks for risk management, and the skilled professionals involved in the Project’s
administration; ii) strong Borrower ownership of the Project; and iii) the effort put into planning, which
meant that a number of sub-projects were ready for bidding.

18.     The Project design was appropriate. The main characteristics of the project design were: the
combination of structural and non-structural measures, the demand driven approach, a pipeline of sub-
projects ready for implementation, a low risk implementation framework, a clear management framework
and the attention paid to long term sustainability of project results. The Project integrated, based on sector
best practice, selected structural and non-structural measures to improve resilience not only through
physical investments and increased protection levels, but also by moving the region towards a risk
prevention approach.

19.       The subprojects to be implemented were based on each Province’s priorities for flood protection
and management, as expressed in their respective Provincial Master Plans (developed under the Bank
financed Flood Rehabilitation Project, as a result of the Parana-Paraguay basin wide strategy). A large
portion of the subprojects had been identified and evaluated under the previous Flood Protection Project
(PPI).10 As such, selection of subprojects was based on compliance with PPI’s environmental and economic
standards. For those not evaluated under PPI, these criteria were again applied under PIDU. Engineering
designs had already been completed for most subprojects prior to PIDU—the Project document includes a
list of 13 possible works, but states “nevertheless, this list is not final and could be amended to accommodate
cancellations and replacements with new works due to technical or financial issues,” providing the
flexibility that later proved an important factor in the Project’s s uccess. For some subprojects, the Project
aimed to complete and/or complement activities (both structural and non-structural) still pending or needing
to be expanded after previous Bank projects. 11 The type of structural measures to be implemented included
pluvial drainage, floodgates, pumping stations, and fluvial protection projects.

20.     Project introduced Trigger Indicators to reduce implementation risk. Originally the Project
targeted six12 provinces. Prerequisites for each province to achieve prior to initiation of the Project were
set. These triggers were accordingly met prior to effectiveness by four of these: Chaco, Corrientes, Santa
Fe, and Entre Rios. Due mainly to difficulties with the provincial debt limits and adherence to the national
Fiscal Responsibility Law, Misiones did not meet these triggers and dropped out of the Project prior to
effectiveness (Formosa dropped out prior to appraisal as stated in the Project document).

21.      Project management design was based on successful previous projects institutional
arrangements. Project management was integrated into existing public administration structures for flood
risk management, in accordance with the new Bank guidelines for Argentina at the time of Project appraisal.
This structure comprised a national-level Project Management Unit (the UEC, Unidad Ejecutora Central)
and province-level SUEPs (Sub Unidades Ejecutoras Provinciales). Both of these structures were created
in 1993 and were responsible for implementing the Flood Protection Program as well as the El Nino
Emergency Project, accumulating significant experience and human capital in project management and
quality control at both the national and province level. The SUEPs were responsible for the administrative
and operational aspects of the four components (i.e., preparing bidding documents, carrying out the bidding
processes, granting the contracts, concluding contracts, approving payments, and supervising the works and
services they contracted), under the UEC’s supervision. The UEC provided technical support to provinces
in the preparation and assessment of subprojects and non-structural activities, coordinated technical
assistance and training activities for the participating provinces, reviewed on an annual basis, the
participating provinces’ investment programs and budgets to ensure that adequate counterpart funds had
been allocated, and monitored achievement of agreed targets under each component. The UEC also served
as liaison with the Bank, and was responsible for compiling and systematizing centralized information for
the overall PIDU.

22.      Long term sustainability was integrated from the Project design stage. The comprehensive routine
maintenance needed to maintain Project infrastructure was recognized during the Preparation phase. To
ensure the sustainability of the Project infrastructure improvements, each Province was required to develop
infrastructure O&M plans, including at a minimum: i) responsibility for O&M of works; ii) options for
infrastructure-protection management; and iii) performance of annual audits to ensure proper O&M. As the
project largely included incremental improvements or additions to existing flood risk management schemes,
some of the institutions responsible for O&M were already in place, with sufficient capacity to undertake
satisfactory O&M.

2.2 Implementation

23.     The Project implementation period was affected negatively and positively by the following factors,
that explained the very chequered performance of the project as presented in the ISRs.

24.      The 2004 National Fiscal Responsibility Law (Law Nº 25.917, approved August 4, 2004) set debt
limits for each of the Provinces, which eventually prohibited the participation of some provinces that were
near their debt limits and limited the borrowing capacity of others, as all participating provinces were
required to adhere to the Law as a condition of the loan.

25.     The project experienced a 21-month delay in effectiveness. The loan was approved by the Board
on June 6, 2006, but the Project was not declared effective until March 3, 2008. This was largely due to the
process of obtaining a national decree to approve the loan and evaluation of province finances by the
national counterpart: the new national framework required a lengthier process for signature of the subsidiary
loan agreements than previously required. Provincial Laws were necessary, and the subsidiary agreements
needed to be passed by the provincial congresses (which underwent elections for half of their seats, in
keeping with Argentina’s election system, in all four provinces in 2007). Delays continued for several

                                                       6
months after effectiveness due to approval and finalization of subsidiary loan agreements for the provinces.
Recognizing the Government commitment to the Project despite these challenges, the Bank RVP granted
an exceptional extension of the effectiveness deadline.

26.      Change in the Subprojects List. Due to the delay in effectiveness, some priority activities planned
for the project (particularly in Santa Fe) had already been initiated with local government financing (outside
of the Project) by the time implementation began. In the cases of projects planned for the municipalities of
Goya in the province of Corrientes; and Saladillo, in the province of Santa Fe; strong public opposition to
the works as designed led to delays that finally precluded the initiation of the works within the Project
period, this was not foreseen during preparation anc was due mainly to the delays in project effectiveness.13
Additionally, although engineering designs, economic evaluation, and social and environmental analysis
for subprojects had been prepared during PPI, due to the aforementioned delays some of these were out of
date14 by the time implementation started, and had to be redone. In some cases, new substituting works
needed to be identified, checked for eligibility, and assessed.

27.     Proactive Management for Improved Implementation. Delays continued during the
implementation period, with slow disbursements and procurement processes due to difficulties meeting
counterpart financing requirements for works and bottlenecks in resettlement process in Entre Rios and
Chaco. At the time of the Mid-Term Review (November 2011), overall implementation progress was rated
Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU), with 35 percent of loan funds disbursed and 53 percent committed.
However, implementation had already begun to improve after the project restructuring in March 2011,
accelerating contracting and resettlement processes. This was due in part to the Bank team’s proactive
management of counterpart financing challenges and an increase in the percentage of works eligible for
loan financing to 100 percent for some categories during restructuring. Additionally, an action plan agreed
upon with the Borrower at the time of the third restructuring successfully speeded up implementation.

28.      Freezing of Board Action on Argentina. Starting in 2011—near the middle of effective Project
implementation— the Bank’s Board of Directors did not discuss any Argentina-related projects or project
restructurings for a 3-year period (FY12, 13, and 14; the last Board discussion was on April 2011). For
Projects under implementation, like PIDU, this meant that all restructurings had to be kept at Level 2, where
they would not require Board approval (meaning no changes to the PDO could be made).

29.     Changing Country Conditions with Accelerated Economic Growth and Increased Access to Job
Opportunities. The Project’s implementation began during a period of accelerated economic growth in the
country. As such, the country underwent a major change, particularly affecting the designed self-
construction modality of the housing project in Resistencia. The Resettlement Plan in Resistencia as
prepared had been based on a largely unemployed population, but beneficiaries had substantially less time
to dedicate to the construction of the houses, since they could find activities that gave them some income
(although most of them were not formally employed). After a period of lagging behind schedule, several
meetings were carried out including the UEC, SUEP, and Bank teams in Resistencia (with both social and
procurement specialists present), where a new alternative of constructing the houses through a contractor
was defined. This alternative, although faster to implement, required both quick adaptation and intensive
management by all three participating teams—however, challenges that arose (including making a detailed
inventory of all material previously bought, making the contractors responsible for the quality of the houses


13
   In the case of Goya, the works were redesigned during the Project to meet community demands, a process that
caused delays that finally precluded starting the works within the Project lifetime. In Saladillo, after the Bank received
a formal community complaint during the bidding process, the Province decided to halt the project for community
discussions that eventually led to the subproject being dropped from the Project.

   Due to changes in the works areas (new settlements, increase in impermeable surface, etc.).

even though some had already started, and managing this issue with the beneficiaries) were successfully
met and resulted in a model resettlement process (see Safeguards section and Annex 7).

30.      Exchange Rate Changes. The Argentine Peso/US Dollar exchange rate shifted dramatically over
the Project lifetime, from AR$2.9 to 1 US dollar at 2005, to AR$3.05 to the dollar at appraisal, to AR$8.55
at Project closing. As the loan value appreciated significantly over the project term, some provinces came
closer to their respective debt limits than expected, limiting their capacity to take on more debt to execute
planned activities. Additionally, as contracts were signed in pesos and executed during a period of rapid
devaluation of the peso, the value in dollars of some works contracts fell during execution, leading to
unexpected under-commitment of loan resources and some undisbursed funds (1.85 percent of loan amount)
as of Project closing.

31.      Entre Rios Subproject and Drop-out. Entre Rios, one of the original participating provinces in the
project, included a subproject to be financed under the Project—the Arroyo Manzores— that required a
resettlement action plan. The project’s preliminary studies (including an Environmental Impact Analysis,
consultations, and preliminary technical designs) were fully developed under the Project, and a RAP was
approved by the Bank. The RAP required purchase of land by the Province to carry out the resettlement.
The RAP obtained the Bank’s No Objection on June 2012, based on an already-complete cadaster and on-
going communication with beneficiaries. However, the Province had financial difficulties acquiring the
required land, preventing the works from being initiated. Due to the province’s substantial progress on the
RAP, technical designs, and bidding documents, the Bank team continued to wait for the province to finalize
the procurement process for the land. However, as the closing date of the Project approached, the Entre
Rios subproject was finally dropped after the last restructuring. To date, the province is still seeking funds
to finalize the structural works. Planned Loan funds were reallocated: Chaco was allocated an additional
US$10 million and Santa Fe an additional US$3 million, to cover the gap in counterpart financing.15

32.     Delays in Works Execution. Execution of works contracts was generally smooth, although some
works experienced delays due to high river levels after an exceptionally rainy period accompanied by
unusually high levels of the Parana River in 2013 and 2014.16 In particular, a major flood in August 2014
damaged works under construction in Cayasta, in the province of Santa Fe, putting execution behind
schedule and leaving some works unfinished by project closing in December 2014 (although the works
were concluded17 by May 2015). Communication with the local population during the course of execution
was prioritized, with stations set up to receive complaints and numerous information campaigns carried out.

33.      In Virasoro, Corrientes, cost-saving measures proposed by the contractor allowed an expansion of
the works scope to cover more of the municipality than planned. In Resistencia, Chaco all planned works
were completed –despite challenges with the resettlement process– resulting in successful implementation
of a fluvial defense system and substantial progress in terms of pluvial drainage.



15
   At the time of the ICR, the Bank team received complaints from some participating provinces that the UEC would
not provide additional financing (that would have required an amendment to the subsidiary loan agreements) for
prepared works or planning projects.
16
   The last four contracts: (i) the construction of 129 houses as part of a Resettlement Plan, (ii) works on Laguna
Prosperidad second stage, (iii) the construction of Laguna Avalos pumping station in Resistencia, Chaco, and (iv) the
protection works (dredging, excavation of the coastal area, and reinforcement of the existing embankment) for the
archeological site of Cayasta in Santa Fe. http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1597465-la-crecida-del-rio-parana-no-da-

34.      Extensions of Project Term. The Project was extended three times, for a total of four years. These
extensions, which allowed completion of a larger percentage of activities and a higher level of disbursement
of loan funds, were chosen as preferred alternatives to cancelling a portion of the undisbursed funds. Overall,
Project implementation required a much longer period—a total of eight years from signing of the Loan
Agreement—than originally anticipated. In large part, this was due to new bureaucratic approval processes
at the national and provincial levels as required by Government regulations, delays in procurement
processes despite largely competent and experienced procurement staff, lengthy public consultation
processes, and weather-induced delays in works construction. In retrospect, it is doubtful that these delays
could have been substantially mitigated and signals the need for more realistic expectations of long-term
Bank commitment when undertaking major works and resettlement.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

35.     The Project had a well-designed, streamlined Results Framework, with indicators that were simple
to use and measure based on easy-to-gather information. Baselines were available at the start of the project
(although mainly zero as measuring incremental changes). Progress reports were prepared by the UEC and
furnished to the Bank each semester in accordance with Bank requirements. Progress Reports were
compiled by the UEC based on information provided to the UEC by the SUEPs, or gathered directly by the
UEC during supervision visits (generally carried out on a monthly basis). The Results Framework was only
changed once through a restructuring.

36.     At the provincial level, M&E arrangements and prioritization were both relatively weak. The
SUEPs themselves were not familiar with the Results Framework indicators, and did not carry out any
regular or systematic monitoring of project outcomes. Continuing M&E arrangements are limited to some
monitoring of runoff water quality (including definition of responsibilities and costs for the monitoring).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37.      Environmental Safeguards. A full environmental assessment was required at appraisal. The
Project shared the goal (originally stated in the PPI project documents) of minimum interference with
floodplain ecosystem patterns in the construction of flood defense works. Most sub-projects had already
been assessed for environmental impact as part of the PPI, and thus were screened for this minimum impact
criterion—other sub-projects added during the Project also followed this guidance. Thus, no significant
environmental safeguards issues emerged during the course of the Project.

38.     Regional Environmental Management Plan. An updated and enhanced Regional Environmental
Management Plan was prepared, incorporating lessons learned from PPI. The Plan laid out a regional,
multidisciplinary approach for coordinated environmental programs, including flood defenses, improved
site conditions, urban plans, site-specific environmental assessments, education, creation of buffer areas
and parks, and restoration of wetlands/new protected areas.

39.      For works construction, contractors were required to submit project-specific environmental
management plans based on the corresponding Environmental Impact Assessments. The SUEPs supervised
contractors’ compliance with these plans, as well as with the environmental manual for construction, and
the UEC supervised the SUEPs. The quality of the implementation of the environmental management plans
was heterogeneous among the different jurisdictions, with cases of very good performance and other cases
where mitigation and/or environmental risk management measures were only partially implemented (which
led to a final Moderately Satisfactory rating).

40.     Resettlement. The only resettlement finally undertaken was in Resistencia, Chaco, where 207
families (940 inhabitants) were resettled in the Laguna Prosperidad area. There were two reasons for

                                                      9
resettlement: (i) to safely relocate 78 families living in the construction zone for one sub-project, and (ii) to
safely re-house the families living in precarious conditions in the resettlement area. Both groups of families
were also at risk of flooding as their houses were located in low laying areas and near a lake. In 2008, the
communications and consultation process was initiated, whereby stakeholders, social groups, and leaders
were identified and surveys, workshops, and meetings were carried out to inform people about the Project
and the resettlement plan and to gather socio-economic data. The resettlement plan was sensitive to the
existing social networks among beneficiaries and significant efforts were made to place families that knew
each other together in the new neighborhood. Each house was designed to accommodate the size and
composition of the beneficiary family.

41.      The resettlement plan guaranteed regularization of land title, quality of housing construction, and
basic utility service connections. It also included an urban-environmental ‘intervention’ near the lake that
provides a physical barrier to discourage construction of new homes in a flood prone area while
concurrently serving as a recreational area. All of these factors make an important contribution to improving
the social and environmental conditions of the beneficiaries and minimizing the exposure to flood risks.

42.      The resettlement works included 78 partially self-constructed houses completed by a contractor,
129 houses fully built by a contractor, an urban environmental intervention, and installation of a sanitary
sewer system. Vulnerability studies were carried out before works initiation in this area, as well as for other
planned resettlement sites. However, as mentioned earlier, the self-construction methodology adopted
under the previous project was not successful, due to: (i) the previously-mentioned economic growth of the
country, which limited time that beneficiaries could divert from employment towards construction; and (ii)
for the Project, unlike PPI, this method was employed for involuntary resettlement as well, with an impact
on beneficiaries’ commitment to construction (PPI method was used for voluntary resettlement). Progress
was slow as a result, delaying the original works intervention.

43.      Modifications to the Involuntary Resettlement Plans to include construction of houses by a
contractor had to be included in order to conclude resettlement. After these modifications, the Project saw
increased visits by the UEC resettlement specialist to respond to the changed resettlement methodology.
Through strong effort and ownership by the Chaco SUEP, the Project was able to overcome initial
difficulties, and the adapted resettlement plan for Resistencia is considered best practice (See Annex 7).

44.      Fiduciary compliance. Procurement, despite initial delays, was satisfactory overall. The decision
to use standard procurement documents approved by the Bank for all provinces to streamline contracting
processes proved successful. Audits did not find any significant issues impacting the project, although there
were some delays in submission of audit reports to the Bank, causing the Project’s FM rating to be
downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory. These delays were due, however, to issues at the level of the
National General Audit Office, not due to the UEC itself.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

45.     The post-completion operation of the infrastructure constructed under the Project is adequately
addressed, even though O&M capacity may vary by municipality.

46.       O&M Plans for Infrastructure. All participating provinces have developed O&M plans for each
of their respective interventions. For the Chaco pumping stations and control works, a water authority (APA,
Autoridad Provincial del Agua) of sufficient capacity is in charge of O&M, with regular budget allocations
and skilled professionals as required for management. This authority has already managed and operated
previous works in the metropolitan area of Resistencia financed under PPI (which were complemented the
PIDU-financed works). Similarly, although the coastal protection works in Cayastá, Santa Fé will need very
limited O&M, responsibility will reside within the Provincial authority (Direccion Provincial de Obras

                                                       10
Hidraulicas), which is well-equipped in terms of human and financial resources and also responsible for
defense works financed under PPI and by the Province.

47.     In the case of the pluvial drainage systems (in Resistencia, Chaco and Governador Virasoro,
Corrientes), municipalities will be responsible for both O&M and budgeting to ensure continued
maintenance of drainage and defense works. There are some risks in both cases regarding limited municipal
capacity to maintain the works and uncertain prioritization of works upkeep during budgeting. O&M
capacity and prioritization varies by municipality. In Resistencia, Chaco, for example, capacity is much
stronger given its history of major flooding and the size of the city, and previously-financed works have
been well-operated and maintained. O&M is also subject to political risks from administration changes.
O&M and proper use of works has been a focus of communication with the local community, particularly
in the Cayasta works.

48.     Risk Reduction Plans. Each province has separately made strides towards improved risk
management over the course of the Project, building to a significant degree on provincial capacity built
during previous Bank projects. This is demonstrated by new or adapted risk management laws and practices
adopted in each province during the Project period.18

49.     Sustained Institutional Capacity. The Project built on institutional capacity developed through
continuing Bank engagement in flood control in the north of Argentina, strengthening and consolidating
the risk management process. The SUEPS have been contracted as full-time staff for the provincial
governments and capacity built during implementation has been directly absorbed into provincial and
national systems. The APL program overall has also provided provincial governments with information to
support better decision-making on flood risk, enhanced and consolidated by the Project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

50.      Relevance of Objectives. Rating: High. Flood prevention and drainage remain top priorities at the
national and province levels in Argentina, as heavy precipitation and flooding continue to affect the country,
the Parana-Paraguay river basin in particular, on a regular basis. Governments at both the National and
Provincial levels remain committed to promoting the country’s move from a disaster response to a risk
prevention approach. According to the Bank,19 hydro-meteorological hazards represent about 68 percent of
the total hazards affecting the country; flooding is the most important of these, affecting 100 percent of the
provinces and 91.2 percent of the departments or municipalities.

51.      Relevance to Current World Bank CPS. Expanding flood protection is a core program result under
the current Country Partnership Strategy—specifically, the Project falls under Results Area 7 of the current
CPS, “Reducing exposure to extreme flooding in Chaco, Corrientes, and Buenos Aires.” The Project itself
is also directly referenced on several occasions within the 2015-2018 Country Program Strategy. More
broadly, the Project’s results remain highly relevant to the current program of Bank engagement in
Argentina, reflecting a longstanding commitment to improving resilience, with an emphasis on
infrastructure that reduces the hazard for people living in and transiting through flood-prone areas.



18
   These include a new pluvial risk map for land use in Resistencia, Chaco; the directly PIDU-financed provincial
contingency plan in Santa Fe province; and a province-level regional land use law under development in Corrientes.

52.     Relevance of Project Design and Implementation. Rating: Substantial. The Project design was
based on a sound intervention logic in line with the already-proven PREI and PPI projects design. Lessons
learned from earlier efforts were effectively incorporated and as in PPI, the institutional arrangements
provided for under the Project have proven useful, leading to strengthened public agencies and flood risk
management. Additionally, the project design allowed subprojects to be dropped and replaced and thus
gave the Project the flexibility to fulfill its objectives.

53.      During implementation, the project faced challenges including delays, drop-out of subprojects, high
river levels, and inflation; nevertheless, the Bank and Borrower teams remained proactive, adapting to the
changes in the environment to ensure that Project implementation remained relevant and led to successful
achievement of all elements of the Project Development Objective.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

54.      PDO (Loan Agreement): The objective of the Project is to reduce the Participating Provinces’
vulnerability to flooding, through: (a) the strengthening of their flood emergency and risk reduction
capacity; (b) the implementation of a housing program for the benefit of the lowest-income population
living in urban flood-prone areas; and/or (c) the strengthening of flood defenses in geographic areas with
strong economic activity and vulnerability to recurrent flooding.

55.      The project achieved its development objectives. The project successfully reduced the Participating
Provinces vulnerability to flooding. The assessment is made with reference to the level of achievement of
target values for the outcome indicators and to other project impacts directly related to the PDO. All PDO
Results Indicator targets were exceeded, and five out of eight Intermediate Results Indicators were fully
met or exceeded.20 Unmet target intermediate indicators are due to the drop-out of Arroyo Manzores project
(Entre Rios Province) as the Province could not acquire the required land to construct works (see Entre
Rios Subproject and Drop-out).

Reduce the Participating Provinces’ vulnerability to flooding
Rating: Substantial

56.     The project directly contributed to protect 445,000 people (exceeding the target of 400,000) and
4,570 ha of land (exceeding the target of 3,124 ha) against flooding through the construction of pluvial
drainage, pumping stations, and fluvial defense works. It supported a total of eight municipalities with a
population of approximately 3.6 million people in Santa Fe, Chaco, Corrientes and Entre Rios Provinces to
develop land use tools and risk management knowledge to strengthen their flood emergency and risk
reduction capacity.

57.     The population benefiting from reduced flood risk through the development of flood-risk municipal
or provincial contingency plans reached 3,194,000, exceeding the target of 2.5 million established at the
March 2011 Restructuring and far exceeding the original PAD target of 400,000.




20
  The team has decided to evaluate the Project against the March 2011 restructuring results framework given the
relatively early date of this restructuring and the incomplete RF included in the PAD (without baseline or targets for
some indicators). Given various phrasings of the PDO in different documents, the Project has been evaluated against
the version included in the Loan Agreement.

Strengthened flood emergency and risk reduction capacity                         of the participating Provinces.
Rating: Substantial

58.      As a result of the Project supported activities, the institutions, businesses and communities in Chaco,
Corrientes, Entre Rios, and Santa Fe are better prepared for improved urban planning and development and
to prevent, mitigate and respond to flooding. The project supported the development of a series of
significant non-structural measures22 including legal norms for land use planning, land use planning tools,
and contingency plans. Even where the number of municipalities involved or number of plans completed
was lower than expected, indicators still generally exceeded targets for population benefiting from non-
structural measures, as they tended to cover large and densely populated areas.

59.      The participating provinces have made great progress in implementing non-structural measures.
Eight municipalities have published ordinances with information on risk and land uses (exceeding the target
of 5). Approximately 3.6 million people are now covered and protected by flood risk contingency plans,
surpassing the PAD target of 2.5 million. Eighteen communication campaigns for municipal stakeholders
were carried out. Five monitoring systems of drainage and wastewater effluent quality were implemented.
For example, the successful monitoring program for the municipality of Gobernador Virasoro – which is
surrounded by mate and tea-producing fields, and where one of the natural drainage canals ends in a
reservoir for drinking water—is essential to protecting water supply from the risk of contamination. All
three provinces are now equipped with contingency plans (at the province level in Santa Fe, the municipal
level for two municipalities in Corrientes, and for each works subproject in Chaco).

Implementation of housing programs.
Rating: Modest

60.       The resettlement plan in the City of Resistencia benefitted 932 urban poor living in flood-prone
areas. The resettlement plan carried out in Resistencia was of exceptional quality and considered best
practice by the Bank and host to several learning visits for Bank staff. 23 Two hundred and seven low-
income families have been rehoused in a flood-safe zone in the urban area of Resistencia, Chaco. Despite
initial difficulties with the self-construction method, the SUEP and UEC made a strong effort to adapt the
project, resulting in a highly successful intervention. A draft Borrower evaluation of the process, including
a beneficiary survey, showed 54 percent of beneficiaries very satisfied with their new housing, 43 percent
were satisfied, and only three percent were dissatisfied.

61.      A similar resettlement intervention planned for Entre Rios province was substantially developed,
with engineering designs drafted, a resettlement action plan approved by the Bank and a public outreach
program carried out. Unfortunately, the resettlement plan could not be executed due to the province’s
financial difficulties relating to purchase of land in flood-safe areas to undertake the resettlement, 24
resulting in the unmet intermediate target25 for this indicator.

dealing with future floods” included in the final ISR PDO.

   This was prior to the Bank’s adoption of new regulations allowing loan financing for purchase of resettlement areas,
which was adopted too close to the Project closing date to allow Entre Rios to take advantage of the change.

Strengthened flood defenses in geographic areas with strong economic activity and vulnerability to
recurrent flooding
Rating: Substantial

62.     The Project directly protected 445,000 people and 4,570 ha of land against flooding, through the
construction of drainage infrastructure, control works, and pumping stations, including both stand-alone
elements and others to complement existing infrastructure built under the previous PPI project.

63.     The infrastructure works significantly contributed to increasing the system’s capacity to protect the
Greater Resistencia Metropolitan Area, the major economic engine of the province of Chaco, against
flooding. The Project funded the construction of the following flood defense infrastructure for the
metropolitan Area of Resistencia:

                 The second stage of works in Canal Soberania, consisting of a pumping station system of
                  16m3/s of capacity;
                 2,200 m of storm drains in Los Hacheros Street;
                 3,800 m of storm drains in Clayton Street;
                 780 m of a storm drainage canal in Laprida Street;
                 Pumping station for Prosperidad pond of 7.5 m3/s of capacity; and
                 Pumping station for Avalos pond of 19 m3/s of capacity

64.      The project also successfully protected, through fluvial defense works, the city center of Cayasta
as well as the adjacent archeological park, a cultural heritage site and tourist attraction with about 53,000
visitors per year. The archeological park is an economic resource for the province and a UNESCO World
Heritage Site candidate. The archeological park corresponds to the old City of Santa Fe, founded by Garay
in 1573. In March 25, 1957, the ruins of the old City of Santa Fe were declared a "National Historic
Monument", and since 1973 the park is home of the "Museum of Discovery and Population of the La Plata
River" which depends on the Ethnographic Museum of the modern city of Santa Fe.

65.     The Project financed structural works in the city of Gobernador Virasoro thus reducing flooding
through drainage works. The Project also supported the improvement of the sanitary conditions through
the extension of the sanitation network by doubling the number of sanitation connections (benefiting 2,700
new families). Gobernador Virasoro has a population of about 33,000 people, with the highest rates of
population and industrial growth in the province of Corrientes. The city is known as the National Capital
of Mate and it is home to the Model Establishment Las Marias, the main national producer of Yerba Mate.

66.     Figures 1 and 2 below show the outstanding impact of the flood control works financed by the
World Bank PREI and PPI projects and the complementary works executed under the Project in Resistencia.
In 2013, the Parana River level rose 26 to similar levels to those in 1966. The event in 1966 led to a
catastrophic flood leaving 40,000 people affected as shown in Figure 1. The event in 2013 did not cause
any flooding in the center of the City of Resistencia as shown in Figure 2 below.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

67.     The ex-post economic evaluation of a selected group of subprojects yielded a positive economic
internal rate of return of 21.6 percent. An ex-post economic analysis (see Annex 3) was carried out for
four infrastructure investments in Chaco (using the avoided damage cost method), and the subproject in
Cayastá, Santa Fe (which had not been included or evaluated in the PAD). For the subproject in Santa Fe,
the investments were divided into two portions for purposes of the analysis. One portion of the investments
corresponded to the protection of the city of Cayastá where the avoided damage method was used to
estimate the benefits, and the second portion corresponded to the protection of the archeological park where
the travel cost method was used to estimate the benefits. Unfortunately, no ex-ante information was
available for the housing and non-structural measures sub-components to allow for a similar analysis.

68.     The analysis of the selected subprojects covers 66 percent of the total Project costs. The ex-post
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 21.6 percent which compares well with the appraisal
estimate of 29 percent. The ex-post analysis shows a US$87 million net present value (NPV). The slight
decrease of the EIRR is attributable to the differences in subprojects between the PAD’s indicative list and
the actual subprojects constructed under the project (particularly in Santa Fe province), nevertheless the
analysis showed the Project is financially viable

69.      The EIRR of the individual sub-projects ranges from 6.75 percent (for the coastal protection of the
Archeological park in Santa Fe) to 29.7 percent (in the storm drains in Clayton street in the metropolitan
area of Resistencia, Chao). As the subproject in Santa Fe is very different in nature from the other
subprojects, the evaluation was performed using available information in order to assess the “use benefits”
valuating the site visitations. Nevertheless the “non use benefits” are the ones better reflecting the
willingness to pay to preserve a national monument, regardless of visits, and relate to the idea of
bequeathing the site for future generations. Literature27 shows that non-use values are substantial for unique
cultural and heritage sites, suggesting that the EIRR for the subproject is significantly underestimated.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.      Overall Project Outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The project objectives, design and
implementation were and remain highly relevant to the country priorities and the Bank’s assistance strategy.
All objectives have been achieved and most of the outcome targets have been exceeded. Based on the EIRR
the efficiency of the operation is satisfactory. However, some factors negatively impacted the project
overall outcome, including the late drop-out of Arroyo Manzores sub-project in the Entre Rios province,
the implementation delays , and a Moderately Satisfactory safeguards rating at project closing.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

71.     Poverty Impacts. As Argentina’s poor are disproportionately located in flood-prone areas, the
poverty impact of flood defense and resettlement works as well as improved flood management directly
benefits many of the country’s most disadvantaged residents. Additionally, Argentina’s Northern
provinces—where the Phase II APL was carried out—are the country’s poorest, least-developed areas.
Particularly, some of the interventions made under the project, benefited directly poor settlers, such as the
resettlement plan in Resistencia (932 people) and the sewerage connections in Gobernador Virasoro (about
11.000 people)

72.      Gender Impacts. Beneficiary families of resettlement in flood-safe areas in Resistencia, Chaco were
51.43 percent led by female heads of household, although no specific gender impact was planned for the
project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

73.      The Project had a direct focus on strengthened institutional flood risk management under
Component 2, on non-structural improvements (results detailed under Outcomes). Apart from this, the
capacity built by the SUEPs and UEC over a 23-year program of Bank engagement for flood management
in the region is significant. The great majority of SUEP staff are now full-time employees of the respective
provinces, with a corresponding positive impact on institutionalization of risk management and capacity to
develop new projects in the provinces. The SUEPs have become well integrated into the Provincial
government structure in all three provinces, under the Ministry of Housing and Finance in Corrientes, the
provincial water authority (APA) in Chaco, and the Ministry of the Economy in Santa Fe.

74.    Additionally, a capacity-building workshop for SEUPs, to share international experiences and
compare lessons from each project, was carried out in December 2014. As a result of this workshop, Santa
Fe is currently providing technical assistance to the Corrientes province in adopting improved risk
management strategies.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

75.     In Virasoro, Corrientes, the SUEP, the municipality, and Bank/UEC supervision teams worked
together to develop an integrated water management system for the municipality after the potential
problems posed by inadequate solid waste management and sewer systems were identified. The highly
successful result included an innovative cooperative public-private partnership for recycling and solid waste
management and two small sanitary sewer systems in addition to the planned pluvial drainage systems
(which were further improved by the municipality with their own funding).

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

76.      The strength of O&M measures is variable among the provinces and works projects. Risk
management in general is well-institutionalized at the provincial level, and major defense works have
established O&M allocations included in local budgets. For municipally-managed works and non-structural
measures, however, there is no guarantee that the necessary O&M and institutional risk management
improvements will be sustained over time.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77.     Bank preparation successfully incorporated lessons learned from previous Bank interventions in
the sector and region. Additionally, many previously-concluded engineering designs and environmental
assessments were utilized. The use of trigger indicators and prerequisites for effectiveness, as well as
streamlined procurement revision processes, did not prevent delays in effectiveness and implementation
but ultimately proved to be excellent tools for achievement of Project objectives, as major problems with
counterpart financing in Misiones and Formosa were identified early and did not undermine overall project
implementation.

78.    However, some changes in context during implementation (see Implementation), showed that the
Bank team at preparation did not adequately assess the magnitude of the new bureaucratic processes that
came along with a new fiscal Law, and the elections approaching in 2007.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.      Bank supervision proved adaptable to challenges arising during implementation, and proactive
restructuring and project extension allowed for the completion of project activities. In particular, a
significant effort by the supervision team during the resettlement process in Resistencia helped in creating
a best practice. Also, the Bank supervision team supported the client in some environmental decisions such
as water quality monitoring plans that protect water sources for the city of Virasoro, and TORs for solid
waste management strategies that were implemented successfully as well in the province of Corrientes. As
planned, the Bank team communicated closely with the UEC, which was then responsible for regular
supervision and technical assistance to the SUEPs.

80.      However, the Bank did not maintain continuity in the leadership of the project. Frequent changes
in Bank task team management (the project saw seven different TTLs over eight years of implementation)
led to shifts in focus and changes to the activity lists, complicating and delaying Project implementation..
However, given that day-to-day technical assistance and implementation support to the provinces was the
responsibility of the UEC, the provinces were insulated to some degree from the shifts in Bank Project
management.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
  Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.     The Bank’s performance showed continuing commitment to a highly relevant area and a
willingness to adapt based on Borrower priorities and the emerging realities during execution, leading to

                                                    18
overall good performance over the course of the project. However, preparation and particularly supervision
did see some delays, and the numerous TTL shifts show substantial issues with continuity in Bank
management.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
  Rating: Satisfactory

82.      Strong, continued prioritization of the flooding issue by both the national and provincial
Governments during the Project assisted in successful implementation despite delays. Based on said
commitment, the project was granted an unusual extension of the effectiveness deadline by the Bank.
Additionally, the Borrower demonstrated strong ownership of the Project at both the national and provincial
levels, working to adapt the Project’s scope to local and national priorities and integrating activities within
the existing risk management agenda. Along the same lines, with provinces from different political parties,
and openly in opposition to the governing national government, the project continued implementation as
was the case with Santa Fe. The dropout of Misiones was due only to fiscal reasons, and the dropout of the
subproject in Entre Rios was related only to the Province’s lack of capacity for purchasing the land needed
for resettlement. No political interference derailed the project.

83.     Despite a significant delay in project implementation, many of the factors affecting it were beyond
Federal or Provincial Governments reach (elections in 2007, implementation of the 2004 fiscal
responsibility Law). Commitment by national and federal institutions continued to be strong throughout the
implementation period. The greatest concern in terms of Government performance is the uncertainty
regarding commitment by municipal governments going forward —however, while some risk from
administration turnover is inevitable, continued prioritization of the flood issue appears highly likely in
almost all cases.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
  Rating: Satisfactory

84.     Overall, both the UECs and the SUEPs showed strong performance, improving after the Mid-Term
Review despite initial implementation delays. Coordination between the national and local project
management units overall functioned well and smoothly, as did communication between the Bank and UEC
teams. However, apart from a Bank-organized seminar (which has led to continuing cooperation between
the Santa Fe and Corrientes provinces), there was limited cross-support and knowledge-sharing between
provinces.

85.      SUEP Performance. Overall, the level of performance by all three SUEPs was satisfactory, with
all three achieving important results through consistent support and expertise despite implementation
challenges. Although monitoring and evaluation of results indicators by the SUEPs was very weak, frequent
(in general monthly) supervision missions undertaken by the UEC appear to have successfully monitored
implementation of structural works. For the province of Entre Rios, although it did not finally construct the
subproject, the SUEP was able to handle all the processes necessary for the resettlement plan to the
satisfaction of the Bank, including generating links and maintaining the dialogue with beneficiaries,
procuring the necessary studies, managing contracts for said studies.

86.    UEC Performance. As mentioned, supervision and technical support by the UEC was consistent
and generally strong. Technical assistance provided by the UEC to the provinces was geared towards




                                                      19
resettlement and structural works, with limited support for non-structural measures. 28 However, some
provinces highlighted the UEC’s decision not to reallocate remaining funds (after the Entre Rios subproject
was cancelled) for further works/plans with designs already in place, in particular non-structural measures.

     (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
     Rating: Satisfactory

87.      Based on the overall implementation period, the capacity and commitment demonstrated by the
SUEPs and UEC were substantial. The national and provincial governments showed significant
prioritization of flood management, as well as integration of the PIDU project activities and the SUEPs
themselves within the larger government agenda. Implementing agencies showed capacity and adaptability
in interpreting the Project in a local context.

6. Lessons Learned

88.     Programmatic Bank engagements in a specific sector and region can lead to substantial and
continued gains. The scale of financing and time required to address issues like regional flood management
exceeds the capacity of a single project. The Project was a continuation of 23 years of Bank engagement in
the Parana River basin in Argentina on the issue of flood management; and as such able to effectively take
advantage of lessons learned from three previous projects. 29 Continuity of Borrower team staff and
thematic continuity were especially important in ensuring a successful program of engagement . PIDU’s
success was built significantly on human capacity, as well as technical assessments and designs, developed
over the course of Bank engagement. Additionally, the length of the engagement allowed time for the
Borrower to build ownership30 of the risk management process, integrating Bank projects into the larger
government agenda and using Bank financing to complement other projects and activities. Finally, most
of the non-structural measures developed under the project are the result of a continued and long term
engagement on flood risk management in the region. None of the institutional improvements would have
been possible in a four or five year period –the usual lifetime of a Bank loan.

89.      Replicating Best Practice is not always smart – context matters. The project used the same design
as the previous one (PPI). It took into account the new regulatory framework, and considered some
adjustments, but never predicted how quickly Argentina was going to grow and how that would influence
some measures such as the resettlement plan. The context in each province was different, some works in
Santa Fe were already completed with Borrower funds due to this economic growth, while counterpart
funding was not easily available in Entre Rios for the land acquisition. At the same time, with a new fiscal
regulatory framework in place, and the addition of changes in legislators, the change in context was
significant and led to years of delay in effectiveness.

90.     Flexibility in Project design to respond to Borrower priorities increases local ownership and
allows counterpart institutions to play to their strengths, leading to more effective implementation. The
Project focused on a specific, high-demand area for the Borrower and was based on existing Provincial
master plans. By avoiding a “Christmas tree” approach, the Project could focus on the target sector,

Bank-financed PPI project— was already in place.

concentrating efforts on achieving major results and further developing deep technical capacity in one area.
As the implementing agencies were integrated into existing government institutions, these gains translated
directly into improved institutional capacity and ownership. During implementation the subproject list was
adjusted with a continuous focus on the Borrower’s priorities.

91.     Resettlement is a complex business: Self-construction of resettlement housing by beneficiaries is
more successful (i) for voluntary resettlement; (ii) when beneficiaries have sufficient time to devote to
construction; and (iii) when the timeline for construction of works is not dependent on completion of
resettlement. The Project was unable to replicate its predecessor’s success with self-construction of housing
given that the involuntarily resettled persons on average had neither the time nor the incentive to complete
construction within the strict timeline required to keep works construction for the Project intervention (that
required the resettlement) on track.

Cost-benefit assessment: flood protection infrastructure in the Metropolitan area of Resistencia,
Chaco

The ex-post assessment analyzed the following investments in the Metropolitan area of Resistencia

       Storm drainage in Los Hacheros watershed (southern Resistencia)
       Storm drainage Canal in Clayton watershed (Barranqueras)
       Pumping station in Laguna Avalos watershed (northern Resistencia)
       Storm drainage canal Laprida and pumping station in Laguna Prosperidad watershed (eastern
        Resistencia)

Costs

           a. Investments
The Program produced the following financial disbursements (in 2015 U$):


       Storm drainage in Los Hacheros watershed  US$ 2.6 million
       Storm drainage Canal in Clayton watershed  US$ 7,1 million
       Pumping station in Laguna Avalos watershed  US$ 5.5 million
       Storm drainage canal Laprida and pumping station in Laguna Prosperidad watershed  US$ 8.4
        million

For the assessment of benefits and costs we expressed all monetary values in 2004 argentine pesos using
an exchange rate of 2.97 pesos per US dollar.

          b. Maintenance costs
Maintenance and operation costs were assumed as followed:

               Storm drains: 1 percent of total disbursements
               Pumping stations: 5 percent of total disbursement


Benefits
In order to perform this cost-benefit assessment, the benefits estimated during the 2005 ex-ante evaluation
were used. Benefits were approximated by the avoided damages attributed to proposed investments. This
methodology assumes that the monetary benefit can be assessed as the difference of damages between the
scenarios with and without investments. For this purpose the following information was collected:

    a) Number of affected households and individuals, and their socio-economic characteristics.

    b) Damages to dwelling were estimated based on “flood-damage” curves, which relates damages to
         different levels of flooding. For this purpose hydrological models were used to analyze flooding
         under alternative scenarios.
Once the beneficiaries were identified several scenarios were analyzed to identify costs and benefits
associated with alternative investments. In particular, benefits were assessed using market prices for (i) the
situation with and without the proposed investments, and (ii) alternative flooding scenarios.

Cost-benefit assessment
The following table summarizes the cost-benefit assessment of different investments for flood control built
in different parts of Resistencia.

Results show that the internal rate of return for all investments analyzed for the Chaco province is 24.82
percent. The lower internal rate of return is associated with the subproject in Hacheros Watershed (16.89).
Net benefits are positive for all subprojects selected for Chaco at a 10 percent discount rate, suggesting that
investments were financially sound.

Cost-benefit assessment: flood protection infrastructure for Santa Fe la Vieja archeological site

The subproject had an ex-ante Economic Evaluation made in 2007. The economic benefits derived from
the proposed infrastructure, were estimated using widely-used valuation methods. In the case of the
archeological site of Santa Fé La Vieja, the method to assess benefits was the Travel Cost Method. This
method infers people’s willingness to pay to preserve the site based on travel expenditures incurred during
visitations to the site. In the case of the city of Cayastá, economic benefits from flooding defenses were
approximated by the Avoided Damage Method. In particular, damages to dwellings were estimated with
and without the proposed investments. The resulting difference is the avoided cost, i.e. the benefits from
reducing the exposure to flooding risks.

Empirical literature on economic valuation of sites with cultural and heritage relevance usually recommend
using discount rates between 2 percent to 4 percent, especially to value interventions that will provide
intergenerational benefits and that do not crowd-out private investments. Taking into account the different
nature of the sites benefiting from the flood-preventing infrastructure (a historical site and a small town),
in the present evaluation it was decided to split the cost-benefit analysis in two subprojects: the
archeological site in Santa Fé La Vieja and the city of Cayastá.

Costs

             a. Infrastructure investments

Given that for the present financial evaluation we had to apply differential discount rates, it was necessary
to allocate total investments between the two subprojects: the protection of the archeological site in Santa
Fé La Vieja and the city of Cayastá. This was done based on cost shares as projected in the 2007 Economic
Evaluation. That is 31.5 percent of total investments were assigned to flood-prevention infrastructure in the
city of Cayastá (US$ 2.3 million), and the remaining were allocated to protecting the archeological site of
Santa Fé La Vieja (US$ 4.9 million).

            b. Maintenance Costs
Maintenance and operational costs are assumed to be the same as those projected in the 2007 Economic
Evaluation.

                Two percent of total disbursements during the first ten years of the project.
                Four percent of total disbursement in the next years.

Benefits

In the 2007 Evaluation, benefits associated with the protection of the archeological site of Santa Fé La Vieja
were obtained from a Travel Cost type of analysis. This methodology allows inferring the willingness to
pay for preserving the site based on costs incurred during visitations to the site. For the case of flood
defenses in the town of Cayastá, the measure of the benefits was the avoided costs due to building flooding
defenses. These avoided costs focused entirely in potential damages to the housing stock.

             a. Comments on the application of the Travel Cost Method

The application of the Travel Cost Method for valuing a site with such a unique historical and cultural
importance cannot be done only through a Travel Cost type of analysis. The reason is that this method
allows inferring the willingness to pay related to visiting the site. So it only captures the “use value”. In
contrast, “non-use values” tend to be very important for this type of sites. “Non -use values” or “existence
values “ arise when people are willing to pay for preserving a site despite the fact that they do not visit it or
do not plan to visit the site in the near future. The usual reasons behind “non-use values” are the option to
use it in the future or the willing to bequest the site in good conditions for future generations to enjoy. These
types of values are impossible to capture with Travel Cost Methods, and can only be inferred through
Contingent Valuation techniques. For this reason it is likely that the benefits identified in the 2007
Economic Evaluation study were severely underestimated.

The vast majority of valuation exercises of sites with similar historic and cultural characteristics use
hypothetical scenarios based on Contingent Valuation techniques to assess economic benefits. [See Navrud
and Ready (2002), Valuing Cultural Heritage: Applying Environmental Valuation Techniques to Historic
Buildings, Monuments and Artifacts, EFE]

             b. Intangible benefits

In the assessment of potential benefits for the protection of the city of Cayastá, it should also be considered
intangible benefits, such as those associated with the incidence of water-borne diseases, especially the
incidence of diarrhea. Flooding events increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks because water supply
and general sanitary conditions are highly compromised. One possible way to compute those benefits is by
looking at prevention expenditures, for example expenditures in bottled water, and other preemptive

                                                       28
measures. Unfortunately no data was available on such consumptions to improve the estimation of avoided
damages and costs.

In summary, it is reasonable to assume that the benefits used in the present assessment should be taken as
a lower bound of the true benefits related to the flood prevention infrastructure.

Discount rate

Existing empirical studies suggests that for cost-benefit analysis of interventions aiming to preserve sites
with such characteristics, it is proper to discount costs and benefits at rates between two to four percent.
Since the midpoint is three percent, we used this discount rate in the analysis presented below (it was also
used a 6 percent rate in order to compute it with the rest of the subprojects).

This lower discount rate is often justified in terms of intergenerational benefits and also because this type
of investments do not crowd-out private investments. [See Boardman et al. (2006), Cost-Benefit Analysis,
3rd Edition, Chapter 10 “Social Discount Rate”].

Santa Fé La Vieja Archeological Park has such characteristics since it is the first settlement in what now
constitutes the Province of Santa Fé, and is one of the first settlements along Paraná River. It is also very
well preserved. Moreover, the Province has elevated a petition to UNESCO to name the site as a World
Heritage Site. For the infrastructure investments in the town of Cayastá a discount rate of eight percent was
used.

Cost-benefit analysis: Summary of results
The following table presents the ex-post economic assessment of net benefits for investments related to
flood protection of Santa Fé La Vieja Archeological Park and the city of Cayastá. Results show that the
internal rate of return for both subprojects analyzed for the Santa Fe province range 6.75 percent and 9.17
percent. Net benefits are positive for the protection of the Santa Fe La vieja historic landmark at a three and
six percent discount rates, suggesting that investment is financially sound. Similarly, for the protection of
the city of Cayastá the Net present value is positive at eight and six percent discount rates, demonstrating
the economic viability of the subproject.

Annex 7. Resettlement Process for Resistencia, Chaco

Background: The Resettlement plan.
The target population consisted of two groups of people to be resettled into a new neighborhood
called New Don Bosco (yellow blocks in figure 1). The first group was composed by 38 families
that lived in the works site of the drainage pipe Laprida (red line in figure 1) in a neighborhood
called Villa Don Rafael. The second group consisted of 169 families scattered in Laguna
Prosperidad in the Don Bosco neighborhood (near the New Don Bosco, see figures 2 to 6). Both
groups suffered from frequent flooding as well.

Due to delays by the beneficiaries in completing construction of their 207 houses, a firm was
recruited to complete the houses. The recruitment was divided into two contracts. One contract for
the construction of 78 houses (four western blocks of the New Don Bosco neighborhood, see figure
1) and the drainage pipe Laprida; and a second contract for the construction of 129 houses (eastern
blocks of the New Don Bosco neighborhood, see figure 1).

The resettlement plan was sensitive to the existing social networks among beneficiaries and
significant efforts were made to place families that knew each other together in the new
neighborhood. Each house is designed to accommodate the size and composition of the beneficiary
family.

The resettlement plan guarantees regularization of land title, quality of housing construction, and
basic utility services connections. It also includes an urban-environmental ‘intervention’ near the
lake, that provides a physical barrier to discourage construction of new homes in a flood prone
area while concurrently serving as a recreational area (see figure 1). All of these factors make an
important contribution to improving the social and environmental conditions of the beneficiaries
and minimizing the exposure to flood risks.

Description of the beneficiaries
The neighborhood Villa Don Rafael was established in the 1970s. At that time, there was
an informal settlement close to downtown on the land surrounding the lakes “Arguello”
and “Prosperidad”. The area flooded periodically.

In 2008, under the framework of the project financed by the Bank, a communications and
consultation process started, whereby stakeholders, social groups, and leaders were
identified and surveys, workshops, and meetings were carried out to inform people about
the project and the resettlement plan and to gather socio-economic data.

In October 2009, a census to identify the population likely affected by the infrastructure
works was carried out. Some of the most salient features of the people living in Don Rafael
and affected by the infrastructure works were:
     22 out of 38 houses were made from very low quality materials (figure 12), and
       16 were made from bricks and/or concrete.
     33 families had water supply service.
     50% of the families lived in overcrowded conditions.
     Most of the houses had access to informal water and electricity connections and
       there was no access sewerage.

The Don Bosco settlement is the result of the informal occupation process that has been a
constant in the Metropolitan Area of the Greater Resistencia over the last 15 years. The
first houses were established in 2004 (see figures 2 to 6).

In 2006, recognizing the problem, the Province passed the Law for expropriation of the
lands in Don Bosco. In 2008, the first actions under the resettlement plan were carried out,
informing and consulting with the population and collecting socio-economic data. At that
time, the population in Don Bosco expressed their interest and asked to be resettled and to
obtain the tenure of their houses. In 2009, a census was carried out establishing the cutoff
date for potential beneficiaries of the resettlement plan.

                                             45
Some of the main characteristics gathered from the census of the Dom Bosco population
were:
    Only 50 percent of the houses had access to water supply, and this was through
      informal connections.
    Only 40 percent of the houses had access to electricity, and this was through
      informal connections.
    77 percent of the houses were made from low quality materials (figure 12).
    67 percent of the families lived in overcrowded conditions.

The main principles that the New Don Bosco resettlement plan complied with include:
   a. Minimize population displacement.
   b. Restore socio-economic conditions.
   c. Inclusion.
   d. Equity-fairness.
   e. Communication.
   f. Consultation.
   g. Transparency.
   h. Celerity.
   i. Environmental sustainability.

This was achieved through the following programs (more information can be find in the
attached Resettlement Plan)
     Communication Program
     Housing award and asset tenure regularization program.
     House construction program.
     Relocation program.
     Demolition program
     Livelihood reestablishment program
     Monitoring and Evaluation program

The resettlement process
In July 2013, 78 families were resettled to the New Don Bosco neighborhood. The
remaining families were resettled later according to the same process. The Provincial
Project Implementation Team (SUOPE, the local acronym used for the SUEP), composed
of social workers, architects and engineers, accompanied the families through this
resettlement process.

The SUOPE informed the Bank that the resettled population was satisfied with their new
homes, and the new settlement. The SUOPE had a day to day relationship with the New
Don Bosco neighbors through a local office, and had developed an assessment that showed
a high degree (97 percent) of beneficiary satisfaction with their new housing. The local
office helped to manage community inquiries, concerns, claims, and construction issues.

As in any given resettlement process there is a difficult transition during which the
beneficiaries need to adapt to the new environment. In order to minimize the difficulty, the

                                            46
SUOPE continued working with the communities until the Resettlement Plan was finished.
Some of the transition support activities included environmental education, training on
building techniques to support home improvements, and training social development (i.e.
cooperatives, sports clubs). After the conclusion of resettlement, the local office was closed
and replaced by periodic visits. The transition support activities strengthened neighbors
associations, to make sure the new development is well kept, and the new infrastructure
protected from vandalisms and misuse.

The two settlements were different in terms of the socio-economic characteristics, as well
as in terms of the quality and conditions of the previous houses and infrastructure. Don
Bosco was home to a more vulnerable population. The main challenge for the success of
the resettlement was the integration of the two population groups, who converged into the
New Don Bosco neighborhood. The support of the SUOPE staff was important for
maintaining and rebuilding community bonds.

As part of the SUOPE efforts to increase the integration of the population groups living in
Don Bosco, regular workshops were held. During August 2013, four of them were carried
out. During these workshops the resettled population helped identify the main aspects to
be considered in order to have a fully satisfactory implementation of the New Don Bosco
resettlement plan. The population did not raise any objections to the location or quality of
the houses.

The Bank considered the case in Resistencia as a good practice and shared the experience
with other projects. Most resettlements in Argentina are conceived and implemented as
relocation from low quality houses in high risk exposure areas to new housing units in low
risk areas. In the New Don Bosco neighborhood in Resistencia, the resettlement was
conceived and is being implemented as a participatory process that goes far beyond
relocation and new housing.

New Don Bosco included permanent social and technical support from 2008 until the
complete implementation of all the programs of the resettlement plan in 2014. This support
was necessary for achieving:
    The acquisition of a resettlement site close to the original sites, enabling the
       population to keep access to schools, health centers, markets, and other services;
    The regularization of land property status;
    The consensus of diverse community leaders and political groups involved at the
       settlements;
    The integration of two settlements with socio-economic and cultural differences, in
       order to live together within one community;
    The acknowledgement that the construction scheme by the beneficiaries needed to
       change to a contractor construction scheme;
    The management of community expectations and trust throughout the almost six
       years that the process took.
    The community surveillance mechanism that avoided new illegal occupation.
    A coordinated construction-moving-demolishing scheme, avoiding temporal
       shelters, and illegal occupation.
