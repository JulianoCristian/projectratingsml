                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY

1.     This Restructuring Paper reflects the following proposed changes with regards to the
closing date and other features of the Argentina, Urban Flood Prevention and Drainage
APL2 Project, (the Project), Loan 7382 (P093491) requested by the Borrower:

       (i)      Extension of the loan’s closing date for eighteen (18) months from September 30,
                2012 until March 31, 2014 to enable the completion of ongoing contracts and the
                preparation of additional subprojects;
       (ii)     Reallocation of loan proceeds to enable funding for project management at central
                and provincial level.
       (iii)    Change the percentage of expenditures to be financed by the loan for categories 1
                and 2 set in the Loan Agreement to up to 100%.

PROJECT STATUS

2.     The project's development objective is to reduce the Participating Provinces’
vulnerability to flooding, through: (a) the strengthening of their flood emergency and risk
reduction capacity; (b) the implementation of a housing program for the benefit of the lowest-
income population living in urban flood-prone areas; and/or (c) the strengthening of flood
defenses in geographic areas with strong economic activity and vulnerability to recurrent
flooding.

3.      The US$70 million loan was approved on June 6, 2006. The Loan Agreement was signed
on May 8, 2007 and declared effective on March 3, 2008 which amounted to a 21-month delay in
effectiveness. Implementation after effectiveness was affected by delays in the signature of
subsidiary loan agreements and approval by the provinces. A first project restructuring request
was approved in 2009, relating to conditions under which participating Provinces may carry out
the construction of flood-resistant housing in non-flood prone areas. The corresponding
amendment was signed by the Bank on August 6, 2009 and countersigned by the Borrower on
November 26, 2009. A second project restructuring request, which included an 18 month
extension of the closing date, was approved in March 2011 to provide time for execution of the
works.

4.      Since that time the PIU has worked to accelerate implementation and overcome
bottlenecks in each Province. Bidding has begun on several contracts that were previously at a
standstill (Chaco, Sante Fe), consultations have taken place and bidding documents for
resettlement are under preparation (Entre Ríos), and provinces are expanding their activities to
new municipalities and activities (Corrientes). Contracts worth a total of US$32.5 million are
currently in the bidding and contracting process, and implementation progress, commitments and

                                                1
disbursements have all improved in recent months. 38% of the resources have been executed so
far with an additional 7% already committed in active contracts. Another 30% of the resources
are now under contracting and an additional 6% is being tendered. Therefore a total of 78% of
the resources have completed the preparation stage.

5.      Due to the slow disbursements and delays and uncertainties with regard to the finalization
of ongoing procurement processes within the current project time frame, the project’s overall
progress towards achievement of the PDO and overall implementation progress are currently
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU).

6.      The restructuring would provide the opportunity for additional subprojects with high
poverty reduction and urban flood prevention impact to be developed and financed under the
project. The restructuring would contribute to the achievement of the PDO by (i) allowing the
completion of works that will benefit a total of approximately 400,000 inhabitants, an increase of
200.000 beneficiaries, and (ii) increasing the geographical area that will have reduced flood
vulnerability (project activities currently limited to the Provinces of Chaco and Corrientes would
expand to include the completion of structural and non structural measures in the Provinces of
Santa Fe and Entre Rios). The project’s development objectives are believed to be achievable
within the proposed extended timeframe.



PROPOSED CHANGES

7.     Extension of closing date: The closing date for the Project will be extended from
September 30, 2012 until March 30, 2014. This will be the second extension of the Project. As a
previous extension of the closing date for 18 months was granted in March 2011, if this
extension is approved the cumulative Project extension would be 36 months.

8.      Reallocation of funds: The main reason for this change is to allow enough funding for
project management and implementation at a central and provincial level until the closing of the
project.

9.      Percentage of expenditures to be financed by loan 7382: the percentage to be financed by
the Bank loan for Category 1 (Works under Subprojects) will be increased from 72% up to
100%, and in the case of Category 2 (Works and/or construction materials under Part B of the
Project) will be increased from 90% up to 100%. The proposed change will allow for a faster use
of funds as well as the creation a more appealing source of funding for participating Provinces
and Municipalities.

10.    The table below sets forth the Categories of items to be financed out of the proceeds of
the Loan, the re-allocation of the amounts of the Loan to each Category and the percentage of
expenditures for items so to be financed in each Category:

11.     An action plan for the implementation during the extension period has been agreed with
the Borrower. With this plan, it is estimated to accelerate Project implementation and maximize
achievement of Project Development Objective by offering participating provinces a more
attractive financial product, with the increase in the percentage of financing for Categories 1 and
2.

12.    It has been agreed with Government that only contracts for Works under Subprojects
(disbursement Category 1), Works and/or construction materials under Part B of the Project
(disbursement Category 2), and consultants’ services under Parts A, B.1 (c) (ii) and B.2 (c) (ii) of
the Project (disbursement Category 3(c)) that are signed by November 30, 2012 will be
considered for funding under the Project.


13.     For Categories 1, 2 and 3 of the amended disbursement table (paragraph 12 above), in the
case where the expected completion date of a specific contract proposed for funding may fall out
the proposed new Closing Date of March 31 2014, the provinces have expressed their intention
to secure other sources of funding to continue payments and ensure contract completion.

14.      The proposed restructuring involves no other changes in terms of project objectives,
institutional arrangements, disbursement arrangements or procurement. The Loan Agreement
will be amended to reflect the changes proposed in this Restructuring Paper. The Project
Development Objective remains the same and continues to be achievable with the proposed
changes.
