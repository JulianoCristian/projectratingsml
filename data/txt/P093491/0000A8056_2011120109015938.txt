                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project would help reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding, through a mix of physical, institutional and financial measures. It will be the second phase
                         of an APL, planned over the next 7 years. While phase 1 of the program develops a risk management program for the City of Buenos Aires, phase 2 develops a
                         risk management program for six provinces complying with the selection criteria, and undertakes preparation of the future operations. The measures will aim at
                         improving the security of economic assets and persons living in flood-prone areas by constructing defense facilities to reduce future losses due to floods, and
                         by strengthening national and provincial institutions and systems for dealing with future floods. These provinces (Chaco, Corrientes, Misiones, Santa Fe,
                         Formosa and Entre Rios), are located along the two main rivers, the Paran? and Paraguay, constituting the Argentinean region most vulnerable to flooding. The
                         provinces have started to develop a risk management strategy under the current Flood Protection Project (4117-AR), and they succeeded in achieving positive
                         results in risk identification and mitigation. In addition, the provinces will build on the achievements and experience from the City of Buenos Aires in phase1.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Implementation is significantly delayed from the Project's early years (due mainly to delays in the effectiveness until 2008 and in the signature of subsidiary loan agreements with
                         provinces). An extension of 18 was approved in March 2011 to enable commencing of planned works and activities in the provinces of Santa Fe and EntreRios, but delays caused
                         by the need to relaunch the public bidding process in the case of Santa Fe and in the finalization of technical studies for the works (designs and EIA) in the case of Entre Rios have
                         meant that the specific sub-projects proposed by these provinces have not yet started implementation. The housing project in Resistencia, in the Province of Chaco, is also
                         significantly delayed with only 10% execution rate to date. The province of Chaco has requested to increase its subsidiary agreement amount by US$10 million aprox to finance all
                         activities currently under advanced stage of preparation.

                         Ongoing works in two of the provinces (Corrientes and Chaco) are being executed with overall good implementation progress and quality. The sub-project in Corrientes is on track
                         for completion in March 2012 and ongoing works in the Province of Chaco are scheduled for completion in June 2012. TOR for three additional municipalities for specific studies
                         related to urban planning land use regulation and flood risk management have been approved for funding under the institutional strengthening component of the Project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Bank team will be further reviewing overall performance of the Project and its likelihood to achieve its PDO as well as the status of compliance with legal covenants, to establish
                         whether the Project might require a further closing date extension and whether some forms of restructuring might be required during a mid-term review mission scheduled for
                         November 28 - December 1, 2011. This review will include results of field visits to Chaco and Corrientes during October and November 2011. The team will make a recommendation
