                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project would help reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding, through a mix of physical, institutional and financial measures. It will be the second phase of an
                         APL, planned over the next 7 years. While phase 1 of the program develops a risk management program for the City of Buenos Aires, phase 2 develops a risk
                         management program for six provinces complying with the selection criteria, and undertakes preparation of the future operations. The measures will aim at improving
                         the security of economic assets and persons living in flood-prone areas by constructing defense facilities to reduce future losses due to floods, and by strengthening
                         national and provincial institutions and systems for dealing with future floods. These provinces (Chaco, Corrientes, Misiones, Santa Fe, Formosa and Entre Rios), are
                         located along the two main rivers, the Paran? and Paraguay, constituting the Argentinean region most vulnerable to flooding. The provinces have started to develop a
                         risk management strategy under the current Flood Protection Project (4117-AR), and they succeeded in achieving positive results in risk identification and mitigation. In
                         addition, the provinces will build on the achievements and experience from the City of Buenos Aires in phase1.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is financing works and non structural measures in the provinces of Corrientes, Chaco, Santa Fe and Entre Rios to reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding. All work
                         contracts have been signed. Finished works have benefited 207,000 people (52 percent of the goal) and have made possible to protect 3,020 ha of land against flooding (96 percent
                         of the goal). The participating provinces have made great progress in implementing non structural measures. Eight municipalities have published ordinances with information on risk

                         and land uses. Approximately 3.6 million people are now protected by flood risk contingency plans surpassing the PAD target of 2.5 million. Eighteen communication campaigns for
                         municipal stakeholders were carried out. Five monitoring systems of drainage and wastewater effluent quality were implemented. And two provinces are now equipped with
                         contingency plans and have carried out simulations. Finally, the implementation of the resettlement plan in Resistencia has helped resettle 78 families from flood prone areas and will
                         help another 129 families. Implementation of the Resistencia resettlement plan is considered best practice.
