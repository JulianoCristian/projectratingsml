                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project would help reduce vulnerability of Argentina to flooding, through a mix of physical, institutional and financial measures. It will be the second phase of an
                         APL, planned over the next 7 years. While phase 1 of the program develops a risk management program for the City of Buenos Aires, phase 2 develops a risk
                         management program for six provinces complying with the selection criteria, and undertakes preparation of the future operations. The measures will aim at improving
                         the security of economic assets and persons living in flood-prone areas by constructing defense facilities to reduce future losses due to floods, and by strengthening
                         national and provincial institutions and systems for dealing with future floods. These provinces (Chaco, Corrientes, Misiones, Santa Fe, Formosa and Entre Rios), are
                         located along the two main rivers, the Paran? and Paraguay, constituting the Argentinean region most vulnerable to flooding. The provinces have started to develop a
                         risk management strategy under the current Flood Protection Project (4117-AR), and they succeeded in achieving positive results in risk identification and mitigation. In
                         addition, the provinces will build on the achievements and experience from the City of Buenos Aires in phase1.

                         To date, the Project has disbursed 57% of loan proceeds and has committed 98% of resources to fund flood prevention infrastructure sub-projects in three participating provinces
                         (Corrientes, Chaco and Santa Fe). An extension of 18 months was approved in September 2012 to enable the completion of ongoing and recently awarded works contracts and
                         activities. The new Project Closing date is March 2014. Project is making good progress in the implementation of the structural measures. However, the participating provinces need
