The\n            project was implemented by the Borrower, the Tunisian\n            National Ports Authority (OPNT). The Master Plan took into\n            account the fact that changing technology in sea transport\n            in the Mediterranean, particularly the advent of Ro-Ro\n            (i.e., roll-on, roll-off) vessels, could substantially\n            reduce transport costs. The main objectives of the project\n            were, therefore, to enable the country's two major\n            ports, Tunis/La Goulette and Sfax, to cope with changes in\n            shipping technology, while increasing their operational\n            efficiency and cargo-handling capacity. The project\n            encountered lengthy implementation delays, which had only a\n            marginal impact on the achievement of project objectives.\n            Despite these delays and a slowdown in overall general cargo\n            traffic growth during the 1980s, the rapid penetration of\n            this traffic by Ro-Ro technology brought savings in\n            cargo-handling costs, ships' service time, and\n            ships' waiting time. Recent trends and present\n            forecasts in traffic growth do not indicate the need for any\n            major port investments in the foreseeable future. OPNT is\n            institutionally strong in the areas of engineering,\n            financial management, and training. It also has the capacity\n            to evaluate the technical and economic viability of port investments."}, "docdt": "1990-10-10T00:00:00Z"}
