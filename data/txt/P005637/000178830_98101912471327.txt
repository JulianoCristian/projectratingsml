I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
1.01      Tunisia, with an area of 164,150 km2, or about one-quarter of that
of France, is bounded by the Mediterranean on the north and east, by Algeria
on the west and by Libya on the southeast. In mid-1977 its population was
estimated to be about 5.9 million, and it is increasing by about 2.3% per
annum. About half of the population is concentrated in the four northeastern
coastal provinces of Tunis, Sousse, Sfax and Bizerte where population density
approaches 100 per km2, compared with fewer than 20 inhabitants per km2 in
the interior. The southern part of the country is largely infertile desert.
1.02      At independence in 1956, Tunisia inherited a relatively well-
developed transport system which was adequate to support economic development
through the 1960s. However, rapid growth in output and increases in traffic
during the last decade now require that greater emphasis be given to the
transport sector than in previous years.
1.03      The transport system comprises some 17,600 km of classified roads;
2,000 km of standard- and narrow-gauge railways; five major commercial sea-
ports; and five airports, of which three handle international traffic.
1.04      The railways continue to lose traffic to the roads, accounting for
34% of freight traffic other than phosphates and iron ore and 23% of total
passenger traffic in 1976, compared with 46% and 30% in 1967. Total cargo
handled by the five major ports increased from 8.9 million m tons in 1972 to
11.0 million m tons in 1978, or an average annual growth rate of about 4%.
Due mainly to the development of tourism, total air passenger traffic increased
from 840,000 passengers in 1970 to 2,500,000 passengers in 1977, or an average-
annual growth rate of about 29%.
B. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.05      During the Fourth Development Plan (1973-76), some progress was made
in increasing transport capacity through investments in both infrastructure
and equipment. While the existing transport facilities are now generally
adequate in capacity and coverage, the condition of the network needs to be
improved in many areas in order to handle rapidly increasing traffic volumes
and to avoid a major bottleneck to future economic growth. Changes in shipping
technology will require the provision of specialized facilities to ensure ade-
quate port capacity for the next 10/15 years. To meet the increasing demands
of domestic and international air services, new airports have been constructed
at Sfax and Tozeur, and improvements have been made to the Tunis, Djerba and
Sousse airports.



.005     7hSe maini objectives of the Fifth Plan (î977-81) f o- thz trznaqcpc
sector are:
(a)  to provide a more efficient use of the ent§:lg 4zif-S':(UtUz
aps well as maintaining and improvîng it as reureD
(b)  to provlde rural development by increasing and ïmprv:"zcg
feeder roads;
(c) to îmDrove urban transport; and
(d)  to reorganize the regional transport companieso
In orsder to achîeve these objectives, investments of US$.Y,250.O  milllon have
been planned for the sector; during 1977 and 1978 about US$500.0 million uere
spent on approved projects. If the budget allocations for 1979 are added,
almost two-thïrda of the Plan invest.ments will have beea achieved in t&e first
three years of the Fifth Plan.  Maritime investsrn'es account for about 25% of
the total. A lack of guidelines and a well-defined investment proSram for the
transport sector follows from weaknesses in subsectoral plaESnîng and project
preparation, and insufficient overall coordination. The Government is au-are
of the need for a clear transport policy and has engaged consu tanto to
prepare both a subsectoral development plan as well as an overal3. (zansport
coordination study. These studies are now beîng reviewed as part of the
preparation necessary for the Sixth Development Plan U.3286)o
Y.07      The Ministry of Transport and Communications &(TC) ic rasponsible
for the coordination of all modes of transport, the improvenert of transport
regulations and tariffs, the overall development of the transport sector, and
the planning of rail, sea and airport infrastructure. The Minîctry of Planniag
and National Economy (MPE) has broad overali responsibiîlty for transport
development, along with all other sectors.
1.08      The Commission Sectorielle des Transports (CST) is a consultative
body establîshed by the MTC and the MPE.  It consises of representatives o£
the administration, of the various transport agencies, and of userso XtS main
function îs to safeguard user and business interests.
C.  The Ports Subsector (IBRD  ao NOo 14530)
e 0t',    Tunisia's five major commercial ports (Tunis/La GouletteD Sfax,
3izerte, Sousse and Gabes) handled 11.0 million m tons of cargo lan  978, of
whlch 9.3 million m tons or 85% was international traffic.  Coastai traff2 c
am,cunting to 1.6 million m tons consisted mainly of the movement of petroleum
products from Bizerte to Sfax and La Goulette.  Liquid bu'Lk cargo totalled
4.1 million m tons; dry bulk, 4.3 million m tons (inc1uicng grEaîn 978,000 m
tons) and general cargo, 2.6 million m tons.  Elghty-four percent of the
international trade is short-distance traffic wîth Europe ard North Africa,
12% with the Americas and 4% with Asia.



-3-
1.10      There are about 45 fishing harbors scattered along the Tunisian
coast. These are discussed in more detail in Staff Appraisal Report No.
2436a-TUN, on the Second Fisheries Project.
1.11      A. summary of the traffic handled at the five commercial ports
in 1978 follows:
(m tons, millions)
Tunis/
La Goulette   Sfax   Bizerte   Sousse   Gabes   Total
Liquid Bulk              1.0        0.6       2.1        -       0.4      4.1
Dry Bulk                 0.8        2.5       0.3      0.2       0.4      4.2
General Cargo            1.4        0.4       0.3      0.5       0.1      2.7
3.2       3.5       2.7       0.7      0.9    11.0
As will be seen from the above table, about 70% of the general cargo traffic
is handled at the project ports, Tunis/La Goulette and Sfax.  General cargo
handled at Bizerte and Sousse consists mainly of construction materials.
Bizerte and Gabes are essentially geared to bulk traffics--crude oil, refined
products and fertilizer materials.
1.12      Port facilities in Tunisia are owned and operated by the Office des
Ports Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT), with the exception of Gabes, which is being
developed by the MTC and is managed by OPNT on their behalf.
1.13      In 1975 a master plan study of the ports was undertaken by the
French consultants, Bureau Central d'Etudes pour les Equipements d'Outre-Mer
(BCEOM), partly financed from the proceeds of the Second Port Project (Loan
573-TUN) from which the proposed project for expansion of the ports of La
Goulette and Sfax has been developed.
D. Previous Projects
1.14      The Bank has lent a total of US$124.8 million equivalent for eight
transport projects: four for roads, two for ports, one for railways and one
for a pipeline. Seven of these projects have been satisfactorily completed.
The most recent, made in June 1978 for a rural roads project, became effective
on March 30, 1979. The proposed project would be the third in the ports sub-
sector. Annex 1 contains a summary of previous projects.

II. THE PROJECT PORTS
A. General
2.01      The Tunis/La Goulette port complex is Tunisia's main general cargo
port facility; and although it constitutes a single port complex, it is in
fact composed of two distinct parts:
(i)  The Port of Tunis situated at the end of the 10-km long
canal linking La Goulette to Tunis and comprising three
basins.
(ii) The Port of La Goulette comprising a canal basin with
port installations on the north and south banks and an
exterior basin for a fishing port located just inside
the northern breakwater.
2.02      La Goulette (IBRD Map No. 14277) is located on the northern coast
of Tunisia in the Gulf of Tunis and is a modern port which was extended and
improved with Bank assistance in 1965-68 and in 1972-75. In 1978 the average
daily throughputs were 385 m tons for general cargo and 600 m tons for roll-on/
roll-off traffic. Operational improvements currently under way (paras. 2.24,
2.25 and 2.34) are expected to result in daily throughputs for general cargo
and roll-on/roll-off traffic of 410 m tons and 645 m tons, respectively, by
1983. With the new facilities, equipment and training to be provided by the
proposed project, it is forecast that, by 1985, 450 m tons per day will be
achieved for general cargo and 710 m tons per day for roll-on/roll-off traffic.
2.03      Physical constraints at the existing port prevent the provision of
adequate back-up and parking areas for the increasing roll-on/roll-off traffic.
It will, therefore, be necessary to provide specialized facilities for this
traffic at a new site on the south bank of the Tunis/La Goulette Canal.
2.04      Sfax (IBRD Map No. 14034), which is located on the east coast of
Tunisia some 240 km south of Tunis, is next in importance to Tunis/La Goulette
and serves a dry and less-developed area of the country. It is mainly a bulk
cargo port for phosphates and chemical products. Its general cargo berths
are old and handicapped by the lack of back-up areas due to the proximity of
city development, and this necessitates the provision of new facilities on
the south bank of the principal basin.  A new fishing port, currently under
construction to the south of the city, will replace the small fishing port
adjacent to the commercial port. In 1978 the average daily throughput for
general cargo was 395 m tons and, for the reasons stated in para. 2.02 above,
is expected to reach 450 m tons in 1982 and 500 m tons in 1984. The roll-on/
roll-off traffic, which is expected to expand, is forecast to achieve 700 m
tons per day. The higher daily throughputs for general cargo compared with La
Goulette are due to the greater preponderance of homogeneous cargoes at Sfax.



B. Port Facilities
La Goulette
2.05      The approach to the port is through an access channel 6.4 km long,
dredged to a depth of 12 m. The harbor is well protected by breakwaters, and
no interruptions to operations are experienced. The main general cargo
facilities consist of a linear quay of 1,060 m on the north side of the canal
with an alongside depth of 10.5 m. Specialized berthage is available on the
south side of the canal for iron ore, phosphates, petroleum products and bulk
grain; open and covered storage areas are also available. Rail access extends
to the specialized bulk berths only, but road access is adequate for the
general cargo berths. Additional cargo-handling equipment, improved main-
tenance facilities, and specialized facilities (including adequate back-up
areas) will be required to handle the increase in roll-on/roll-off traffic
(para. 2.03).
Tunis
2.06      The general cargo facilities are located at a central basin with 900
m of quay and an alongside depth of 5 m. There is also a quay for mineral
traffic, 600 m long with a depth alongside of 7.5 m; open and covered storage
areas are provided and road and rail facilities are adequate. The port lacks
sufficient back-up areas due to the proximity of the city of Tunis.
Sfax
2.07      The approach to the port is through an access channel 6 km long,
dredged to a depth of 11 m. The harbor is naturally sheltered. There are
specialized berths for handling phosphates, sulphur, salt, edible oil, and
petroleum and chemical products; these facilities have sufficient storage
areas and adequate road and rail access. The general cargo facilities consist
of a linear berth 520 m long, with an alongside depth of 11 m; storage areas
are inadequate and hamper efficient operations. The access road to the
general cargo area is through the city's narrow streets. Adequate back-up
and storage areas for general cargo are therefore required (para. 2.04).
Traffic - La Goulette
2.08      In 1978 the total number of commercial vessels calling at La Goulette
was 1,547, of which 524 were general cargo liners, 289 roll-on/roll-off
vessels, 319 car ferries, 98 cruise ships, and 317 bulk carriers. The general
cargo vessels calling at La Goulette are small, averaging 2,900 dwt and 85 m
in length; this is a feature of Mediterranean general cargo trade. Total
traffic in 1978 was 2.6 m tons, of which 36% was bulk liquid cargo, 31% dry
bulk and 33% general cargo. Roll-on/roll-off traffic is expected to develop
rapidly as more facilities are provided. About 38% of general cargo was
carried in roll-on/roll-off ships and car ferries in 1978. In 1978 the Port
of Tunis handled some 606,000 m tons, of which general cargo totalled 515,000
m tons.



-6-
2.09      Traffic projections have been made in detail up to 1985; general
cargo is expected to increase from 935,000 m tons in 1978 to 1.2 million m
tons in 1985 and 1.6 million m tons by 1990. Further details of traffic
projections are given in Chapter IV and in Project Files.
Traffic - Sfax
2.10      In 1978 the total number of commercial vessels calling at Sfax was
1,392, of which 527 were general cargo liners and 865 were bulk carriers.
The general cargo liners calling at Sfax are similar in size to those call-
ing at La Goulette. Total traffic in 1978 was 3.5 million m tons, of which
15% was bulk liquid cargo, 69% dry bulk and 16% general cargo.
2.11      Traffic projections have been made in detail up to 1985.  Due to
the expected cessation of cement and sugar imports, general cargo is expected
to decline from 558,000 m tons in 1978 to 485,000 m tons in 1985. By 1990,
however, general cargo traffic should have increased to 617,000 m tons, of
which about one-third is expected to be carried in roll-on/roll-off vessels.
Further details of traffic projections are given in Chapter IV and in Project
Files.
C. Port Administration
OPNT (The Borrower)
2.12      The Law No. 65/2 of 1965, as revised in 1972, established OPNT as
an independent public authority. The authority is managed and acts through a
Board (Conseil d'Administration) consisting of twelve members, five of whom
are Government representatives, and seven of whom are port users and repre-
sentatives of related interests; all are appointed by the Minister of Public
Works (MPW) on the recommendation of the interested Government departments and
other agencies. The Board is presided over by a President/ Director General
who is responsible for implementing Board decisions and for the day-to-day
management of OPNT; however, much of the latter has been delegated to the
Assistant Director General.
2.13      In conformity with Government's regulation for controlling national
corporations and agencies, a Technical and a Financial Controller also sit on
the Board, and they are responsible for overseeing technical and financial
matters; they are appointed by the MPW and the MPE, respectively.
2.14      The approval of MPE and MPW is required for:
(a) the revenue and capital budgets;
(b) the personnel establishment, regulations and remuneration;
(c) tariffs;



-7-
(d) long-term loans;
(e) purchase and sale of assets; and
(f) investments in other enterprises related to OPNT activities.
2.15      OPNT is also legally empowered (a) to operate and maintain the
ports of Bizerte (including Menzel-Bourguiba), Tunis/La Goulette, Sousse and
Sfax, and any other port assigned thereto by Government decree; and (b) to
levy dues and charges for the use of the ports and their facilities. OPNT
provides pilotage, towage, navigational aids and railway services and controls
and supervises the quays and harbors, all within the ports' limits which have
been fixed in agreement with the Ministries of Finance and of Public Works.
OPNT has a satisfactory degree of autonomy in both financial and administra-
tive affairs. The legislation is adequate for the purposes of the project and
for lending operations.
2.16      Health and immigration services, police and customs are the respon-
sibility of the appropriate Government departments.
Organization and Management
2.17      OPNT's management structure comprises the President/Director General
and Assistant Director General and five Directors of the following departments:
planning and development, administration, finance, technical, and new works.
At the Port of La Goulette there is a Port Director with six senior managers:
commercial, administrative, operational, accounting, maintenance, and stores.
At Sfax there is a Port Director and Commercial and Accounting Managers,
supported by operational, maintenance and stores, and administrative divi-
sions.
2.18      In general, the organization and management of OPNT has functioned
well. The accounting and financial management is particularly strong, follow-
ing technical assistance and training provided under the two previous port
loans (No. 380-TUN and No. 573-TUN). The Project Performance Audit Report
(PPAR) on the Second Port Project (Loan No. 573-TUN) identified the lack of
improvement in operational efficiency as a major weakness, despite the con-
siderable investment in facilities. The proposed project will address this
problem by providing consulting services to assist in the improvement of
operations and technical assistance to develop and implement training programs
for port personnel (para. 3.31).
D. Operations
General
2.19      The review of cargo-handling operations at the project ports is
limited to general cargo and does not include bulk cargoes, both liquid and
dry, which are handled at specialized facilities at both ports.



2.20      The movement of cargo from and to ships and wîthîn the ports to and
from the transit sheds or open storage areas is done by the cargo-handling
companies who employ the necessary labor. Delivery of cargo already cleared
by the customs is undertaken by OPNT at La Goulette and by the cargo-handling
companies at Sfax.
Cargo-handling Companies
2.21      Although there are several cargo-handling companies operating at the
various Tunisian ports, the Societe Tunisienne d'Acconage et de Manutention
(STAM) is by far the largest and most important. It has a de facto though not
de jure monopoly of cargo handling at La Goulette and is the major operator at
Sfax.
2.22      STAM is a limited company established and operating under the
Tunisian Commercial Code in which the state-owned shipping company, Compagnie
Tunisienne de Navigation (COTUNAV), has a 60% majority shareholding and six
seats out of ten on the Board (Conseil d'Administration): OPNT has no share-
holding or direct representation in STAM.
Operations at La Goulette
2.23      Ships' waiting time does not as yet present a serious problem, but
the cargo congestion on the quays and open storage areas does and affects
cargo throughput (para. 2.02). Until now, OPNT has exerted little effective
control over these operations, mainly due to the lack of experienced super-
visors.
2.24      To help ease the congestion, OPNT is presently constructing two
warehouses away from the operational areas and replacing a transit shed
destroyed by fire.
2.25      Following an initial reorganization of operations by STAM, there
is some improvement in stowing cargo in the sheds and in the open, and a start
has been made to palletize cargoes.
Operations at Sfax
2.26      The problems at Sfax stem from the lack of sufficient back-up areas
behind the commercial quays, and expansion is prevented by the proximity of
the city. However, port operations there are more efficient due to competi-
tion between the cargo-handling companies and to more effective control and
supervision by OPNT.
Labor
2.27      Labor relations in the ports are generally good, though the present
practice whereby the stevedores travel to and from Tunis to La Goulette
shortens the working day there by about two hours. Normally, two 6-hour shifts
are worked from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. and, if required,
a further 6-hour shift from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. may be worked.  There is a labor
surplus in the country and efforts to reduce port labor are resisted.



- 9 -
2.28      There are 850 permanent dockers on the labor register at Tunis/
La Goulette, but around only 500 are present each day. The casual labor force
is about 1,200, of whom about 1,000 attend daily. At Sfax the labor force is
about 300 permanent and 500 casual dockers. The conditions of employment are
fixed by a collective agreement negotiated between the employers and employees.
This agreeaent lasts for three years, and a new agreement is now in course of
negotiation.
2.29      Although the level of skills of the port workers is acceptable, it
will be necessary to institute training programs at all levels to increase
productivity (paras. 2.35 and 3.32).
Cargo-handling Equipment
2.30      OPNT owns quay cranes, mobile cranes and forklift trucks of various
capacities. At La Goulette the cranes are leased to STAM by OPNT, and the
forklift trucks are used by OPNT for the delivery of cargo.
2.31      STAM owns a considerable quantity of cargo-handling and transport
equipment for its operations. Existing equipment is sufficient to handle
present traffic provided (a) it is properly maintained and (b) both OPNT and
STAM implement their programs for replacement of old equipment.
2.32      Repair and maintenance of all cargo-handling equipment is currently
undertaken at STAM's workshops, which are inadequate and poorly equipped;
however, a new maintenance workshop is under construction at La Goulette.
2.33      During negotiations both OPNT and STAM agreed that consultants
should be retained to reorganize the repair and maintenance services for port
equipment, including all equipment and workshops in the proposed project, and
the project includes technical assistance for these services (para. 3.30).
Maintenance and repair of all equipment will be undertaken by STAM to avoid
unnecessary duplication.
Plan of Action
2.34      In order to maintain the momentum generated for improving port
operations, an outline Plan of Action with target dates for implementation has
been prepared and agreed with OPNT and STAM during negotiations.
Training
2.35      Personnel training requirements for OPNT, STAM and other cargo-
handling companies have already been identified; and in order to avoid un-
necessary duplication, OPNT and STAM have prepared their joint proposals
for training and implementation (para. 3.32). The implementation schedule
therefore, which has been agreed with the Bank during negotiations, is
included in the Plan of Action referred to in para. 2.34 above.

E. Finance, Accounting and Audit
General
2.36      OPNT's accounting system, which is in conformity with the Plan
Comptable tunisien which contains specific regulations as to form, is satis-
factory.  Training and advisory services provided under the two earlier loans
(No. 380-TUN and No. 573-TUN) have expanded the management information aspect
of the system. The accounting and statistical systems have been partially
computerized, and further expansion is planned to enable a fully computerized,
comprehensive management information system to be introduced, based on the
recommendations of the Societe Informatique de Gestion et de Mathematiques
Appliquees (SIGMA). As provided by the Loan Agreement 573-TUN, OPNT's assets
have until now been valued at cost, but the revaluation of assets, using the
Wholesale Price Index for Tunisia as a basis to provide adequate data for cost-
related tariffs (para. 5.09), has been agreed by OPNT and the Bank during
negotiations.
2.37      About 26% of OPNT's 1978 revenues were derived from dues on pas-
sengers and goods, 33% from storage, 13% from ships and 26% from renting
equipment, ground and buildings.
2.38      OPNT's annual budget for current and capital expenditures is sub-
mitted to the MPE and the MPW for approval. OPNT's accounts are audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Insurance
2.39      OPNT maintains adequate insurance against insurable port operating
risks consistent with sound business practice.
Tariffs
2.40      Dues are levied on ships for entry, berthing, pilotage and towing
and on goods for wharfage and storage. Other charges cover the use of the
canals between Tunis and La Goulette and between Bizerte and Menzel-Bourguiba;
hire of cranes and other equipment; and supply of fresh water and electricity.
2.41      There have been several studies over the years on the tariff struc-
ture, one of which was financed by the First Port Loan (No. 380-TUN). The most
recent was undertaken by BCEOM, and most of their recommendations for revision
of the structure have been accepted by OPNT and incorporated in a new schedule
of dues and charges. The new tariff, a copy of which is in Project Files, has
been approved by the Government and came into force on July 16, 1979: it will
increase OPNT revenues by about 30% overall in a full year, with specific
increases of 150% on ships' dues and 30% on cargo. It goes some way towards
equating the proportion of revenues obtained from ships and cargo. Assurances
were obtained from OPNT that the rates levied will be reasonably related to the
costs of providing the various services, having particular regard to (a) the
fact that the new facilities being provided under the project will mainly
benefit the shipowners and to (b) storage charges in order to encourage owners
to remove goods more expeditiously and thereby prevent cargo congestion in
operational areas of the ports (paras. 5.02 and 5.09).

III. THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.. The Port Investment Program
3.01      Long-term port planning was undertaken by the Government in 1974
when a master plan study, partially financed by the Bank through Loan 573-TUN,
was prepared by BCEOM (para. 1.13). The Bank has reviewed and agreed the
proposed plan.
3.02      Based on the above study, OPNT retained BCEOM and the Societe
Tunisienne d'Ingenierie (STUDI) (Tunisia) in 1977 to prepare preliminary
engineering for the expansion of the ports of La Goulette and Sfax for the
period 1979-1990 and requested the Bank to appraise these projects to deter-
mine their suitability for Bank financing. The Government has decided to
proceed with the expansion of these ports.
3.03      As the low level of productivity has been a matter of concern, cargo-
handling equipment for La Goulette and Sfax ports and technical assistance to
improve operations have been included in the project.
3.04      A summary of the port investment program, 1979-84, which has been
discussed and agreed with OPNT during negotiations, is given below.

3.05      This investment program includes taxes and import duties as part
of the local cost.  All items in the OPNT program for other projects appear
generally justified.



- 12 -
B.  Timing of the Investment in the Project Ports
3.06      All too often the decision to invest in expansion of port facilities
is taken after problems such as ship-waiting time and port congestion have
already arisen, with consequent cost to the country. At the moment, there is
little ship-waiting time at La Goulette and only minor amounts at Sfax. How-
ever, conservative projections show that in four years' time ships would
experience considerable delay; this the Government and OPNT are determined to
prevent.
C. Project Objectives and Dimensions
General
3.07      Changing technology in sea transport, in the Mediterranean particu-
larly, has enabled total transport costs from origin to destination to be
reduced; in particular, the advent of roll-on/roll-off vessels has had a
significant impact on costs. In the case of La Goulette where back-up areas
on the north side are restricted, the only solution is to move to the south
side of the canal and install roll-on/roll-off berths there. This entails
fairly massive dredging and reclamation, part of which will benefit expansion
of facilities in the future.
Objectives
3.08      The main objectives of the project are therefore (a) to enable the
project ports to cope with the changes in shipping technology and future
traffic, and (b) to increase operational efficiency and capacity at the
project ports.
3.09      The above objectives will be accomplished by providing (a) special-
ized facilities to accommodate roll-on/roll-off vessels; (b) additional port
facilities with appropriate operational and storage areas, transit sheds and
warehouses; (c) additional cargo-handling equipment; and (d) repair and
maintenance facilities. To complement the physical components, the project
also includes the necessary technical assistance to improve operations and to
train port personnel and port workers.
Dimensions
3.10      The scope of the project has been determined separately for each
of the project ports, taking into consideration traffic growth and shipping
patterns.



- 13 -
At La Goulette
3.11      The project is the first major step towards the development of a new
port area on the south bank of the Tunis/La Goulette channel; it is in accord-
ance with the master plan study mentioned in para. 3.01 and will involve, as
its major cost component, deepening and widening the existing Tunis/La Goulette
channel and dredging a new deep-water basin. Land required for the new port
area and for further port expansion will be reclaimed under the project using
part of the dredged material. The project will enable OPNT to further expand
the port, as required, at a relatively low cost and will also make available
an additional area of about 30 ha which could be leased or rented by 1984 for
commercial or industrial uses on a temporary basis.
3.12      Existing port capacity excluding the specialized berths for dry and
liquid bulk cargoes consists of a linear quay of 1,060 m in length, able to
accommodate on an average eight relatively small ships. These facilities are
currently utilized as follows: (a) one berth for car ferries; (b) one berth
for cruise ships, which have berthing priority; (c) one berth for roll-on/
roll-off ships; and (d) five berths for conventional general cargo vessels,
one of which is occupied from time to time by oil tankers supplying fuel to
the adjacent electric power station and another by roll-on/roll-off vessels
using a floating pontoon with limited operational efficiency.
3.13      Tourist traffic to Tunisia has more than doubled during the 1970s,
and in 1978 cruise vessels used about 200 ship-days in the Port of La Goulette.
Assuming that the tourist traffic will continue to grow at about the same pace
in the 1980s, one full berth will be needed for the cruisers by about 1982;
and by about 1991, another berth will be necessary.
3.14      Taking into account the forecast growth in cargo and passenger
traffics and the changes in shipping patterns (paras. 4.09 and 4.11), it is
anticipated that by 1991 berth requirements would be as follows: (a) car
ferries--one berth; (b) cruise ships--two berths; (c) roll-on/roll-off
vessels--five berths; (d) general cargo--six berths.
3.15      With regard to the volume of traffic forecast for 1985, i.e., 1.2
million m tons, the two multipurpose cargo berths at the new site may be
underutilized during the initial years after completion of the project. How-
ever, if construction of these berths were postponed, then retaining dikes
would have to be built to confine the adjacent reclaimed land at an estimated
cost of US$1.0 million, compared with quay wall costs of US$2.8 million. The
net incremental cost of constructing the two berths is therefore only US$1.8
million. The last of these two berths would be required not later than 1991,
and their construction would have to start at least three years earlier.
Their estimated construction costs (including mobilization) in constant price
terms would be about US$4.2 million. A present value analysis, using an
acceptable 10% discount rate, shows that building these berths now would be
more economical than postponing them; this analysis does not include the cost
of dislocation of normal port operations involved in such delayed construction.

At Sfax
3.16      The project is in accordance with the master plan study mentioned
in para. 3.01 and will develop for port use the area at the south and adjacent
to the existing port basin. Further expansion, when required, is provided for
by the long-term port development plan.
3.17      Existing general cargo port capacity consists of 520 m of general
cargo quays; operational capabilities are constrained by inadequate back-up
and storage areas (about 8.7 ha, including 3,500 m2 of sheds). Further expan-
sion of the existing port area is impossible due to the proximity of city
developments.
3.18      The project is dimensioned to cope with forecast traffic and shipping
patterns up to about the year 2000 and includes the provision of one roll-on/
roll-off berth, two general cargo berthe and one shallow-draft berth for harbor
craft and small vessels.
D. Description of the Project
3.19      The project consists of:
(a)  Civil Works
At La Goulette
(i)  dredging of access channel and south port basin to a depth
of 10 m;
(ii)  dredging and reclamation at the new port area to replace soft
layers with suitable material;
(iii)  improving soil conditions at the new port area;
(iv)  constructing about 350 m of quays, and of jetties
capable of handling general cargo liners, roll-on/
roll-off vessels, and container ships;
(v)  constructing about 30,000 m2 of transit and customs' sheds;
(vi)  paving open storage areas and constructing the port access
road;
(vii)  constructing port administration and other ancillary build-
ings;
(viii)  providing port utilities, inter alia, water supply, elec-
tricity, drainage, etc.; and
(ix)  constructing a shallow-water berth and related back-up area
to handle dangerous materials.



- 15 -
At Sfax
(i) constructing quays about 515 m long and 11 m deep, capable of
handling general cargo liners and roll-on/roll-off vessels;
(ii)  constructing the port access road;
(iii)  filling, grading and paving open storage and parking areas;
(iv)  constructing transit and customs' sheds and ancillary build-
ings; and
(v)  providing port utilities, inter alia, water supply, elec-
tricity, drainage, etc.
(b) Equipment and Materials
At La Goulette and Sfax
(i) cargo-handling and workshop equipment; and
(ii) timber for manufacture of about 20,000 pallets.
(c) Technical Assistance
(i)  consulting services for supervision of civil works construc-
tion;
(ii)  consulting services to assist OPNT and STAM to reorganize
repair and maintenance services; and
(iii)  technical assistance to develop and implement training pro-
grams for port workers.
E. Engineering Evaluation
General
3.20      The proposed project was evaluated taking into account the following
general considerations:
(a)  Physical constraints in expanding existing port facilities to
cope with forecast traffic;
(b) Suitability of proposed ports expansion in accordance with types
of cargoes and shipping patterns;
(c) Availability of reserve areas for future expansion;
(d) Road network links;



- 16 -
(e)  Environmental effects, if any, of the project; and
(f)  The selected port layouts and development schemes correspond
to least-cost solutions when compared with alternative schemes
analyzed during the preparation of the master plan studies
(para. 3.01).
Engineering
3.21      Development plans for La Goulette and Sfax ports expansion and final
engineering, prepared by BCEOM and STUDI, are based on the master plan studies
mentioned in para. 3.01.  Each project port was evaluated separately as
follows:                                                                                      s
La Goulette
3.22      The proposed port expansion is located at a new site on the south
bank of the Tunis/La Goulette Canal and is consequently free of any sea-
generated wave action; the site, however, is exposed to winds, but conditions
are not different from those at the present port facilities where wind exposure
is not a problem. Tidal range, being Mediterranean, rarely exceeds 0.60 m.
3.23      Soil Conditions.  Extensive soil investigations proved that natural
soil conditions are not adequate for construction of port facilities; conse-
quently OPNT retained soil consultants, Mecasol, (France) to determine the
means to improve soil conditions; the study's recommendations may be summarized
as follows:
(a)  Zone of new quays:  soft layers (mud) to be partially replaced
with suitable dredged material, imposing an overload and build-
ing in a deep-drain system to accelerate consolidation of deeper
compressible strata.
(b)  Zone to be reclaimed:  Imposing an overload and building a semi-
deep-drain system to accelerate consolidation of shallow com-
pressible layers.
The Bank has reviewed and agrees with the consultants' recommendations.
3.24      Dredging and Reclamation.  A dredging and reclamation program,
directly related to soil improvement, was discussed and agreed by the Bank
with OPNT and included in the bidding documents.
3.25      Engineering Design.  Final design of quay structures was prepared,
taking into consideration improved soil conditions; the selected type of
construction and design criteria were reviewed and agreed by the Bank.
Sfax
3.26      The location selected for port expansion is fully protected by exist-
ing breakwaters; the site exposure to winds is similar to that at existing
port facilities; therefore, prevailing regulations for berthing ships alongside
the new berths will continue to apply.



- 17 -
3.27       Soil Conditions and Engineering Design.  Soil investigations show
that soil conditions are suitable for construction of proposed port facilities.
Selected type of construction and design criteria were reviewed and agreed by
the Bank.
Equipment
3.28       The Bank's proposed list of equipment for project ports is based on
(a) an analysis of port operations of the various types of commodities and
ships that will use the new port facilities and (b) OPNT and STAM programs for
acquisition of cargo-handling equipment.
3.29       The list of required equipment has been discussed and agreed with
OPNT and STAM at negotiations, and it will be revised in agreement with the
Bank, if required by changes in operational techniques. All equipment will be
procured and owned by OPNT who will then lease it as required to the cargo-
handling companies on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. Spare
parts and workshop equipment are also provided for in the project. Materials
for the manufacture of pallets will be procured by OPNT and transferred to
STAM under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank which will ensure full
recovery of the costs involved.
Technical Assistance
3.30       The technical support required for the implementation of the project
is described in para. 3.19(c). An area of particular interest is the improve-
ment of productivity at La Goulette; to improve it, the project includes
consulting services (a) to assist in reorganizing the ports' workshops and
port equipment repair and maintenance services, and (b) to develop and imple-
ment training programs for port workers, either in Tunisia and/or overseas.
3.31       Consultants' terms of reference for item (a) under para. 3.30 have
been discussed and agreed at negotiations, and OPNT and STAM will review, with
the Bank, the consultants' recommendations and the action they propose to take.
3.32       Training requirements for port workers have been discussed and
agreed with the Bank. Implementation of the training program has been dis-
cussed and agreed during negotiations (para. 2.35).
F. Cost Estimates
3.33       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$125.8 million, in-
cluding about US$21.5 million equivalent of local taxes and customs' duties
on imported goods. The foreign exchange component is US$62.8 million, or
about 50% of total cost.
3.34       Cost estimates for civil works at both project ports reflect December
1979 prices and are based on bid prices; bids received under international
competitive bidding (ICB) were publicly opened in June 1979 and are being
evaluated at present. It is estimated that the overall costs would have been



- 18 -
at least 12% higher, but for the extremely low prices quoted for dredging--
US$0.70 per m3, as compared with an expected US$2.00 per m3. Equipment cost
estimates are based on actual prices obtained from foreign manufacturers and
reflect December 1979 prices; 6% is included for spare parts and attachments.
3.35      Distribution of total project cost including taxes is as follows:
(a) civil works: at La Goulette: US$82.2 million, and at Sfax: US$26.7
million; (b) equipment:  at La Goulette:  US$8.2 million, and at Sfax:  US$4.6
million; (c) technical assistance:  US$4.1 million.  A summary of cost esti-
mates is given below:

construction materials and labor and are based on the fact that main works
will be executed by foreign contractors; however, local contractors will
probably participate in the execution of part of the works as subcontractors.
3.37      Estimates for consultants' services are based on manpower require-
ments as follows: (a) supervision of works: 150 man-months of expatriate
experts, 110 man-months of local experts, and 260 man-months of local tech-
nicians; (b) organization of ports' workshops and equipment repair and main-
tenance services: five man-months of expatriate experts; and (c) training
of OPNT and STAM personnel and port workers: 65 man-months of expatriate
experts. Costs per man-month are estimated at US$7,800 for expatriate
experts, US$4,000 for local experts, and US$2,000 for local technicians.
3.38      An analysis of the cost of delays in project execution was con-
ducted, and it shows that a delay of six months would increase the project
costs by about US$5.6 million, and a delay of one year, by about US$11.0
million.
G. Financing Plan
3.39      The proposed Bank loan of US$42.5 million (68% of the foreign
exchange component of the total project) would contribute towards the foreign
exchange cost of the following project elements to the extent stated:
US$ Million
Civil Works at La Goulette                      29.5
Technical Assistance                             2.0

3.41      The Bank loan will be to OPNT on standard Bank terms for a period
of 17 years, including a grace period of 3.5 years. Eighty percent of the
balance of foreign exchange required will be provided under export credits
on the following terms: 12 years including a grace period of 4 years with
k interest at 8.5% per annum for civil works and satisfactory terms for equip-
ment.  It is anticipated that the remaining balance'>,f foreign exchange
requirements (20%) will be obtained from financial credits, failing which the
Government has undertaken to secure the necessary finance.
3.42      It is expected that local currency costs, including taxes and
duties, to the extent stated above (para. 3.40) will be financed from OPNT's
internally generated funds. The OPNT Law of 1965 gives OPNT the power to
secure loans from the Government or other sources on terms and conditions as
may be approved by the Government; satisfactory agreements between OPNT, the
Government and other external sources of finance will be a condition of
effectiveness (para. 5.07). The Government has agreed to guarantee cost
overruns.
H. Project Execution, Supervision and Reporting
3.43      OPNT is competent to execute the project with the support of consul-
tants (a) to monitor project execution in accordance with the program discussed
and agreed with OPNT during negotiations and (b) to supervise construction of
civil works.
3.44      The project implementation schedule is mainly as follows:
A.   Civil Works

The planning allows for a period of about six months for bid evaluation and
award of contracts. The project is expected to be completed by June 1984, and
the loan would be closed on June 30, 1985.



- 21 -
Reporting
3.45      OPNT will submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports which should
include engineering, procurement, progress of construction and of consulting
services, traffic statistics, financial statements and disbursement schedule,
port efficiency indicators, critical path program, and progress of training
implementation. The format has been discussed and agreed with OPNT at nego-
tiations.
Project Completion Report (PCR)
3.46      During project implementation, OPNT will, as agreed during negotia-
tions, generate the information needed for the preparation of the PCR in
cooperation with Bank staff. The PCR should be submitted not later than six
months after the closing date.
I. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.47      Procurement of civil works to be financed by the Bank was carried
out on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines of March 1977.
Contract packages for Bank-financed items were previously discussed and agreed
by the Bank with OPNT during appraisal.
Disbursement
3.48      Disbursements from the loan will be as follows:
Civil works at La Goulette      48% of total expenditures.
Technical assistance            100% of foreign expenditures.
3.49      The schedule of disbursements from the US$42.5 million loan was
discussed and agreed with OPNT at negotiations and is as follows:

J. Environmental Impact
At La Goulette
3.50      The expansion of La Goulette affects the hydraulic patterns of the
south lake of Tunis, for reclaimed land will block an existing connecting
channel that currently allows the flow of water between the Tunis/La Goulette
Canal and a zone of the south lake in which some small fisheries are installed.
To avoid this problem which would endanger the commercial operations of the



- 23 -
fisheries, the project includes dredging another connecting channel to main-
tain the hydraulic communication of the fisheries' basin with the Tunis/La
Goulette channel.
3.51      The provision of new facilities on the south bank of the canal will
enable road traffic destined for the southern regions of Tunisia to avoid the
center of Tunis and thus prevent any further increase in urban traffic conges-
tion from port-generated traffic.
3.52      The operational training program included in the project should
cover pollution prevention, and consequently it should facilitate efforts to
reduce pollution of the port area.
At Sfax
3.53      As at La Goulette, any further increase in urban traffic will be
avoided since part of the port-generated traffic will not pass through the
city center.
K. Impact on Employment
3.54      The project will have a favorable impact on employment for the
following reasons: (a) construction works at the project ports will generate
a temporary demand for skilled and unskilled labor for three or four years;
(b) training of port workers will improve their skills; and (c) palletization
of cargo, which includes the manufacture, repair and maintenance of pallets,
will provide alternative employment for workers displaced by changes in
operational techniques.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01      The project now proposed is mainly designed to meet the changes in
shipping techniques, to avoid costly ship-waiting time and to improve produc-
tivity. That the project is justified is borne out by the satisfactory
economic rates of return for each of the project ports.

B. Traffic Analysis
Tunis/La Goulette
Present Traffic
4.02      The Tunis/La Goulette port complex handled 3.2 million m tons of
traffic in 1978, including 1.6 million m tons through the specialized bulk
cargo facilities at La Goulette and 1.6 million m tons via general cargo
berths (La Goulette, 1.0 million m tons and Tunis, 600,000 m tons).
4.03      According to a recent survey, 90% of the Tunis/La Goulette general
cargo imports and 83% of general cargo exports are with Europe. Most of this
traffic is shipped through Europe's Mediterranean seaports. Within Tunisia,
inland origin and distribution of the ports' general cargo include all regions
of the country either directly or through the distribution centers located
throughout the greater Tunis metropolitan area.
4.04      Of the one million tons of general cargo handled at La Goulette in
1978, approximately one-third were homogeneous-type products--such as cement,
steel, timber and sugar--carried in conventional break-bulk vessels. The
rest, consisting of many semi-finished and finished manufactured products,
was carried in part by conventional and in part by roll-on/roll-off vessels,
including car ferries. Only conventional vessels, including small bulk
carriers, call at the Port of Tunis; in 1978 nearly 100,000 m tons of its
600,000 m tons were classified as bulk cargo.
4.05      The conversion of general cargo shipments from conventional to roll-
on/roll-off vessels is a recent, rapidly growing phenomenon.  At La Goulette,
the volume of general cargo shipped in roll-on/roll-off vessels rose to 35% of
the total in less than five years. Because of its high throughput, roll-on/
roll-off traffic permits more efficient utilization of berth facilities.
4.06      The western end of the general cargo quay at La Goulette is used
by cruise ships and passenger car ferries. The expected growth of this
segment of port traffic will reduce berthing and storage facilities available
for general cargo traffic.
4.07      The growth of general cargo traffic through the project port, from
793,000 m tons in 1973 to 1,450,000 m tons in 1978, was mainly due to the
construction sector imports which rose from 98,000 m tons to 531,000 m tons
during that period, or 42% per annum. Other general cargo rose more slowly,
averaging some 5.8% annually.
Traffic Projections
4.08      Port traffic projections have been prepared to estimate the future
demand for general cargo and roll-on/roll-off facilities at the Port of La
Goulette. These projections have been arrived at in three consecutive
analyses: (1) traffic forecasts for the Tunis/La Goulette port complex, (2)



- 25 -
estimates of cargo likely to use the Port of La Goulette, and (3) estimates
of cargo expected to move in roll-on/roll-off, car ferries and conventional
vessels.
4.09      A de,ailed analysis of the major imports and exports up to 1985 was
undertaken by OPNT; for the remainder, imports were estimated to grow at about
5% per annum and exports at about 9% per annum. These forecasts have been
reviewed by the Bank and accepted as reasonable. Traffic growth after 1985
is related to macro-economic growth parameters and averages just under 6% per
annum. The forecasts take into account the Bank's latest economic review,
the European Economic Community (EEC) policies for agricultural and industrial
imports and the Tunisian Government's import substitution program (specifi-
cally, cement and sugar imports will end). The results of these forecasts are
summarized below for selected years:

4.10      The basis for interport allocation of general cargo is the actual
disbribution recorded in 1978. General cargo projections are allocated'
between the two ports based on anticipated port user preferences. However,
if the project is not implemented and La Goulette becomes congested, other
ports including the old port of Tunis would be expected to handle part of
La Goulette's general cargo. Cargo diversion from La Goulette to Tunis and
other ports is estimated and evaluated in paras. 4.30 and 4.31.



- 26 -
4.11      Roll-on/roll-off traffic is likely to be limited by cargo character-
istics, geographical origin and destination of port traffic and availability
of roll-on/roll-off facilities in the ports of Tunisia's trading partners.
This appraisal assumes that most of the traffic with continental Western
Europe which is capable of being carried in roll-on/roll-off vessels (70% of
total general cargo traffic) will eventually divert to roll-on/roll-off
vessels as facilities become available. Projections for La Goulette for
roll-on/roll-off traffic and other cargo which will continue to use conven-
tional vessels and car ferries are as follows:

Sfax
Present Traffic
4.12      After Tunis/La Goulette, Sfax is the second largest general cargo
port in Tunisia. Located 240 km south of Tunis, the port is a gateway to
Tunisia's southern region. The port handles mineral and agricultural exports
and, jointly with Tunis/La Goulette, seaborne imports for the southern
provinces. The primary economic activity in the South consists of olive and
almond cultivation, fishing, and phosphate and salt exploitation. Oil and gas
deposits have been found and exploration begun some 100 km offshore from Sfax.
The secondary sector is dominated, on the one hand by well-established artisan
and small industries, and on the other, by heavy chemical industries. There
is little or no manufacturing industry.
4.13      In 1978 port traffic totalled 3.5 million m tons.  Bulk exports
(phosphates and salt) and imports (petroleum and sulphur) accounted for 2.9
million m tons. General cargo shipments of 558,000 m tons consisted of
340,000 m tons of largely homogeneous goods such as cement, steel, timber,
sugar and cereals; 171,000 m tons of miscellaneous break-bulk cargo; and
47,000 m tons of olive oil exported both in homogeneous (liquid) and break-
bulk form.



- 27 -
4.14      All bulk commodities are shipped over specialized facilities adjoin-
ing the general cargo quay. Due to the lack of berthing and storage facili-
ties in the general cargo port area, some break-bulk imports consigned to the
mining and chemical companies are unloaded at their bulk cargo berths. A
portion of the general cargo quay is used as a supply depot and home port for
vessels supporting offshore oil exploration activities.
Traffic Projections
4.15      Traffic projections for Sfax have been prepared on the same basis
as for La Goulette (para. 4.09) and take into account other events directly
affecting economic and port activities in the region:
(a) the proposed construction of an Algerian gas pipeline;
(b) offshore oil and gas exploration; and
(c)  the completion of industrial estates.
4.16      According to OPNT, roll-on/roll-off vessels carried 27,000 m tons,
or 4.8%, of general cargo at Sfax in 1978. This is despite the fact that the
port has no roll-on/roll-off berths and very limited storage and parking
facilities. Taking account of physical characteristics and geographic distri-
bution of Sfax's seaborne commerce, it is estimated that nearly one-third or
158,000 m tons of general cargo will be carried by roll-on/roll-off vessels in
1985.

/a   Detailed commodity analysis not available after 1985.
4.18       The above figures reflect (a) the cessation of sugar and cement
imports for the reasons stated in para. 4.09 and (b) a decline in cereal
imports; these were high in 1977 and 1978 because of a drought which resulted
in the diversion of grain ships from La Goulette where the silos were full and
were being used for storage of grain.
C. Project Benefits
General
4.19      The method used in estimating project benefits has been to compare
the "with project" and "without project" situations and to estimate the
difference in economic costs. This analysis has been done separately for La
Goulette and Sfax.



- 29 -
4.20      At La Goulette, with or without the project, the increasing passenger
traffic (car ferries and cruise ships) will utilize more of the existing
capacity of eight berths, taking about one and one-half berths in 1978, two
full berths by 1982, and gradually increasing to three full berths by 1992,
thus leaving less capacity to handle growing general cargo traffic. The main
feature of the "without project" situation at La Goulette would be that the
conversion to the faster and more operationally efficient roll-on/roll-off
traffic would have to be frozen at a level of about 500,000 m tons, in view of
the physical limitations at the existing berths. The remaining part of the
growing general cargo traffic would be handled as break-bulk cargo, resulting
in more ship-time for cargo-handling, higher berth utilization levels and
consequently longer ship-waiting lines. The expected diversion of part of the
existing port capacity to passenger traffic would further aggravate congestion
and waiting costs. In the "with project" situation, there would be no physical
constraints, and the conversion to roll-on/roll-off traffic would be achieved
to the maximum extent (about 1 million m tons by 1990 and 1.7 million m tons
by the year 2000). The analysis presented below attempts to identify and
estimate the various costs and benefits related to the two situations.
4.21      At Sfax, the shortage of general cargo berthing and back-up storage
areas is so acute that efficient operations are hindered, and there is no
capacity for further increases in general cargo traffic or for handling the
expected switch to roll-on/roll-off traffic. Without the project, these
conditions would generate further congestion.
Sources and Assessment of Benefits
4.22      Quantifiable benefits attributed to the project, scheduled to become
fully operational in July 1983 at Sfax and July 1984 at La Goulette, consist
of:
(a) lower cargo-handling costs;
(b) reduced ship-service time;
(c) reduced ship-waiting time;
(d) avoidance of diversion costs, arising from re-routing
cargo through alternative ports; and
(e)  value of reclaimed land.
(a)  Lower cargo-handling costs
4.23      Information on actual cargo-handling rates and costs for conven-
tional and roll-on/roll-off vessels, provided by STAM, has been revised to
reflect operational improvements already being effected. Cargo-handling rates
and costs have been weighted to allow for a changing mix of commodities and of
conventional and roll-on/roll-off traffic moving through the port.



- 30 -
4.24      Through the training of port workers in modern cargo-handling
methods and the provision of more storage and handling areas and newer equip-
ment, the project will improve the efficiency of the shore-handling operations
and will consequently generate some savings.
4.25      The resulting savings at La Goulette are estimated at about
US$197,000 in the first full year of operation (1984), rising to US$300,000
in 1992; and at Sfax, about US$100,000 in 1984, rising to US$136,000 in 1992.
(See Tables 1 and 2 following para. 4.34.)
(b) Reduced ship-service time (alongside berths)
4.26      A crucial element of cost in ocean transportation is the time spent
by ships in port in loading and discharging cargo (service-time) and in wait-
ing for berths. The proposed project will reduce both of these, thereby pro-
ducing valuable savings in ship-time costs which will be ultimately reflected
in the ocean freight charges paid by the country. The reduced service-time
would result from (a) increased productivity in ship-servicing operations
(whether general cargo or roll-on/roll-off traffic), arising from improved
operational methods and new equipment and (b) the larger share of the traffic
carried in roll-on/roll-off ships with higher throughputs. It is assumed that
at La Goulette the present throughput of about 410 m tons per ship-day for
general cargo and about 650 m tons per ship-day for roll-on/roll-o-ff traffic
would be maintained up to 1983; and then, with the introduction of the new
facilities, would improve by a minimum of 10% in 1985. At Sfax, the present
productivity of 400 m tons per ship-day for general cargo is expected to be
maintained until about 1982 and then would improve by about 10% in 1984 with
the introduction of the new facilities. Roll-on/roll-off traffic throughputs
are estimated to be around 700 m tons per ship-day in 1984. Details of
estimated ship-service-time savings are presented in Tables 1 and 2 after
para. 4.34; the figures presented show only 90% of the global savings from
this source, the share of benefits assumed accruing to Tunisia.
4.27      In quantifying the value of ship-time savings in ports (both for
service-time and waiting-time) costs of US$3,900 per ship-day for general
cargo vessels and US$5,600 per ship-day for roll-on/roll-off vessels have been
used. These values have been weighted to allow for a changing mix of conven-
tional and roll-on/roll-off vessels using the ports from year to year.
(c) Reduced ship-waiting time (awaiting berths)
4.28      Without the project, the expected general cargo traffic growth; the
physical constraints in increasing conversion of part of this traffic to
roll-on/roll-off; and, at La Goulette, the increasing utilization of berths by
car-ferry and cruise ship traffic all would contribute to longer service-time,
reduced berth capacity, higher berth-occupancy and consequently longer ship-
waiting lines. With the project, the above constraints would be removed, and
additional port capacity would be provided, thus reducing berth-occupancy and
the related ship-waiting time. Savings in ship-waiting time have been taken
as project benefits; however, when ship-waiting costs reach a certain level,
it would be more economical to divert the additional traffic to other ports.



- 31 -
Ship-waiting-time savings have therefore been frozen at the level reached at
the cutoff point which comes in the year 1989 at La Goulette and in 1993 at
Sfax.
4.29      The costs for the diverted traffic are discussed in para. 4.30
below. Estimated savings from reduced waiting-time of ships accruing to
Tunisia (assumed as 90% of global benefits) are shown in Tables 1 and 2
following para. 4.34.
(d) Avoidance of traffic diversion
4.30      As discussed in the foregoing paragraph, when the average cost of
ship-waiting exceeds the cost of ship-diversion to other ports including
inland transport for the cargo, such diversion of additional traffic to nearby
ports becomes more economical.
4.31      At La Goulette, for example, estimated ship-waiting cost without
the project would be about US$10.0 per ton in 1988 and about US$32.0 in 1989,
whereas the cost of diversion to other ports and additional land transport
cost for the cargo would be about US$16.0 per ton. Therefore, it is less
costly to divert part of the traffic from sometime in 1989, when waiting costs
exceed US$16.0 on a per ton of cargo basis. At Sfax, such diversion becomes
economical from 1994. The resulting avoided diversion costs are shown in
Tables 1 and 2 following para. 4.34.
(e) Value of reclaimed land
4.32      Apart from the land to be reclaimed under the project for immediate
port use, about 30 ha of additional land adjacent to the Port of La Goulette
will also be reclaimed as part of the dredging works, and will be available
for industrial or commercial uses at the end of 1983. This land, because of
its prime location, will constitute a valuable new asset created by the
project; ruling market prices for such undeveloped land in the La Goulette
area are about US$50 per m2; for the present analysis, a conservative value of
US$25 per m2 has been used, giving an amount of US$7.5 million which has been
taken as a one-time benefit from the project at La Goulette in the year
1984.
Summary - Benefits Streams
4.33      Tables 1 and 2 that follow on pages 34 and 35 present a summary of
the benefits streams, for each port, arising from the project, as described in
the foregoing paragraphs. The following points should be highlighted:
(a)  The economic evaluation covers a twenty-five-year period
for project life, coinciding with the expected useful life
of civil works, a major component of the project. The
project benefits are assumed to accrue from mid-1983 at Sfax
and from mid-1984 at La Goulette, except for reclaimed land
at La Goulette (para. 4.32).



- 32 -
(b)  Economic benefits, other than diversion-cost savings,
are held constant at the level attained in 1988 at
La Goulette and in 1993 at Sfax, when these respective
ports would, without the project, reach high levels of
congestion, and it would become more economical to divert
additional traffic to other ports. All project benefits
are held constant after 1999 at La Goulette and 2005 at
Sfax, when the expanded ports would be fully utilized.
(c)  All project benefits from the savings in cargo-handling,
avoided diversion costs, and the value of the additional
land accrue directly to Tunisia.  However, part of the
benefits from ship-time savings accrue first to foreign
shipowners and have to be passed on to Tunisia, since
ship-waiting in any country's port is ultimately paid by the
country concerned either as demurrage charges (in the case
of charter ships) or as congestion surcharges (in the case
of liner ships); any savings in reducing such waiting costs
would accrue in full to the country. As regards service-
time benefits which in the present case are only a small
amount compared with waiting-time savings, such passing on
is uncertain. However, in the case of Tunisia, many factors
would favor an almost full transfer of such benefits:
(i) The Tunisian national shipping company, Compagnie
Tunisienne de Navigation (COTUNAV), has about a 30%
share of the liner traffic and therefore has a
considerable role in fixing liner freight rates.
(ii) Unlike other liner traffic where the freight
rates are not sensitive to conditions in any
particular port because of the several ports in a
common freight range, the general cargo traffic
between Tunisian and European ports (which accounts
for most of the traffic--90% of imports and 83% of
exports) is carried primarily by shuttle services
between these ports. Therefore, changes in port
conditions have a greater impact on freight rates;
moreover, the projected growth of Tunisian national
shipping lines will further strengthen Tunisia's
bargaining power in this matter.
(iii)  Finally, it is expected that OPNT's tariff policy
will be restructured to help recover some of the
benefits accruing to ships due to the project
(para. 5.02). On these grounds, it would be
reasonable to expect a full transfer of the ship-
time savings to Tunisia; however, as a conservative
assumption, only 90% of the total global benefits
are assumed to accrue to Tunisia.

D. Economic Costs of the Project
4.34      The estimated financial cost of the project was adjusted for
economic evaluation by excluding taxes (import and local) and price con-
tingencies, as follows:
Total Financial                      Price           Economic
Cost            Taxes       Contingencies         Costs

The economic costs include physical contingencies. The time-phasing of the
investment used in the economic analyses is in accordance with the expected
physical completion of the project. Periodic replacement costs for the
equipment procured under the project have been introduced into the project
cost stream. These costs are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below:

E. Economic Return and Sensitivity Analyses
4.35      The economic rate of return (ERR) on the project--at La Goulette,
16.5% and 16.5% at Sfax--indicates that the project is economically justified
and eligible for Bank financing. Sensitivity of the ERR has been tested for
higher project costs and lower benefits. Lower benefits are likely if traffic
grows at less than the projected rates, which are conservative. Materially
higher project costs are unlikely since these are based on bids received for
civil works which form the major part of the project. Results of the sensi-
tivity analyses summarized below indicate that the project is economically
viable even under these conditions.
La Goulette      Sfax
(a)  Basic rate of return                       16.5         16.5
(b)  Project cost increase (10%)                15.5         15.5
(c)  Reduction in project benefits (10%)        15.4         15.4
(d)  Combination of (b) and (c)                 14.4         14.4
4.36      An analysis of the impact of delaying the project at La Goulette by
one to three years was made; the results show that with a delay of three years,
the ERR and the net present value are 15.3% and US$15.3 million, respectively,
compared with 16.5% and US$26.4 million if the project started in 1980. This
is partly due to: (a) lower than normal dredging costs included in bids
received as a result of the current market situation in the Middle East,
whereby dredging capacity is in surplus: the cost would be at least US$6
million more (at current prices) if the project were delayed and (b) the delay
in starting the project would correspondingly delay the generation of benefits,
since most of these, by their nature, are related to the project development
and need a build-up period after the project is under way.
4.37      The dimensions of the project were also examined, particularly
whether two of the six new berths at La Goulette should be built now or later;
the analysis showed that it would be more economical to build them now (para.
3.15).
4.38      The project is generally free from any major risk.  The traffic
projections used in the analysis are conservative, and any change therein is
reflected in the sensitivity analysis which still shows an acceptable return.
A further analysis shows that project benefits have to be reduced by 36% or
costs increased by 57% to give a rate of return of less than 12%.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      The present financial situation of OPNT and the quality of the
financial management are good and are likely to remain so in the future.
Increases in tariffs, estimated to increase revenues by 30% in a full year,
were introduced on July 16, 1979; and certain changes in the tariff structure
as proposed by the consultants BCEOM have been incorporated. Assets are
valued at cost and at the takeover value from the old Regie des Ports de
Commerce.
5.02      However, since the facilities to be provided by the project will be
largely for the benefit of shipowners, OPNT agreed at negotiations to under-
take a further review of the tariff structure not later than December 31, 1981
to ensure that an adequate share of these benefits are captured by the country
and that a satisfactory return on this investment is obtained.

5.05      The main assumptions used in the forecasts shown in para. 5.04 are
as follows:
Revenues:  The income is based on the estimated increases in traffic
and includes, from July 16, 1979, 150% increase in ship dues; 50% in
pilotage; 30% in wharfage; 25% in passenger dues; and 75% in storage
charges. Hire of equipment includes the estimated rents on equipment
proposed to be leased to STAM. It also has been assumed that following
the introduction of a new tariff structure on January 1, 1983, dues on
ships and wharfage would be increased by 10%.



- 39 -
Expenditures
(a)  Wages and salaries, which account for about 70% of direct
operating costs, are assumed to increase by 10% per annum
to cover anticipated inflation costs and include additional
staff required.
(b)  Repairs and maintenance and other expenditures have been
increased by 5% per annum.
(c)  Depreciation is 2-4% for civil works, 5% for floating craft
and 5-15% for cargo-handling equipment.
(d)  Interest charges have been calculated at existing rates on
current Bank loans of 5-1/2% and 6-1/2%, and 1-1/2% on
government loans. For the proposed Bank loan the current
Bank rate of 7.95% has been used. Interest charges for
export credits have been taken at 8.5% and for commercial
credits at 12%.
5.06       Cash flow estimates indicate that OPNT will be able to contribute
about 53% of the investment program 1979-85.  A summary of the 1979-85 cash
f low is given below:
Funds Required                                               (TD '000s)
Bank-financed project                                    50,350
Other capital expenditures                                8,000
Debt service                                             16,640
74,990
Funds Available                                              (TD '000s)
Internally generated                                     45,370
Loans - IBRD                                             17,000
Loans - Others                                           12,620
74,990
5.07       The financing plan assumes that, in addition to the proposed Bank
loan of TD 17.0 million (US$42.5 million equivalent), the balance of the
foreign exchange requirement for the project and other capital expenditures
will be obtained from export credit guarantees and commercial bank credits
in accordance with the financing plan agreed at negotiations (paras. 3.40
and 3.42). These financing arrangements are satisfactory to the Bank. The
prior conclusion of agreements securing the necessary foreign exchange finance
will be a condition of effectiveness.



- 40 -
C. Financial Covenants
5.08      As will be seen from the preceding paras. 5.03 to 5.06, OPNT will
be able to maintain satisfactory operating ratios and has a strong financial
position with satisfactory rates of return on its net operational fixed
assets, and adequate debt service coverage. Debt/equity ratios are also well
within the limits of a sound capital structure, reaching a peak of 43/57 in
1983 and 1984.
5.09      During negotiations, the following matters were discussed and agreed
as conditions of Bank lending:
(a)  A further review of the tariff structure, particularly
those charges on vessels and for storage, not later than
December 31, 1981 to ensure an adequate return on the
proposed investment in port facilities. Appropriate new
tariffs should be introduced on or before January 1, 1983
(paras. 2.41 and 5.02).
(b) The generation of revenues sufficient
(i) to produce an annual return on net average revalued
fixed assets in operation of not less than 7% before
tax and interest (Loan Agreement 573-TUN for the
Second Port Proiect provided for a return of 7% by
1973); and
(ii) to meet, out of internally generated funds, debt service
payments, taxation, and to provide adequate working
capital and make a reasonable contribution to capital
expenditures.
5.10      To ensure continuation of OPNT's sound financial position, agreement
was reached during negotiations that OPNT will not incur any further debt,
without the agreement of the Bank, unless its net income for the fiscal year
next preceding the date of such incurrence, or for the later period of twelve
consecutive months ending prior to such incurrence, whichever amount is the
greater, is not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements for
any succeeding fiscal year.
5.11      During negotiations OPNT agreed not to change materially the invest-
ment program shown in para. 3.04. However, they should be allowed to expend,
in addition to the agreed expenditures under the investment program, up to
US$2.5 million equivalent per annum until the completion of the project.



- 41 -
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      The Government has agreed to guarantee cost overruns (para. 3.42).
As recorded in the draft Guarantee Agreement (Section 2.02).
6.02      OPNT and the Bank have agreed on the following:
(a) outline Plan of Action to improve operational efficiency (para.
2.34);
(b) the investment program for 1979-84 and an annual capital expendi-
ture allowance of not more than US$2.5 million until the comple-
tion of the project (paras. 3.04 and 5.11);
(c) appointment of consultants for reorganization of repair and main-
tenance services and for training program implementation. Consul-
tants' recommendations for the workshops reorganization are to be
reviewed with the Bank (paras. 3.19(c), 3.30, 3.31 and 3.44);
(d) cargo-handling equipment to be leased to cargo-handling companies
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Materials for
the manufacture of pallets by STAM will be transferred under
arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, which will cover the full
costs of such materials (para. 3.29);
(e) the preparation of the Project Completion Report (para. 3.46);
(f)  a further review of the tariff structure not later than December 31,
1981, and the introduction of cost-related tariffs on or before
January 1, 1983 (paras. 4.33, 5.02 and 5.09);
(g) the maintenance of revenues at a level sufficient:
(i)  to generate a return on average revalued net assets in opera-
tion of not less than 7% (para. 5.09);
(ii)  to meet, out of internally generated funds, debt service pay-
ments, and to provide adequate working capital and make a
reasonable contribution to capital expenditures (para. 5.09);
and
(h) no further debt to be incurred unless it is shown that OPNT's net
revenue is not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service required
for any succeeding fiscal year (para. 5.10).
As recorded in the draft Loan Agreement (Sections 3.02, 3.04(c), 3.06-07, 4.04
and 5.06-08).



- 42 -
6.03      A condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan should be the
prior conclusion by the Government and OPNT of agreements, satisfactory to the
Bank, with other parties for the financing of the foreign exchange costs of
the project not covered by the Bank loan (paras. 3.42 and 5.07). As recorded
in the draft Loan Agreement (Sections 7.01 and 7.02).
6.04      Based on the agreements reached and subject to the foregoing condi-
tion of effectiveness, the project is suitable for a Bank loan to OPNT of
US$42.5 million for 17 years, including a grace period of three and one-half
years.

THIRD PORT PROJECT
Transport Sector Projects Previously Financed by the Bank
1.        Loan 380-TUN (1964, US$7.0 million, Republic of Tunisia, First Port
Project) was for a project, the major components of which were dredging and
refilling at La Goulette, the construction of berths, transit sheds and other
infrastructure and consulting services. The project was satisfactorily co-
pleted.
2.        Loan 573-TUN (1969, US$8.5 million, Office des Ports Nationaux
Tunisiens, Second Port Project) was for a project, the major components of
which were dredging, the provision of dredges and cargo handling equipment,
provision of a grain berth, training and consulting services. The project
was satisfactorily completed.
3.        Loan 606/Credit 150-TUN (1969, US$17.0 million SNCFT, Railway
Project) was for a project, the major components of which were the renewal
of 352 km of track, purchase of rolling stock, improvement of workshops and
consulting services. The project was delayed by about two years due to the
disastrous floods of 1969 and 1971 and shortages of funds resulting from slow
payments by the railway's principal customer (SFAX/GAFSA Phosphate Co.) prior
to 1973, when the Government assumed the debts of the phosphate company. The
project was satisfactorily completed.
4.        Loan 52-TUN (1969, US$0.8 million) was for engineering studies for
highways included in the First Highway Project. It was satisfactorily com-
pleted.
5.        Loan 724-TUN (1971, US$7.5 million, Societe Tunisienne de l'Electri-
cite et du Gaz, Gas Pipeline Project) was for a project, the major components
of which were procurement and installation of pipelines, compressors, and
auxiliary facilities. The project was satisfactorily completed.
6.        Loan 746-TUN (1971, US$24.0 million, First Highway Project) was for
partial financing of construction and improvement of 274 km of highways, re-
surfacing and rehabilitation of 1920 km of roads, reconstruction of 51 bridges
and consulting services. The project encountered difficulties with the rise
in costs at the time of the oil crisis. In addition, further studies showed
that the Tunis-Turki section should be constructed as a four-lane freeway
rather than as the three-lane road included in the project. The Board there-
fore approved exclusion of the Tunis-Turki road from the project; this road
was later financed by the Kuwait Fund. The disbursement rate was reduced on
the remaining items. All other construction items and consulting services
have now been satisfactorily completed.

7.        Loan 1188-TUN (1976, US$28.0 million, Second Highway Project)
was for the improvement of about 225 km of primary and secondary roads, and
consulting services to assist in the updating of the 1968 Transport Survey
and to assist with the preparation of a Rural Roads Program. Construction
has been completed on one lot of highway G.P.8, Tunis-Bizerte, and is well
advanced on the second lot. Construction is also in progress on the single
lot for improvement of a road in Nabeul. However, works on the remaining
three lots of the project have not started because of local budgetary con-
straints. The Rural Roads Study has been completed, but the updating of the
1968 Transport Survey is behind schedule due to Government delays.
8.        Loan 1601-TUN (1978, US$32 million, Rural Roads Project) was for
the improvement of about 1,000 km of rural roads, maintenance equipment
and training. This loan became effective on March 30, 1979 and is proceeding
satisfactorily.
