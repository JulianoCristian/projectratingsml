(Credit 787-BD)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Second
koodgrain Storage Project in Bangladesh, for which Credit 787-BD in the
amount of US$25.0 million was approved on March 15, 1978. The Credit was
closed on December 31, 1984, two and a half years later than originally
expected; an unu.ed balance of US$4.6 million was cancelled. The date of
final disbursement was October 7, 1985.
The PCR was prepared by the PAO/IBRD Coorerative Program following
missions to Bangladesh in July and September 1985, a review of the Staff
Appraisal Report (No. 1715a-BD) dated February 15. 1978, the President's
Report (No. P-2263-BD) dated.March 15, 1978, the Loan Agreement of April 12,
1978, correspondence with the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda on project
issues as contained in relevant Bank files, as well as interviews with
officials both in the Bank and in Bangladesh who have been associated with
the project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on August 31,
1987 for comments. No comments were received.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH
SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT (CR. 787-BD)
EVALUATION SJJHARY
Introduction
i.       The foodgrain production strategy of the Government of Bangladesh
aims at increasing domest!:: production through a wide range of measures
including the operation of a domestic foodgrain procurement and farmgate
price support policy. The Second Fc3dgrain Storage Project is a sequel to
the First Project which consisted of financing four grain silos with a
total capacity of 226,500 tons primarily a storage and transshipment
facilities for imported foodgrains.
Obiectives
ii.      The main objective of the Second Project was to provide additional
safe grain storage and procurement facilities in major grain surplus
regions, thereby improving the Government's domestic foodgrain procurement
program and reducing storage losses. The project was expected to cost US$40
million (Tk 620 million) over four years, with US$25 million financed by
IDA. To achieve the objectives, the project included construction of
145,000 tons (290 godowns) new storage capacity.,/ 20,000 tons capacity
*Twin Nissen* and similar godowns, and provision of other related
facilities, equipment, technical assistance an training. The new and
improved storage was expected to benefit the country through reducing
annual foodgrain losses by some 11,000 tons, pest control in all Ministry
of Food (MOF) facilities in the project area would reduce losses by at.
additional 7,000 tons and the paddy dryer component by 1,000 tons.
Implementation Experience
iii.     Responsibility for project implementation rested primarily with
MOP. The Director General of Food was the manager of the project supported
by a Project Implementation Unit. A Project Engineering and Construction
Unit (PECU) within the Ministry of Public Works was made responsible for
the engineering design and construction of godowns. A number of problems
is Adding 70,000 tons and replacing some 75,000 tons of MOF storage
facilities in the project area.

arose during implementation that delayed completion. These included
slowness in the establishment of PECU, acquisition oA' sites for storage
buildings, and approval of project proforma, shortages of materials
particularly cement and limited Annual Development Program (ADP) funds.
The project was completed in 1983/84, two and a half years later than
originally planned. Total project cost amounted to Tk 706 million (US$33
million), exceeding the appraisal estimate by 14S in the Taka terms. The
lower than estimated project cost in dollars was due to shortfalls in some
project components. Due to implementation delays and changed needs of the
project, the rehabilitation component was reduced to 10,000 tons capacity;
20,000 tons capacity earmarked for relief storage was diverted for
procurement functions; the paddy dryer coiaponent was dropped and sun-drying
yards were added at 171 godown sites; purchase of vehicles and equipment
was curtailed. The pest control component, which was supposed to generate
significant savings in storage losses, has been severely hampered by
deficiencies in staffing, training, equipment and mobility.
Results
iv.      It appears that need for suitable storage facilities wus pressing
in the early years of the project. In later years a rapid expansion of
grain storage capacity has taken place in the seven project districts. By
June 1984, the total nominal storage capacity in these districts rose to
some 580,000 tons of which project godowns accounted for 25? (145,000
tons). At appraisal, domestic procurement of foodgrains in 1985/86 was
projected at 725,000 in a normal year and 1,240,000 tons in a good year.
However, only in 1980/81 was a volume of over 1 M tons domestically
procured, in the remaining years procurement was between ?00,000-350,000
tons. The annual average utilization of project godowns has ranged between
57? and 124S over the past five years.
V.       Recent studies have indicated that losses prevented through
storage are less then expected at appraisal. The annual grain losses
prevented by the project as completed (excluding rehabilitated storage) is
now estimated at about 8,000 tons. The re-estimated economic rate of
return (ERR) is 8? compared with 21 2./estimated at appraisal. However,
the re-estimated ERR does not include benefits from rehabilitation, pest
control and paddy drying, which could not be quantified but are believed to
be substantial. The ERR hna also been significantly reduced by a lower
rice price projection than at appraisal and slow implementation. As at
appraisal, the ERR does not take into account a significant but
unquantifiable benefit from increased production likely to have arisen from
incentive support prices to producers.
2/ Appraisal ERR were: 14? on the storage component, over 50 on pest
control and 242 on paddy drying.



v 
Sustainability
vi.      The project achieved its basic objective of providing additional
safe grain storage and procurement facilities and, through these, (a)
reduced physical losses in foodgrains, (b) strengthened the Government's
farm price support system needed to increase foodgrain production, (c)
improved the operation of the Public Food Distribution System, and (d)
enhanced the efficiency of foodgrain stock management and transportation.
The p"3ject component strengthening grain inspection and pest control
operations eas complemented by additional technical assistance provided by
FAO. And further support in the areas of grain transportation logistics
and telecommunications was made available vith financial and technical
assistance from the Federal Republic of Germany. The technology supported
by the project is adopted to the local conditions and no change in
technology is expected to be required in the foreseeable future. Based on
the project's achievements as observed, the complementary assistance
provided, and the suitability of the storage and stock management
technology, it can be safely assumed that the project is sustainable.
Findins and Lessons
vii.     The following main lessons can be learned from the experience
gained with this projects
(a) Land acquisition is a complex matter in Bangladesh and
required close attention during preparation and appraisal
to avoid delays in project implementation.
(b) The importance of careful preparation and project design
cannot be over-emphasized. Although the Dhaka-type godown
chosen in the project is sturdy and functional, its costs
appear to be high compared to storage constructions in
other countries of the region. For future storage
projects a study of alternative designs used in the region
is recommended. Another point that came out in this
project is that storage would be more efficient if sites
were planned and developed to include a complete package
of godowns and ancillaries such as concrete yards for
receiving and drying procured grain.
(c) Proper technical supervision during construction and
startup of operations is critical, and capable accounting
staff should be recruited early to keep project accounts
and prepare disbursement claims in a timely fashion.
(d) Once again the experience suggests the importance of
adequate and timely release of budget funds to enable
continuous progress in project implementation.
Availability of funds for maintenance is critical for



- vi -
effective utilization of project constructions. For
future projects it is suggested that each storage manager
be provided with an annual budget for undertaking minor
repairs and maintenance, thereby avoiding bureaucratic
delays in decision-making.

SECOND FOODGRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
(CREDIT 787-1D)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The foodgrain production strategy of the Government  of  Bangladesh
(GOB) alms at increasing domestic production through - (a) development of
drainage, flood control and irrigation facilities for multiple cropping; (b)
provision of yield-increasing technology such as HYV seeds, fertilizers and
pesticides; (c) strengthenirg the extension, credit, and other farmer
support  services;  and  (d)  operating a domestic foodgrain procurement and
farmgate price support policy and related efforts. While the other elements
of the strategy have had a longer history, GOB's domestic procurement
operations  became  significant  only  recently  with   markedly   increased
procurement in 1975/76 when a bumper crop enabled GOB to procure 415,000
tons of rice out of a crop of 12.8 N tons (see Table 1). The coincidence of
heavy imports of foodgrain and relief food into the country in that year has
focussed attention on the need for a more immediate and practical policy for
improving grain storage capacity in the country. Since then, a number of
investment projects have been implemented in the agricultural sector, which,
combined with GOB's procurement and pricing policies, have helped to
increase production and procurement, rendering the public sector storage
capacity inadequate in the subsequent five years.
1.2      Other  major  problems  in  the  sub-sector were abnormal foodgraln
losses in transit as well as in storage due to various factors including
sub-standard storage facilities, and the lack of an effective pest control
management, and organizational and managerial weaknesses of the Directorate
of Food (DOF).
1.3      Traditionally,  the  public  foodgrain procurement and distribution
*        system was Intended to prevent famines and  provide  food  security  through
building up stocks from good harvests and distributing these in times of
shortages. In recent years, the system has added on a number of other
obJectives  which  include  assurance  of  incentive prices for producers of
foodgrains and fair prices to consumers, gradual reduction of foodgrain
subsidies,   targeting   an  increasing  share  of  total  public  foodgrain
distribution through various programes designed to reach the very poor, and
distribution of emergency food relief to areas and people affected by
natural disasters.
1.4      Policy decisions on grain marketing and  storage  are  carried  out
through the Ministry of Food (MOF) which operates the public sector
procurement, distribution and storage system. The Directorate of Food is the
operating department of the Ministry. The Directorate has been reorganized
in January 1984 in a general move by the GOB to decentralise operations of
the various govermuent departments.



2
1.5      The Bank  Group's  involvement  in  the  grain  storage  sub-sector
started with the first Foodgrain Storage Project (Credit 381-BD) which
provided funds for the construction of four silos with a total capacity of
226,500  tons  of  grain; improvements in grain inventory control and insect
control for stored grain; technical assistance in management and operation
of grain storage and transport facilities; and consultants for study of
future foodgrain movements and storage needs of Bangladesh. The silos were
intended primarily as storage and transshipment facilities for imported
grains. IDA provided US$19.7 N and the Swedish Government Skr.25 M (about
USS5.3 M). The project replaced Credit 83-PAK which was signed in February
1966, but suspended in December 1971 as a result of the liberation war and
the subsequent independence of Bangladesh. By that time, project works had
been almost completed. The project was reactivated in May 1973. After some
delays following the civil war, It was successfully completed in June 1977.
The project contributed considerably to alleviate Bangladesh's problem in
timely and efficient handling and distribution of imported grain, exceeding
in some years 2 N tons (Table 1), two to three-times the appraisal estimate.
1.6      In July 1978 IDA approved a Second Credit (787-B) of US$25 M for a
four-year  period  (1978/79-1981/82)       aimed  at providing additional safe
grain storage and procurement facilities in selected districts to strengthen
domestic procurement operations in the public sector. The project was
estimated to cost US$40 N including a foreign exchange component of
USS11.7 M.
1.7      This  project  is the subject of this completion report. The report
prepared by FAO/CP, is based on a review of the Appraisal Report (1715a-BD)
dated 15 February 1978, the President's Report (P-2263-BO) dated 15 March
1978, the Development Credit Agreement dated 12 April, 1978 together with
information obtained from the implementing agencies; a review of supervision
reports and project files; field visits in June 1985 to selected project
sites; discussions with project staff in the Directorate of Food; Interviews
with Bank staff (Resident Mission - Ohaka) who have been associated with the
project and a perusal of documents listed in Appendix 1. The report was
reviewed by the Bank's RMB and headquarters project staff and finalised
after incorporating only some changes and additions.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1      A consulting firm carried out a preparation study and finalised its
report in October 1975. Pre-appraisal by Bank staff took place in November
1976; appraisal followed in April/May 1977.
Oriain and Preparation
2.2      As part of the First Foodgrain Project, a consulting firm Carl Bro,
Denmark, was engaged to prepare a Second Foodgrain Storage project. The
consulting firm submitted its project preparation report in October 1975 -
Bangladesh Foodgrain Storage II Feasibility Study" - recommending a project
designed to enable the DOF to handle a foodgrain throughput of 1.7 M tons
per annum, consisting largely of imported grain. The project comprised
rehabilitation of existing flat storage involving a total capacity of
254,000 tons, construction of silos at Chalna and Khulna with an additional
combined capacity of 52,000 tons, organizational improvements and training,
and possibly provision of grain dryers in selected locations. The estimated
total cost of the project was about US$29 M.



Pre-appralsal
2.3      The  consultant's study had raised a number of policy issues. These
were addressed by a pre-appraisal mission which visited the country in
November 1976 followed by an IDA Food Price Policy mission in 1977. The
Ministry of Food refuted the study's conclusions on storage capacity,
assessing the public sector storage need at 2 N tons capacity.
2.4      During  the pre-appraisal mission's field work, the DOF submitted a
revised project proposal which placed greater emphasis on the rehabilitation
of existing storage facilities and the construction of new godowns to
supplement  the  existing  godown   capacity.   These   proposals   included
rehabilitation of existing godowns involving a total capacity of 356,000
tons, construction of silos at Chalna and Khulna with an additional combined
capacity of 75,000 tons, construction of new Dacca-type godowns j/ with a
total nominal capacity of 243,000 tons and technical assistance for
organizational improvements and project implementation. The estimated total
-ost of the proposal was USS76.2 M. The project was to be implemented by an
Engineering Directorate proposed to be set up within the OOF.
2.5      These proposals were examined and the pre-appraisal mission came up
with a revised proposal deleting the silo and rehabilitation components and
substantially increasing the technical assistance component. As revised by
the mission, the proposed project included construction of new Dacca-type
godowns with a total capacity of 200,000 tons, located mostly in major
procurement regions; provision of dryers and electronic desk calculators and
technical assistance (21 man-years) and training. The project was estimated
to  cost  US$25.7  M.  A  new  Directorate,  within  the  Food  Directorate,
(Directorate   of   Maintenance  and  Construction)  was  proposed  for  the
implementation of the project.
2.6      The mission excluded the silo component  in view of its  desire  to
keep the project and choice of construction techniques as simple as possible
and within the management  capacity  of  the  DOF  while  meeting  the  most
pressing need for grain storage, i.e. to strengthen the logistical base for
expanding the GOB's procurment of domestic grain. Furthermore, inclusion  of
a Khulna/Chalna silo complex was considered to require further study of
grain transport alternatives, which could not be done without unduly
*      delaying  the  project  processing.  The  rehabilitation  component  was not
considered because a country-wide government godown rehabilitation project
was about to be implemented with British assistance.
2.7      The  new construction of 200,000 tons capacity was in part based on
the 'ssumption that GOB could only handle a throughput of some 2 M tons per
year, given its budgetary and administrative constraints. With this
addition, the MOF would have a total loading capacity of at least 1.6 M tons
which would be adequate to handle 1.5 M tons of rice projected for domestic
procurement for the 1986/87 crop year and to facilitate the government grain
distribution of a volume well over 2 M tons per year.
1/ The Dacca-type godown is an enclosed structure made of concrete floor,
brick walls and concrete roofs.



4
Appraisal
11&.8    As noted above, an important issue revolved around the estimate  of
additional grain storage requirements. Transport difficulties in Bangladesh
were such that national availability of foodgrains co-existed with regional
shortages. For storage designed to meet domestic procurement or emergency
relief, location was considered more important than size of storage in
determining ability to meet requirements. A case was therefore made for
additional storage on a thana by thana basis. The project area was
restricted to certain 'core' districts where more grain surplus areas
existed and where the potential for streamlining procurement appeared to be
available. In addition, CIDA's proposal to build Dacca-type godowns with a
total capacity of 50,000 tons was also taken into account. Another concern
during appraisal was the possible duplication of godown rehabilitation
effort. Since the British assistance was confined to rehabilitation of
Dacca-type godowns (which, the GOB considered, had not all been covered),
rehabilitation of Twin-Nissen sheds and similar godowns were included in the
IDA project.
2.9      As  a  complementary investment to protect stored grain, support to
pest control activities was included at appraisal. Cooperative marketing
assistance was another additional component being supported on a pilot
basis. The scope of technical assistance was reduced by excluding some
studies planned earlier and proposing assistance only to support activities
directly concerned with project implementation. This reduction was in part
to allay GOB's concern that the technical assistance requirement was
excessive, particularly engineering consultants.
2.10     Because of MOF's organizational  problems  and  its  difficulty  in
getting   qualified   and  experienced  staff,  responsibility  fcr  project
implementation was entrusted to a new MOF Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
instead of creating a new Directorate within MOF. Design, sub-contracting,
supervision of construction works were to be carried out by a Project
Engineering   and   Construction  Unit  (PECU)  within  GOB's  Public  Works
Department (PWD), which would be responsible to the PIU.
2.11     From the preceding paragraphs it can be noted that from preparation
to pre-appraisal the focus of the project shifted from assisting GOB in
efficiently handling imported grain to strengthening the government's
farmgate price support programme and procurement operations by providing
storage facilities, equipment and technical assistance in core areas for
domestic grain procurement. By addressing this issue and others like level
of storage capacity, type and locations of storage, storage management and
grain   quality   control,   in   retrospect,  pre-appraisal  and  appraisal
concentrated on the right issues.
ProJect DescriPtion
2.12     The  project  covered  seven  districts  of  Bangladesh  (Dinajpur,
Rangpur, Bogra, Rajshahi, Jamalpur 1/ Mymensingh 1/ and Sylhet) and as
negotiated, comprised the following components:
I/ In December 1978, Mymensingh was divided into two districts - Mymensingh
and Jamalpur.
!



a) Construction of 145,000 ton (nominal) 1/ new storage capacity,
including necessary ancillaries, at about 150 existing or new sites
chosen for the availability of suitable Temporary Purchase Centres
(TPCs) sites in their vicinity and rehabilitation of 25,000 tons of
*Twin-Nissen" and similar godowns.
b) Provision of weighing and testing equipment and mechanical drying
facilities;
c) Strengthening of the grain inspection and pest control operations
of MOF through provision of equipment and vehicles, including motor
launches,   and  the  establishment  of  a  new  foodgrain  testing
laboratory.
d) Implementation of a pilot project to develop the grain marketing
potential of selected Upazilla Central Cooperative Associations. g/
e) Provision of technical assistance (10 man years) in engineering,
pest control training, paddy drying and procurement systems and
studies for the evaluation of project benefits.
f) Establishment of a Project Implementation Unit and a Monitoring
Cell and strengthening of the Planning Cell, within MOF.
g) Additionally, in selected flood or cyclone prone districts outside
the project area, the project would provide for the construction of
20,009 tons of storage godowns to facilitate GOB relief response to
emergencies.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
I .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Delays in Effectiveness
3.1      The  negotiations  for the credit took place in December 1977.  The
Bank's Board of Directors approved the credit on 3 March 1978. The Credit
was signed on 12 April 1978 and the target date in the Development Credit
Agreement for fulfilling the conditions of effectiveness was specified as 12
July 1978. Because of delays in the approval of the Project Proforma (PP),
administrative clearance for the establishment of PECU, and the opening of
separate  accounts for project funds, the Credit effectiveness was postponed
to 30 September 1978.
/ A loading capacity of paddy which provides ideal storage conditions but
which can be safely and economically exceeded for short periods.
2/ Previously known as Thana Central Cooperative Associations (TCCA).



6
3.2      Delays in PP  approval  resulted  from  maJor  differences  in  the
project as agreed at negotiations, particularly in regard to insufficient
vehicles for pest control squads and procurement staff, omission of the
engineer and operators for the paddy dryers, omission of the new zonal
testing laboratory and insufficient allocation for price escalation. These
deficiencies were remedied following Bank's intervention in July 1978.
Implementation Schedule
3.3      At  appraisal,  it  was  estimated  that the construction programme
would be completed by December 1981, with a project closing date of 30 June
1982.  Final construction took place in December 1984 and the Credit closing
date was extended to 31 December 1984. 1/
3.4      A number of  problems  arose  during  implementation  that  delayed
completion. Slowness in the acquisition of sites for storage buildings,
shortage of funds under the Annual Development Programme (ADP) and material
shortages were major contributory factors. Other problems were inadequate
planning   and   monitoring,   project   administration   and   construction
supervision, mainly due to frequent changes in responsible staff in PIU,
tack of effective coordination between PIU and PECU, lack of authority of
PECU over PWD field staff and Insufficient use of the engineering consultant
(See also paras 3.9, 4.6, 4.7, 4.10 and 4.11).
ProJect Cost
3.5      The total cost of the project at completion was Tk706 M compared to
Tk621 N 9/ at appraisal, implying an overall cost increase of 14% (see
Table 2). xpressed in dollars which reflect the depreciation of Taka
(increase of 70% over 1978/79 to 1984/85), there was a cost underrun of 18%.
However, if allowance is made for project components which are not carried
out (paddy dryers) or partially carried out (rehabilitation and pest
control), the actual project cost would have a higher cost overrun (35%).
The godown component 3/ cost Tk 682 M (Tk 414 M in constant 1977 prices)
as against Tk 499 M (Tk 413 M base cost including physical contingencies)
at appraisal. As a result, the share of godown component in the total
project cost rose from 80% at appraisal to 97% at completion. Expressed
on a per ton basis, the cost of godowns (excluding rehabilitation) was
Tk 4,100 per ton or about 52% above the appraisal estimate.
1/ Loan disbursement continued till September 1985 without officially
extending the closing date. Disbursements were, of course, restricted to
expenditures incurred up to the official closing date.
3/ Due to difficulties in getting proper cost data from PIU, data up to
1983/84 were taken from audited accounts and the data for 1984/85 from
PIU records. PECU has provided detailed cost data.
./ comprising land acquisition cost, construction cost and engineering
services.



7
3.6      Price escalation and quantity changes have both contributed to  the
cost overruns. Indicative of price rise was the almost doubling of the
consumer price index over the project impleeratation period. Quantity
changes were due to (a) changes in foundation design in some sites where
poor soil conditions existed, (b) provision of additional facilities like
drying yards, (c) higher than expected site filling, and (d) remoteness of
many sites involving increased cost particularly carriage of materials. The
provision of 5% for physical contingencies at appraisal proved therefore
inadequate.
Project Changes after ApDraisal
3.7      As  a  result  of  implementation  delays, changed needs in several
components and of tne need to keep total project cost in line with appraisal
cost estimates, the project was amended on several occasions during
implementation. The main changes were reductions in rehabilitation capacity
from 25.000 tons to 10,000 tons, deletion of paddy dryers, inclusion of paddy
drying yards, and modification of relief storage to cater forprocurementoutside
the main projectarea.  In addition, provision of equipnenttand vehicles had been
curtailedmainly to avoid duplication with those provided under other projects.
3.8      The project storage facilities now account for 32%  of  the  'core'
project  area  LSD  capacity,  15% of the total LSO capacity, and 10% of the
national storage capacity (Table 3).  Total public sector  storage  capacity
in 1978 was 1,135 M tons, compared to 1,774 M tons in 1985. Since the
project added only 165,000 tons, about 474,000 tons (of which 81,000 tons in
the project core area) was constructed during the project period under other
programmes.  I
Godown Construction
3.9      Godown  construction  was  scheduled in three phases extending over
four years; 56,000 tons in Phase I, 53,000 tons in Phase II and the
remaining 36,000 tons in Phase III in the seven northern producing
districts. Oespite delays, appraisal targets of 145,000 tons have been
achieved and all the godowns are now operational as shown below.

c4city (tons)
As can be seen above, the godowns were brought into operation im_ediately on
completion. Construction delays were caused by the length of time taken for
acquistion of land (8-10 months), for preparation of construction estimates
(3-4 months), and administrative approval (2 months). Material shortages and
inadequate provision of ADP funds have also caused delays. Some of the
difficulties with material shortages and land acquisition could have been
avoided. When allocating coal for brick burning, PWD appeared to have given
preference to other godown programmes, and construction sites earmarked for
the project had le some cases been diverted to other storage projects.



81
3.10     Arrangements for the award of tenders  and  for  construction  were
generally regarded as satisfactory. The simple and sturdy 'Dacca' design is
well tried and tested under local conditions and only minor improvements
have been suggested, at appraisal. The concrete outside the store were added
later to facilitate handling and conditioning operations and to provide a
suitable base for emergency storage.
3.11     Of  the  330  units  1/  constructed,  four  have  been found to be
defective, obviously due to lack of adequate supervision. Three of these
have now been rectified while the fourth is still under dispute as to
quality of construction. However, It has been handed over to MOF and it has
become operational. Minor defects are still being reported by the District
Food Controllers and these have been taken up with PWD for remedial action.
Construction of boundary walls at nine sites as well as drying yards at
three sites were not completed due to land disputes.
Relief Storage
3.12     After an initial delay of r.early 18  months,  the  construction  of
relief storage godowns was finally completed in 1984. These godowns are now
operational as shown below.

As  previously  noted,  the  above  godowns were also brought into operation
immediately after completion.
3.13     The main cause of delay was  GOB's  slowness  in  selecting  sites.
Meanwhile wheat procurement in Jessore, Kushtia and Comilla districts had
picked up very rapidly requiring additiondl storage capacity. About the same
time, the Food Security Assistance Scheme of FAO was under consideration.
The Bank therefore agreed that the relief storage located outside the main
project areas be used for procurement. Accordingly the capacity of 20,000
tons under this category was built in the following districts predominantly
for wheat procurement - Jessore, Kushtia, Faridpur, Khulna, Noakhali,
Tangail, Pabna and Ohaka (see Table 3).
1/ Including relief storage of 40 units.



Rehabilitation
3.14     As  in  the case of relief storage, the start of the rehabilitation
programme was delayed by about 18 months. The delay was caused by
disagreement between PIU and MOF as to the choice of sites for rehabilitated
storage and replacement. Some of the stores considered for rehabilitation
under the project such as Twin Nissen huts and Assam sheds had already been
replaced and rehabilitation of some other facilities did not appear cost
effective. Moreover, the government could not find enough stores within the
project area for rehabilitation. The programme was therefore reduced from
25,000 tons to 10,000 tons. It was completed in 1983/84.
Mechanical Drying Facilities
3.15     Initial delays arose from difficulties of recruiting a  consultant.
The first engaged consultant left after six months. His replacement did not
take up duties until September 1980, but had a slow start, because initially
he had no counterpart. When he finally had selected equipment for a reduced
pilot project of five sites 1/ orders were not placed because DOF found that
results with similar driers installed under a DANIDA project were not
encouraging. Farmers and traders apparently were not interested in bringing
their grain to a drier because of unfamiliarity with the system of price
deductions to be applied for moisture loss, even though fuel and labour
costs had not been charged. Under the circumstances MOF decided not to use
the funds allocated for the pilot driers and to drop the component
altogether. The deletion of this component has been partially offset by
inclusion at a later stage of drying yards at some 171 godown sites.
Weighing and Testing Equipment
3.16     As  shown  in  Table  4,  most of the equipment required by the new
Temporary Procurement Centres and godowns was procured rather belatedly,
conforming to the revised PP. The items purchased were 15 units of sieves,
250 units of moisture meters. Weighing scales and the 3 launches were not
purchased as envisaged at appraisal due to their omission in the PP.
Vehicles (one car and 40 motorcycles) were purchased on time.
Grain Quality Control and Inspection
3.17     The  project  provided for vehicles and other equipment to be given
to 25 pest control squads, the establishment of a foodgrain testing
laboratory, training programme for operators, spraymen, godown managers and
inspectors. In addition the project Included two man years of quality
control expertise, three equipped training vans and budget for training
courses.
1/ In mutual consultation between IDA and MOF the initial number of 15
drier sites was reduced to five. On the basis of a pilot project the
initial number proposed at appraisal was much too large.



10
3.18     Implementation of this component faced numerous problems.  Some  15
posts were not filled in a total sanctioned strength of 62 pest control
operators. They were not provided with vehicles as anticipated. In fact, 10
land Rovers which were donated under the British assisted - godown
rehabilitation scheme, were impounded under a martial law direction after
only three months of operation. After repeated requests by the Bank
supervision missions, 5 jeeps have been purchased in 1984/85. The Foodgrain
testing laboratory at Naogaon in Rajshahi district has been completed in
1984/85. The food technologist has yet to be appointed.
3.19     As regards training, the first PP omitted any reference  to  either
mobile training units, training aids, or a local budget. After-a series of
discussions spanning a period of two years, a revised PP was approved by MOF
in February 1982 with mobile training unit, training aids and local budget
for training all deleted. In view of the abuve, the pest control consultant
virtually filled the role of grain storage/pest control adviser encompassing
the whole field of technical operations of the DOF. He has reviewed its
operations   and   made   proposals  including  the  reorganization  of  the
Directorate of Inspection, Control and Training. His proposals were not
fully implemented and a need exists for promoting an effective pest control
system, substantially improving the key areas of staffing, vehicles and
training. It is worth noting that after expiry of his contract with IDA, the
consultant has continued to assist HOF in pest control training activities
until July 1985 with financing through the Food Security Project executed by
FAO (see para 4.14).
3.20     Equipment supplied under  the  FAO  projects  together  with  those
procured   under   IDA   and  FRG  projects  has  provided  the  operational
directorates with an adequate and appropriate range of equipment for
procurement, storage and protection of foodgrains.
Cooperative Marketinc
3.21     The original PP provided financing for only one  UCCA  (Muktagacha)
under the pilot scheme. The pilot project was launched In 1978 through the
Muktagacha UCCA in Mymensingh district. Local management was undertaken by
the staff of the Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BROB) and support from
the staff of the World Bank in Dhaka. The revised PP has increased UCCA
participation to 10, the number envisaged at appraisal. Only four have so
far participated in the programme. Moisture meters, weighing scales,
motorcycles, training cost and other development expenditure for UCCAs as
well as a 50 ton capacity godown at Kotwali UCCA, Dinajpur district, have
been funded under the project. Despite problems in getting paddy marketing
loans, the UCCAs have managed to run their limited programmes satisfactorily
using their own funds (members share and savings).
3.22     The scheme has proved financially beneficial to the farmers and all
the four UCCAs have made profits (Table 5). It must be noted that in
arriving at these profits, indirect costs of BRDB and other government
inputs have not been taken into account.
3.23     In recognition of the success of this programme, BROB  has  decided
to replicate it in other districts including IDA-financed Rural Development
tI Project areas.



ProJect financing
3.24     IDA was expected to finance about 75% of  the  total  project  cost
(net of 18.5% duties and taxes) with the remaining portion contributed by
GOB. USAID participated in the local cost financing of the project to the
value of Tkl3.3 M (USS528,000) out of PL480 proceeds.
3.25     Throughout   the   project   implementation  period,  disLirsements
consistently lagged behind the volume forecast at appraisal (see Basic Data
Sheet).  The total expenditure up to 30.6.1984 was Tk497 1, of which Tk373 M
was due for reimbursement but reimbursement was claimed for only Tk276 M
leaving  a backlog of Tk97 M. The backlog of Tk97 M comprised Tk56 M against
civil works and Tk41 M against security deposit as shown below.

3.26     Pro,ress of claiming reimbursement against security deposit by PECU
was very poor. In certain cases, claims were submitted two or three years
after the actual refund of the mount to the contractors. Main reasons for
the delay in preparing claims against civil works were as follows:
a) In some cases, contractors have preferred appeal against the
departmental decision in finalising the works contract. In a few
cases, the contractors have sought arbitration or legal action
thereby delaying final disposal of cases.
b) For works which continued up to 30 June 1985, bill vouchers could
not be submitted as these have to be processed and collected from
PWO field offices. In some other cases, the final bills could not
be   prepared   due   to  non-cooperation  or  non-availability  of
contractors in measurement of works and finalising bills.
c) Procurement delays to replace materials used from PWD's own stock
(see para 4.8).
3.27     In addition, substantial  delays  occurred  in  the  submission  of
withdrawal   applications   for  local  expenditure  by  executing  agencies
particularly PECU. They have little Incentive to seek reimbursement in
foreign exchange (which goes to Bangladesh Bank) once they have made
expenditure  from  their  own   budgets.   In   addition,   over-centralised
bureaucratic procedures have also contributed to the delays.

Credit Allocation
3.28     Upon GOB's request, IDA agreed (under the Special Action Programme)
to raise the disbursement rate for civil works from 65% to 90% (for claims
submitted from November 1, 1982 onwards) in order to (1) better utilize the
Credit, which had substantial savings, mainly due to Taka depreciation 1/ ;
and (ii) to maintain IDA's share at about 75% of total project costs, net of
duties and taxes (estimated in SAR at 18.5% of total costs). The Increased
rite for civil works about halfway through the project compensated for
reduced or deleted components with a 100% disbursement rate (see table below
and para 3.5).

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Implementing Agencies
4.1      The  Director General of Food (DGF) was the manager of the Project,
supported by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). He reported directly to
the Secretary of Food who was assisted in project implementation by a
Project Steering Committee (PSC), consisting of representatives of other
interested ministries and agencies. The Public Works Department (PWO) under
the Ministry of Public Works was made responsible for the engineering design
and construction of godowns, for which a special unit called Project
Engineering and Construction Unit  (PECU)  headed  by  an  Additional  Chief
Engineer was set up within PWD to operate in close association with the PIU.
BRDB was given responsibility for the execution of the UCCA pilot scheme. In
addition,  to  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  MOF, the project
provided for strengthening the Ministry's Planning Cell, for establishing a
monitoring cell, for technical assistance, and for improvements in DOF
organization, ooerating systems and procedures.
4.2      The institutional  impact  of  the  project  was  satisfactory  but
variable among the executing agencies.
4.3      In  assessing  the impact of the project on the overall performance
of the DOF, it is worth noting that the Directorate during the project
period had undergone changes in its organization, operating systems and
procedures. These changes were in part due to various initiatives taken at
different times by IDA as well as other institutions.
4.4      The  performance  of  the  individual  agencies is discussed in the
following paragraphs.
Project Steering Committee
4.5      A Project Steering Comittee was formed under the Secretary of Food
to review progress of project implementation in conjunction with other
ministries and institutions involved in project execution. Until April 1980,
regular meetings were held to discuss the quarterly progress reports
prepared by the Project Implementation Unit and the annual reports prepared
by the Planning Cell. Due to Increasing responsibilities of the committee
members in their day-to-day work, the Project Steering Comittee has not met
since April 1980. However the committee members headed by the Secretary,
Ministry of Food met in every quarter to discuss project issues raised in
the QRR (and lately introduced CROPS) prepared by RMB.
Project Implementation Unit
4.6      The  Project  Implementation  Unit  has  not  been  as effective as
anticipated at appraisal. This is attributed to a lack of staff experienced
in implementing such projects, high staff turnover (five different officers
served as Deputy Director during the project period), and a lack of
engineering capability to deal at an equal level with PECU/PWD. Lack of
delegation of financial powers to the Director General was also a reason for
slow project implementation.



14
Project Enaineerino and Construction Unit
4.7      Although all new godowns and most of the ancillary works have  been
successfully completed, eventually it was generally felt that over the
project period coordination and works supervision by PECU have not always
been satisfactory, which has been partly the reason for the delays. Some of
the pre-construction delays, like preparation of cost estimates, site
surveying and tendering were due to slow actions of PWO field staff over
which PECU clearly had not sufficient authority. Although on paper adequate
engineering and accounting staff were assigned to PECU, construction
supervision by PECU has hardly been of any significance. Preparation of
accounti and disbursement claims have been unduly delayed because of
inaction by PECU and PWD field staff. Also, PECU/PWD has not. been very
imaginat've in impro-ing or overhauling the very traditional godown design,
In order to reduce construction costs and improve functionality.
4.8      Procurement.  Procurement requirements under the  project  required
that contractors were given the option to bid based on self-procured
materials or materials made available to contractors by PWD from its stocks.
Project use of such stocks would be replenished by normal commercial
Imports,  not  otherwise  financed,  using  international   shopping   under
procedures acceptable to IDA.
4.9      There  were  delays  in  procurement  of  building materials due to
lengthy procedures and lack of quick decision. Procurement of 8,000 tons
of Portland Cement was greatly delayed due to belated approval by the
Ministry of Works.  In  another  case,  the  Min;stry  sought  reimbursement
against the procurement of 3,000 tons of cement but failed to establish that
these were procured through proper tendering. Also the procurement of jeeps
ran into problems. After IDA approval of tender award, the Ministry required
that the jeeps be procured from the lone local manufacturer. It took months
before the Ministry accepted the bid of the lowest conforming foreign
bidder, by which time the validity of the bids had expired and the bidder
refused to supply. A reduced number of vehicles was then procured from the
local manufacturer whose bid was still valid.
4.10     Performance of ensineerina consultant. The  appraisal  mission  had
originall1yplaced the engineering advisor in the Food Ministry to deal with
PWD on technical matters. However, the engineering consultant who was to
monitor progress and to assist and advise both PIU and PECU was engaged by
and reporting to PECU. This arrangement has proved not to be appropriate.
According to his terms of reference the consultant was to assist PECU in
review of specifications, contract documents and bid evaluations,  recommend
standards of supervision and train personnel In supervision methods. In
practice, however, design estimates and tender documents were all prepared
by PWD without reauesting or accepting any input from the consultant. The
actual arrangement has been that the consultant was undertaking only
supervision for which PECU had neither the staff nor vehicles. In making
inspection visits at construction sites supervised by PWO field staff the
engineering consultant has done a good Job in helping to maintain minimum
standards  of  quality.  However,  the  rapport  between   the   engineering
consultant and PWO has not been very good and the services of the consultant
have not been optimally utilized by PECU/PWD.
4.11     The expatriate consultant and later only  the resident engineer  of
the firm travelled frequently to the sites to report on the status of works
and certify completed works. Generally their work has been useful. Due to
delays in construction completion, the fim's contract was extended
twice,  expiring  finally  on  30  June  1984.  This  resulted  in  many



1.0
completion certificates for works finished after 30 June 1984, not having
their counter signature. Another consequence was the non-submission of the
terminal report by the consultants. Their final bills had however been paid
by PECU.
4.12     Performance  of  contractors.  The performance of local contractors
was generally satisfactory. In a few cases of unsatisfactory work, as found
by the engineering consultant action was taken by PW0 by demolishing and
redoing the defective work. The reasons for poor performance in some of the
cases can be attributed to low bidding and slender financial resources of
some of the contractors. To overcome their liquidity problems, PWO has
provided   in many  cases  construction  materials  on  credit  and  rented
construction machinery.
4.13     Maintenance.  Repair and regular maintenance of godowns,  equipment
and vehicles owned by the DOF are genewally poor. A number of godowns have
cracks in the floors and adjoining walls. Due to shortage of funds, no
repair and maintenance of the godowns and staff quarters had been done since
completion of the construction work. Other reasons for maintenance problems
are unclear responsibilities for carrying out repair and maintenance work,
time-consuming administrative procedures for even minor repairs, and a lack
of engineering expertise in the Directorate of Food. At present, MOF
requests the PWD on a job-by-job basis to carry out almost all godown
repairs, which is an unsatisfactory situation. Either PWD should take the
godowns in repairs or DOF should have funds and some engineering staff
available to do minor repairs on their own.
Pest Control Training
4.14     Pest control training was proposed under the project to be provided
by a consultant. Accordingly, an expert, who had previously worked with the
British-assisted godown rehabilitation project was recruited and took up his
post in October 1980. As the Warehouse Training Centre, under the auspices
of which he was intended to function, had ceased to exist, he was placed
directly in the Directorate of Inspection, Control and Training (DICT),
reporting to DGF. He was required to provide intensive training in the field
for all MOF personnel in the 7 core districts starting with pest control
operators, spraymen and godown managers in addition to participants from
UCCAs and the private sector. As stated in para 3.19 the training effort did
not materialise to the extent expected because the key elements of staffing,
equipment and mobility remained unresolved due to emission in the PP despite
efforts by successive IDA supervision missions to; redress the situation.
Furthermore,  the consultant was not given a counterpart until the expiry of
his contract. He was then recruited by FAO to perform similar functions
sucessfully under two Food Security Projects for a total period of 17
months. These projects provided for supply of vehicles and equipment and
conducted a series of training courses. As a result , the entire national
complement of quality control inspectors (previously designated technical
Inspectors and pest control operators) appointed or promoted under the
reorganization plan was given a two-week training course in all aspects of
pest and quality control. In addition, a series of regional training courses
for quality control inspectors were also given, making up for a limited
effort under the IDA project. These efforts were also supported by the FRG
Food Security Assistance Project.



16
Organizational Improvements
4.15     OOF field administration.  Field  administration  of  the  DOF  was
required to be improved in order to establish an effective food management
system. As a first step, the posts of the District and Sub-divisional
Controllers of Food were upgraded in 1979 as recommended by IDA. Later in
January 1984, DGF was reorganized following the report of the Martial Law
Committee. Most of the changes were in line with IDA proposals.
4.16     Under  the  new  set-up  (see  Chart  1),  the  Director General is
assisted by an Additional Director  General  as  Chief  of  Operations.  The
Directorate  General  now consists of six directorates - (a) Administration,
(b) Movement, Storage and Silos, (c) Procurement (d) Inspection, Development
and  Technical  Services  (e)  Supply,  Oistribution  and  Marketing and (f)
Accounts and Finance. The role and duties of the Director General as well as
those of the Directors have been clearly defined.
4.17     New  staff  cadres  and  career  avenues were introduced in several
cases transferring serving staff across traditionally exclusive working
discipline boundaries. These changes were more marked and fundamental in the
DICT (now DIOTS) which lost its operat!rna' role in the fields of pest and
quality control. For the first time, the oesciplines of storage engineering
and processing technology have been Introciued into the OGF. the Director,
Additional Director and one Deputy Oire totr of 0OTS are all engineers. Pest
and quality control has been made the responsibility of the line managers -
godown managers and technical inspectors respectively - under the District
Controllers of Food.
4.18     Foodgrain   procurement.    Procurement   operations   have    been
streamlined. The focus of the operations has been shifted from ensuring a
target level of public stocks to ensuring an adequate 'floor' price to
producers. In line with this development, procurement prices have been
adjusted regularly with announcement in advance of crop planting. To
illustrate, increased procurement prices for the aman crops were announced
on 30 June 1984. The new prices represented a 15% increase for paddy and 10%
increase  for  milled rice, levels considered to offer farmers a significant
price incentive to produce. However, achievements in the actual procurement
of foodgrains are a function of various factors, of which the procurement
prices set by Government is one. Consequently, actual procurement was only
266,000 tons in 1983/84 (see Table 7) As shown in Chart 2, this was not
because procurement price was inadequate but rather because the commercial
prices were consistently above the procurement price.
4.19     Access   to   procurement   centres.   The  restrict.ve  system  of
Authorised Grain Oealers (AGO) has been abandoned. In addition, farmers' and
traders' access to MOF procurement centres has been improved, in some areas
with the result that competiton for farmers' grain has Increased somewhat
and farmgate prices have probably been higher than they would have been
otherwise. Furthermore, the number of purchasing centres has been greatly
increased in the last four years and improved handling, quality standard and
payment procedures have been put into effect.
4.20     Constraints.  NOF's procurement efforts could, however, not  always
prevent market prices from falling below the support price levels. Farmers,
therefore, still lack full confidence in GOB's price support policy.
Indicative of this was the decline in low-lift pumps used by farmers for
irrigating the 1981/82 boro crop. The decline was attributed to, among
various factors, the low prices received by many farmers for the preceeding
aman crop.



4.21     Foodgrain distribution.   The  increasing  effectiveness  of  MOF's
foodgrain distribution operations was demonstrated in the crisis period of
May to December 1984 (during which three floods occurred), by the absence of
famine conditions which were evident after the 1974 floods. The noteworthy
factors contributing to MOF's success were (a) significant additions to
public storage capacity in LSDs over the past few years, (b) local transport
improvements through road, bridges and ferry construction programmes, (c)
improvements   in   management,  information,  organization  and  logistical
capacity of the MOF, (d) effective coordination of food operations between
different ministries and line agencies and (e) better targeting of relief
operations. The project's contributior to LSD construction and, to a certain
extent, to improvements in organization and management has been significant.
Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.22     The  Planning  Cell  in  the  MOF  has  been  strengthened  by  the
appointment of a research officer and an economist as required at appraisal.
The planning cell has taken on broad responsibilities for planning and
monitoring the work of the MOF and for implementing its development
activities in general. The start-up of the monitoring cell was delayed due
to problems in staffing and non-availability of office accommodation. It was
eventually  set  up  within  the  office  of  the  OGF  to  streamline   the
compilation,  processing  and analysis of operational information. Under the
reorganization, the cell has been strengthened, and is headed by an
Additional Director who is assisted by a Deputy and one Assistant Director.
Under FRG assistance, the Directorate has procured and installed 13
teleprinters   at  district  level.  In  addition,  FAO  provides  technical
assistance to help develop the Directorate's management information system.
4.23     During the project period, the monitoring  cell  has  been  largely
ineffective. This in part was due to lack of an appropriate monitoring
system. Reports submitted by the consultant appointed to assist in this
regard have not been acted upon. Other reasons for the ineffectiveness of
the monitoring cell have been frequent personnel changes, inadequately
trained and experienced staff and lack of motivation.
4.24     Project monitoring efforts have not been addressed by the PSC which
has not met since April 1980. A consultant firm was appointed to develop a
continuous farmgate price monitoring system. The consultants' report has not
been finalised by the GOB yet. Since farmgate pricing monitoring is handled
by the Marketing Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture, placing of the
responsibility with MOF did not seem appropriate. Moreover, a need existed
for the assessment of storage losses which remained the responsibility of
the MOF but no study was proposed. Meanwhile, a grain loss assessment study
started by the pest control consultant under the Food Security Project was
not proceeded with when the consultant left the country on expiry of his
contract.
Accounting and Reporting
4.25     The usual government system of accounts was followed  by  both  PIU
and PECU. This meant that separate accounts were not maintained for project
activities. To satisfy credit conditions relevant records of expenditures
were kept to allow identification of project spending. On this basis
project accounts up to 1983/84 have been audited by the Office of the
Director General Comercial Audit. Several discrepancies were noted during
audit. These included - moisture meters imported for the project but



is
distributed outside the project area, excessive issue of materials to
contractors, materials issued but contract neither executed nor materials
returned, distribution of motorocycles outside the project area, delayed
execution of works allowed without penalty, payment at rates higher than
scheduled rates, paddy drying yards smaller than approved size, award of
sub-contract in violation of tender agreement and over-payments against
defective and incomplete works.
4.26     Quarterly  progress  reports were submitted by PIU until March 1982
and ceased thereafter due to changes in key staff and lack of initiative.
Compliance With Covenants
4.27     Appendix  2 sets out the status of covenants with brief explanatory
notes. It is seen that compliance has been in general, satisfactory except
for  submission  of  quarterly  reprts and audit reports. Quarterly reports
have not been submitted to IDA since March 1982 while audit of 1984/85
accounts of PECU and PIU are due since December 31, 1985.
V. PROJECT IMPACT
Utilization of Godcwns
5.1      It  would  appear  that  the  need  for suitable storage facilities
particularly in the major procurement regions was pressing in the early
years of the project. This conclusion is supported by the fact that many of
the godowns constructed under the project had become operational immediately
after completion and were used to capacity, (see paras 3.9 and 3.12 and
Table 8) some exceeding the full rated capacity, and a utilization rate of
124%  was achieved by resorting to higher stacking. During the FY 1981 aman,               '
boro and wheat and FY 1982 aus procurement season, support prices could  not
be maintained because the public foodgrain storage was so overloaded that
procurement could not be expanded sufficiently. The later years witnessed a
rapid expansion in grain storage capacity in the seven project districts
(see Tables 9 and 10). By June 1984, total nominal storage capacity in these
districts rose to some 580,000 tons of which project godowns accounted for
25% (145,000 tons). At appraisal, domestic procurement of foodgrains in
1985/86 was proJected at 725,000 tons if it was a normal year or 1,240,000
tons if it was a good year. Domestic procurement has, however, not expanded
as forecast at appraisal. Only in 1980/81 a volume of over 1 M tons was
procured, in the remaining years since appraisal, procurement was between
200,000 tons to 350,000 tons (Table 1). As expected, the bulL of the
procurement came from these seven 'core' districts rising from 65% of total
procurement in 1977/78 to 87% in 1983/84, justifying, the appropriate choice
of the project area (see Table 7). As a result, annual utilization rate fell
rapidly  from  124%  in  1980/81  to  57%  in  1984/85. jj This situation is
j/ Based on a sample analysis of 10 project godowns. This conclusion must
be treated with caution because some of the reported data may be
inaccurate as PIU was not able to supply inflow-outflow data to the PCR
mission.



corroborated further by the fact that GOB's target stock level of 1.2 M tons
of grains (comprising minimum operational stock of about 500,000 to 550,000
tons plus emergency stock of at least 700,000 to 750,000 tons) represent
some 67% of nominal storage capacity (1.8 N tons) or 46% of effective
capacity through 50% (2.7 M tons) higher stacking. UtiiHzation also fell
because GOB since 1981 had started constructing substantial storage capacity
(approximately 250,000 tons) under two crash programmes (see Table 9). As
mentioned in para 3.8, since appraisal, almost 81,000 tons was newly
constructed in the project core area in addition to the project storage.
Physical Losses of Stored Grains
5.2      As discussed earlier, pest control  operations  under  the  project
were limited because the equipment provided along with suplementary items
financed by other multilateral and bilateral sources were used to strengthen
the national network. The project area did not recieve any special
treatment. Moreover, weaknesses in the key areas of staffing (see Table 11),
staff training and mobility persisted for the better part of the project
period. Under these circumstances, physical losses of stored grains should
have been higher if not for the rapid turnover of the stocks due to low
procurement and high offtake in most of the years. However, in FY 1981 and
early FY 1982, extensive grain spoilage and losses from infestation were
reported when substantial quantities of grains had to be stored in sub-
standard facilities or out in the open and in the godowns which were
generally overstocked (see Table 12). Pest control and stock maintenance
operations could not be carried out as required.
5.3      Grain  losses are generally recorded in accordance with a system of
specified  permissible  limits  for  storage  and  transit   losses.   These
allowances are small, never greater than 1% as set out below. The system
does not differentiate between storage facilities of different quality, or
between different regions and seasons of storage.

1/ For storage period in excess of one year, additional 0.25% storage
loss is permitted for each 3 months beyond one year.



5.4      Absence of hard data on the cause and extent of grain losses has
prevented precise estimation of storage losses. The monitoring study on
loss assessment started by the pest control consultant under the Food
Security Project was not proceeded with when the consultant left the country
on expiry of his contract. Thus the lack of hard data required efforts by
the mission to collect data through interviews and field assessments based
on judgement. Based on these, physical losses of grain are estimated at
2% with project and 6% without the project (appraisal estimates average
4.2% savings). 1/ Field data suggests that the storage period would be
about 8 months for rice/wheat and about 4 months for paddy, the annual
stock turnover around 1.7, annual average capacity utilization approximately
i0% and composition of stored grain 50% of rice and 25% each of paddy and
wneat. Based on these data, it is estimated that some 8,000 tons 2/ of
foodgrains would be saved annually, compared to 11,000 tons 3/ assumed at
appraisal.
Beneficiaries
5.5      Benefits accrue primarily to the GOB in the form of reduced grain
storage losses, which, in turn, correspondingly reduces dependence on
imported grains, resulting in lower foreign exchange expenditure and reduced
deficits in subsidized foodgrain distribution. The project also benefits
farmers and consumers. Additional storage in the grain producing areas and
increased operational effectiveness enabled MOF to expand domestic procure-
ment, increasing competition for the farmers' produce, and hence farmgate
prices. This normally benefits especially small farmers who cannot hold
grain but have to sell immediately after harvest when farmgate prices are
the lowest.
5.6      Experience has shown that the participants of GOB's Food for Work
and relief feeding programmes often get the poorest quality wheat available.
To the extent that the quality of wheat could be better maintained, these
groups will benefit from higher quality foodgrain and better nutritional
standards. Benefits also accrued to UCCAs/KSSs and their members.
Impact on Private and Cooperative Sector
5.7      Though the project did not directly affect the private sector
storage, and the aspect was not assessed at appraisal, a covenant was
included in the DCA for GOB to study the private sector storage and
marketing system with a view to identify investment needs. 4/ Some of the
1/ Excludes losses avoided by rehabilitation component.
2/ Losses avoided derived as follows - 165,000 tons x 0.7 capacity utilization
x 1.7 turns x 0.04 savings = 7,854 tons, rounded to 8,000 tons. An alter-
native estimate made by Bank staff based on different assumptions regarding
turnover and storage loss savings arrives at a similar result:
0.75 wheat or rice x 165,000 x 0.7 x 1.25 x 0.06 = 6,475 tons
0.25 paddy          x 165,000 x 0.7 x 1.25 x 0.03 = 1,442 tons
7,939 tons
3/ Includes losses avoided by rehabilitation. Appraisal estimates include an
additional 7,000 tons in MOF storage saved through pest control in the
project area and 1,000 tons saved through paddy drying.
4/ The study was deleted from this project and then considered under 872-BD,
but may be undertaken under a future TA project.



improvements promoted by the project - suspension of anti-hoarding laws,
abolition of the AGD system - had stimulated private sector interest in
grain storage. Also some other incentive measures have been taken by the
government. However, the private sector still lacks confidence to play a
larger role in grain storage, due to lack of a clear policy committment from
GOB to allow trade to play an Increasingly important role in grain marketing
for the years to come. More incentives are needed to stimulate private
investment in grain marketing facilities, at import wholesale as well as at
retail level. During the implementation of the pilot paddy marketing
programme of the project, storage need in the cooperative sector was
identified; provisions for grain storage were introduced for cooperative
societies in two rural development projects now- being implemented through
IDA and IFAD assistance.
Economic Re-Evaluation
5.8      Benefits.  At appraisal, the estimated rate of return (ERR) for the
entire project was 21% (14% for the godown, over 50% for the pest control
programme and 24% for the paddy drying scheme). The main quantifiable
benefit was to accrue from savings in storage losses, since the spoilage of
grain in the project godowns was estimated to be much less than what it
would be without the project. As discussed in para 5.4, in the analysis
prepared for this report, much lower savings have been calculated. An
additional benefit considered in this report but not at appraisal was
identified in the course of appraising the Third Foodgrain Storage Project;
it consists of savings in operational costs associated with good quality
storage such as instituted under the project (see Table 13). Benefits from
technical assistance and reorganization of the DOF have not been
quantified. Benefits from paddy drying and pest constrol have also
been excluded from analysis for reasons stated in paras. 3.15 and 5.2. Other
less direct benefits which however are beyond the scope of quantitative
appraisal include: contributions through buffer-stocking to price moderation,
the resource benefits due to improved godown location, contribution to credible
support price purchasing, stimulus to greater production, and improved food
security.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
5.9      For ERR computation, the project was equated to its major component
- godown constructior., and all costs incurred by the project were charged to
it. A modified economic analysis was carried out for the rehabilitation
component.
5.10     Godown  comDonent.   Economic  costs  and  benefit values have been
computed  at  estimated  wrder   prices   (see   Table   14).   Prices   of
internationally traded goods have been converted at an exchange rate of USS1
* Tk26.50. 1990 border prices in 1985 constant terms for paddy, rice and
wheat, derived from IBRO commodity price forecasts have been used in the
analysis 1/ (see Table 15). No distinction has been made in the prices used
for valuing reduced grain losses prior to 1985 as it is insignificant in the
1/ The analysis has been carried out in 1985 prices, with past expenditures
restated in 1985 price terms by using the consumer price index.



context of the overall project. For calculating the economic values of non-
traded goods, the standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.8 has been applied.
The shadow wage rate for unskilled labour has been estimated at 75% of the
financial wage rate. All costs and benefits are expressed in constant 1985
Takas. Based on these assumptions and others detailed in para 5.4 the new
estimated economic rate of return (ERR) for the entire project is about 8%
(see Table 16). The reduction in the ERR for the project from the one
estimated at appraisal is mainly due to (a) lower calculated storage loss
savings, (b) exclusion of net benefits from rehabilitation, pest control and
paddy drying components, (c) lower rice price forecast (US$ 346 fob Bangkok
in 1990 compared to US$ 535 at appraisal, both in 1985 prices), and
(d) slow implementation resulting in a delay of benefits (two years lag).
5.11     Rehabilitation component.  ERR on the rehabilitation component  has
not been separately estimated due to lack of reliable data and the small
volume.of storage capacity involved (10,000 tons). Instead a modified
economic analysis was carried out to test its cost effectiveness.
5.12     Allowing  for  an  average  capacity  utilization  rate  of 70% and
considering a throughput of  1.7 per year,  the   rehabilitation   cost   of
Tk7.08 N 1/ covering 10,000 tons nominal capacity becomes of the order of
Tk595 per ton in terms of quantity stored. When this cost per ton is spread
over 15 years using a discount rate of 12%, rehabilitation cost per ton per
annum comes to about 4% of the value of produce stored, 2/ Justifying
investment in rehabilitation of existing facilities. If rehabilitated
godowns are assumed to have reduced storage losses by the same amount as
the new godowns, savings would be approximately 475 tons. Adding the
benefits from this component would improve overall ERR by almost 0.5%.
VI. IDA PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance
6.1      Bank  assistance  to the project allowed accelerated implementation
of an expanded foodgrain storage  programme  by  the  goverment  to  enable
official purchases of paddy and wheat in the growing areas. Along with the
rapid development of minor irrigation, increased use of fertilizers,
supplies of improved seeds and more effective supporting services for
farmers, it was evidently necessary to give farmers the Incentive of
reliable returns for their crops especially in the period Immediately after
harvest when market prices were habitually depressed by the pressure of
supplies. The central activity of the project thus became the construction
of godowns for procurement in foodgrain surplus areas. An expanded storage
programme naturally required an effective quality and pest control system to
reduce physical losses of foodgrains, and an effective procurement system to
provide buying service for all who wished to sell their grain at the
procurement centres. The project formulation within this context, to which

the  Bank  much  contributed,  is  therefore  considered   appropriate   and
justified.
6.2      The project  has,  however,  encountered  several  problems  during
Implementation. In hindsight, it seems that some of the problems such as
modification of relief storage and reduction in rehabilitation capacity and
land   acquisition   problems  could  have  been  taken  into  account  more
accurately.  The  relief  storage  component  was  neither   considered   at
preparation nor during pre-appraisal of the project. It was included during
appraisal after setting certain criteria for selection of sites. In view of
FAO's Food Security Assistance Scheme, and in the absence of proposals by
the government for relief sites, the Bank, in its first supervision mission
in July 1978 itself indicated to the government that the provision of relief
storage capacity could be used to construct godowns for procurement purposes
outside the 'core' districts. The rehabilitation programme could lot be
implemented fully as appraised as there were not enough godowns to meet  the
target of 25,000 tons within the project area.
Supervision
6.3      IDA  supervisory  performance  wa;  adequate  despite  the numerous
problems the project encountered. The project implementation was monitored
closely  by  the  Bank,  drawing  attention  to  potential  difficulties and
eliciting appropriate action from government agencies such as the MOf,
Planning Commission and PWO. IDA fielded nine missions in the 6 1/2 year
implementation period, 5 by staff in Washington and 4 by staff in RMB.
Supervision missions made also recommendations on the organization of OOFs
operations, notably to shift responsibility for quality control from DICT to
operational managers. Reduction of the pilot drier programme was proposed by
an IDA mission. IDA responded quickly to GOB requests for amendments of the
Credit Agreement and has been flexible in increasing the disbursement rate,
extending the closing date and keeping Credit accounts open, even more than
six months. RMB staff has been instrumental in organizing coordination
meetings between agencies involved, thus filling up the gap caused by the
non-functioning of the Project Steering Committee. IDA responded quickly to
GOB requests for amendments of the Credit Agreement.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.1      The project has made a valuable contribution to the development  of
the country's post harvest sub-sector. Despite the initial delays and the
modifications in scope, the project has achieved its basic objective of
providing needed grain storage facilities. These facilities have helped MOF
to reduce physical losses of foodgrain and to expand its grain procurement
operations, thereby supporting GOB farm price support towards increased
production. The operation of the procurement system, grain quality control
and pest control was only partially improved. Effective working of these
operations is now hampered by managerial weaknesses rather than shortages of
materials or equipment. The results of the pilot scheme of cooperative
marketing enabled BROB to replicate the scheme in other areas. The
reorganization of the Food Directorate and other improvements in the working
of the MOF has enhanced the effectiveness of GOB's foodgrain operations, as
evidenced by the absence of famine conditions during the crisis period of
mid to late 1984 compared to the famine conditions which were evident after
the 1974 floods.



24
7.2      Major lessons which can be learned from the project are that it  is
desirable to:
a) give close attention to acquisition of sites in the project
preparation and appraisal process because land acquisition is a
long and difficult exercise in Bangladesh;
b) consider that, although the Dacca type godown chosen in the project
is sturdy and functional, its costs are high compared to storage
constructions in other countries of the Region. For future storage
programes alternative designs should also be considered and/or the
Dacca type design, which dates back from several decades, should be
carefully reviewed aiming at reducing construction costs;
c) try out artificial drying of paddy first at a small scale to test
its acceptability to farmers and suitability of equipment before
setting up a pilot operation at drying sites;
d) plan and develop grain storage sites for a complete package of
godowns and ancillaries, including concrete yards for receiving,
sun drying and conditioning of procured grain;
e) provide suitable project management and engineering capability in
the Project Implementation Unit within the implementing agency and
take care of continuity of staff;
f) arrange that an engineering consultant, to assist in monitoring
and supervising the construction programme, reports to the project
implementing agency; he should not be contracted by and be
responsible to the agency that is executing the construction
programme;
g) identify rehabilitation programmes for existing storage clearly at
appraisal;
h) obtain a specific commitment from the borrower govermnent in the
Credit Agreement to provide annual budgetary provisions for regular
maintenance works on project facilities;
i) provide the Food Directorate with annual budget for operational
managers to undertake minor repairs and maintenance;
J) attach to the Project Implementation Unit capable accounting staff
to keep project accounts and to prepare and assist other agencies
involved in the timely preparation of disbursement claims;
k) Include a covenant in the OCA requiring  the  Borrower  during  the
whole project to consult with IDA on other storage program_es that
could affect the utilization of project facilities; and
1) include under a storage project a study to assess and evaluate
storage losses in the project storage and in the facilities to be
replaced.

l/ At full development; after applying the SCF; assumptions are
stock turnover 1.7, scorage period Rice/Wheat 8 months, Paddy 4
months, composition of stored grain - Rice 50%, Paddy/Wheat 25%
each.
2/ Based on rent Tk415 per month paid by MOF for 69'x14'x9 with 1,000
ads capacity.
O Unskilled labour 75% of financial cost.
S/ TkO.10 for ad, labour cost estimated to be 10% higher for rented
storage owing to small capacity and scattered location.
5/ Two guards required for LSO with 4,000 tons at a financial cost of
Tk6,400/man-year. Due to scattered location of rented storage, 3
guards would be required.
6/ Estimated at 1.5% of civil works cost (Tk623.97 million) for new
godowns, 5% of rental fees for rented storage.
7/ Includes preventive spraying with Malathion; three fuaigations
for new godown and five for rented storage.
8/ New godowns at Tk3,000-4,000 per month for 7,500 ton capacity LSD;
assumed 50% of this for rented storage.
