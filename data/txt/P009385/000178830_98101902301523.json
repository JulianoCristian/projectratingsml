The project will assist the\n            government in implementing a farm gate price support\n            program. By enabling the Government to increase its levels\n            of domestic foodgrain procurement the project would increase\n            production and farmer income. Losses would also be reduced\n            by improvements in pest control and paddy drying operations.\n            There is a risk that increases in the supply of grain in the\n            project area would be inadequate to permit the economic\n            utilization of the net addition to storage capacity made\n            available under the project. However, given the\n            Government's efforts to expand production and domestic\n            procurement, the risk is not considered large. The credit\n            will finance storage facilities, essential equipment,\n            vehicles, mechanical drying facilities and technical\n            assistance to (a) increase storage capacity and improve\n            farmer access to Government procurement centers; (b)\n            strengthen grain inspection and pest control operations; and\n            (c) develop the marketing potential of selected Thana\n            Centeral Cooperative Associations. A study of private\n            storage would be undertaken to identify constraints and\n            investment needs"}, "docdt": "1978-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
