No evidence exists yet to show that program quality\n            improvements have translated into better labor market\n            absorption of graduates or better paying jobs. Thus, it is\n            too early to measure the impact on the productive capacity\n            of the economy, the ultimate goal of the project. The most\n            pertinent of the lessons learned include the following: The\n            competitive grants program used for the engineering\n            education programs was an effective mechanism to bring about\n            quality improvements in universities. The World Bank must\n            ensure that government regulations do not conflict with\n            procedures for implementing project activities, and that\n            joint planning with Government entities are completed during\n            project preparation. Project start-up was delayed because of\n            financing for project activities prior to effectiveness.\n            That government procurement methods and Bank Standard\n            Bidding Documents should be discussed prior to effectiveness\n            supports the recent decision by the Bank to require a\n            detailed procurement plan and manual prior to effectiveness.\n            Project objectives were clear and consistent with the\n            Government strategy for improving engineering and technical\n            education. Projects that are a part of a broader strategy of\n            reform pursued by the Government can be a catalyst leading\n            to a full reform program. A full-time project management\n            team is key."}, "docdt": "1999-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
