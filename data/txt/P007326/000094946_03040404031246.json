The lessons learned indicate that social\n            capital building in a sector should be supported by the\n            financial engagement of the Government. Although defined as\n            units serving the government, project management units\n            should be politically solvent institutions designed to\n            fulfill the project's objectives. The concept of\n            politically solvent project management units could be\n            negotiated during the project preparation. Project staff,\n            whether temporary or permanent should be hired on their\n            professional merits and on their demonstrated commitment to\n            address environmental issues. A core group of qualified\n            permanent staff should be hired to constitute the backbone\n            of the project ensuring that technical knowledge and skills\n            are absorbed by the staff. Local communities,\n            non-governmental organizations, private sector, and state\n            partnership can be successful when the roles are well\n            specified. It also became evident that external financial\n            support was a very important factor in facilitating\n            partnership. Government counterpart funding and support is\n            imperative for the ownership and sustainability of the project."}, "docdt": "2002-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
