 satisfactory; GEO outcome were moderately satisfactory; risk\n            to development outcome was moderate; risk to GEO outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: timing of European Union (EU)\n            pre-accession and accession process. When defining broad\n            objectives as a partner to implement activities such as EU\n            accession negotiations, the Bank has little control on\n            timing and in phasing its activities requiring a very\n            flexible implementation approach where procurement often\n            fills immediate needs that may not have been fully\n            identified at project preparation. This project as most\n            projects of this sort supporting EU pre-accession invested\n            very substantial portions of the funding in building\n            government owned national reference testing capacity.\n            Investments for mitigation of environmental pollution\n            measures in agriculture depend on public support and\n            incentives and minimum farm size. The EU accession agenda,\n            successful partnership with other donors and strengthening\n            capacities for the country to effectively absorb and\n            administer EU funding remain the primary focus of the\n            Bank's ongoing engagement in Croatia. This approach has\n            a great potential to be replicated in other neighboring\n            countries aspiring for EU membership."}, "docdt": "2013-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
