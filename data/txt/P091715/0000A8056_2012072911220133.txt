                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This final Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) for the Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project (AACP) and the associated Agricultural Pollution Control Project (APCP)
                         reflects the implementation and performance of the components and activities of these two projects and assesses overall progress on achieving the projects’ development objectives.

                         The AACP Project Development Objective (PDO) to develop sustainable systems and capacities within the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure timely compliance with the EU acquis
                         conditions in the rural sector has been achieved. The same is true for the APCP PDO aimed to significantly increase the use of environmentally friendly agriculture practices by
                         farmers in Croatia’s Danube River Basin in order to reduce nutrient discharge from agriculture sources to surface and ground water bodies. All activities under the AACP and APCP
                         are substantially completed and most of the end projects’ targets have been reached.

                         The AACP activities contributed to country's successful closure of EU Acquis Chapter 11 on Agriculture and Rural Development that was closed in December 2010 and Chapter 12
                         on Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy closed in mid-April 2011. The Project has supported activities related to harmonization with EU acquis directives, food, plant and
                         animal safety and capacity building of the management and staff of the Ministry of Agriculture. Some of the key AACP results include the following: establishment of EU-compliant
                         payment system for the agriculture and rural development sector (the Paying Agency for Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development (PAAFRD) has established payment system
                         for IPARD fund management, including an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) incorporating a Land Parcel Information System (LPIS); the construction of new
                         buildings for the Seeds and Seedlings Institute (SSI) and the associated Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) laboratory in Osijek is completed as well as the construction of the
                         new Plant Protection Institute building in Zagreb; the Ministry of Agriculture data management center is operational and phytosanitary and veterinary information system are
                         developed; the rehabilitation of the national and regional veterinary laboratory institutes is completed and key laboratory tests at the National Veterinary Institute and regional
                         veterinary centers have been ISO 17025 certified; training has been completed with fifty six short and long term scholarships approved, English language training program has
                         included 500 Ministerial staff and 700 staff benefited from the computer training program. To date, 97 percent of loan funds have been disbursed and 100 percent committed.

                         The APCP continues to make a steady progress across all components. Presently, disbursements stand at 83 percent and all grant funds have been committed. 66 applications for
                         construction of manure storage platforms under the 2.6 million US$ Nitrates Mitigation Investment Fund have been received out of which 50 farm investments have been contracted.
                         The construction of 30 platforms is complete and the remaining ones will be completed by the Grant closing date of July 31, 2012. Demonstration plots on 87 farms with 1400 ha of
                         arable land have been incorporated in the good agriculture practice demonstrations. The Project has supported major public awareness activities with some 390 lectures, seminars
                         and media appearances aimed at the end beneficiaries -- Croatian farmers.
