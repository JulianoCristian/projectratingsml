                            RESTRUCTURING PAPER




SUMMARY
The proposed changes are necessary to complete activities under Component 3, Ensuring
Safe Food and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Conditions, that implement ISO 17025 testing
methodologies in line with the EU requirements for plant health services and
phytosanitary policy and thus would allow the project to fully achieve its project
development objective (PDO). The changes are: (i) five-month closing date extension;
(ii) reallocation of loan proceeds; and (iii) revision of the implementation schedule to
complete Component 3 activities. The restructuring of the project does not involve any
changes in the PDO, its scope, or design.


      PROJECT STATUS
Project performance is satisfactory and the project continues to make steady progress
across all components. The project development objective to develop sustainable system
and capacities within the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Management
(MAFRD) to ensure timely compliance with EU acquis conditions in rural sector is well
underway of being fully achieved. Most of the project end targets have been reached.
Croatia successfully closed Chapter 11 on Agriculture and Rural Development in
December 2010 and Chapter 12 on Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Policy in
mid-April 2011. Some of the project’s results include the following: Croatia Seeds and
Seedlings Institute (CSSI) Genetically Modified Organisms laboratory is completed; the
construction of the new Plant Protection Institute (PPI)/Horticulture Institute building
will be completed by early February 2012; the Paying Agency for Agriculture, Fisheries
and Rural Development (PAAFRD) has established an EU-compliant system for IPARD
fund management, including an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)
incorporating a Land Parcel Information System (LPIS); the MAFRD integrated data
management center is operational; the rehabilitation of the national and regional
veterinary laboratory institutes is completed and key laboratory tests at the National
Veterinary Institute and regional veterinary centers have been ISO 17025 certified.

Disbursements now stand at 88.26 percent and commitments represent 96 percent of the
total loan amount.


      PROPOSED CHANGES
The proposed changes would consist of:


                                           3
   •   Extension of Loan Closing Date. Although the Borrower has requested a six-
       month extension of the loan closing date from February 28, 2012 to August 31,
       2012, a five-month extension to July 31, 2012 is proposed. This extension would
       provide the Borrower with sufficient time to complete the procurement and
       installation of laboratory furnishings for an annex of the Plant Protection Institute
       in Zagreb while allowing the loan to close concurrently with the associated GEF-
       funded Agricultural Pollution Control Project (APCP) which closes on July 31,
       2012. This would also enable both the Bank and the Borrower to prepare one,
       consolidated Implementation Completion and Results Report for the two projects
       within the same timeframe. The extension would support the Borrower’s capacity
       in implementing food safety and phytosanitary policies in compliance with EU
       requirements as the new plant health reference laboratories will be implementing
       ISO 17025 testing methodologies critical for securing access of Croatian farmers
       to the EU food market.
       An old summer house on the site of the PPI is almost completely restored and has
       been annexed to a new PPI building. Its restoration took longer than planned and
       delayed tendering of its laboratory furnishings. However, all tender specifications
       are ready to be launched pending approval of closing date extension.
       This would be the second extension of the project. The original closing date was
       October 31, 2010. In June 2010, the Bank extended the closing date by 16 months
       until February 28, 2012 to enable completion of construction activities, in
       particular the Plant Protection Institute.

       The Borrower has presented a clear time line for the procurement process which
       has been reviewed by the Task Team and deemed realistic.

   •   Reallocation of Loan Proceeds. The request also includes reallocation of funds
       from the goods; consultants’ services and training; and operating costs categories
       to the works category amounting to a €805,277 to finance additional costs
       associated with the completion of construction and rehabilitation works for
       regional veterinary institute in Rijeka and the PPI building in Zagreb.

       With the proposed reallocation of funds, the disbursement categories would be
       amended as follows:


                            Amount of the Loan Allocated
                            (Expressed in Euro)                        % of Expenditures
Category                                                               to be financed

    Facility                                                          2.02 (b) of the

                                                                      Agreement

   •    Implementation Schedule. A revised implementation plan has been reviewed by
        the Bank’s Task Team and was found to be realistic with full utilization of project
        funds.
