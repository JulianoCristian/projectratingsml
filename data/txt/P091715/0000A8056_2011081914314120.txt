                         Implementation Status Overview
                           Agriculture Acquis Cohesion Project (AACP) continues to make steady progress across all components. Recommendations made during November 2010 implementation support
                         mission have been either completed or progressed satisfactorily. Disbursements stand at 64.4 percent with commitments standing at 92 percent. The Croatia Seeds and Seedlings
                         Institute (CSSI) Genetically Modified Organisms laboratory is completed. The construction of the Plant Protection Institute (PPI)/Horticulture Institute building, with minor variations, is
                         on schedule for completion by the project closing date (February 28, 2012). The Paying Agency for Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development (PAAFRD), with project support,
                         has established an EU compliant system for IPARD fund management, including an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) incorporating a Land Parcel Information
                         System (LPIS). The rehabilitation of the national and regional veterinary laboratory institutes is on schedule and key laboratory tests at the National Veterinary Institute and regional
                         veterinary centers have been ISO 17025 certified.

                         Capacity building activities for the administration and management of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development (MAFRD) are progressing well. Notably, fifty six
                         short and long term scholarships training program are under implementation as is an English language training program including approximately 500 MAFRD staff. Training of farmer
                         associations in EU integration is ongoing and a strong interest by farmers associations has been indicated (several study tours are underway and about 18 requests for training and
                         study tours are in the pipeline).

                         The MAFRD is preparing a rural development program for 2011-2012 in support of expected EU integration during this period and will, thereafter, commence work on a rural
                         development plan to accommodate expected 2013 EU Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reforms.

                         The implementation of Agriculture Pollution Control Project (APCP) has been improving. Disbursements now stand at 27 percent with commitments standing at 60 percent. Total of
                         15 grants for on-farm manure platforms, valued at US$ 1.14 million, has been approved. The construction of six platforms has been completed and five more have been contracted.
                         In order to accelerate farmer application rates for construction of on-farm manure platforms and speed up disbursement of grant funds, certain revisions to the IPARD compliant
                         Beneficiary and Public Procurement Guide (Project Operation Manual) have been discussed and agreed upon. These include upfront grant payment of 55 percent and time reduction
                         for administrative processing from 12 to seven months provided that documentation and on-the-spot control are satisfactory.
