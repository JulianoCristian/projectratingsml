                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the Bank's approval to extend the closing date of Agriculture Acquis Cohesion Project from February 28, 2012 to July 31, 2012 and to reallocate loan proceeds to
                         finance additional costs associated with the construction and rehabilitation works of the regional veterinary institute in Rijeka and the Plant Protection Institute in Zagreb. The closing
                         date of the Dutch Grant attached to the Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project (AACP) was also extended until July 31, 2012 to enable a successful completion of the remaining grant
                         activities, in particular training and study tours for Croatian farmers to enhance their ability to use common agricultural policy and their future participation in the common EU market.

                         The five-month extension of the project closing date became necessary in order to enable procurement of laboratory furnishings for the Plant Protection Institute in Zagreb. This
                         would contribute to a successful completion of the Component 3 on Ensuring Safe Food and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Conditions as these laboratories will be implementing testing
                         methodologies in line with the EU requirements for plant health and phytosanitary policies. The extended project closing date from February 28, 2012 to July 31, 2012 will enable
                         procurement and installation of laboratory furnishings in the newly constructed Plant Protection Institute building in Zagreb.

                         Project performance is satisfactory and the project continues to make steady progress across all components. The project development objective to develop sustainable system and
                         capacities within the Ministry of Agriculture to ensure timely compliance with EU acquis conditions in rural sector is well underway of being fully achieved. Most of project end targets
                         have been reached. Croatia successfully closed Chapter 11 on Agriculture and Rural Development in December 2010 and Chapter 12 on Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary
                         Policy in mid-April 2011. Some of the results of the project include the following: Croatia Seeds and Seedlings Institute (CSSI) Genetically Modified Organisms laboratory is
                         completed; the construction of the new PPI/Horticulture Institute building completed in February 2012; the Paying Agency for Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development (PAAFRD)
                         has established an EU compliant system for IPARD fund management, including an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) incorporating a Land Parcel Information
                         System (LPIS); the MAFRD integrated data management center is operational; the rehabilitation of the national and regional veterinary laboratory institutes is completed and key
                         laboratory tests at the National Veterinary Institute and regional veterinary centers have been certified. To date, 94 percent of loan funds have been disbursed and 97 percent
                         committed.
