was achieved. Over a period of seven years Bank\n            management remained committed despite years of frustration\n            to convincing the Government that a fundamental\n            reorientation of its policies was required to lay the basis\n            for sustainable growth. Not only was the Government finally\n            convinced, in addition a national consensus emerged in Benin\n            that structural adjustment was inevitable, and beneficial.\n            Two mains lessons can be drawn from SAL I i) the importance\n            of maintaining the policy dialogue even when progress\n            towards adoption of an adjustment program is slow, and ii)\n            the positive contribution that firmness and joint donor\n            action can make to re-establish conditions conducive to\n            program implementation and sustainability. In conclusion,\n            initial difficulties in program execution were overcome and\n            permitted a significant improvement in economic performance\n            once adjustment measures were consistently pursued. Given\n            the extent of Benin's economic deterioration prior to\n            adoption of the adjustment program, the progress made under\n            SAL I in 1990 and 1991 is commendable and forms the basis\n            for deepening the adjustment process. It will, nonetheless,\n            take many years of strong adjustment to remove the\n            deep-seated constraints to growth, particularly in view of\n            the economy's heavy dependence on a few export commodities."}, "docdt": "1992-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
