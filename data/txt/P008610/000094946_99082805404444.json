World Bank and Borrower performances\n            rated satisfactory overall. The overall sustainability of\n            the project is unclear due to uncertainties over technical\n            procedures for forest management and mechanization; the\n            impact of adverse input/output values on economic viability\n            of the forest sector; and weak support for national parks\n            development. Five key lessons result: In a country with\n            strong traditions in forestry production, well-trained\n            personnel, a clear development program and implementation\n            capacity, the main benefits are in introducing modern\n            technologies and institution strengthening. Second, forest\n            establishment and management innovations have to be\n            supported by hard evidence of their technical, financial,\n            environmental, and economic advantage. In-depth technical\n            and economic analysis of the comparative advantage of\n            options and alternative project designs is essential. Third\n            commitment must be obtained during the appraisal process on\n            the source of financing. Fourth, the design of institutional\n            development activities should emphasize the need for\n            financial and economic sustainability. Finally, the Bank\n            should pay more attention to ensuring that problems arising\n            during project implementation are thoroughly addressed\n            during supervision, and realistic solutions agreed."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
