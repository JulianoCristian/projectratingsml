The project\n            will also fund the procurement of specialized equipment to\n            assist those states in monitoring the condition and usage of\n            their networks, and to promote road safety. The training of\n            staff, technical assistance to emphasize the planning,\n            design and implementation of projects and to develop the\n            skills of the road maintenance staff will also be financed\n            under the loan.  Finally, the project will finance the\n            service of consultants for the introduction of pavement\n            managment systems and for the supervision of several of the\n            project's contracts."}, "docdt": "1988-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
