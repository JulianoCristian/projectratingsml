MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
AND TO THE FONDS D'EQUIPEMENT CCiKMUNAL
FOR A FIRST MUNICIPAL FINANCE PROJECT
1 *       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on proposed loans of US$4 million to th. Xingdom of Morocco and of US$100 million
to the Fonds d'Equipement Communal (FEC), with the guarantee of the Kingdom of
Morocco, for a First Municipal Finance Project which combines two interrelated
projects with the effectiveness of the FEC loan being conditional upon the
effectiveness of the Kingdom loan and any default by the Government on its locn
being an event of default of the FEQ's loan. The loans would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest r,te, with a maturity of 20 years, including five
years of grace.
2.        Background. The local sector in Morocco generates almost 5 percent of
GDP, even with present low service and investment levels. Most urban services
such as potable water supply, sewerage, solid waste and disposal, and markets are
deficient, while local governments and their enterprises strive to cope with an
urban population growing at about 4 percent p.a. To achieve acceptable levels
of local services, Morocco's local governments need to invest about US$600
million p.a. over this decade. Yet limited financial resources now constrain
investment levels to some US$400 million p.a., despite the fiscal reform of 1988,
which allocated 30 percent of the value-added tax (VAT) to local governments.
3.        Although the paucity of funds is a binding constraint, Morocco has
ample margin to improve sector policies and institutions. Leaving distribution
of the local share of the VAT among local governments largely to Government
discretion is conducive neither to an efficient allocation of resources nor to
the accountability of elected local authorities to their constituencies (para.
10). In particular, the distribution of part of the local share of the VAT on
the basis of forecast budget deficits, which include debt service, encourages
local governments to finance low-priority investments with debt beyond their
capacity to pay with their own resources. Although the Government has just
implemented a reform of local taxes aiming to increase local government revenues,
it can further improve the country's local and intergovernmental finance. This
ought to be considered once a reform of the system to distribute the local share
of the VAT ia introduced and results of the reform of local taxes can be
assessed.
4.        The local sector in Morocco comprises the following institutionss
(a) about 1,600 urban municipalities and rural communes governed by elected
officials, but for which the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) approves budgets and
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) manages cash; (b) provinces (which comprise
municipalities and rural communes), a hybrid of local government and line unit
within NOI; (c) the R6gies, semi-autonomous water distribution, power
distribution, and urban transportation agencies serving the major citiess and (d)
FEC, the municipal finance agency. Local governments lack sufficient trained
staff and adequate management systems. The Government, for its part, lacks
adeauate systems to monitor sector performance. The Rhgles, under the tutelage
of local authorities and MOI, generally perform well below the standards of
business enterprises. Ongoing and planned water and sewerage sector projects
will address their problems. FEC, until recently a government fund managed by
the Caisse de D6p8ts et de Gestion (CDG - an agency that manages government



- 2 -
pension funds), has lacked standard banking procedures, effective control by MOY,
and supervision by the Central Bank (Banque Al-Kaghrib - BM). Yet, FEC will
continue to dominate municipal finance until local governments can manage their
own cash (for use as collateral for commercial bank loans).   Following the
recommendations of Bank sector and completion reports, the Government began
restructuring FEC by converting it into a legally autonomous financial agency
overseen by both MOI and MOP and supervised as a financial institution by BM
(para. 10). Furthermore, FEC's Board has approved a comprehensive statement of
sound lending and financial policies (Policy Statement) giving FEC effective
managerial autonomy. Also, the Government, by the end of May 1993, plans to
contribute an additional DH 75 million to FEC's equity, and local governments,
at the Government's request, will take charge of their enterprises' loans in
arrears with FEC, to bring down FEC's debt-to-equity ratio to 15 to 1 (previously
70 to 1) by the end of 1993. These measures, together with FEC's financial
undertakifls (para. 12) provide FEC with financial independence. FEC, moreover,
has been able to submit the appraisal of several subprojects complying with its
recently approved Policy Statement.
5.        To overcome the above constraints (para. 3), the Government plans to
distribute most of the local sbare of the VAT among loeal governments for
coverage of operating costs, debt service, and investments on the basis of
objective criteria. Under this reform, no less than 50 percent of the local
share of the VAT will be distributed on the basis of population, per capita
endowment of tax base (poorer communities will receive more per capita), and
collection rate of some taxes as an incentive to local effort; MOI will still
enforce repayment of FEC's debt as a first priority and approve local budgets.
in addition, the Government will: (a) formulate a strategy to further improve
iPtergovernmental finance and local taxation; (b) carry out an action plan to
upgrade local government capacity as well as the Central Government's information
system for the local sector; and (c) to the extent possible, help the local
sector reach an investment level of around US$500 million p.a.
6.        Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project aims tot (a) improve the
efficiency of local investments (partly by restructuring FEC); (b) improve the
distribution of the local share of the VAT and lay the basis for further
improving intergovernmental finance; (c) increase the availability and improve
the delivery of local services; and (d) upgrade the management of local
governments and central tutelage over the local sector.
7.        Proiect Delcriftion. The project will be implemented between 1993 and
1999, albeit substantially completed in early 1998. It includes the following
components: (a) funding for local investments (96.8 percent of total project
cost), excluding major water systems and rural power systems, which other Bank
loans will assist; (b) technical assistance, training, and equipment to increase
FEC's capabilities (0.4 percent); (c) training for local, government staff
(1.3 percent); and (d) purchase of computer equipment and software, training for
central government officials, and studies to improve local sector management
(1. S percent). These studies aim to: (i) formulate a strategy to improve further
intergovernmental finance and local taxation, including an assessment of
prospects for privatizing local services; (ii) introduce improved reporting,
accounting and budgeting systems for local governments; and (iii) introduce a
system to produce, collect, and disseminate information on local governments from
a centralized data base. Tarms of reference for the studies have been agreed
upon. The total cost of tte project is US$182.3 million with a foreign exchange
content of US$68.2 million (FEC, with other funds, will finance a larger part of
the local sector investment program). A breakdown of costs and the financing



plan for the proposed project are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement are in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Grcup operations are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively.
8.        proict Imylementation.  The Kingdom of Morocco will borrow US$4.0
million for training and technical assistance to improve local sector management
systems.   FEC will borrow US$100.0 million for financing local investment
projects and its own institutional improvement. Local governments will carry out
most investments. MOI, in coordination with MOP, will carry out the studies on
local finance, information systems of the local sector, investments and the data
base, as well as training for the local sector.  FEC will finance priority
investments thats (a) match eligible sectors as indicated in FEC's Policy
Statementt (3) meet FEC's borrower and project eligibility criteria; and (c) have
been listed in the local authorities' investment programs. In general, FEC will
apply the same eligibility criteria, standards, and lending conditions to all its
operations, regardless of sources of financing. Eligible sectors Include water,
sewerage, solid waste, markets, communal facilities, and some productive
facilities such as slaughterhouses and markets. Eligibility criteria include
maximum debt service ratios for borrowers and minimum economic rates of return
of 10 percent for projects. FEC will lend An local currency at both variable and
fixed interest rates. Its average interest is estimated at around 14.5 percent
over the project period. That rate includess a 2 percentage point margin to
cover costs and commercial risk; a 0.5 percentage point margin to cover interest
risk (for fixed-rate loans); and an estimated 4 percentage point margin to cover
the cost to FEC of the foreign exchange risk which the Government assumes. The
Government, out of its own resources, covers the foreign exchange losses under
the Bank loan over the "reference cost," which is equivalent to average rates
paid on bank term deposits, plus 0.75 percentage points. FEC will supervise
subprojects and manage a special account of US$6 millicni to expedite payments for
project expenditures from Bank loan proceeds. The Government for its part will
manage a special account of US$0.25 million. FEC is already capable of managing
project start up and will further enhance its capabilities by, first, hiring new
staff, and, second, improving management systems through technical assistance
financed by USAID and French agencies early Luring project execution and later
by the present project. Ministerial units that carry out training and supervise
consultants for the studies are well organized and staffed with qualified
professionals.
9.        Proiect Sustainability. The project is designed to lay the groundwork
for further upgrading of intergovernmental finance in Morocco, foster FEC's
financial viability, and improve the capabilities of FEC and the local
governments. This will support project objectives as well as overall sector
improvement beyond project completion.
10.       Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. Bank's past involvement in the
sector includes a pilot project, and sector and economic work. The completion
report for the pilot project recommended that FEC supervise projects more closely
and become managerially autonomous, recommendations that underlie the proposed
project design. The sector report on local finance identified the issues that
pervade project conditionality (paras. 3, 4 and 12). The sector report on issues
and prospects of the public sector concludes that the system to distribute the
VAT share among local governments has been detrimental to savings performance by
local governments. The reform of that system is a major policy objective of the
present project (paras. 5 and 12).



-4-
11.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project supports the main pillars
of the Bank's country assistance strategy for Morocco, as discusse( in the Board
in February 1993. First, the project is designed to enhance the efficiency of
the public sector management. This is expected to be achieved through the reform
of the system to distribute the local share of the VAT among local governments,
and through the restructuring of FEC. Second, improved local sector performance
will necessarily help consolidate and deepen macroeconomic adjustment by
extending the reform beyond the Cenrtal Government level. Third, the project
will help alleviate poverty and improve social indicators, as it will improve the
coverage and quality of essential services for the poor. Fourth, the project,
mitinly by increasing local transport infrastructure and the reliebility of watqr
and power services in many municipalities, will help the private sector achieve
its potential as an engine of growth. Finally, the project specifically aims to
improve water resource and environmental management, as project eligibility
criteria include conditionalities to foater cost recovery -- notably to reduce
the wastage of water -- control any adverce environmental impact, and enhance
FEC's environmental competence and improve its coordination of environmental
management with the central and Local governmentes
12.       Aareed Actions. Main sector issues the project will address are the
paucity of funds, the weakness of sector institutions including FEC, the
inadequacy of the system to allocate the local share of the VAT, and the
difficulties in monitoring local sector performance.  In addition to project
components, the following conditionalities agreed with the Moroccan authorities
address these issuess (a) By the end of May 1993, the Government will contribute
DH 75 million to FEC equity. (b) As conditions of effectiveness of the FEC loan:
(i) local governments will have assumed or guaranteed their Regies' loans in
arrears with FEC; and (ii) FEC will have appointed its four main line managers
and two environmental specialists.  (c) During neootiations, the Government
confirmed that it would: (i) introduce a new system to distribute the local share
of the VAT among local governments by 1995 (unavailability of data on 600 new
municipalities precludes an earlier introduction); (ii) implement the plan agreed
with the Bank (paras. 3.6 and 5.4 of SAR), during project execution, to improve
local sector management, including training; and (iii) take all measures to
enable FEC to comply with its obligation under the FEC loan agreement (including,
if needed, an equity contribution of DH 60 million to enable FEC to achieve the
debt-to-equity ratio target for 1997). (d) Durino neaotiations, FEC confirmed
that it woulds (i) adhere to and maintain the agreed Policy Statement and related
project eligibility criteria and subloan conditionality; (ii) gradually increase
return on assets to 1.2 percent by 1997; (iii) maintain operating costs at no
more than 0.75 percent of assets; (iv) maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of not
more than 15 to 1 in 1993, 1994, and 1995 and of not more than 12 to 1 in 1997
and thereafter; and (v) implement the plan agreed with the Bank (paras. 4.9 and
5.4 of SAR), during project execution, to improve its capabilities, including
training.  Durina negotiations, an understanding was also achieved on carrying
out annual reviews (including a major mid-term review) to assess project
performance with FEC and the Government, as well as the implementation of a
system, to monitor that performance, according to a set of indicators.
13.       Environmental Aspects. Many subprojects, particularly those in water,
sewerage, and solid waste collection and disposal, will have a positive
environmental impact.   Any possible adverse environmental impact will be
screened, assessed, and mitigated as needed, consistent with the present
project'.3 environmental category of "B." FEC will approve a subproject for a
sewerage system, solid waste collection and disposal, marketplace, or
slaughterhouse only when such a subproject or any other subproject by the ame



-5-
beneficiary addresses all significantly adverse environmental aspects. FEC will
employ two environmental specialists to assess environmental issues. When the
Environmental secretariat of OI--with Bank asaistance--becomes operational, FEC
will comply with the guidelines of the Secretariat and clear with it
environmentally complex subprojects, as needed.
14.       Benefits. The project, with improved services, would benefit about two
million people living in urban and rural agglomerations, including many poor.
All investments financed under the loan will have high priority and meet
demanding quality criteria. Subprojects will have an economic rate of return of
at least ten percent. Further, project benefits are expected to go well beyond
Bank-financed investments on at least three additional counts. First, policy
reforms and project conditionalities are designed to increase the officiency of
all investments--regardless of sources of financing--through the local sector.
Second, actions to improve management systems of local governments and cen..ral
authorities dealing with the local sector are designed to improve local services
and the financial performance of local entities. Third, the restructuring of FEC
and the reform of the distribution of the local share of the VAT are designed to
enhance the financial discipline of local governments and thus increase their
savings. These amount to a substantial reform in terma of economic public sector
management.
15.       Risks. Improving local services and sector management countrywide is
an ambitious undertaking which will require sustained effort for many years. The
project addresses key sector issues and involves many agencies, some of which are
institutionally and operation&lly weak. Three main risks have been identified.
The first is that limited project preparation capacity at the local level
compounded by a still untested restructured FEC may result in a slow pipeline of
quality subprojects and thus delay project execution. FEC's rapid appraisal of
some eligible subprojects complying with its new Policy Statement has already
mitigated this risk (para. 4). Training of local government staff and technical
assistance to FEC will further reduce that risk later. The second main project
risk is that FEC's management and goterning bodies may fail to uphold their
demanding Policy Statement. Government and Bank collaboration in designing the
new FEC have already reduced this risk. Financial conditionalities should reduce
it further. The third major risk is that political pressures may undermina the
Government's resolve to maintain the reform in the distribution of the local
share of the VAT.  Intense discussion of sector issues throughout project
preparation have already reduced this risk. Implementing the VAT reform early
during p:oject executLon will further reduce such a risk. The annual reviews of
project performance including a major mid-term project performance one should
additionally mitigate all major project risks.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loans.
