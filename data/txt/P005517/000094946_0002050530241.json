 satisfactory, sustainability is likely, and, both the Bank,\n            and the Borrower's performances were satisfactory.\n            Lessons suggest that: 1) an efficient management of local\n            resources, and expenditures is critical for building\n            creditworthiness of local communities and their investment\n            programs, to further establish sound intergovernmental\n            finance systems, with the appropriate incentives in the\n            process of decentralization. However, the experience of this\n            project indicates that a lot remains to be done to\n            rationalize the allocation of powers, and responsibilities,\n            between the Central and Local Governments, an issue to be\n            addressed in future operations; 2) while the Communal\n            Infrastructure Fund stands as a solid financial institution,\n            following its restructuring, there is still the need to\n            improve monitoring practices in post-evaluation of projects,\n            to prevent risking funds, and future operations as well. In\n            addition, environmental concerns were not fully integrated\n            into the evaluation process, and it will need to be\n            introduced in future routine operations; 3) although at\n            appraisal, extensive training was included for strengthening\n            the local governments' capacity, the component was\n            dropped due to a reluctant Government to pursue the program\n            as such. However, external financing could have been\n            mobilized, and, training ensured at negotiations."}, "docdt": "1999-12-30T00:00:00Z"}
