the proposed project is a\n            large program of action which is aimed at improving\n            operational and financial performance, and which includes\n            measures to strengthen the railway's organization,\n            management, and staff training. To complement the action\n            program, the project also provides for some important\n            physical investments designed to improve productivity. The\n            main components are: (i) track renewal (about 60 km); (ii)\n            procurement of track maintenance equipment and materials,\n            spare parts for motive power and rolling stock and workshop\n            equipment; (iii) extension and rehabilitation works at the\n            Dakar-Bel Air marshalling yard; (iv) a three-year training\n            program for selected middle- and high-level managers and\n            about 300 skilled laborers and low-level supervisors\n            annually; and (v) consulting services for studies. The\n            project will yield direct benefits mainly from\n            rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and rolling stock."}, "docdt": "1978-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
