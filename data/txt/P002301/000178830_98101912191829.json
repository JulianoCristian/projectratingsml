To complement the action\n            program, the project also provides for some important\n            physical investments designed to improve productivity. The\n            main components are: (i) track renewal (about 60 km); (ii)\n            procurement of track maintenance equipment and materials,\n            spare parts for motive power and rolling stock and workshop\n            equipment; (iii) extension and rehabilitation works at the\n            Dakar-Bel Air marshalling yard; (iv) a three-year training\n            program for selected middle- and high-level managers and\n            about 300 skilled laborers and low-level supervisors\n            annually; and (v) consulting services for studies. The\n            project will yield direct benefits mainly from\n            rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and rolling stock."}, "docdt": "1978-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
