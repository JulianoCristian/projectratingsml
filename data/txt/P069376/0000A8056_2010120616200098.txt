                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global objective of this project is to support the reduction and eventual stoppage of production of CFCs as mandated by the MOntreal Protcol. India is now
                         the second largest CFC producer in the world after China. Final stoppage of CFC production by 2010 will be a major milestone in achieving the global
                         environmental objective with regards to helping restore the stratosperic ozone layer. Project outcomes are monitored through the independent verification of
                         CFC production against a CFC production quota at individual plant levels and national aggregate levels.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The ODS III project has met its Development Objective of supporting GoI to meet its obligation under the Montreal Protocol to phase out both production and consumption of
                         Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2010. However GOI took a more proactive approach to bring forward the phase-out date to August 1, 2008. This target was also satisfactorily

                         completed and submitted in October 2010. Both these documents will be reviewed at the Executive Committee meeting in November 2010. The Government of India had requested

                         Essential Use Exceptions for the production of pharmaceutical grade CFCs for manufacturing of Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI). This was approved by the Executive Committee and
                         GOI issued quota orders for the production of 343 metric tons of CFC in 2010. The Bank has been requested to undertake the related verification audit in 2011 for this activity.
                         Technical Assistance activities have been implemented satisfactorily, with the support of UNEP. The next formal review mission will be undertaken in January or February 2011.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The 2010 audit found that there was a stock of 11mt of CFCs with one of the CFC producers which have not yet been exported for destruction. The Ozone Cell will monitor this
                         issue and ensure that the stocks are brought down to zero, as per the Acceleration CFC Phaseout Plan, agreed with ExCom in July 2008.
                         Signing of the Performance Agreement between Ozone Cell and the CFC producers is a critical requirement for the release of additional funding approved under the Accelerated
                         CFC Phaseout Plan.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
