                         Global Environmental Objectives
                         Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The global objective of this project is to support the reduction and eventual stoppage of production of CFCs as mandated by the MOntreal Protcol. India is now
                         the second largest CFC producer in the world after China. Final stoppage of CFC production by 2010 will be a major milestone in achieving the global
                         environmental objective with regards to helping restore the stratosperic ozone layer. Project outcomes are monitored through the independent verification of
                         CFC production against a CFC production quota at individual plant levels and national aggregate levels.

                         Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by August 1, 2008. However, upon request from Government of India, the Executive Committee of the Montreal Protocol allowed India to produce and

                         Indian producers have not exceeded the quote requirements; and are therefore in compliance with the obligations under the Montreal Protocol. Technical Assistance activities have
                         been implemented satisfactorily, with the support of UNEP. The project has been extended until December 2011 to allow for completion of TA activities and disbursement of all funds
