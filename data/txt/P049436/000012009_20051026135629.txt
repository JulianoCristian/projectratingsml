INTRODUCTION
1 .1. GENERAL BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT PROJECT
Originally under the jurisdiction of Sichuan Province, China, Chongqing was designated in March
1997as a Municipality directly under the control of the Central Government, the fourth after
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Chongqing has an area of 82,400km2 and a population about 31
million, with 6 million inhabiting in urban districts. Due to its special location and economic
advantages, Chongqing has become the largest economic center in the west of China, the
increasinaly important brdge and ties linking the so-called West Chongqing (Yuxi)-Chengdu
industrial and economic corridor in the west, connecting the technological and economic zones
along the east coastal line of China through the Yangtze River via the Three Gorges to the east.
According to the Official Reply to the Overall Urban Planning of Chongqing Municipality by the.
State Council of P. R. China (GUOHAN [1998] File No.108), Chongqing, one of the most
important cities in the southwest of China and the upper reach of the Yangtze River, one of the
most influential industrial bases, transport and traffic hubs and trade ports nationwide, her urban
construction and development shall be achieved through a strategy for sustainable development,
in harmony with her economic, social, demographic, resources and environmental conditions.
According to the requirements for construction of a municipality to be a city leader in the region,
Chongqing has been expected to develop into a modern city, with prosperous economy,
developed sciences and education, social civilization, complete facilities and pleasant
environments, featuring unique landscapes as a "hilly city", "river-side city". Meanwhile, the
Official Reply requests Chongqing to develop the urban districts in a controlled way, by taking
effective measures construct cluster quarters in suburban areas, improve and deepen city and
town system planning, raise funds through diversified channels, speed up construction of the
urban infrastructure so as to change the situations of traffic congestion, water supply shortage,
poor drainage, etc. throughout Chongqing Municipality as soon as possible.
The Chongqing Urban Environment Project approved by the World Bank in Fiscal Year 2001,
has been designed to address pollution problems in the Municipality by providing a blend of both
key infrastructure investments and institutional reforms. The objective of the Chongqing Urban
Environment Project (CUEP) is to provide a safe environmental setting for the sustainable long-
term economic growth of urban areas in Chongqing Municipality (CM). The project would
support the Municipality in implementing the first phase of a long-term urban environmental
improvement program to recover from past environmental degradation, provide an adequate
supply of safe water and maintain water quality at levels that are compatible with the needs of
the wider Yangtze River Basin.
Since approval of the loan ($200 million) it has become apparent that there will be significant
savings from the loan (estimated at approximately $60 to $70 million) which may be re-allocated
for existing and/or new project components. The basis for this estimate is the trend in
procurement activities, namely: (a) bid prices of already awarded contracts average between 50
percent and 60 percent of the estimated project costs indicated in the Project Appraisal
Document; (b) reductions in the scope of works, (c) cost reductions arising from refined detailed
engineering design, and (d) loan savings due to works being completed along with ongoing bund
road works, ahead of schedule using Chongqing's own funds.
As of November 2002, Chongqing Municipality began to enter in a dialogue with the World Bank
concerning a second possible loan to finance both urban and environmental projects in

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WATER SUPPLY COMPONENTS
Chongqing, subsequently known as the Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement
Project or CSCP. As initially outlined the project focused on four broad sectors:
*   Infrastructure construction to support the development of business parks;
*  Water Supply;
*  Bund Roads (including flood control/protection);
*  River Harness (Wastewater and Flood Control/Protection).
As the preparation of a number of the below projects was relatively well advanced, it has been
proposed that these projects could be possibly financed using the loan savings from the first
urban environment project in Chongqing, the CUEP.
The following sub-components are part of the CUEP 1 New Components financed from loan
savings:

The location of these sub-components is illustrated on figure on the following page.
As some if not all sub-projects may have significant impacts on the natural or social
environment, it was decided in agreement with the World Bank to prepare a Category A
Consolidated Environmental Assessment (EA) for each of the 3 Sectors of concem for the
CUEP 1 New Component Project, i) Wastewater components, ii) Water supply components and
iii) River embankment components.
To carry out the preparation of these 3 Consolidated EA, the Project Management Office (PMO)
for WB Loan Financed Project in Chongqing appointed CISDI Engineering Co., Ltd.

1.2.    GENERAL BACKGROUND FOR EA
1.2.1.  CLASSIFICATION OF EA
In accordance with PRC National Regulations and the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01
related to Environmental Assessment, the concemed wastewater components of the Project fall
under the Category A project and as such, they require full EA.
1.2.2.  PRINCIPLES & METHODOLOGY FOLLOWED
The project technical and financial preparation was carried out by Chinese local organizations
and has been supported by various sources of international assistance to CUEP, including
SOGREAH, the Design Review and Advisory (DRA) Consultant to the Chongqing Project
Management Office (PMO), the responsible institution for the overall preparation of the project..
In accordance with the Government Regulation 'Strengthening Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) Management for the Construction Project Loaned by Intemational Finance
Organisation" of June 21, 1993 and the World Bank Safeguards Operational Policy, the Project
PMO, has commissioned the CISDI Engineering Co. Ltd to carry out the preparation of the
3 Consolidated EA studies for the CUEP Loan Savings components.
The Consolidated EA of CUEP II, China and the Consolidated EIA of Chongqing Environment
Project (CUEP I), China (hereinafter referred to as Consolidated EIA) are based on the individual
ElAs of the subprojects. CISDI Engineering Co., Ltd. compiled the Consolidated EIA Report of
CUEP I and the Consolidated EIA Report for Infrastructures of CUEP il, China, Environmental
Management Plan and Summary of EIA.
Similarly, Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) for each of these 3 subcomponents are currently
under preparation.
This Consolidated EA has therefore been carried out by the CISDI with the assistance of the
DRA Consultant; this overall assessment is based on the EA studies carried out by the various
organizations for the individual components of the project.
. 9",   COVERAGE OF EA
This consolidated EA has been carried out strictly in accordance with the State and Chongqing
laws, codes and criteria relating to environmental protection. It satisfies the Chinese EA system,
whilst at the same time gives full attention to the requirements of the World Bank's
environmental safeguards, and more precisely those of the Operational Policy 4.01 for EA.
The EA is based on the collection and use of existing materials and data supplementing missing
material by field investigations.
This Consolidated Environmental Assessment analyzes present environmental situation,
potential impacts of project implementation and proposes mitigation measures in relation to the
wastewater and embankments projects proposed for Bachuan River, Huaiyuan River, Laixi
River, and Taohuaxi River.

3.1.2.  PRESENT SITUATION OF SOLID WASTE COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
Please refer to Section 3.1.2 in the Cbnsolidated EA for Wastewater Components.
3.1.3.  PRESENT SITUATION OF WNA7T--R SUPPLY
The west region of Chongqing Municipality is facing frequent water shortage. Water supply
resource in Tongliang County, Dazu County and Yongchuan City relies mainly on water storages
created by the construction of dams on secondary rivers or on rainwater reservoirs.
However, inappropriate management and treatment of wastewater has resulted in severe
pollution proolems in secondary rivers as Bachuan River, Huaiyuan River, Laixi River, etc,
amplifying the conflict between water supply and effluent discharge, affecting river ecology and
bottlenecking sustainable development in the west region of Chongqing Municipality.
3.2.    OVERALL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL
INFRASTRUCTURE
3.2.1.  OVERALL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK
In compliance with the decision to expedite implementation of the urbanization strategy,
Chongqing Municipality has formulated an overall framework for the development program of
environmental infrastructure (environmental facilities) and educational, scientific and cultural
facilities including traffic, communications, energy, water supply & drainage, landscaping,
environmental protection, natural calamities prevention and fighting, etc.
The program relies on a rational and sustainable use of resources, strengthens ecological
environmental construction and protection in towns and cities, tries to create a development
pattern with growing production, well-being living and good ecological conditions, basically to
provide towns and cities with complete functionalities meeting the needs of economic and social
development.

3.2.2.   SECTOR ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
By 2010 the daily water supply capacity will be increased by 1,980,000 m3, representing an
investment of RMB 11.5 billion, of which RMB 6.5 billion will be devoted to the central urban
3
districts for increasing the daily water supply capacity by 900,000 m , and improving the water
quality to potable level. Remaining RMB 5 billion will be invested in surrounding counties, cities
and towns to increase the daily water supply capacity by 1,080,000 mi, and extend water pipe
networks by 1,800km.
When the environmental projects (i.e. water supply projects, sewage treatment and wastes
disposal) are implemented, the water supply quality, quantity and surface water contamination
are expected to be significantly improved and the urban environmental infrastructure of
Chongqing will be greatly improved.
3.2.3.   DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM COMPONENTS UNDER WORLD BANK LOANS
Water supply projects are the most important infrastructure in a city. In the urbanization process
of Chongqing Municipality. priority shall be given to their construction Water supply projects

3.3.    SUMMARY OF CSCP
Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement Project (CSCP) mainly consists of bund
subprojects, water supply subprojects, infrastructure improvement and environment subprojects
(wastewater) in medium- and small-sized towns under its jurisdiction. These subprojects are
mostly located in the West Chongqing Corridor with convenient traffic and transportation
conditions, close to Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and Chengdu-Chongqing Expressway. To give
attention to the development of other regions, particularly the economic development and culture
property protection in the regions of minor ethnic groups, similar subprojects have also been
planned in Qianjiang District, Wulong County in the east of Chongqing Municipality. The
Urbanization and Environment Project is designed to increase the capacity of infrastructure like
traffic and transportation, water supply, promote industrial construction in the medium- and
small-sized towns with integration of small town construction, environmental protection and
industrial restructuring, hasten the urbanization process and promote sustainable development
of environment in Chongqing Municipality.
The CSCP financed with loans from the World Bank are one of the important measures for
Chongqing Municipality to implement the urbanization strategy. These projects and the project
sites usually have the following features:
* Close to the large- and medium-sized cities or medium- and small-sized towns
planned by Chongqing Municipality, the subprojects are arranged with favorable traffic
and transportation, economic and technological conditions, having sufficient labor
force, land and technical resources, much potential of industrial integration and
development for urbanization;
*  The subprojects, mostly related to infrastructure and environmental protection in
towns and cities, will a great driving force for industrial restructuring, traffic and
transportation improvement, investment environmental improvement and ecological
construction in the adjacent towns and cities, essential to the sustainable development
of the adjacent towns and cities;
*  The subprojects are all urgently needful or lacking for the towns and cities to carry out
industrial restructuring, living and investment environmental improvement;
* The subprojects are closely related to fostering of the local supporting industries;
* The subprojects are mutually supplemented to each other, constituting the
cornerstone for improving the infrastructure of Chongqing Municipality for urbanization;
* The subprojects are commonly expected and supported by the local governments and
the common people.

4.      WATER SUPPLY PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
The objective of the CUEP is to assist Chongqing in the first phase of its long term
environmental improvement program to: (a) improve urban environmental services with a view to
reducing environmental degradation of its water and land resources; (b) provide an adequate
supply of safe water to its growing urban population and economy; (c) maintain water quality at
levels which are compatible with the needs of the wider Yangtze River basin and of the Three
Gorges Reservoir.
The water supply components of the CUEP 1 NC contribute directly to the achievement of these
objectives.
4.1.    ALTERNATIVE WITHOUT WIATER SUPPLY COMPONENTS
In the absence of WS components, the deficit in water supply and the poor quality of the water
resource already observed in the concerned areas and rivers, will continue to deteriorate, with
evident severe impacts on the quality of life of the served population and on public health.
Also, it will hamper the economic development of the region which is considered as a priority by
the Government, as poor water supply and water quality will eventually limit industrial
development and attractiveness for the potential migrants.
Necessary improvement of water supply and sanitation in fast growing urban areas totalizing
several millions population is not questionable. The supply of safe water in. sufficient quantities to
the population must also remain a key objective in the process of improving urban public health,
with even a higher priority today in the light of those recent and threatening experiences with
new viral epidemics spreading easily through polluted water.
There is no dedicated potable water supply plant in Dongyang area. Water supplied to the
population comes from the private facilities of the enterprises for the production of their process
water, with limited guaranty regarding quality or quantity. Dongyang water supply project is thus
an important infrastructure project contributing to regional economic and urban deveinhment,
and to the living standard and health of the population.
Bicheng, Shizi and Puyuan towns, in the west of Chongqing, are facing current shortage of
water, affecting the population and the economic activities.
At present, industrial and domestic water in Jiangjin City come from water wells, streams or
water reservoir. The water quality and quantity supplied from these sources does not meet the
present demand, limiting economic and social development.
The WB CUEP 1 NC related to tiie water supply sector will i^crease the water treatment
capacity by 55,000 m3 /day and the water distribution network by almost 100 km in the towns of
Bicheng, Dongyang and Shuangfu. The total population supplied by the project in 2020 is
estimated at almost 400,000 peoples.
Both in terms of economic development, public health and environment, the "non project"
situation is not an reasonable alternative.

6.      BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
6.1.    PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
Chongqing is also called Yu in Chinese for abbreviation, and one of the four municipalities
directly under the Central Government, located at latitude between 28010' and 32013' north and
at longitude between 105011' and 110011' east. Chongqing, with a total area of 82,403km2,
bounds on the west by Sichuan Province, south by Guizhou Province, east by Hubei Province
and north by Shanxi Province, and connects the eastern China well developed to the western
China abundant in resources.
Chongqing is located in central part of Southwest China and in a center strip of Great
Development of West China. Chongqing is also a very important central municipality on
upstream of the Yangtze River, and acts as an important industrial base, transportation center
and trade port in China.
For Beibei District, Bishan County and Jiangjin County, concerned by the 3 water supply sub-
projects, specific locations in Chongqing administrative region are shown in the attached
drawings (Appendix 2).
5.1.1.  CLIMAT E
Chongqing is located in medium sub-tropical humid monsoon area, and features hot-summer-
cold-winter, rich but seasonally uneven rainfall, high humidity, cloudy weather, long frostless
period and low wind speed. The average annual temperature is 16.9-18.8 OC, and average
annual rainfall 814.8-1229mm, average annual relative humidity 77-81%. The leading wind
throughout the year is of NE wind and N wind with average annual speed of 0.7-1.7m/s. Some
area is affected by the local terrain where the leading wind has the same direction as the valley
extends.
6.1.2.  HYDROLOGY
Chongqing is dominated by low mountains and hills, and suffers from the serious soil erosion.
There are more than ten rivers, small or large, such as The Yangtze River, Jialin River, Wujiang
River, Daling River across Chongqing. But 96.9% of water resource is of passing water
resource, and therefore the water resource utilization per capita of Chongqing is only 720m3/a
Chongqing, amounting for 33% of the national average. There is lack of water in the western,
southeastern and northern Chongqing.
6.1.2.1.  BEIBEI-WENTANGJIANG SECTION OF JIALING RIVER
Jialing River, the second largest branch of Yangtse River, is located to the west of Beibei
Dongyang Town, flowing from northwest to southeast. Jialing river is a permanent river, 1,120km
long, and drains a catchment of 157,900km2. It features an average water temperature of
19.80C and an average flow of 2,360 m3/s, with historical minimum flow of 242 m3/s. The annual
water resource volume is 69.77 billion m3.

Based on the information from Beibei hydrologic station, the average water level of Beibei
section of Jialing River is 175.94m and the average sediment content in 2000 was 0.566 g/l.
Single-peak flood event lasts in average 3-5 days and the multi-peak flood 7-8 days. The flood
level is 203m for a 20-year return period.
6.1.2.2. TONGXIN RESERVOIR IN BISHAN TOWN
Based on the information from Bishan Water Conservancy & Agricultural Machinery Office,
Tongxin Reservoir is 8.5 km far from Bicheng town, featuring a total volume of 13.86 million m3,
an available volume of 11.54 million m3, an average water level of 343.78m. It drains a
catchment area of 20.4 km2 with an average runoff of 10.5 million m3.
Two reservoirs are also anticipated as water source in the future: Yanjinghe reservoir (existing)
and Sanjiang Reservoir (planned):
Yanjinghe reservoir is 11km from Bicheng town, featuring a total volume of 8.48 million m3, an
available volume of 7.28 million m3, an average water level of 307.5m and a catchment area of
27.4km2 with an average runoff of 10.13 million m3. According to the Surface Water
Environmental Quality Standard (GB3838-2002) for Water Area, its water quality is above the
requested Class II.
Sanjiang reservoir under preparation, features a total volume of 14.82 million m3, an average
impoundment level of 410m and drains a catchment area of 25km2. It is scheduled for
completion in 2007.
Based on information available in June 2004, above 3 reservoirs are to be used for Water
Supply only.
0.1.2.3.  DAB) RIVER IN SHUANGF J TowN
Shuangfu town of Jiangjin city is adjacent to Jiulongpo district on the east, close to Bishan
county on the west. Daxi river flows through Shuangfu town and Jiulongpo district to enter
Yangtze river.
6.1.3.  SURFACE WATER QUALITYe
6.1.3.1. WATER QUALITY OF JIALING RIVER
Since its creation in 2001, Chongqing Environmental Nionitoring Station has monitored the
quality of Chongqing urban potable water source by taking samples at frequency of 12 times per
year, including the monitoring of Beibei Tuanshanbao and Wenxingwan section which are close
to Wentang section (the intake water head site for Dongyang Town water supply project). As
presented in the following table, the water quality at water head site in Jialing River for Beibei
district water intake complies with Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard (GB3838-
2002) for Water Area of Class II, except for the coliform pollution, which indicates river pollution
by sewage.

6.2.    ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
6.2.1.         T GE ATgON
The soil in assessed area is of paddy soil, violet soil, yellow soil and alluvium. Main terrestrial
vegetation consists of ever-green board-leaved forest, coniferous forest, bamboo forest and
ever-green bush. The forest coverage in related county and district ranges from 24.5% to 27.6%.
Dazu County has been awarded granted the Ecological Agriculture Achievement County in
China. In addition to the usual trees such as cypress, horsetail pin and fir, Chongqing has rare
plants such as gingko, yellow thorn, Nanmu and Metasequoia.
Areas anticipated for the development of the WWTP are both agricultural land with only sparse
secondary vegetation of shrubs and trees.
6.2.2.  WILDLIFE
Aquatic ecological systems mainly consist of fishes, poultry such as goose and duck and small
amounts of aquatics and amphibian such as frog. Due to serious water lack in western
Chongqing, there are many man-made dams and reservoirs in the basins of the secondary
rivers therein.
6.2.3.  PROTECTED C2R RESTRICTED AREAS
There is no area of special environmental protection (nature reserve, historical site) concerned
by the project development.

6.2.4.  AQUATIC ECOLOGY
Limited information does exist on the aquatic ecology in the project area. Due to the quality of
water, it is anticipated significant fish population and fishing activities along the river reaches.
Because of water resource limitations in western Chongqing rivers and streams, many man-
made dams and reservoirs have been developed, generating new habitats for aquatic
biodiversity.
6.3.    SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
6.3.1.  POPULATION PROFILE
The territory area of Dongyang town, Beibei district is 47.84 kM2, with an existing built-up
downtown area of 3.5km2. The current population is approx. 40,000, of which the industrial and
urban population accounts for about 72.5%. The total area for Dongyang town is 5.7 km2

6.3.3.  INFRASTRUCTURES & SERVICES
With Chongqing-Hechuan free way, Xiangfan-Chongqing railway and Yi-Beibei road going
through the territory, Dongyang town of Beibei enjoys convenient access, transportation and
traffic conditions. Dongyang town is equipped with 11 OkV substations, natural gas station, good
road network and good educational facilities (a total of 7 elementary schools, high schools and
technical schools). However, the water supply infrastructure in Dongyang town is rather poor.
Without any dedicated WTP, domestic water distributed to the residents comes from the
process water of the enterprises, which does not guaranty so far either the quality or quantity of
supplied water.
With 13 incoming and outgoing highways (including Chengdu-Chongqing free way, national
highway No.319 and provincial highway No.111) in the territory, Bishan county enjoys significant
traffic and transportation advantages. The infrastructure in Bishan has been developing fast. The
industrial park and mechanical industrial center in Qingang - Dingjia economic corridor is one of
the production base to supply automobile and motorcycle parts for Chongqing municipality. The
shoe production sector is also a significant development basis for the area. However, economic
development suffers water shortage, insufficient water treatment and supply capacity.
Based on Jiangjin town development plan, Shuangfu town will organize development around
landscaping and industrial park promotion. The industrial park of Shuangfu town was considered
as the Demonstrating Park of Town-Owned Enterprises in Chongqing in 2003. Now the park has
attracted 25 enterprises to settle down and signed contracts worth of RMB 43 million. The water
supply capacity in Shuangfu town is only 2,00Om3/d at present, suffering severe lack of water
supply facility and acute conflict situation between the water supply and demand.
..3.4.  QUALITY OF SERVICES
The existing water supply in Dongyang town, Beibei district is not sufficient in terms of water
quantity and poor in terms water quality as it does not comply with Regulations on Sanitary &
Drinking Water Quality (2001)-File Nc. 161 issued by the Ministry of Sanitation and Health.
With inefficient water treatment, severe leakages of main structures and pipe network, the
existing Houshipo WTP (7,000 m3/d) and Xiangyang WTP (15,000m3/d) in Bicheng town are not
able to supply sufficient quantity of water at an acceptable level of quality.
In Shuangfu town of Jiangjin, the water from shallow wells and small reservoirs is distributed as
domestic water after simple treatment. In Xiangtang and Shenquan, the water is pumped up to
an elevated water tank where it is settled and then supplied to the population for direct drinking.
In this way, not only the supply is insufficient, but also the water quality.
6.3.5.  CULTURAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL VALUES
There is no relicts of cultural or archaeological value identified and reported from the project
sites.
6.4.    MAIN ENVIRON;MENTAL ISSUES AND PROBLE ."S
6.4.1.  POOR INFRASTRUCTURES
There are generally poor infrastructures regarding flood control and sanitation facilities in various
towns of the a,-. pi-oposed for water supply sub-projects. Domestic refuse requires urgent
improvement for collection, transport and disposal. Industrial waste water is seldom treated and
SCGREAH - BYN - N'2 _.i5321 . R3.2-AG -j,r_4                                   PAS- 31



CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK

has a high pollution level. Without due treatment, industrial waste water, agricultural waste water
and domestic sewage are discharged into the rivers without control, affecting the quality of the
resource eventually used for urban water supply.
6.4.2.  WATER POLLUTION
Except large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the proposed areas, most of the
medium- and small-sized enterprises lack appropriate sewage treatment facilities and contribute
significantly to the pollution load in the river system.
Due to impact from industrial waste water and domestic sewage and undue waste disposal, the
secondary branches to the Yangtze River, located in Three Rivers basins, are full of
contaminated flow during rainy season and become hotbed for the breeding of fly and mosquito.
Waste causes serious organic pollution in river water bodies and noxious odor, and makes the
rivers full of floating and foam. Thus the city appearance and people's mental and physical
health are seriously deteriorated.
When the proposed water supply project is implemented, the induced sewage amount will be
increased, so the requirement for sewage treatment will be even more critical. Therefore, the
concept of integrated environmental improvement of the river systems promoted by CUEP 1 NC
is a major tool to improve this critical situation on both side of water supply and pollution control.

7.      IMPACT ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION
7.1.    GENERAL
This chapter discusses the impact of the proposed water supply sub-components of the
CUEP 1 Loan Savings on the physical and human environment.
The overall impact of CUEP 1 New Components on the environment will be highly beneficial,
particularly on the improvement of the river water quality and on the public health. It is not
anticipated that the implementation of the project will involve unmanageable negative impacts.
The proposed water supply components are based on well-known technology, with limited
potential negative impacts but several advantages, most notably:
* Meet the needs of water supply of city, ensure production water and people's drinking
water;
* Improve water quality supplied to the growing urban population;
o Improve public health condition;
* Improve attractiveness of area for investors and promote better living conditions for
rapid economic development.
Construction activities for water treatment plants, pumping stations and pipe network may cause
noise, dust, fumes emission, nuisance for the residents, traffic jam, temporary cut-off water and
gas supply. These issues are temporary only and their impact can be significantly minimized or
avoided by appropriate construction management practices and appropriate construction
monitoring. For all these issues, mitigation measures are proposed and developed further in this
report (see chapter on Environmental Management Plan).
7.2.    POTENTIAL IMPACTS & MITIGATION DUE TO PROJECT LOCATION
7.2.1.  PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
In general the potential impacts of permanent land acquisition for the water supply components
are mainly imposed by the construction of the WTP facilities. Temporary land acquisition during
the construction stage is justified by the pipe laying works and the related worker and
construction camps.
Information on land acquisition and resettlement requirements for the Water Supply components
are provided in the following table (source: RAP surveys).

The Water Supply sub-projects will not involve any house demolition.
Total area required for the 3 sub-projects will be 4.84 ha for permanent acquisition and 10.04 ha
for temporary use during construction.
Total compensation cost for land acquisition is estimated at about RMB 3.3 million (net) or
RMB 6 5 million with tax, contingencies and implementation costs.
Details on land type and cost breakdown is provided in the Resettlement Action Plan Report.
7.2.2.   SENSITIVE SITES
There are no highly sensitive sites or infrastructure which may be impacted due to project
location. The most sensitive sites located close to project components are the followings:
* Lijiaping Elementary school, located 150 m from Dongyang WTP
* Silkworm farm located about 250 m from Dongyang WTP
o Scattered isolated urban or rural residences located within 100 m from Dongyang
WTP and Shuangfu pumping stations.
7.2.3.   CULTURAL HERITAGE SITES
There is no identified or known physical culture heritage site which may be impacted because of
the project location. However, attention will be raised and appropriate measures proposed in
case artifacts are discovered during construction works.

7.3.    IMPACTS & MITIGATION DURING CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION
7.3.1.  IMPACT ON WATER QUALITY AND AQUATIC BIODIVERSITY
7.3.1.1. IMPACT DURING CONSTRUCTION
The type of project and the limited works concerned are not anticipated to generate significant
impacts on the aquatic environment.
The most significant impact on water quality may result from activities carried out next to a water
body, mainly the construction of water intake structures. Some temporary and local increase of
suspended sediments may be expected from earthworks and instream works. Also, punctual
pollution from petroleum products, chemicals or sewage from camps may alter the water quality.
However, if the construction activities are appropriately managed and monitored, the risk will be
low.
Mitigation Measures: During Construction, some quantities of wastewater will be generated by
aggregate washing, equipment cleaning and construction camps.
Appropriate management practices will be imposed to the Contractors regarding sediment
control, chemical storage, refueling procedures, camps management (sanitation and waste).
These may include measures as sedimentation pond treatment, water re-use (for aggregate
washing or mortar preparation. Pollution load of effluents from construction sites will be reduced
by appropriate practices particularly during maintenance of trucks and heavy machinery.
Pollution from worker camps will be controlled through appropriate sanitation facilities as
Ventilated Improved Latrines or septic tanks. A minimum of one toilet facility for 20 workers will
be required.
7.3.,. . IMPACT, DURING OPERATION
Potential impact upon the aquatic environment during the operation period is twofold:
*  Indirect impact from higher production of sewage resulting from' increased water
supplied to the serviced population.
*   Direct impact from the facility operation and related to the production of sludge from
pre-sedimentation tank, reaction tank and sedimentation tank, production of backwash
water of filtering tank, production of sanitary sewage by staff, risk of chlorine leakage.
Indirect impact is mitigated through proper planning and coordination between water supply and
sewerage development.
At present, sanitation facilities are rather poor in the 3 concerned towns. In Dongyang, domestic
and industrial effluents are discharged with limited or no treatment in the Chepanxi river. A
sewage treatment plant is under study for construction at the confluence of the Chepanxi and
the Jialing rivers. It is schedule to be in operation by 2007 with a capacity of 25,000 m3 /day in
Phase 1 (see location on figure 5 in Annex 2). Situation is similar in Bicheng and effluent are
released into the Binan river. The Bicheng-Guanyintang Sewage Treatment Plant is under
construction, and its Phase 1 (30,000 m3 /day) is expected to start operation by the end of 2005.
In Shuangfu, no sewage facility exist and effluents are discharged in the Daxi river.
The construction of 2 separate 'ewage treatment f- ilities for domestic and industry and thei,
network is scheduled to start at the end of 2004.
Taking consideration of the on-going sanitation programs in the concerned areas, increase in
water supply should not have any detrimental effect on the aquatic environment. Due to the
extension of sewage network and sewage treatment capacity there should even be significant
improvement of the surface water quality.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WATER SUPPLY COMPONENTS
Direct impacts are generally of limited importance. Each WTP will employ only few staff, 31 in
Dongyang and about 48 in Bicheng. Sanitary facilities will be implemented in order to comply
with applicable discharge standards.
Sludge from the treatment process contents generally 60 to 80% of inorganic solids and silt and
20 to 40% of organic solids. Sludge contents also aluminum hydroxide, if alum (aluminum
sulfate) is used as flocculant. Aluminum hydroxide comes generally in sludge in the proportion of
0.44 kg per kilo of alum used in the process. Aluminum hydroxide is insoluble.
Sludge produced by the treatment process is highly liquid, with less that 5 to 10% solids.
The sludge quantity to be discharged from the water plant in Dongyang town and from
Qiancengyan water plant in Bicheng is estimated respectively between 4 to 8tVday and between
7 to 14 tVday, with a moisture content higher than 90%.
Due to the non-threatening character of sludge from WTP regarding aquatic life, most of the
medium size facilities operating around the world discharge directly the liquid sludge in the
nearby river where water is abstracted. This process will be used in both facilities under the
CUEP 1 NC, and it is not anticipated any detrimental impacts on the river system.
Another option for the sludge disposai is too add in the WTP a sludge dewatering unit that could
allow the re-use of the sludge for soil improvement.
The risk of chlorine leakage depends on the type of product used (gas or liquid). In any case,
simple safety measures for storage will be implemented in order to avoid any risk of
contamination cf the surrounding aquatic environment. This risk is avoided by:
* equipping the treatment works with adequate chlorine storage units and chlorinators,
using fcr example bunded storage with retention capacity of at least 110% of the
largest container capacity stored, as requested by ISO 14001 regarding Hazardous
Matena! storage.
@  equipping the chlorine unit with specific neutralisation system -and adequate leak
deten:or and warning system,
* adoptina an adequate chlorine handling procedure and management.
7.3.2.  IMPACTS ON SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY
7.3.2.1. IMPACT OF DONGYANG PROJECT ON JIANGLING RIVER IN BEIBEI SECTION
Dongyang WS project is designed with a capacity of 20,0O0m3/d, based on 12 hours water
supply per day and peak factor of 1.3. The rate of water intake is 0.6m3/s, which is only 0.028%
of average flow of Jiangling River Beibei section or 0.25% of the historical minimum flow of
Jialing River in Beibei section. Also considering that the rate of water abstraction will be reduced
by app. 4,000m3/d when the ten existing small-sized water plants are closed at completion of the
water supply project, the water intake of Dongyang WS project has low impact on the
downstream river section, and will not create conflict situation for water use.
7.3.2.2. IMPACT OF BICHENG PROJECT ON TONGXIN RESERVOIR
As Tongxi, reservoir and Yanjinghe reservoir fe& ,, good water quality due to clean
surroundings, their water area functions are defined as the Class I protected zone to supply
central potable water for Bicheng town.
When the water supply project of Qiancengyan water plant is completed, the water supply
capacity to Bicheng town shall reach 50,000m /d (including 35,000m3/d from Qiancengyan water
plant and 15,i00m /d from the existing Xiangyang water plant) or a volume of 18.25 million m3
annually. Tongxin Reservoir and Yanhejing Reservoir, with total volume of 22.34 million m3, will

have sufficient capacity to supply raw water to Bicheng town water plant. As the two water
bodies, classified Class I feature a single usage function (water supply), the completion of the
project will not cause any particular environmental problem to Tongxin reservoir or Yanjinghe
reservoir nor social problem related to potential competitive use of water.
7.3.3.  IMPACTS ON AIR QUALITY
7.3.3.1. IMPACTS DURING CONSTRUCTION
The main pollution sources are machines burning fuel for digging, transportation, load, unload,
vibration. Dust and waste gas from these machines affects air quality surrounding work place.
Area most affected is located in a range of around 100 m all around project sites, but also main
access roads to sites which will be supporting the heavy truck traffic.
Also, same impacts will be observed along the pipe network construction sites, where the impact
may be more direct for the population than the one from the water intake or WTP sites, as the
resident population will be located much closer to works, but should have a shorter duration as
the work sites move permanently.
According to field monitoring of dust generation on various construction sites, the dust
concentrations on the places 50m, 100m and 150m leeward to the construction site are 486.5,
390 and 322 1gm/M3 where 2.4m/s of wind speed, 316.7 1dm/M3 of TSP concentrations on
reference point windward to construction site and 599,5 um/m3 of TSP concentrations within
construction site. Thus it is seen that the effect of dust generation within construction site is
approx. 150m. Additionally, the construction equipment features small amount of emission and
short period of application. In Chongqing the air humidity is great, wind speed low and water
content of soil high. It is available for water spray on specific points on construction site during
dry season and coverage of earth and gravel transported. Therefore the emission and dust from
construction and transport can be effectively controlled.
Part of the spoil obtained during the excavation works for the WTP construction should be
reused as fill: In Dongyang, 5,000 m3 of spoil from the pipe works will not be reused, in Bicheng
all the excavation spoil is reused. No information is available on Shuangfu.
During project construction and especially during transportation and disposal of this spoil, there
could be dust production. If the spoil is not properly disposed of or stockpiled, it would impact the
cleanliness of the urban areas. If excavated spoil is stockpiled for several weeks, the spoil will
be dried by exposure to sunlight and wind and when disturbed, will raise dust clouds resulting in
an increase in the fine particulate content of the ambient air. Hence, management of spoil during
the construction should be reinforced to prevent excessive impact on air quality by reducing the
emission of dust.
Mitigation measures: Mitigation concems mainly appropriate construction and earthworks
management methods to be imposed to the Contractor:
*  During excavation/filling earthworks, water will be sprayed to keep certain humidity;
construction site and worker camps as well as other project areas soil surface will be
regularly sprayed during dry periods to prevent dust emission;
e  Disposal sites for excavated material will be compacted and sp. yed with water
regularly; spoil not used on site will be removed at the soonest for =Vi,. .1 disposal
outside urbanized areas;
*  Inflammable construction waste (cartoon, paper, plastic, wood, etc.) will not be burned
on site but transported to appropriate landfill or disposal site;
*  Cooking for workers on sites will rely on gas or electrical cookers, and will not use
charcoal or wood or any product generating dust or fumes;

CHONGQING URBAN ENViRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WATER SUPPLY COMPONENTS
*  Trucks for spoil transportation will be covered before they leave the construction sites
to limit dust emission during travel to disposal site; washing stations will be installed in
main construction sites (WTP) to avoid release of mud on public streets and roads with
eventual production of dust (or sediment to sewers);
* Strict maintenance of engines for trucks and other heavy machinery will be
implemented by the contractor to reduce smoke and gas emission;
*  Roads for truck traffic will be selected preferentially outside residential areas.
7.3.3.2. IMPACTS DURING OPERATION
There could be some chlorine smell in the immediate vicinity of the storage and disinfection
room, but the proposed process using chlorine gas, and based on the observation of operating
facilities, it is unlikely that it represents a nuisance for surrounding residents.
No significant impact on air quality is anticipated during operation of the facilities.
7.3.4.  IMPACT FROM NOISE
7.3.4.1. IMPACTS DURING CONSTRUCTION
During the construction phase, the main source of noise will be the operation of construction
machines and vehicles transporting building materials. It is not anticipated in the project to use
blasting on construction sites.

At night, especially, construction noise would impose a severe nuisance on the residents in the
vicinity, especially those located at less than 50 m. Night working and especially the use of the
most noisy equipment during the night should then be strictly controlled in order to minimize the
impact of noise on the surrounding residents. In particular for excavations, drills used outside at
the beginning of tunnel construction should be forbidden at night. In order to limit construction
noise to people, China government issued a regulation "Noise limitation of Construction Field
Boundary (GB12523-90) ".
Based on the daytime and night time limiting noise values contained in this regulation, the buffer
zones required to respect these limiting values have been calculated and are presented below.

Mitigation: During construction, contractors will be requested to use low noise heavy equipment
which comply with standards. Use of noisy equipment will be forbidden during the period from 10
p.m. to 6 a.m. Night working and especially the use of the most noisy equipment during the night
should then be strictly controlled in order to minimize the impact of noise on the surrounding
residents. In order to limit construction noise to people, China government issued a regulation
'Noise limitation of Construction Field Boundary (GB12523-90)".
Special measures will be requested from the Contractor for works in Dongyang, to reduce noise
emission in the vicinity of the Lijiaping elementary school during the presence of children.
Construction activity during nighttime is also prohibited during the period of important school
examination. For the residents or organizations who suffer from construction impact on local
section, the construction units and supervision units shall strengthen coordination or make due
compensation where necessary.
7.3.4.2. IMPAC7S DURING OPERAT.N
During the operation phase, the main sources of noise are due to pumping stations and water
treatment works, using electrical equipment.
Standards applicable to.Level 2 areas (residential) are 6OdB(A) during day time and 5OdB(A)
during night time. Taking into consideration the distance to nearest residential buildings in
Dongyang and Bicheng, and the type of equipment concerned, these standards should be
respected.
7.3.5.  TEMPORARY LAND ACQUISITION DURING CONSTRUCTION
For the WTP, it is not anticipated the temporary acquisition of land during construction. Storage
of equipment, work s -s and worker camps shouid be organized within the land allocated
permanently to the plant.
For pipe works and pumping stations, some temporary occupation of land will be required:
0.54 ha in Dongyang, 2.72 ha in Bicheng and 6.78 ha in Shuangfu.
Mitigation measure: Inconvenience will be financially compensated to affected persons.
Provisional budgets have been estimated in the RAP: RMB 9,000 for Dongyang, RMF. 1p 500 for
Bicheng and RMB 125,400 for Sh?!angfu.
The Contractor will be requested to limit as much as feasible the area and the duration of
temporary land occupation.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WATER SUPPLY COMPONENTS
7.3.6.  IMPACT ON NATURAL AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
The project will not involve any destruction of valuable natural land. Dongyang and Bicheng
WTP sites have no particular ecological value, and are located in agricultural or urbanized
environment.
The development of the water network may impose the cutting of street trees. This impact can
hardly be quantified at present, but during works, field inspectors in charge of supervising the
EMP will ensure that any tree is cut by absolute necessity, that any cutting is registered and that
the project will ensure replanting of trees at a rate of not less than one tree planted for one cut.
Detrimental impact of construction on fauna is not anticipated.
The sub-projects will not generate air pollution in the future and thus have no impact on
terrestrial environment.
Mitigation measures: Obligation for the contractor to control river pollution and dust emission
from construction sites.
7.3.7.  CONSTRUCTION WASTE MANAGEtMENT
Significant volumes of spoil will be generated during the construction of the project components,
mainly composed of earth from excavation works and not re-used for filling or reclamation, and
of the products from demolition of existing buildings and concrete structures, mainly along the
network component.
Earth spoil will need to be removed from the construction sites using trucks, with resulting
nuisance for residents and public safety issues related to the risk of traffic accident. Strict
procedures related to this activity will need to be imposed to the contractor in charge.
In order to ensure minimization of nuisance from inadequate management of construction
waste, the contractor in, charge cf civil works in each site will prepare and submit a spoil
management plan which will respect the following guidelines:
1. Present a detailed sheet.of expected spoil volumes including:
*Building demolition volumes,
*Earth volumes from excavation works (distinct for WTP and network),
*Schedule of production.
2. Details the possible volume for reuse of demolition spoil and excavation spoil.
3. Identify and present on a map the areas anticipated for the disposal of excess spoil
which cannot be reused as fill; provide location of site (on a map), area needed, volume
to be disposed off, land use of area, agreement of owner/user to dispose spoil on the
site.
4. Provide information of access road anticipated to be used: distance, type of road,
number of urban/village areas crossed.
5. Soil and spoil removed during the construction process shall be stockpiled separately
and stabilization measures implemented. The soil shall be used for landscaping and
restoration of work area. The stockpiles shall be constructed with smooth slopes and
free draining patterns. Spoil stockpile will not exceed 3 meters and the slope will not be
more than 2:3.
6. Spoil stockpiles or platforms shall not be located on drainage lines or in floodway zones
or other areas important for the conveyance of floodwaters during major floods.

7. Soil and spoil to be stockpiled for long periods of time shall be stabilized by seeding to
promote vegetation growth and reduce surface runoff.
8. Erosion and sedimentation shall be controlled on a round the disposal site during the
construction stage. Where necessary, sediment traps/basins will be implemented.
9. During the implementation of the works, any requirement for a new disposal area for
spoil will be subject to the preparation of a similar management plan.
Spoil management plan will be prepared by the Contractor not later than 30 days before the start
of the works in the considered area.
7.3.8.  OFF-SITE PUBLIC SAFETY AND INCONVENIENCE
Proposed pipeline or pipe networks will cut across some roads or run parallel with them. During
the excavation and pipe-laying stage, there will be more traffic congestion along these roads.
The conventional way to solve the problem is to build side-tracks for vehicles during
construction. As these temporary roads are usually very narrow, it is impossible for vehicles to
pass each other. In addition, some vehicles will find it necessary to make a detour, which will not
only increase the mileage but also increase the traffic volumes on other roads. During projects
construction, spoil encroaching on the road surface will result in narrowing of the carriageway.
On dry days, the surface will be dusty and on wet days, the roads will be covered with mud and
become slippery.
Mitigation measures: The project will take all the necessary measures in order to minimize the
detrimental side effects of network construction. Coordination between the contractor and the
traffic police will minimize road blockage or will reduce it to the minimum duration. Pro-active
information will also be implemented in order to have the concerned residents or daily passer-by
to be informed of the date and the duration of the works in their area. This information will be
done through posters and local meetings.
The contractor(s) will be required to implement safety and road signs in sufficient quantities and
at the appropriate location, in order to facilitate traffic diversion and to reduce the risk of jam and
car accident.
7.3.9.  IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE
Through integrated environmental control for rivers, the related areas will have better status of
urban environmental infrastructure such as water supply & sanitation, fiooding prevention
communication, improved capacity to control soil erosion and to prevent flooding, and better
ecological environment, urban landscape and investment environment. People will live and work
in peace and contentment and society will keep stable. The related counties and districts will
modify the urban economy structure and industry structure based on their own specific
conditions. The proposed water supply sub-projects will significantly contribute to the
improvement of the quality of life of the serviced population.

7.4.    ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ANALYSIS
7.4.1.  RAW WATER POLLUTION EVENT
Accidental pollution of the water body upstream the intake facility is the major risk which may
hamper the operation of the water supply facilities. This may result either from an accidental
spillage of industrial storage of hazardous materials or the occurrence of an overflow (during a
rain event) or a major break-down in the operation of an upstream wastewater treatment plant
which may result in the temporary release of untreated wastewater in the river.
7.4.1.1.  PRESENTCONTROLOFUPSTREAM POLLUTION
In the upper reach of the Dongyang section of Jialing River is located the 'mini three-gorges'
scenic area planned for tourism development by Chongqing Municipal Government. Existing
polluting enterprises (e.g. cement or chemical plants) located along the river have been already
subject to pollution abatement obligations or relocation in order to reduce point source pollution.
Meanwhile, measures such as soil erosion control, sewage collection and treatment, controlled
pesticide and fertilizer application along the river sides have already been implemented,
contributing to the reduction of pollution in the Jialing River and achieving present compliance
with Class II standards.
Bishan County Government has issued file officially to define Tongxin reservoir and Yanjinghe
reservoir as Class I protected areas for central potable water source. Visible signs have been
implemented in distinct positions and people assigned especially for supervision. Besides,
enterprises with potential pollution risks are not allowed to be set up in the watershed area of the
two reservoirs. Domestic sewage is not drained into the reservoirs, but discharged to a facility for
biogas production in an irrigation scheme. The application of pesticides and fertilizer is strictly
controlled to protect the reservoirs from pollution. With above measures taken, the water quality
in the two reservoirs is above Class II standards.
7.4.1.2. RECOMMENDED COMPLEMENTARY ACTIONS
In order to reduce the probability of occurrence of such event, it is proposed the definition and
implementation of a protection zone around the water intake. This protection zone should
include:
* a protection area of Class I, extending 1000 m upstream and 100 m downstream, with
a band width of 300 m in the river and 500 m inshore,
* a protection area of Class II, extending 2.5 km upstrearr and 100 m downstream, with
a band width of 300 m in the river and 500 m inshore,
In Class I and Class II protection areas, only agricultural activities should be permitted and heavy
or pollution prone industrial construction projects should be forbidden. Revegetation should be
strengthened in order to avoid too much soil wash into the river. Harmful chemical storing should

8.3.     MITIGATION PROGRAM
Mitigation requirements and measures identified during the Environmental Assessment studies
of the sub-projects mainly concern the following issues:
* The compensation for temporary or permanent land acquisition, with resettlement
program if involuntary displacement of persons,
* Mitigation for the loss of valuable ecological or cultural resources.
* Application of environmental good practices during construction activities by the
Contractors on all the construction sites and in their surroundings.
8.4.     MONITORING PROGRAMS
In order to ensure the strict and efficient implementation of the mitigations measures proposed,
including the respect of environmental obligations during the construction stage, a program of
monitoring activities will be required, which includes mainly 3 types of monitoring:
* The general environmental and social monitoring of construction sites and activities,
*   The specific monitoring of water quality and water pollution control,
* The specific monitoring of air quality and pollution control, and of noise.
Monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement is considered in RAP reports and will not be
presented again as part of the present Consolidated EA Report.
8.4.1.   MONITORING OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES
This monitoring aims at ensuring compliance of Contractor activities with its contractual
commitments as well as with the environmental regulations and standards prevailing in PRC.
Monitoring should be carried out during the project construction stage .

8.4.2.  WATER QUALITY MONITORING
Objective of water quality monitoring is to ensure pollution control from construction activities is
efficient and that all activities are performed in compliance with applicable standards.
8.4.2.1. LOCATION OF SAMPLING SITES
For the construction sites monitoring (compliance monitoring), sampling sites will be distributed
in critical points where the control of effluents from construction activities can be easily
implemented. This concern for example any drainage outlet from construction sites, from
concrete preparation plant (if any), from labor camps, from disposal areas for earth-fill or
construction waste, from machinery reparation yards or from petrol products storage areas.
For the follow up of river sections water quality, sampling stations need to be located 50 m
upstream and 100 m downstream the anticipated influence zone of each major construction site
(water intake, outfall for sludge).
8.4.2.2.  PARAMETERS TO BE MEASURED
Three types of indicators will be considered:
* Those related to the follow up of potential pollution sources resulting from
construction activities,
* Those related to larger characterization of the receiving water body in relation to its
quality objectives, and
*  Those related to routine monitoring of raw water and sludge during operation.
The most frequently observed pollution types from construction works are mainly suspended
solids due to earthworks. soda effluents from concrete related activities, and hydrocarbons from
engine leakage and maintenance. Potential pollution from labor camps is mainly of
bacteriological nature and related to sanitation issues. The parameters to be followed must be
the best indicators of activities anticipated in the sites, which may clearly establish the presence
or not of a nuisance directly induced by the activities. The other types of parameters concern
those providing a more general information on the condition of the receiving river.
The parameters are:
Group 1: Indicators of pollution
*  At any discharge point from the construction sites: Temperature, pH, Electrical
Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO).
* At the treated effluent discharge point from labor camps (if any): fecal Coliform,
Ammonia, Biological Oxygen Demand in 5 days (BOD5).
* At the outlet of concrete production effluent (if any): Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
and pH
*  At the outlet/drains draining construction activities and mechanical maintenance
areas: pH, TSS, Hydrocarbons (HPA), oils.
Groutp 2: Indicators of water body quality
 Monitoring will follow parameters conventionally designated for Municipal or National
*                                  Monitoring stations.
* Temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, TSS, TDS, Chemical Oxygen Demand
(COD), Ammonia, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus.
Group 3: Routine monitoring during operation.

* For sludge, pH, EC, COD, TSS, Total N, Total P, Aluminum or Iron (depending on the
coagulant selected).
8.4.2.3. SAMPLING FREQUENCY & REPORTING
During Construction
Sampling for Group 1 indicators should be performed by the contractor on a weekly basis'
except for HPA and oils to be carried out on a monthly basis. More specific measures to be
carried out in a laboratory (Coliform, BODs ) will be carried out on a monthly basis. EPB will carry
out random check on samplings results for these parameters to confirm the validity of the data
provided by the Contractor.
Sampling results for Group 2 indicators will be checked on random basis by EPB.
Semi-annual reoorts of WQM and other monitoring results will be prepared by the Consultant to
the local environment agency, with a copy to the PMO.
During Operation
The Operator of the WTP will be responsible for monitoring of safety parameters in raw water on
a daily basis, and of sludge quality on a monthly basis.
EPB will check routine monitoring results of river water in a point located downstream the
sludge discharge point.

standards are respected on the construction sites and that these nuisances are kept at the
minimum acceptable level for the surrounding residents.
During construction, monitoring will concentrate on key emissions related to construction
activities: dust from earthworks (measured as Total Suspended Particulates-TSP) and fumes
from machinery (measured as No2). Controls for the pipeline network construction sites will also
be organized following the same procedures than those applied to the WTP.
During operation, monitoring will concern chlorine gas.
8.4.3.2.  MONITORING SITES
During construction, monitoring sites will be established at the concerned sites and nearby
sensitive spots located around.
Dongyang WS Project sites:
* Lijiaping Primary School
* Dongyang Middle School
* Dongyang Primary School

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY -THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WATER SUPPLY COMPONENTS
10.     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.1.   IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT
There is no dedicated potable water supply plant in Dongyang area. Water supplied to the
population comes from the private facilities of the enterprises for the production of their process
water, with limited guaranty regarding quality or quantity. Dongyang water supply project is thus
an important infrastructure project contributing to regional economic and urban development,
and to the living standard and health of the population. Bicheng, Shizi and Puyuan towns, in the
west of Chongqing, are facing current shortage of water, affecting the population and the
economic activities. At present, industrial and domestic water in Jiangjin City come from water
wells, streams or water reservoir. The water quality and quantity supplied from these sources
does not meet the present demand, limiting economic and social development. Residents in
Dongyang, Bicheng and Shuangfu areas suffer permanent and severe shortages of water.
Quality of water distributed at present does not comply with applicable safety standards.
In the absence of new WS investments, the deficit in water supply and the poor quality of the
water resource already observed in the concerned areas and rivers, will continue to deteriorate,
with evident severe impacts on the quality of life of the served population and on public health.
Also, it will hamper the economic development of the region which is considered as a priority by
the central Government, as poor water supply and water quality will eventually limit industrial
development and attractiveness for the potential migrants.
Necessary improvement of water supply and sanitation in fast growing urban areas totalizing
several millions population is not questionable. The supply of safe water in sufficient quantities to
the population must also remain a key objective in the process of improving urban public health,
with even a higher priority today in the light of those recent and threatening experiences with
new viral epidemics spreading easily through contaminated water.
The present WB CUEP 1 NC related to the water supply sector will increase the water treatment
capacity by 55,000 m3 /day (85,000 m3 /day in 2020) and the water distribution network by
almost 100 km in the towns of Bicheng, Dongyang and Shuangfu. The total population supplied
by the project in 2020 is estimated at almost 400,000 peoples.
10.2.   MAJOR ANTICIPATED IMPACTS AND MEASURES
Sites anticipated for the water intakes look appropriately located, relying on raw water sources
acceptable in quality and reliable in quantity. Location of sites for water supply treatment plants
in Dongyang and in Bicheng are also jiudicious!, sele"7c!, close enough to the serviced areas to
minimize costs but on areas without buil up properties.
The Water Supply sub-projects will not involve any house demolition. Land requirements have
been minimized so that total area required for the 3 sub-projects will be only 4.84 ha as
permanent acquisition and 10.04 ha for temporary use during construction. Total compensation
cost for land acquisition is estimated at about RMB 3.3 million (net) or RMB 6 5 million with tax,
contingencies and implementation costs.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WATER SUPPLY COMPONENTS
The sub-projects of Dongyang and Bicheng will provide respectively an additional water supply
capacity of 20,000 m3 /d (extension to 30,000 m3 /d in 2020) and 35,000 m3 /d (extension to
55,000 m3 /d in 2020), in fast growing urban areas which face presently water supply shortages.
The sub-projects construction and operation stages are not anticipated to involve detrimental
impacts on the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Sites dedicated to the treatment facilities are
already used for agriculture and pipe laying involves mainly urban land use. Any road tree felled
because of the sewer laying works will be replanted at the end of the works.
The project is not anticipated to affect any known cultural spot. However, excavations in the
cities for the sewer network may reveal some buried remains of historical value. Procedures will
be set-up for construction
During construction, limited impacts from earthworks are anticipated, mainly because quantities
involved are not important and because excavation and fill volumes are almost balanced, thus
resulting in very limited quantities of spoil to eventually dispose of.
At the time of the construction, and particularly for the water supply network components,
several construction sites will be implemented over the cities in densely inhabited areas. Several
nuisances and risks for the public safety may result from activities if appropriate measures are
not strictly enforced. For this purpose, the Environmental Management Plan proposes to
implement specific mitigation measures including:
* The implementation of clear procedures for routine monitoring, reporting and
addressing non-compliances detected on the construction sites.
* The implementation of procedures for public information, to deal with nuisances as
road traffic disturbance, water, electricity or gas temporarv cut-off, temporary noise,
and including among classical information measures the creation of an Internet site
dedicated to the Project.

Abstract of minutes of administration hearing meeting attended by the public for water supply project in
Shuangfuzhen:
The public representatives heard the project overview, protective facilities and measures for ecological
environment introduced by construction and environment assessment units, reviewed the feasibility study
report and draft environment assessment report, checked the sections through which the pipeline passes
and made necessary inquiry about possible effects and compensation measures. Then they expressed
their ideas below:
Located in the hilly area north of Jiangjing, Shuangfuzhen town suffers greatly from drought as other
districts and counties in west Chongqing .Water supply problem not only limits economic construction
and development of ecological agriculture, but also hardly guarantees basic living water demand of the
inhabitants. It is the wish of the people of Shuanfuzhen for years to solve the water problem. They expect
to strengthen water supply project, take the advantages of the water resource of the existing Jiangjing
water supply company, make unified plans and implement in stages in coordination with construction of
the economic development area, traffic and road in the urbanization process of Degangzhen and
Shuanfuzhen so as to keep steady development based on resource advantages of Shuangfuzhen along
with imp, ovement of living quality of people and investment environment for economic construction.
Meanwhile, they request civilized construction be ensured in the construction process of pipelines and
pump stations so as to minimize effects on the benefits of the people along the line.
Representatives of residents to be compensated for resettlement such as Liu Zhi-mei, Zhang Xun-ming,
Cheng Da-ming, Huang Da-lu, Cheng Yu-jiou, Zhang Zhu-rong and Cheng Bi-wen have expressed their
understanding for construction of pump stations or water storage pool nearby their existing houses,
though some of their land shall be taken over for use. They expect to have reasonable compensation
standard fixed within the limit that does not reduce their living level. Because there will be some

difficulties after resettlement compensation, they expect construction units to arrange reasonable
employment for them according to construction progress. During this period, priority should be given to
the compensated people for the project. Labor employment or labor output should be arranged for them.
All participants believe that establishment of water supply plant are of great importance in development
of economy, society, investment environment and living standards of Shuangfuzhen. They hope that
emphasis should be put on water and soil conservation and protection of Daqi river in the construction of
the project. The construction of the proposed sewage treatment plant in Shuangfuzhen should be
coordinated with the water supply project.
Conclusions
The questionnaires show, environment protection consciousness of the public has been
apparently increased. Since the proposed project itself relates to projects of basic installations
for environment of towns, most of the persons consulted think that construction of the proposed
project is completely necessary, it acts as an important impetus for speeding urbanization
process of the districts and counties in the project area, promoting local economical
development and improving living level of people. Therefore, the public , generally having the
attitude of welcome and support to the proposed project, have expressed that they will support
the construction of the project vigorously and raised some reasonable suggestions for the
proposed project.
The main content of the demands and suggestions put forward by the public consulted is
summed up as follows:
(1)  The proposed project must be fixed, constructed and accepted in strict accordance
with relevant national stipulations and requirements. Construction quality must be
guaranteed and effect on environment reduced to the minimum.
(2)   Enforce water source protection to avoid pollution.
(3)   Matters about resettlement and land compensation involved in construction of the
project must be disposed in strict accordance with relevant national stipulations.
(4)   Relation between industry and agriculture must be best coordinated in construction
process.
(5)  All the relevant departments related to the project construction should do their best to
coordinate one another in making the project construction be started at an early date
and putting it into use as early as possible.
In the administration hearing meeting, representatives of people's congress, members of
political consultative committee and representatives of cadres, teachers, workers, peasants and
inhabitants have made inquiries to engineering content of the project and related environment
protection measures and understood in a deeper way the relevant policies concerning
resettlement compensation measures and land occupation fee announced by the project.
After consulting feasibility report and environment assessment report draft and hearing
environment protection measures and effect in construction period and operation period
introduced by assessment unit and compensation expenditure and resettlement measures
introduced by construction units, the public representatives directly affected by noise, dust and
land occupation in construction period of the project are satisfied with construction units and
environment as6'..srnent uniz, thinking that the design and environmrn  ' assessment not only
take into account the general objective of the water supply project and the basic benefit of the
broad masses, but also reflect the doing of "with human being as the foundation" at subtle
places, especially they put emphasis on taking into account the benefit of the weak group of the
common public affected by land occupation and who are small in quantity. Therefore, they have
expressed their understanding and support for construction of water supply installation nearby
their houses, even though some or even all of their land will be taken over for use and some of
their crops will be spoiled. The expect that departments concerned will give them compensation
in strict accordance with relevant State's policies and make proper arrangement for their future

employment and profession-selection so as to reduce unfavorable effect to their living and
continuously improve and enhance their living level while they shall take the interests of the
whole into account and contribute to the urbanization construction.
The public holds unanimously that the proposed water supply project is the infrastructure in
urgent need for construction in cities and towns, as it is favorable to health and safety of the
broad masses. Meanwhile, the implementation of the project can promote construction of roads
and landscaping surrounding the water plant and along the pipelines, favorable to traffic of
residents and development of the 2nd and 3rd industries and value increment of land. It has very
important significance for enhancement of urbanization level and plays an important role in
economy, society, investment environment and development of special industry.
The public expects that emphasis should be put on local water and soil conservation, protection
of surface water environment and ecological construction, planning and construction of
infrastructures of other cities such as sewage treatment plant should be coordinated with the
water supply project and both of them should be planned as a whole without taking one and
losing the other, while the water supply project is being considered.
The public have expressed unanimously their support to the construction of the proposed project
and think at the same time that after the implementation of all the environment protection
measures, the noise, dust and sterilizing gas in the construction period will not bring too great
effect which can be accepted by the common people and the environment.
In addition, the public demand, safety access shall be built for inhabitants going out or into the
affected area during construction period so as to avoid unnecessary accident disputes.
