CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
INTRODUCTION
1.1.    GENERAL BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT PROJECT
Originally under the jurisdiction of Sichuan Province, China, Chongqing was designated in March
1997as a Municipality directly under the control of the Central Government, the fourth after
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Chongqing has an area of 82,400km2 and a population about 31
million, with 6 million inhabiting in urban districts. Due to its special location and economic
advantages, Chongqing has become the largest economic center in the west of China, the
increasingly important bridge and ties linking the so-called West Chongqing (Yuxi)-Chengdu
industrial and economic corridor in the west, connecting the technological and economic zones
along the east coastal line of China through the Yangtze River via the Three Gorges to the east.
According to the Official Reply to the Overall Urban Planning of Chongqing Municipality by the
State Council of P. R. China (GUOHAN [1998] File No.108), Chongqing, one of the most
important cities in the southwest of China and the upper reach of the Yangtze River, one of the
most influential industrial bases, transport and traffic hubs and trade ports nationwide, her urban
construction and development shall be achieved through a strategy for sustainable development,
in harmony with her economic, social, demographic, resources and environmental conditions.
According to the requirements for construction of a municipality to be a city leader in the region,
Chongqing has been expected. to develop into a modern city, with prosperous economy,
developed sciences and education, social civilization, complete facilities and pleasant
environments, featuring unique landscapes as a "hilly city", "river-side city". Meanwhile, the
Official Reply requests Chongqing to develop the urban districts in a controlled way, by taking
effective measures construct cluster quarters in suburban areas, improve and deepen city and
town system planning, raise funds through diversified channels, speed up construction of the
urban infrastructure so as to change the situations of traffic congestion, water supply shortage,
poor drainage, etc. throughout Chongqing Municipality as soon as possible.
The Chongqing Urban Environment Project approved by the World Bank in Fiscal Year 2001,
has been designed to address pollution problems in the Municipality by providing a blend of both
key infrastructure investments and institutional reforms. The objective of the Chongqing Urban
Environment Project (CUEP) is to provide a safe environmental setting for the sustainable long-
term economic growth of urban areas in Chongqing Municipality (CM). The project would
support the Municipality in implementing the first phase of a long-term urban environmental
improvement program to recover from past environmental degradation, provide an adequate
supply of safe water and maintain water quality at levels that are compatible with the needs of
the wider Yangtze River Basin.
Since approval of the loan ($200 million) it has become apparent that there will h' significant
savinng from the loan (estimated at a-_ .ately $60 to $70 million) which may be r! ai.vcated
for existing and/or new project components. The basis for this estimate is the trend in
procurement activities, namely: (a) bid prices of already awarded contracts average between 50
percent and 60 percent of the estimated project costs indicated in the Project Appraisal
Document; (b) reductions in the scope of works, (c) cost reductions arising from refined detailed
engineering design, and (d) loan savings due to works being completed along with ongoing bund
road works, ahead of schedule using Chongqing's own funds.
As of November 2002, Chongqing Municipality began to enter in a dialogue with the World Bank
concerning a second possible loan to finance both urban and environmental projects in

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
Chongqing, subsequently known as the Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement
Project (CSCP). As initially outlined the project focused on four broad sectors:
* Infrastructure construction to support the development of business parks;
*   Water Supply;
*   Bund Roads (including flood control/protection);
*   River Harness (Wastewater and Flood Control/Protection).
As the preparation of a number of the below projects was relatively well advanced, it has been
proposed that these projects could be possibly financed using the loan savings from the first
urban environment project in Chongqing, the CUEP.
The following sub-components are part of the CUEP 1 New Components financed from loan
savings:

As some if not all sub-projects may have significant impacts on the natural or social
environment, it was decided in agreement with the World Bank to prepare a Category A
Consolidated Environmental Assessment (EA) for each of the 3 Sectors of concern for the
CUEP 1 Loan Saving Project, i) Sanitation components, ii) Water supply components and
iii) River embankment components.
To carry out the preparation of these 3 Consolidated EA, the Project Management Office (PMO)
for WB Loan Financed Project in Chongqing appointed CISDI Engineering Co., Ltd.

1.2.    GENERAL BACKGROUND FOR EA
1.2.1.  CLASSIFICATION OF EA
In accordance with PRC National Regulations and the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01
related to Environmental Assessment, the concerned wastewater components of the Project fall
under the Category A project and as such, they require full EA.
1.2.2.  PRINCIPLES & METHODOLOGY FOLLOWED
The project technical and financial preparation was carried out by Chinese local organizations
and has been supported by various sources of international assistance to CUEP, including
SOGREAH, the Design Review and Advisory (DRA) Consultant to the Chongqing Project
Management Office (PMO), the responsible institution for the overall preparation of the project..
In accordance with the Government Regulation "Strengthening Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) Management for the Construction Project Loaned by Intemational Finance
Organisation" of June 21, 1993 and the World Bank Safeguards Operational Policy, the Project
PMO, has commissioned the CISDI Engineering Co. Ltd to carry out the preparation of the
3 Consolidated EA studies for the CUEP Loan Savings components.
The Consolidated EA of CUEP II, China and the Consolidated EIA of Chongqing Environment
Project (CUEP I), China (hereinafter referred to as Consolidated EIA) are based on the individual
ElAs of the subprojects. CISDI Engineering Co., Ltd. compiled the Consolidated EIA Report of
CUEP I and the Consolidated EIA Report for Infrastructures of CUEP II, China, Environmental
Management Plan and Summary of EIA.
Similarly, Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) for each of these 3 subcomponents are currently
under preparation.
This Consolidated EA has therefore been carried out by the CISDI with the assistance of the
DRA Consultant; this overall assessment is based on the EA studies carried out by the various
organizations for the individual components of the project.
1.2,3.  COVERAGE OF EA
This consolidated EA has been carried out strictly in accordance with the State and Chongqing
laws, codes and criteria relating to environmental protection. It satisfies the Chinese EA system,
whilst at the same time gives full attention to the requirements of the World Bank's
environmental safeguards, and more precisely those of the Operational Policy 4.01 for EA.
The EA is based on the collection and use of existing materials and data supplementing missing
material by field investigations.
This Consolidated Environmental Assessment analyzes present environmental situation,
potential impacts of project implementation and proposes mitigation measures in relation to the
wastewater and embankments projects proposed for Bachuan River, Huaiyuan River, Laixi
River, and Taohuaxi River.

3.      ENVIRONMENTAL SITUATION AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
3.1.    PRESENT ENVIRONMENTAL SITUATION IN CHONGQING
3.1.1.  PRESENT SITUATION OF WASTEWATER SECTOR
In 2001, the total amount of wastewater discharged in Chongqing Municipality was
1,265 Million m3, including 812 Million m3 of industrial wastewater and 453 Million m3 of
domestic wastewater.
In 2002, Chongqing had only three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) i.e. Tangjiaqiao,
Beibei and Yubei Chengnan, with a total capacity of 118,000 m3 per day. Chongqing is among
the megalopolises in China with the lowest percentage of urban sewage centrally treated and
the lowest density of drain pipe networks, which was only 7.4% and 5.88 km/km2 respectively.
In 2002, a total of 317 Million m3 of urban sewage were directly discharged into the Yangtze
River in Chongqing. And the central urban districts, Wanzhou District and Fuling District were
the top three dischargers, the central urban districts discharging about 60% of the total. In the
central urban districts, 16 water catchments discharge points have been reported along the
Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, while about 500 wastewater drain outlets are reported on the north
and south banks of Jialing River and the east and west banks of the Yangtze River.
After completion of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the water velocity in the Yangtze River will fall
down to 0.38 m/s from the present 3.8 m/s, causing a significant reduction in the self cleaning
capacity, which in return would probably cause the pollutant concentration in the river sections
running through the central urban districts to increase by 34.5%.
The length of wastewater drain trenches/pipes per capita in Chongqing is only 0.2 m, lower
than 0.27 m the average of cities nationwide. And some of the wastewater drainage systems
have been operating for over 40 years, now in poor conditions.
With a tremendous amount of urban sewage being directly discharged into the Yangtze River
and Jialing River without any treatment, the surface water environmental quality along the
sections of the Yangtze River running through the central urban districts has seen 6 indicators
exceeding the standard for Category IlIl water area. This is quite out of harmony with the water
environmental control efforts taken since the cut-off dam of the Three Gorges was completed.
In September, 2001 the drainage project of the central urban districts (Phase I) financed with
loans from the World Bank was already engaged. The loans from the Cooperation Bank of
Japan were used for Phase II project in 2003. In a principle of planning at one go,
implementing in different phases the project has been executed by perfecting the cDnstruction
of the secondary sewage treatment and sludge treatment systems on the basis of the
pretreatment in Phase I. It was scheduled to complete the project by the end of 2005.
However, in view of the poor ecological environmental conditions in the Three Gorges
Reservoir area, the Central Government requested the wastewater drainage project of the
central urban districts to be implemented faster. Therefore, the construction of the project has
been speeded up and is expected for completion by the end of 2004. Since then, more than
60% of sewage in the central urban districts will be treated, and Jiguanshi Wastewater
Treatment Plant and Tangjiaqiao Wastewater Treatment Plant will have a daily sewage

treatment capacity of 900,000t/a (in 2010) and 1,200,000/a (in 2020), allowing discharge of
treated effluent in compliance with relevant standards and consequently reducing the amount
of pollutant discharged into the two rivers in the central urban districts by about 230,000t each
year.
Meanwhile, construction of 19 sewage treatment plants, several primary and secondary
sewage networks of the first lot in the Three Gorges Reservoir area have been started since
the end of 2001 in 13 districts, cities or counties including Jiangjin, Changshou, Fuling,
Fengdu, Zhongxian, Wulong, Wanzhou, Yunyang, Shizhu, Kaixian, Fengjie, Wuxi, Wushan.
This represents an investment of 2.48 billion RMB in total, for a treatment capacity of
510,000 1/day. Ten of the 19 sewage treatment plants were constructed and put into trial
operation in June, 2003. The trial operation shows that the tail water discharged out of the
sewage treatment plants meet the national water quality standards, and the sewage treatment
plants, with daily treatment capacity of 300,000t, can treat 50% of the sewage produced in the
surroundings.
In addition, Qianjiang District, Dianjiang County and Nanchuan City, which also may affect the
Three Gorges Reservoir have already started urgent construction of VWVTP.
The construction of wastewater treatment facilities in Chongqing Municipality will play an
important role in improving the Yangtze River water environmental quality, promoting the
sustainable development of Chongqing Municipality.
.1.2.  PRESENT SITUATiON OF SOLID WASTE COLLECTION AND TREATMENT
In 2001, 2.75 million tons of solid waste were generated in Chongqing Municipality with a
waste handling rate of 85.09%. In the central urban districts, waste generation amounted to
1.15 million tons, with an handling rate of 98%.
Changshengqiao Sanitary landfill with a capacity of 1500 t/d was completed as part of CUEP
and replaces some of the existing eight open dumpsites in the central urban districts; these
latter sites had a total disposal capacity of 2,930 t of waste per day with stacking and partial
incineration. Most of these latter sites are full and overloaded, resulting in serious pollution to
surrounding soils, ground water and air.
Tongxing Landfill in Beibei District and Heishizi Landfill in Jiangbei District with proposed
capacities of 1,500 tVd and 1,000 t/d are under planning. Also, landfills with different capacities
have been planned or are already under construction in the Three Gorges Reservoir area and
other districts, cities and counties. Chongqing Municipality is now planning to construct 4
hazardous waste treatment plants, and the preliminary engineering of the hazardous %P.'aste
treatment plants in the central urban districts and Changshou District is nearly drawing to a
close.
3.1.3. PRESENT SITUATION FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURES
The west of Chongqing Municipality faces water shortage and the water use in Tongliang
County, Dazu County, Yongchuan City mainly relies on water con7rvation by building dams on
the secondary rivers or rainwater conservation by building reservoirs. However inappropriate
level of wastewater collection and treatment causes serious pollution on such secondary rivers
as Bachuan River, Huaiyuan River, Laixi River, sources of water supply. This situation worsens
the conflict between water supply and pollution, affects the ecological environmental quality and
bottlenecks sustainable development in the west of Chongqing Municipality.

3.2.    OVERALL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL
INFRASTRUCTURE
3.2.1.  OVERALL DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK
In compliance with the decision to expedite implementation of the urbanization strategy,
Chongqing Municipality has formulated an overall framework for the development program of
environmental infrastructure (environmental facilities) and educational, scientific and cultural
facilities including traffic, communications, energy, water supply & drainage, landscaping,
environmental protection, natural calamities prevention and fighting, etc.
The program relies on a rational and sustainable use of resources, strengthens ecological
environmental construction and protection in towns and cities, tries to create a development
pattern with growing production, well-being living and good ecological conditions, basically to
provide towns and cities with complete functionalities meeting the needs of economic and social
development.
3.2.2.  SECTOR ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The concerned sector arrangements for the development program of Urban Environmental
Infrastructure (Environmental Facilities) mainly include:
3.2.2.1. WASTEWATER MANIAGE;,1ENT
In November 2001, the State Council gave official approval to Water Pollution Prevention and
Control Planning for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area and Its Upper Reach, which states that
by 2005 water quality at the main controlled sections of water areas in the Three Gorges
Reservoir and its affecting zone in Chongqing must meet the national surface water
environmental quality standard Category IlIl, and by 2010 the entire water quality must meet
with Category II standard.
After the key environment projects (including: water drainage project in urban districts, sewage
treatment projects in 15 districts and counties in the Three Gorges Reservoir area and 9
regional central cities in the affecting zone, sanitary sewage treatment facilities and matching
sewage pipe network project financed with loans from the World Bank) are completed in the
10th Five-year Plan period, the percentage of urban sanitary sewage centrally treated all over
Chongqing Municipality will rise from 7.2% in 2001 to more than 60%, that in the Three Gorges
Reservoir area to more than 90%. It is estimated that a total of RMB 8.65 billion is required for
these projects.
3.2.2.2. URBAN SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
As set forth in the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Planning for the Three Gorges
Reservoir Area and Its Upper Reach, Chongqing Municipality is placing emphasis on
construction of the following solid waste treatment projects in the 10th Five-oear Pian period:
e   Construction of Changshengqiao Sanitary Landfill, Tongxing Waste Incineration Disposal
Site, Heishizi Sanitary Landfill in the central urban districts, sanitary landfills in 13 districts
and counties in the Three Gorges Reservoir area and 9 regional central cities in the
affecting zone, designed to dispose of sanitary waste of 8,900 t per day in total. It is
estimated that RMB 3.06 billion are required;
*   Construction of 4 hazardous waste treatment centres designed to treat hazardous waste
1 ,480t per day, 540,000t per year. Cost estimate is RMB 330 million;

* Construction of ports in the urban districts, Wanzhou District, Fuling District, Wushan
County, etc. for collection and transfer of vessel sanitary sewage and waste. Cost estimate
is RMB 536 million.
With the construction and operation of the above projects, more than 70% of the urban sanitary
waste will be treated to be harmless all over Chongqing Municipality, and more than 90% in the
Three Gorges Reservoir area.
3.2.2.3. PLANNING OF OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS
*   Water supply project
In the year of 2010, RMB 11.5 billion will be invested to increase the daily water supply
capacity by 1,980,000m3, of which RMB 6.5 billion will be in the central urban districts to
increase in the daily water supply capacity by 900,000m3, also improve the potable water
quality as purified water; RMB 5 billion will be in the further located counties (autonomous
counties, cities) and towns under the county organizational system to increase the daily
water supply capacity by 1,080,000m3, water pipe networks by 1,800km;
*   Landscaping project
Focusing on theme parks, efforts will be continuously taken to ensure construction of
gardens and parks. Five large parks are planned in the central urban districts, and 40 parks
are planned in the further located counties (autonomous counties, cities), with an
investment requirement of RMB 1.65 billion;
*   Secondary river pollution control project
It includes the integrated control of Taohuaxi River, Qingshuixi River in the central urban
districts and 39 secondary rivers in the further located districts and counties. After the
construction of the whole project, the water environmental quality will be improved to a
great extent throughout Chongqing Municipality. It is estimated that RMB 4.8 billion will be
required;
o   Geologic hazard prevention and control project in the Three Gorges Reservoir area
According to the geologic hazard prevention and control planning in the Three Gorges
Reservoir area, the project will be implemented in two phases, requiring an investment of
RMB 5.7 billion in total.
After completion of the above mentioned wastewater and solid waste management
projects, the water quality in Chongqing Section of Yangtze River will likely be significantly
improved and comply with Grade IlIl quality standard. With further treatment of industrial
and agricultural wastewater which fails to meet the standards of discharge, the water
quality in non urban section of Yangtze River is expected to comply with Grade II quality
standard.
3.3.    DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM COMPONENTS UNDER WORLD BANK LOANS
3.3.1.  DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR IMPROVEMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN MEDIUM- AND
SMALL-SIZED TOWNS
Urbanization lies its core in displacement of the excessive rural labor forces, sufficient
employment in the urban and rural areas. Its essence is to improve the people's living standard
by focusing attention on the people. The most urgent mission is to enforce the industrial support,
radically change the present situations of large urban districts coexisting with large rural areas

and outstanding dualistic structure as well. Without the industrial support of towns, urbanization
would be like water running with no sources, trees growing with no roots, and towns would be
void, dead and shell-like towns with no markets.
The characteristic industrial parks are usually at the interface between towns and rural areas.
So, to attract industries and let them settle down in the medium- and small-sized towns,
integrate and spur on the local economic growth, planning and construction of the necessary
infrastructures become an essential prerequisite. This relies on the town resources and regional
advantages, receiving radiation of funds and technologies from large- and medium-sized cities,
optimizing and breeding dominant industries, absorbing the excessive rural labor forces,
developing the secondary and tertiary industries in towns to be stronger contributors to
economic growth, improving the people's living standard and invigorating the towns with
prosperous industries. In this regard the improvement of the infrastructure in medium- and
small-sized towns is one of the most important measures to urbanize the county (district, city)
seats and central towns with higher priority.
Meanwhile, the improvement of the infrastructure in medium- and small-sized towns will not only
integrate and attract preponderant industries to settle down for economic development, but also
help restructure the industries and wash out the behindhand enterprises, achieve transformation
from extensive resource utilization to output of higher-added-value products, thus reducing the
production and discharge of pollutants accordingly. The other benefit is that items which used to
be scattered, hard to control in the past wiil be under standardized management and pollution
control will be relatively centralized according to the Central Government requirements to
improve the operability, uniformity and unit benefits- of pollutant reduction, which is not only
favorable for standardized management by the environmental protection management and
monitoring departments, also for reduction of total amount of pollutants and regional control,
improvement of local environmental quality.
At present, 30 projects aiming for improvement of infrastructure in medium- and small-sized
towns have been approved by Chongqing Municipality, and the area of land for their starting up
and expansion covers 63.4km, of which 16.68km      have been prepared. According to the
planning, the investment for improvement of the infrastructure in medium- and small-sized towns
in Chongqing Municipality will amount to RMB 20 billion in 2007, 145km2 of land will be
prepared, and about 3,000 enterprises will reside in, generating a production value of RMB 170
billion, a revenue of RMB 10 billion, employing 600,000 persons, and thus fulfilling the strategic
target of "re-establishing a new industry in Chongqing".
Of the projects for improvement of infrastructure in medium- and small-sized towns, six are
planned to be financed with loans from the World Bank, as presented in the following Table.

3.3.2.    DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR RIVERBANK (BUND ROAD) PROJECTS
Most of towns and cities in Chongqing Municipality are located before hills, close to rivers. Due
to the factors such as long-term rainwater scouring of slopes, soil erosion, uncontrolled discard        ,   -
of industrial and sanitary wastes and effluents, the secondary rivers of the Yangtze River and
Jialing River have encountered the problems of mud accumulation in riverbed, serious pollution,
which affect the people's living standard, jeopardize the physical and mental health, affect the
urban traffic and transportation, worsen the conditions for flood control and investment
attraction. To this point, the construction of riverbank road and flood control projects is not only
essential to urbanization, also long-awaited and image-showing to the people.
The riverbank road projects in Chongqing Municipality financed with loans from the World Bank
are shown below.

3.4.    SUMMARY OF CSCP
Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement Project (CSCP) mainly consists of bund
subprojects, water supply subprojects, infrastructure improvement and environment subprojects
(wastewater) in medium- and small-sized towns under its jurisdiction. These subprojects are
mostly located in the West Chongqing Corridor with convenient traffic and transportation
conditions, close to Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and Chengdu-Chongqing Expressway. To give
attention to the development of other regions, particularly the economic development and culture
property protection in the regions of minor ethnic groups, similar subprojects have also been
planned in Qianjiang District, Wulong County in the east of Chongqing Municipality. The
Urbanization and Environment Project is designed to increase the capacity of infrastructure like
traffic and transportation, water supply, promote industrial construction in the medium- and
small-sized towns with integration of small town construction, environmental protection and
industrial restructuring, hasten the urbanization process and promote sustainable development
of environment in Chongqing Municipality.
The CSCP financed with loans from the World Bank are one of the important measures for
Chongqing Municipality to implement the urbanization strategy. These projects and the project
sites usually have the following features:
*   Close to the large- and medium-sized cities or medium- and small-sized towns planned by
Chongqing Municipality, the subprojects are arranged with favorable traffic and
transportation, economic and technological conditions, having sufficient labor force, land
and technical resources, much potential of industrial integration and development for
urbanization;
   The subprojects, mostly related to infrastructure and environmental protection in towns and
cities, will a great driving force for industrial restructuring, traffic and transportation
improvement, investment environmental improvement and ecological construction in the
adjacent tocvns and cities, essential to the sustainable development of the adjacent towns
and cities;
*   The subprojects are all urgently needful or lacking for the towns and cities to carry out
industrial restructuring, living and investment environmental improvement;
*   The subprojects are closely related to fostering of the local supporting industries;
*   The subprojects are mutually supplemented to each other, constituting the cornerstone for
improving the infrastructure of Chongqing Municipality for urbanization;
*   The subprojects are commonly expected and supported by the local governments and the
common people.

4.       DESCRIPTION OF THE WASTEWATER PROJECT COMPONENTS
As presented in Section 3 of this report, the CUEP 1 New Components supported by the World
Bank addresses 3 main sectors, the Wastewater Sector, the Water Supply Sector and the River
Embankment Sector.
The cities concerned by the wastewater component are also generally concerned by river
embankment subprojects, with the aim to better integrate pollution control and urban
development. In this case, the embankment subprojects and issues are presented in the River
embankment Sector Consolidated EA. The Present Consolidated EA addresses the Wastewater
Sector Component only.
4.1.    PROJECT COMPLIANCE WITH NATIONAL AND MUNICIPAL STRATEGIES
This section mainly provides a consolidated description of the proposed new Components'
conformity with Chongqing Urban Environment Project (CUEP I) and their compatibility with
relevant planning programs.
The proposed wastewater subprojects concern integrated environmental control of three
secondary rivers. They are designed to intercept urban sewage and deliver it to the Wastewater
Treatment Plants (WWTP) constructed under Chongqing Municipality's jurisdiction. They
constitute complements to CUEP I. As such, they are designed to comply with the principles
formulated for the CUEP I regarding design, public involvement, resettlement, compensation
and environmental protection.
As required in the Overall Planning of Chongqing Municipality and the File issued by the State
Council of P. R. China (GUOHAN [1998] File No.108), the urban construction and development
of Chongqing Municipality shall be done under a strategy for sustainable development, in
harmony with its economic, social, demographic, resources and environmental conditions. The
CUEP I and the WB Loan Savings subprojects comply with this overall development strategy.
According to the requirements defined in the State Council's official reply to the Water Pollution
Prevention and Control Planning for the Upper Reach o' th,- Yangtze River (GUOHAN [2001]
File No. 147), water quality at the main controlled sections of water areas in the upper reach of
the Yangtze River must meet the national surface water environmental quality standard
Category IlIl by 2005 and Category II by 2010.
The WB Loans financed components of CUEP I which will actively promote industrial
restructuring, clean production and pollution control fully comply with the water pollution
prevention and control planning strategy.
Chongqing Municipality is also facing an urgent need for ecological environmental restoration.
The major ecological problems include a too low percentage of forest cover of only 20.98% (the
State required over 45%), difficulties in forestation; severe soil erosion (140,000,000 tVa of soil
and sand flushed into the rivers); frequent natural calamities such as floods and landslides,
insufficient arable land resources. To enforce the ecological conservation strategy, Chongqing
Municipality has addressed "Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution and
Conservation of Ecological Balance" as one of the four priorities of economic and social
achievements by 2015. The ecological conservation planning of Chongqing Municipality
emphasizes integrated control of small river basins, the construction of water supply projects in

5.      WASTEWATER PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
5.1.    GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF CUEP1
The objective of the Project is to assist Chongqing in the first phase of its long term
environmental improvement program to: (a) improve urban environmental services with a view to
reducing environmental degradation of its water and land resources; (b) provide an adequate
supply of safe water to its growing urban population and economy; (c) maintain water quality at
levels which are compatible with the needs of the wider Yangtze River basin and of the Three
Gorges Reservoir.
5.2.   M'YA1A IA CRITERIA rOR AL-ERNAT-!/E SELECTION
Various alternatives were considered prior to project definition, which were compared based on
the following main selection criteria:
*   Site location for the treatment plant: comparison was mainly based on distance of site to
serviced area (length of main sewers), to nearest access road and receiving river (length of
treated effluent outlet);
a   Site land use: this criteria considers basically land acquisition and resettlement needs for
the plant. However this criteria was not found critical as alternative sites anticiPated were all
cultivated land;
*   Receiving river Function Class: not a critical criteria as the alternative plant sites were
considering the same rivers for discharging treated effluents;
*   Topography: a major criteria as it influences the gravity flow and the earthwcrks for laying
the mains;
*   Process and design: Criteria is mainly based on investment cost and operational easiness.
5.3.    ALTERNATIVE WITHOUT PROJECT
Without project, the already poor water quality of the Chongqing Municipality rivers will continue
to degrade, resulting in the progressive vanishing of the river life, and eventually increased
pollutant and nutrient load to the Three Gorges Reservoir, speeding up the eutrophication
process of the water body with disastrous results on reservoir ecology, fisheries and water uses.
After completion of the Three C-,orpe- R.eservoir, the water velocity i . ', a   River will fall
down to 0.38 m/s from the present b.8 m/s, causing a significant reduction in the self cleaning
capacity, which in return would probably cause the pollutant concentration in the river sections
running through the central urban districts to increase by 34.5%. Urgent action is required to
avoid the urban branches of the Yangtze river system to turn into open sewers.
The WB Loan Savings Components related to the wastewater sector will reduce by more than
3,00C ,Lons/year the BOD5 load presently discharged in the Bachuan, Huaiyuan, Laixi and
Taohuaxi rivers, all parts of the Yangtze basin. The whole wastewater component project under

development will achieve the treatment of almost 600,000 m3 /day of urban wastewater, which
will eventually correspond to a pollution abatement of 26,000 t/year.
Aside from river quality improvement, necessary improvement of sanitation and public health in
urban areas totalizing several millions population is not questionable, mainly after those recent
and threatening experiences with new viral epidemics which spread easily through waste water.
Both in terms of economic development, public health and environment, the "non project"
situation is not an acceptable alternative.

Mituo Town, Fulong Town and Longshui Town are distributed along both east and west banks of
Laixi River, 4 to 8km from each other. The process design analysis compares 4 options to
establish sewage treatment plant:
Option 1: Mituo Town, Fulong Town and Longshui Town each build up one sewage treatment
plant with capacities of 1,500m3/d, 2,OOOm3/d and 30,00Om3/d respectively in Phase I;
Option 11: Mituo Town and Longshui Town each build up one sewage treatment plant with
capacities of 2,000m3/d and 30,000m3/d respectively in Phase l;
Option III: Longshui Town alone builds up one sewage treatment plant with capacity of
30,000m3/d in Phase l;
Option IV: Fulong Town and Longshui Town each L'jild up one sewage treatment with capacities
of 2,500m3/d and 30,000m3/d respectively in Phase 1.
For the site selection concept of sewage treatment plant, Option I features short sewage
interception main and short laying depth, no pumping station required, convenient construction
access, easy management during operation and lower investment. Considering the planning of
the three towns' development and the feature of Fulong Town, which is a simple agricultural
town, with limited sewage of standard domestic quality and located near Longshui Town, it is

recommended to intercept its sewage and send it to treatment plant in Longshui Town. Option III
is the preferred option.
The design compares the Oxidation Ditch and Sequential Batch Reactor (SBR) to be used for
sewage treatment and plant operation. The Oxidation Ditch is proposed because of lower
investment and easy operation management.
5.6.    ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT FOR SLUDGE
The network will collect a significant proportion of industrial effluent, with the risk of accumulation
of contaminants as heavy metals in the sludge. For this reason, sludge reuse is not considered
as an acceptable alternative.
According to Chinese regulations, the quality of sludge leaving the WWTP must satisfy
standards which can only be complied with after a stabilization process. Sludge will then be
stabilized prior to disposal in suitable sanitary landfills. Alternative without stabilization is thus not
considered.

6.      BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
6.1.    PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
Chongqing is also called Yu in Chinese for abbreviation, and one of the four municipalities
directly under the Central Government, located at latitude between 28010' and 32013' north and
at longitude between 105011' and 110011' east. Chongqing, with a total area of 82,403km2,
bounds on the west by Sichuan Province, south by Guizhou Province, east by Hubei Province
and north by Shanxi Province, and connects the eastern China well developed to the western
China abundant in resources.
Chongqing is located in central part of Southwest China and in a center strip of Great
Development of West China. Chongqing is also a very important central municipality on
upstream of The Yangtze River, and acts as an important industrial base, transportation center
and trade port in China.
For Changshou District, Dazu County and Tongliang County, which involve integrated river
control, the specific locations of them in Chongqing administrative region are shown in the
attached drawings(Appendix 2).
C.6.1.  CL!MATE
Chongqing is lccated in medium sub-tropical humid monsoon area, and features hot-summer-
cold-winter, rich but seasonally uneven rainfall, high humidity, cloudy weather, long frostless
period and low wind speed. The average annual temperature is 16.9-18.8 OC, and average
annual, rainfall 814.8-1229mm, average annual relative humidity 77-81%. The leading wind
throughout the year is of NE wind and N wind with average annual speed of 0.7-1.7m/s: Some
area is affected by the local terrain where the leading wind has the same direction as the valley
extends.
6.1._.  HYDROLOGY
Chongqing is dominated by low mountains and hills, and suffers from the serious soil erosion.
There are more than ten rivers, small or large, such as The Yangtze River, Jialin River, Wujiang
River, Daling River across Chongqing. But 96.9% of water resource is of passing water
resource, and therefore the water resource utilization per capita of Chongqing is only 720m3/a
Chongqing, amounting for 33% of the national average. There is lack of water in the western,
southeastern and northern Chongqing.
Bachuan River originates from somewhere to the n. .h of Bachuan Town and runs through this
town, and finally joints the Huaiyuan River between Bailong Bridge and Yandu Bridge. Bachuan
River is 14.02km long and covers the basin of 57.8km2, with average annual flow of 0.68m3/s.
Huaiyuan River originates in Dazu County and runs into Tongliang County through Tuqiao Town
and then runs through Quande, Shixiang, and finally joins Xiaoanxi River in the place named
Hetanshi located in old downtown of Tongliang County. Huaiyuan River is 73.1km long and
covers the basin of 536.3km2, with average annual flow of 6.44m3/s.

Laixi River is the main river and also the potable water source in Dazu County. It originates in
Beiyun Village, Tianshan Town, Dazu County and runs through Zhongao, Longgang, Longshui
and Zhuxi up to Rongchang County, and then joins Tuojiang River in Hushi Town, Luxian County
which finally joins The Yangtze River. Laixi River in Dazu County is 71.4km long and covers the
basin of 929.3km2, with average annual flow of 12.57m3/s.
Taohuaxi River in Changshou District is the one of the major branches to The Yangtze River. It
originates in Wangshaopo of Xishang Mountain in Changshou District, and runs through Yihe,
Shiyang, Gelang, Tiantai, Xlnshi, Fuhe, Bake, Duzhou, Fengcheng and joins The Yangtze River
in the place named Shiliangzi, Hejie, Changshou District. Taohuaxi River is 65.1km long with
average multi-annual flow of 5.98m /s.
6.1.3.  SURFACE WATER QUALITY
Water quality monitoring data for river sections of Huaiyuan River upstream and downstream in
May 2003; monitoring data for ambient air quality and environmental noise level in May 2003,
done by Environment Monitoring Station of Tongliang County.
Water quality monituring data for river sections in the vicinity of various proposed sewage
treatment plants along Laixi River, ambient air quality and environmental noise level in July
2003, done by Environment Monitoring Station of Dazu County.
Water quality monitoring data for river sections from Gelan Bridge to Andao Bridge across
Taohuaxi River in 2002, for ambient air quality in Feb., 2003, and for environmental noise level
related to the proposed project in June 2003, done by Environment Monitoring Station of
Changshou District.
Surface water of these 3 secondary rivers related to the proposed projects is severely polluted
and ail main pollutants fail to comply with the standards. Serious failure of conformance of BOD5
in Taohuaxi River and NH3-N and Total-P in Three Rivers, mainly result from the domestic
sewage and irrigation effluent which are directly discharged into rivers without treatment. For
petroleum pollutant and COD, the pollution level at and over Grade V may result from the
discharge of industrial waste water along the rivers.

The soil in assessed area is of paddy soil, violet soil, yellow soil and alluvium. Main terrestrial
vegetation consists of ever-green board-leaved forest, coniferous forest, bamboo forest and
ever-green bush. The forest coverage in related county and district ranges from 24.5% to 27.6%.
Dazu County has been awarded granted the Ecological Agriculture Achievement County in
China. In addition to the usual trees such as cypress, horsetail pin and fir, Chongqing has rare
plants such as gingko, yellow thorn, Nanmu and Metasequoia.
Areas anticipated for the development of the WWTP are both agricultural land with only sparse
secondary vegetation of shrubs and trees.
6.2.2.  WILDLIFE
Aquatic ecological systems mainly consist of fishes, poultry such as goose and duck and small
amounts of aquatics ahd amphibian such as frog. Due to serious water lack in western
Chongqing, there are many man-made dams and reservoirs in the basins of the secondary
rivers therein.

There is no area of special environmental protection (nature reserve, historical site) concerned
by the project development.
6.2.4.  AQUATIC ECOLOGY
Limited information does exist on the aquatic ecology, except the fact that water pollution in the
areas concerned by the project has seriously altered habitats and biodiversity. There is no
organized fisheries at least in the river reaches located in the vicinity of the project sites.
However, some isolated fishermen can be observed along the rivers using rods (close to cities
and in the most polluted sections of the river) or using otter or gill net from small boats.
Aside from liquid effluents as sewage, urban river reaches are heavily polluted by the direct
discharge of solid waste in numerous places.

Current population in Tongliang County is approx. 808,000, of which rural population amounts
for 85.6% and urbanization rate is only 20%. The integrated environment control for Bachuan
River and Huaiyuan River mainly involves Bachuan Town, capital of Tongliang County.
According to the schedule, the population in Bachuan Town will come up to 150,000 to 280,000
in the period of 2005 to 2020, of which the urban population amounts for approx. 41 % to 54%.
Current population in Dazu County is approx. 925,000, of which rural population amounts for
86.3% and urbanization rate is 22.8%. The integrated environment control for Laxi River mainly
involves Longshui Town, Fulong Town and Mituo Town. According to the schedule, the
population in Longshui Town will come up to 75,000 to 130,000 in the period of 2005 to 2020,
the population in Fulong Town will come up to 5,600 to 16,000 in the period of 2005 to 2020 and

In 2001, GDP in Changshou District is 5.57 billion RMB. In Duzhou Town and New Taohua
Town along the both banks of Taohuaxi River are mainly distributed the industries of ceramic,
fertilizer, natural gas and machining.
6.3.3.  INFRASTRUCTURES & SERVICES
So poor are the Infrastructure and flood-proof & drainage facilities in various towns along
Bachuan River/Huaiyuan River in Tongliang County, Laixi River (hereinafter called Three Rivers).
in Dazu County and Taohuaxi River in Changshou District, which are proposed for integrated
environment control, that industrial waste water without due treatment and qualification for
discharge combines with the poor-treated agricultural waste water, domestic sewage and rainfall
to flow into the rivers.
Flood-proof project has already completed for the section of Bachuan River within Bachuan
Town ranging from Xianyu Bridge north to Longmenti south, and waste water interception mains
have been laid onto the river bed in this section of Bachuan River. Water supply plant' in the
north of Bachuan Town can supply water of 30,000m3 /d. Sewage is collected in the masonry
conduits and then discharged into Bachuan River and Huaiyuan River. Due to impact from
industrial waste water and domestic sewage, approx. 30,000t of waste is disposed at discretion
at suburb and along both banks of the rivers. It thus causes serious organic pollution in river
water bodies and terrible odor, and makes the rivers full of floating and foam. As a result, the city
appearance and people's mental and physical health are seriously deteriorated.
Longshui Town, Fulong Town and Mituo Town each has one water supply plant which can
supply water of 30,00Om3/d, 1 ,500m3/d and 2,300m3/d respectively. The water supply pipework
for Longshui Town and Fulong Town are 42km and 5.2km long respectively. The drains for the
above-mentioned three towns are 36000m, 350m and 350m long respectively and mainly
ccnsist of masonry conduits. At present, the sewage drains are troubled by small cross sections,
out of maintenance after years of service, popular collapse and serious silt-up. The limited
capacity of drain easily leads to flood throughout downtown area in case of heavy rain. Only in
the section of Laixi River running through the center of Longshui Town exists 1km long masonry
river banks. Along banks of other sections of this river are piled by waste.
In Changshou District, there are two water supply plants: Ximen Water Supply Plant
(36,000m /d) and No.2 Water Supply Plant located in Miaoshanpo. Domestic sewage is mainly
treated in septic tanks and then discharged. In downtown area, there are approx. 150 septic
tanks with a total capacity of approx. 8,000m3. Except the newly built residence areas where
rainfall and sewage are respectively drained, rainfall and sewage are combined for drainage in
other areas. The masonry drains are 10km long and carry the most of sewage into Taohuaxi
River.
6.3.4.  QUALITY OF LIFE
In 2001, the GDP per capita of Tongliang is 5445 RMB. Bachuan Town is awarded "Ideal
Environment for Human Habitant in China" and "Small & Civilized Town in China ".
Longshui Town is an economic center of Dazu County with developed business of hardware and
,r:tium-specific chemic2l indt-try and has ample tourist resource of far-, - Longshui Lake.
Residents in urban and rural areas enjoy a growing incomes and impro.i,~ living standards.
One employed person has an average wage of 8809 RMB per year while one person in
countryside has an average income of 3456 RMB per year. Longshui Town is also one of 58
demonstration towns in national small town construction plan.
In Changshou District, one employed person has an average wage of approx. 10,000 RMB per
year and enjoys a living standard like the people in Chongqing Municipality.

6.3.5.  CULTURAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL VALUES
There is no relicts of cultural or archaeological value identified and reported from the project
sites.
6.3.6.  SENSITIVE SITES
Due to the location of the project components either in urban areas or sub-urban agricultural
land, there are no ecologically sensitive areas neither protected areas identified near the project
sites.
No site of particular sensitivity is observed near the proposed WWTP sites. Urban areas are
located at least 100 m from the WWTP borderlines.
In Tongliang, two sites of particular sensitivity to noise have been identified, located close to the
river embankments works and which could, in the future, be affected by the road traffic on the
embankment: a residential area and a primary school.
In Longshui, two primary schools are located close to the future river embankment.
In Changshou, no site of particular sensitivity is observed.
These sites are indicated on the maps presented in Appendix 2.

3.4.1.  INDUSTRIAL POLLUTIC;j
Except iarge- and rnedium-sized state-owned enterprises in the proposed areas, most of the
medium- and small-sized enterprises lack appropriate sewage treatment facilities and contribute
heavily to the pollution load in the proposed rivers (Huaiyuan River and Bachuan River in
Tongliang County, Laixi River in Dazu County and Taohuaxi River in Changshou District).
Therefore, the industry and economy structures in these areas need to be re-organized. The
management shall be standardized. The pollution must be controlled from pollution source.
Based on following tables, it is observed that most of the industrial wastewater fail to meet the
discharge si- - -rds, and contribute as a main water poliution source in the project areas. Th-
counter-me1_-uit.,' in the corresponding counties and district are to adjust industry structure and
eliminate the enterprises with high consumption of resource and energy and serious pollutions;
and organize smaller enterprises in industrial parks. Based on central treatment of chromium-
bearing waste water produced during electroplating, the industrial park in Longshui Town will
introduce complete set of treatment facilities to improve further the treatment on chromium-
bearing waste water, so as to meet the discharge standard even when the park is expanded.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY -THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
It is estimated today that the potential contribution of the industrial wastewater to the WWTP
inflows may represent 9.4% for Mandongzhipo WWTP (Tongliang) and 16.5% for Wuguituo
WWTP (Dazu). Proportion of industrial wastewater and its treatment measures and plans for
Tongliang and Dazu are detailed hereunder. For the sewer network extension in Taohua
(Changshou), there will be almost no industrial flow as Taohua new township will be mainly the
location of government agencies and residential area.
6.4.1.1. INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER PROPORTION AND ITS TREATMENT MEASURES AND PLANS IN TONGLIANG
Tongliang has 65 industrial enterprises with considerable sizes, including silk, machinery,
petroleum chemicals, construction materials and food processing, mainly located in Bachuan
Town, capital town of Tongliang County.
Industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater generated in Bachuan Town are discharged
directly into Bachuan River and Huaiyuan River without any treatment. At present, the rainwater
and wastewater are combined for discharge and most of sewers are of concealed stonework
sewer. Main polluters of industrial wastewater include Chongqing Longzhu Electricity Co., Ltd.,
Tongliang Silk Co., Ltd., Tongliang Tianqing Strontium Salt Company, Fine Chemicals
Company, Xianfeng Strontium Salt Company, Yeshoubao Amylum Sugar Factory and Linda
Industries Co Ltd. According to preliminary estimate, there is approx. 2570m3/d of industrial
wastewater in Bachuan Town, accounting for about 9.4% of the total effluent wastewater of
Bachuan Town at present.
According to planning, rainwater and wastewater are discharged separately in Bachuan Town.
For Chongqing Longzhu Electricity Co., Ltd., most of wastewater is indirect equipment cooling
water, which will be recycled as much as possible to reduce effluent. For Tongliang Silk Co.,
Ltd., the current wastewater treatment equipment can treat wastewater at a rate of 450m3/d,
For other enterprises, the wastewater generated by them needs to be respectively treated by
their own wastewater treatment equipment for qualified discharge into municipal sewer system,
from which the wastewater is sent to the proposed wastewater treatment plant for central
treatment.
6.4.1 .2. INDUSTRIAL WASTE'YATER PROPCRTiON AND ITS TREATMENTJT MEASURES AND PLANS IN DAZU
Longshui Town is the biggest market of small hardware in southeast China, an economic center
of Dazu County and also short listed in the town reform in China. Longshui Town sees some
development of new and hi-tech industry such as vehicle and motorcycle spare parts business
developed on basis of small hardware.
According to industrial wastewater and domestic wastewater discharge data about enterprises in
ind6strial park of Longshui Town, it is preliminarily estirnated that industrial wastewater is
ap,rox. 3300m3/d, accounting for 16.5% of the total effluent wastewater from Longshui Town at
present.
According to the planning of the town, rainwater and wastewater are discharged separately in
Longshui Town. In the Industrial Park of Longshui Town is located central treatment facility for
electroplating wastewater at a planned capacity of 1000m3/d (200m3/d at present). According to
the principle of separate discharge of rainwater and wastewater in industrial zone, the production
wastewater is discharged at rate of 1500m3/d, and treated by combination of separate and
central treatments. Electrop!ating wastewater is treated within the electroplating area. Domestic
wastewater is treated in H: domestic wastewater treatment facili;y featuring high efficiency and
zero energy consumption or septic tank in the near future, and will be treated in wastewater
treatment plant of Longshui Town for discharge up to standard in the far future. Other production
wastewater will be treated by various works in industrial zone for discharge up to standard.
Industrial wastewater from Hongdie Strontium Business Company is about 380m3/d and is
treated for discharge up to standard.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
According to the planning of Longshui Town, industrial wastewaters from other small hardware
industries shall be first treated in various works up to standard and then join the municipal sewer
system for central treatment in the proposed wastewater treatment plant.
6.4.2.  POOR INFRASTRUCTURES
There are generally poor infrastructures regarding flood control and sanitation facilities in various
towns along Three Rivers proposed for integrated environment control. Domestic refuse
requires urgent improvement for collection, transport and disposal. Industrial waste water is
seldom treated and has a high pollution level. Without due treatment, industrial waste water,
agricultural waste water and domestic sewage are discharged into Three Rivers without control.
6.4.3.  RIVERS NEED TO BE CONTROLLED
Three Rivers feature seasonal flood, which is caused by the storms and has the same
occurrence frequency as the storms. Due to the fact that flood-proof capacity for Three Rivers
can not resist the flood which may take place every ten years, the Three Rivers basins often
suffer from flood. According to the statistics from weather forecast stations, 39 floods took place
in Tongliang County during the recent 44 years from 1950 to 1993. During the period of gth to
10 h, July, 1989, there was 218mm of rainfall in Tongliang County and Bachuan Town was
surrounded by the flood, where 10 streets, 30 enterprises and 6 schools was flooded, 2456
rooms, 6.9 hectares of vegetable field and 213.3 hectares of farmland was ruined by flood, and
about 10,000 people suffered from that flood. Also Taohuaxi River and Laixi River have suffered
from frequent flood. Since 1949, Taohuaxi River witnessed 4 great floods.
Due to impact from industrial waste water and domestic sewage and undue waste disposal, the
secondary branches to The Yangtze River, located in Three Rivers basins, are full of
contaminated flow during rainy season and become hotbed of the fly and mosquito. Waste
causes serious organic pollution in river water bodies and terrible odor, and makes the rivers full
of floating and foam. Thus the city appearance and people's mental and physical health are
seriously deteriorated.
Therefore, it is urgent to improve the weakness of current infrastructure in those towns and to
control the environment pollution in Three Rivers basins, which otherwise can not provides solid
foundation for urbanization. For this reason, the proposed sites for sanitation also benefit an
integrated approach and include a river embankment program, which components are
addressed in the Sector Specific EA on River Embankments.
6.4.4.  ENVIRONMENT CONDITIONS FOR INTEGRATED RIVER CONTROL
From macro point of view, Chinese government introduces the strategies of great development
of the West, improvement of urbanization, strengthening of ecological environment construction
and ecological reservation upstream The Yangtze River, which provides internal beneficial
conditions. Based on analysis of local resources, position and economy advantages since
Chongqin, b-came the 4th municipality directly under Central Government, the World L.ai,.
decides to make an investment in this key area of great development of the West. Therefore,
this investment not only helps Chongqing improve environmental infrastructure and promotes
local economy, but also establishes a friendly statue of the World Bank as a constant helper for
developing countries and areas while at the same time benefiting the World Bank by return of
the investment.
From the point view of Three Rivers basins, the local governments fully realize the importance of
environmental infrastructure construction. Poor environment means weak urbanization and
unsustainable development. Therefore, the local governments pay much attentions on the

proposed integrated river control in their respective development plans and give them the priority
with respect to allocation of finance resource.
In some areas adjacent to the towns, the riverfront has already been treated and certain results
and experience are made.
In addition, Three Rivers are considered Mother River for the local people. The integrated river
control will be good for their essential interests and therefore gain general support from them.
The construction materials to be used in integrated river control projects are available in the
related countries and district, which reduces the intermediate links of transportation and
management and therefore makes the project cost controlled in a reasonable way.

7.      IMPACT ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION
7.1.    GENERAL
This chapter discusses the impact of the proposed sanitation sub-components of the
CUEP 1 Loan Savings on the physical and human environment. Topics covered include:
*   Impacts on the surface water environment;
*   Impacts on air quality;
*   Impacts of noise;
*   Impacts of solid waste;
*   Impacts on ecological resources;
   Social Impacts including land acquisition and resettlement;
   Economic Impacts; and
n Accidental Impacts.
The overall impact of CUEP 1 New Components on the environment will be highly beneficial,
particularly on the improvement of the river water quality and on the public health. It is not
anticipated that the implementation of the project will involve unmanageable negative impacts.
The proposed wastewater components will have many positive effects, most notably:
*   Improve water quality of the Bachuan, Huaiyuan, Laixi and Taohuachi rivers and eventually
of the aquatic ecological environment of the Three Gorges Reservoir.
*   Enhance urban construction level of Chongqing Municipality, reduce impact of untreated
wastewater on drinking water sources and improve urban landscape.
   Improve urban sanitary conditions and enhance public health level.
Prediction and analysis of future water quality conditions in the rivers where treated effluent will
be discharged are presented in this section. Odor and noise pollution from wastewater treatment
plants, pump station and sludge management are also assessed in the report, using standard
air dispersion model.
Construction activities for wastewater treatment plants, pump stations and pipe network may
cause noise, dust, fumes emission, nuisance for the residents, traffic jam, temporary cut-off
water and .cs bUpi;1. These issues are tempnrc.. only and their impact can be sig '; -intly
minimized or by appropriate construction management practices and appropriate constfuction
monitoring. For all these issues. mitigation measures are proposed and developed further in this
report (see chapter on Environmental Management Plan).

7.2.    POTENTIAL IMPACTS & MITIGATION DUE TO PRCOJECT LOCATION
7.2.1.  PERMANENT LAND OCCUPATION AND RESETTLEMENT
In general the potential impacts of land acquisition for the Chongqing Environment Project are
mainly imposed on the adjacent towns and rural inhabitants due to the land use by sewage
treatment plants, pipes and embankments. As occupied is a part of flood land whose actual use
is restricted to a certain extent, involvement of housings which have to be relocated or tillable
fields which have to be occupied is relatively low, the apparent impacts mainly happen during the
construction period. After the construction, as the river banks are renovated, slope protections
and embankment protections have been built, control of soil erosion and enforcement of flood
protection are ensured, and valuable land is readily available for greening and construction of
towns while the land acquired or occupied during the construction period will have a higher
added value after the construction of the projects.
According to following Tables, the proposed integrated environmental control for Three River
need 115.9 hectares land in total, of which 53.87 hectares for Bachuan River and Huaiyuan
River for sewage water treatment plant and riverway control; 21.83 hectares for Laixi River for
sewage water treatment plant and dikes control; 40.2 hectares for Taohuaxi River for dike and
riverway control, and sewage interception pipework.
In Tongliang County, 4015m2 cf residence house will be relocated, of which 3468m2 of farming
house and 547m2 of enterprises and organization house. 88 persons will be subject to house
relocation, of which 14 persons are farmers. 211 farmers need for resettlement due to land
occupation. A little of scattered fruit trees, outbuilding or special farming facilities of the farmers
are also in the range of land occupation. In Mingguang Village, Xingguang Village, Yujiang
Village, Longdong Village and Puan Village of Dazu County, there are 21.83 hectares of land
subject to occupation and 2071 persons subject to resettlement in total. In 10 villages under
Duzhou Town and Fongchen Town of Changshou District, there are 422 persons (including 413
farmers) in 106 families to become immigrants, 14210.64m2 of housing area to be relocated and
17.7 hectares of farmland to be occupied.
The land occupation by the proposed projects has insignificant impact on the short-term
economic income. With reasonable compensation for land occupation and relocation and also
various beneficial conditions and funds provided for immigrants resettlement, the immigrants will
have no problems to make a living. According to analysis, 23.987 million RMB is needed to

The proposed projects involve three secondary rivers with flow less than 15m3/s, which are
regarded as small rivers. Therefore, this assessment adopts one-dimensional stable river quality
model from water quality management information system, one of results from National
"Seventh-Five-Year-Plan" on major scientific and technical research, to stimulate, estimate and
calculate impermanent pollutants. The estimation formula of model with respect to evaluation
factors BOD5, NH3-H and COD is as follows:
LBOD=LBODO (-(K1+K2) t)
NH3-N = (NH3-N)o exp (-Kn t)
LcoD=LcoDo (-KCOD t)
where
LCOD LBOD and NH3-N respectively mean concentration of COD, BOD and NH3-N X meters from
initial section, measured by mg/L;

Expression of t=x/u means flowing time of river, measured by second (s); x refers to longitudinal
coordinate distance of river, measured by meter (m); u means average flowing speed, measured
by m/s.
KCOD means comprehensive attenuation coefficient of COD, K, means attenuation coefficient of
BOD5, K2 means coefficient of recovered oxygen, KN means attenuation coefficient of NH3-N, all
of them expressed by l/d. During estimation, the values can be determined by Two-point Method
or be taken with safety margin based on experience with consideration of river featuring shallow
and small flow amount water.
For permanent pollutants, zero-dimensional totally mixed model is used for calculation.
7.2.2.2. TwO-DIMENSIONAL STABLE MIXING MODEL
For river section adjacent to confluence where the secondary rivers join the Yangtze River or the
Jialin River, it shall adopt the common mathematic model and suggestion for river, which are
stipulated in EAI Technical Guideline on Surface Water Environment (HJ/T 2.3-93). For
estimation of surface environment impact in this project, it shall combine both two-dimensional
stable mixing accumulative flow model for mixing process in winding river section with effluent
discharged from banks and totally mixed model for fully mixed section. They are respectively
described as follows:
1.  Permanent pollutants
*   Mixing process section:
C(x,q)=Ch+CpQp/(-,,MqX)1/2 . exp(-q2/(4Mqx))+exp(-(2Qh-q)2/(4Mqx)) I
*   Fully mixed section:
C=( CpQp+ChQh)/(Qp+Qh)
where
- x means distance from confluence of secondary river to the river section planned for
estimation, measured by mi;
- q means accumulative flow, measured by m3/s; q=Huy, where H means water depth,
measured by m; u means flowing speed, measure by m/s; y means distance from
estimation point to the bank on the side of confluence, measured by m);
- Ch means pollutant concentration on the corresponding upstream section, measured
by mg/L;
- Qh means river flow up;reoiii ffom confluence, measured by rm ,;
- Cp means pollutant concentration in the secondary river, measured by mg/L;
-    means secondary river flow, measured by m3/s;
- M means transversal mixing coefficient in accumulative flow coordinate, measured by
m /s I
- (Mq=H 2uMY, where My means transversal mixing coefficient, measured by m2/s; H and
u have the same m_cnings as in the previous paragraphs.)

e   Selection of data with respect to hydrology and hydraulics
Based on statistic information from Chuntang Hydrologic Station on Yangtze River and Beibei
Hydrologic Station on Jialin River for many years, there is usually 1 to 3 months of low water
period in Chongqing area. During March 1987, as a typical example for low water period, the
extremely minimum flow of Yangtze River is 2060m /s (on April 1, 1973) and Jialing River
244m3/s (on March 3, 1973). Thus 98% is taken as assured minimum flow. Therefore, 1816m3/s
is taken as upstream Yangtze River on Luxian Country flow during typical low water period and
2063m3/s as Changshou section of Yangtze River flow during typical low water period. Based on
11102 m3/s of average Yangtze Rive flow for 38 years (from 1950 to 1987), the flow rate is
estimated with safe margin and used in this evaluation as flow rate during high water.
The transversal mixing coefficient My is calculated with Taylor method:
My=(0.058H+0.0065B)u..u.=  gHJ
where
- My means transversal mixing coefficient. measured by m2/s;
- H means water depth, measured by meter;
- B means river width, measured by meter;
- u. means shearing flowing speed, measured by m/s.
- I means water slope;
- g is 9.81m/s2.
After the water builds up in the Three Georges reservoir area, the upstream backwater comes to
Huahongbao, Jiangjin Country (for Yangtze River) and Maliuping, Hechuan Country (for Jialin
River). When reservoir water level for Gezhouba Dam during low water period is 175m, under
the preconditions where output flow from Gezhouba Dam keeps 5683m3/s and flow rate on the
Chuntang section of Yangtze River keeps 5,000m3/s, the change of hydraulics data of Chuntang
section of Yangtze Rive is shown in following Table. From that table, it is observed that the
diluting and self-cleaning capability are reduced with less flow rate, water slope and transversal
mixing coefficient.

For Luxian section where Laixi River joins Yangtze River and Changshou section where
Taohuaxi River joins Yangtze River, the transversal mixing coefficient for Chuntang Section can
be used for calculation because the variation thereof is very limited.
This change in transversal mixing capacity due to the TGD through its backwater effect will be
fully considered when assessing the impact of the project during the operation period of the
wastewater treatment plants.

7.3.    IMPACTS & MITIGATION DURING CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION
7.3.1.  IMPACT ON WATER QUALITY
7.3.1.1. IMPACT DURING CONSTRUCTION
The most important impact on water quality will result from activities for the construction of river
embankments. In particular, river dredging will increase the SS concentrations in local
watercourse under construction up to approx. 500mg/L and even more. However, the water will
probably return to its original SS condition after 3 to 5km of natural settlement.
Along Laixi River are located urban water sources for Longshui Town, Fulong Town and Mituo
Town. The existing water supply plants are also capable to clarify and remove SS. Due to the
fact that watercourse control and dike project only make SS treatment load increased during
short period, the water supply therefore will not be affected. On the contrary, with the laying of
interception pipework and control along the rivers, the water source quality will become better,
which consequentially allows better water for water supply plant.
Mitigation Measures: During Construction, some quantities of wastewater will be generated by
aggregate washing, construction activities and labor camps. After settlement pond treatment,
aggregate washing water will be used as mixing water to prepare mortar for masonry works.
Pollution load of effluents from construction sites will be reduced by appropriate practices
particularly during refueling and maintenance of trucks and heavy machinery. Pollution from
labor camps will be controlled through appropriate sanitation facilities as Ventilated Improved
Latrines or septic tanks. A minimum of one toilet facility for 20 workers will be required.
v.2.1.2. IMPACT DURING rPrFATC.
It is estimated that after implementation of integrated environmental control for Bachuan River
and Huaiyuan River, the effluents from sewage treatment plant comply with the Grade IlIl of
water body standards with respect to COD, BOD5 and total P. The only exception is NH3-N
during the low water period where the maximum concentration is 1.4 times more than standard
value. It is suggested that the denitrification capacity on sewage in the proposed project be so
designed that NH3-N concentrations in effluents over 120C during low water period is not more
than 1 Omg/l and the corresponding indicators comply with the standards.
After implementation of integrated environmental control for Laixi River, due to sewage
interception and treE-. rient along Longshui Town, Fulong Towr and Mituo Town, the water
quality of Laixi River wiii be significantly improved. The current urcw'alifiecd COD and NH3-N in
section of Huilongwang, on entry of Yutang Reservoir which is located downstream of those
town and acts as water supply resource, will comply with Grade IlIl of water body standard.
Changes in pollutant load to concerned river sections are presented in the following table.

The implementation of proposed wastewater project will improve water quality of Three Rivers in
some degree. However, without significant control of pollution source of industrial wastewater
from both banks along Three Rivers, and with serious pollution resulting from agricultural
irrigation return flow in related basins, COD is beyond the standard value in general and NH3-N
and Total P for Huaiyuan River and Total P for Taohuaxi River are also beyond the standard
values. Therefore, the control of pollution source of industrial waster water shall be integrated
into the proposed project in order that the related water bodies meet the requirements of
environmental function.

CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
Mitigation during Operation stage: the sewage treatment plants will adopt Oxidation Ditch
method to treat the intercepted sewage from towns and the effluents will comply with B, Class I
of aquatic pollutant standards as stipulated in "Pollutant Discharge Standards for Municipal
Sewage Treatment Plant" (GB18918-2002). Effluents will receive tertiary disinfection before
being discharged in the river stream and will comply with standards for discharge after
disinfection treatment. For each sewage treatment plant, the feasibility study analyzes and
compares the possible disinfection method of ultraviolet light disinfection, chlorine dioxide
disinfection and liquid chlorine disinfection. It is suggested to adopt the same disinfection
method for the various sewage treatment plants. The small amount of domestic sewage
generated in the dining room of sewage treatment plant will be treated inside plant and comply
with standard for discharge.
To avoid the pollution risk resulting from overload or brake down of the treatment process, it is
considered the supply of emergency power facility and spare pumps in each WWTP.
7.3.1.3. IMPACT ON LOCAL WATER UIJALJTY OF YANGTZE RIVER
Bachuan River joins Huaiyuan River and the latter joins Xiaoanxi River in Heitan Town,
Tongliang County, which flows north and joins Fujiang River and Jialin River in Hechuan City.
Both Laixi River and Taohuaxi River directly join the Yangtze River. For the flow direction of
Three River, please refer to Attached Drawing 1. After implementation of proposed project,
COD, BOD5 and NH3 in water flowed into the Yangtze River will be reduced by 6,939tVa, 3,001Vta
and 637tVa respectively. In local sections of the Yangtze River which suffers from pollutants from
Three Rivers at present, the water quality of surface water will be therefore slightly improved.
For example, COD impact during low water period is reduced by approx. 0.12mg/L in average.
Since current COD in related sections of Yangtze River meets Grade IlIl of water body
standards, the implementation of proposed project will reduce the failure of conformance of
current coliform group (1- 12 times more than standard value) in some degree. Combined with
general control of domestic sewage along rivers, the problem of Coliform group will be
essentially controlled and improved.
7.3.2.  !MPACTS ON AIR QUALITY
7.3.2.1.  IMPACTS DURING CONSTRUCTION
The main pollution sources are machines burning fuel for digging, transportation, load, unload,
vibration. Dust and waste gas from these machines affects air quality surrounding work place.
Area most affected is located in a range of around 100 m all around project sites, but also main
access roads to sites w; iich wv'l be supporting the heavy truck tralFic.
Also, same impacts will be observed along the network rehabilitation or extension sites, where
the impact may be more direct for the population than the one from the WWTP sites, as the
resident population will be located much closer to works, but should have a shorter duration as
the work sites move permanently.
According to field monitoring of dust generation on various construction sites, the dust
concentrations on the places 50m, 100m and 150m leeward to the construction site are 486.5,
390 cnd 322prm/m3 where 2.4m/s of wind i -    3 16.7im/m3 of TSP concc        or
reference point windward to construction sit_ and 599,5pm/m3 of TSP concentrations within
construction site. Thus it is seen that the effected scope of dust generation within construction
site is approx. 150m. Additionally, the construction equipment features small amount of emission
and short period of application. In Chongqing the air humidity is great, wind speed low and water
content of soil high. It is available for water spray on specific points on construction site during
dry season and coverage of earth and stone transported. Therefore the emission and dust from
construction and transport can be effectively controlled with respect to impact degree and
effected area. The construction applies a little impact on ambient air.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
Part of the spoil obtained during the WWTP construction should be reused to fill ground. During
pipe network implantation, spoil will be stockpiled or reused to fill ground. During project
construction and especially during transportation and disposal of this spoil, there could be
impacts on the environment. Spoil dropped on the ground by vehicles and spoil on the vehicle
wheels would generate dust clouds on fine days, and would make the road muddy on wet days,
affecting both people and passing vehicles as well as the local environment.
If the spoil is not properly disposed of or stockpiled, it would impact the cleanliness of the city. If
excavated spoil is stockpiled for several weeks, the spoil will be dried by exposure to sunlight
and wind and when disturbed, will raise dust clouds resulting in an increase in the fine particulate
content of the ambient air. Hence, management of spoil during the c.onstruction should be
reinforced to prevent excessive impact on air quality by reducing the emission of dust.
However, most of this impact will result from the simultaneous creation of river embankment
with important earthworks.
Mitigation measures: Mitigation concerns mainly appropriate construction and earthworks
management methods to be imposed to the Contractor:
*   During excavation/filling earthworks, water will be sprayed to keep certain humidity;
construction site and worker camps as well as other project areas soil surface will be
regularly sprayed during dry periods to prevent dust emission;
*   Disposal sites for excavated material will be compacted and sprayed with water regularly;
spoil not used on site will be removed at the soonest for eventual disposal outside
urbanized areas;
3   Inflammable construction waste (cartoon, paper, plastic, wood, etc.) will not be burned on
site but transported to appropriate landfill or disposal site;
Cooking for workers on sites will rely on gas or electrical cookers, and will not use charcoal
or wood or any product generating dust or fumes:
a Trucks for spoil transportation will be covered before they leave the construction sites to
limit dust emission during travel to disposal site; washing stations will be installed in main
construction sites (WWTP) to avoid release of mud on public streets and roads with
eventual production of dust (or sediment to sewers);
* Strict maintenance of engines for trucks and other heavy machinery will be implemented by
the contractor to reduce smoke and gas emission;
*   Roads for truck traffic will be selected preferentially outside residential areas.

Sewage treatment plants will adopt an oxidation ditch process, which produces low level of odor,
and provide 100 m of sanitary protection distance. According to comparison analysis for field
smell in sewage treatment with general aeration method, the odor concentration 1 OOm away can
comply with the related standards and should not cause unpleasant impact on the people living
in surrounding residential areas. Tongliang station presents more risk of nuisance due to the
vicinity of residential areas.
During operation, sewers and pump stations generally do not emit odor pollutants, if they are
appropriately operated. Pump stations may possibly release some odors, but impact is uncertain
as they are located far from the nearest residential area. Therefore no significant impact from
odor pollutants of pump stations is expected.
Mitigation: during operation, the bar screen well and screened slag packing will be located and
done inside house of sewage treatment plant. Common ventilation system will be provided to
vent odorous gas from high level. Good maintenance and operation of the treatment process will
be necessary to limit the emission of odors from the system. Planting separation strip and 100m
buffer zone will minimize risk of unpleasant smell for nearest residents.

At night, especially, construction noise would impose a severe nuisance on the residents in the
vicinity, especially those located at less than 50 m. Night working and especially the use of the
most noisy equipment during the night should then be strictly controlled in order to minimize the
impact of noise on the surrounding residents. In particular for excavations, drills used outside at
the beginning of tunnel construction should be forbidden at night. In order to limit construction
noise to people, China government issued a regulation "Noise limitation of Construction Field
Boundary (GB12523-90)
Based on the daytime and ri:yht time limiting noise values contained in this regulation, the buffer
zones required to respect these limiting values have been calculated and are presented below.

Mitigation: During construction, contractors will be requested to use low noise heavy equipment
which comply with standards. Use of noisy equipment will be forbidden during the period from 10
p.m. to 6 a.m. Night working and especially the use of the most noisy equipment during the night
should then be strctly controlled in order to minimize the impact of noise on the surrounding
residents. In particular for excavations, drills used outside at the beginning of tunnel construction
should be forbidden at night. In order to limit construction noise to people, China govemment
issued a regulation "Noise limitation of Construction Field Boundary (GB12523-90) ".
Use of explosive during nighttime is prohibited. The amount of explosive shall be controlled and
micro-deviation explosion technique shall be adopted to reduce the impact of explosion noise
and oscillation on residents, environmental protection targets and environmental susceptible
spots. Construction activity during nighttime is also prohibited during the period of important
school examination. For the residents or organizations who suffer from construction impact on
local section, the construction units and supervision units shall strengthen coordination or make
due compensation where necessary.
7.3.3.2. IMPACTS DURING OPERATION
During the operation phase, the main sources of noise are due to pumping stations and waste
water treatment works with equipment such as pumps, ventilator and air compressors with noise
production in the range 86-95 dB(A).
Standards applicable to Level 2 areas (residential) are 6OdB(A) during day time and 5OdB(A)
during night time. Taking into consideration the distance to nearest residential buildings in
Tongliang, these standards should be respected.
Mitigation: During Operation stage, the main noise sources of sewage treatment plant consist
of sewage pumps, sludge pump and sludge demisters. The sewage pumps and sludge
demisters shall be accommodated inside the pump station to reduce oscillation and insulate
noise. The water outlet shall be treated with flexible connectors. The sludge pumps shall be of
sinking pumps and the surface aerators of low noise type ones. Combined with reasonable
process layout and 5-20m planting insulation strip and approx. 100m buffer zone to residential
areas, environmental noise level during operation will comply with the related standards.
Transport vehicles (based on 5t of capacity per vehicle) to carry sludge and small amount of raw
materials should increase to maximum 15 vehicle per day and will only operate daytime.
7.3.4.  IEMPORARY LAND ACQUISITION DURING CONSTRUCTION
For the WWTP, it is not anticipated the temporary acquisition of land during construction.
Storage of equipment, work sites and worker camps should be organized within the land
allocated to the plant.
For sewer laying works and pumping stations, some temporary occupation of land may be
required. Most of the time it will be in a public area (road for example). However, in case
SOGREAH - BVN - N°2 35 0032 ' R3.1- A 01 2UO4                                   PAGE 50



CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK

CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
temporary use of land may result in the alteration of previous use or agricultural production, the
loss for the previous user will be fully and fairly compensated during the period of occupation by
the project.
7.3.5.  IMPACT ON NATURAL AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
The project will not involve any destruction of valuable natural land. Site in Tongliang is totally
developed, site in Longshui is agriculture land. Both sites have no particular ecological value.
The development of the sewer network may impose the cutting of street trees. This impact can
hardly be quantified at present, but during works, field inspectors in charge of supervising the
EMP will ensure that any tree is cut by absolute necessity, that any cutting is registered and that
the project will ensure replanting of trees at a rate of not less than one tree planted for one cut.
Regarding aquatic ecology, the baseline survey carried out for the purpose of this study has
demonstrated the high level of pollution of the river nearby the project sites, with a probably
related low biodiversity. The terrestrial/aquatic ecological environments and ecological
environment in towns along rivers are already seriously affected, particularly in the Laixi Rivet
and Taohuaxi River which have basically lost their application functions due to pollution from
industrial and domestic wastewater, disposal of refuse and serious soil erosion. The problems
include silt-up of watercourse, eutrophication of water bodies, floating of algae, abnormal water
color and bad smell.
Mitigation: with measures imposed to the contractor to control river pollution from construction
sites, significant impact of construction on the aquatic environment is not anticipated.
Impact during operation will be globally beneficial, as a direct consequence from pollution
discharge abatement.
7.3.6.  CONSTRUCTION WASTE MANAGEMENT
Significant volumes of spoil will be generated during the construction of the project components,
mainly composed of earth from excavation works and not re-used for filling or reclamation, and
of the products from demolition of existing buildings and concrete structures, mainly along the
sewer network component.
Earth spoil will need to be removed from the construction sites using trucks, with resulting
nuisance for residents and public safety issues related to the risk of traffic accident. Strict
procedures related to this activity will need to be imposed to the contractor in charge.

waste, the contractor in charge of civil works in each site will prepare and submit a spoil
management plan which will respect the following guidelines:

spoil will be subject to the preparation of a similar management plan.
Spoil management plan will be prepared by the Contractor not later than 30 days before the start
of the works in the considered area.
7.3.7.  OFF-SITE PUBLIC SAFETY AND INCONVENIENCE
Proposed sewer systems or pipe networks will certainly cut across some roads or run parallel
with them. During the excavation and pipe-laying stage, there will be more traffic congestion
along these roads.
The conventional way to solve the problem is to build side-tracks for vehicles during
construction. As these temporary roads are usually very narrow, it is impossible for vehicles to
pass each other. In addition, some vehicles will find it necessary to make a detour, which will not
increase the mileage but also increase the traffic volumes on other roads. During projects
construction, spoil encroaching on the road surface will result in narrowing of the carriageway.
On dry days, the surface will be dusty and on wet days, the roads will be covered with mud and
become slippery.
The project will take all the necessary measures in order to minimize the detrimental side effects
of network construction. Coordination between the contractor and the traffic police will minimize
road blockage or will reduce it to the minimum duration. Pro-active information will also be
implemented in order to have the concerned residents or daily passer-by to be informed of the
date and the duration of the works in their area. This information will be done through posters,

local meetings and the creation of an internet site dedicated to the project and providing fresh
and up-dated information on these issues.
The contractor(s) will be required to implement safety and road signs in sufficient quantities and  2
at the appropriate location, in order to facilitate traffic diversion and to reduce the risk of jam and
car accident.
7.3.8.  IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE
Through integrated environmental control for rivers, the related areas will have better status of
urban environmental infrastructure such as water supply & sanitation, flooding prevention
communication, improved capacity to control soil erosion and to prevent flooding, and better
ecological environment, urban landscape and investment environment. People will live and work
in peace and contentment and society will keep stable. The related counties and districts will
modify the urban economy structure and industry structure based on their own specific
conditions. The application of proposed projects will promote the infrastructure construction for
sewage treatment, refuse disposal and others.
It is believed that implementation of proposed projects will improve the local economy, living
standard of people, urbanization construction and urban ecological environment protection.
7.3.9.  SLUDGE MANAGEMENT
7.3.9.1. ESTIMATED SLUDGE PRODUCTION
Wastewater projects have definitely a huge beneficial impact on urban environment, but
wastewater treatment means also sludge production, with a high risk to concentrate and release
pollution if the sludge produced are not appropriately collected and safely disposed. Solutions
have to be found to minimize the amount of sludge produced and to implement safe disposal
facilities.
After the implementation of proposed project, the dry sludge produced by the two WWTP of
Tongliang and Longshui will be 5,256 tVyear (6.6 t/day BOD5 and 7.8 t/day SS), each station
contributing to 50% of this total or 2,628 t/year. The initial water content of sludge straight from
the sewage treatment process may reach 98% to 99%. To allow for easy and economical
handling, dewatering operation through belt press will be carried out. This should allow the
reduction of water in the sludge to a level around 80%, sometimes even less. The sludge and
screenings will thus be transported by trucks to dedicated landfills for disposal.

Longshui        30,000            2,628              20               13,140

According to this table, the total of sludge produced daily by each of the WWTP will be
36 tons/day of sludge at 20% dry solid.
In addition to the sludge, the volume of solid waste from screen bars will also need handling,
transportation and disposal. The volume is generally at least equivalent to that of the sludge, but
with a solid content of 40%.

The table shows that about 108 tons/day of wet waste will need to be evacuated from both new
WWTP. Wet sludge alone will represent 72 tons/day.
7.3.9.2. SLUDGE COMPOSITION
In Tongliang WVWTP, heavy metal content of sludge is expected to be low, as a special WWTP
dedicated to industrial parks will be constructed. The Tongliang station will thus receive mainly
domestic water. The Longshui WWTP will receive part of industrial effluents, and a higher heavy
metal content may be expected in the sludge. However, it may be reasonably expected a
progressive reduction in heavy metal contamination of sludge in the coming years as the result
of the implementation of the national clean industry strategy, which promotes industrial waste
water treatment facilities and clean industrial processes with higher recycling level of effluents
and waste. During future operation, industries discharging to the wastewater network should be
strictly controlled for ensuring that the industrial discharges to the wastewater networks do not
exceed the allowed concentrations and loading rates (generally based on national standards as
described in Appendix 3).
However, like the other small and medium-sized (< 50,000 m3/d) sewage treatment plants in
China, the sludge recently produced from proposed projects is not planned to be digest-treated.
Such sludge has unstable performance and contains degradable organic matters which are
likely start fermentation and generate smells. Additionally the low abatement ratio for pathogenic
bacteria and helminthes egg make the sludge dangerous for public health and not suitable for
agricultural application. Therefore, the sludge produced is proposed for disposal in appropriate
landfills.
7.3.9.3. TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF SLUDGE
The sludge to be produced will be stabilized. After stabilization and thickening, sludge will be
dumped in dedicated landfills. Two landfills are considered to accommodate the sludge
produced by the two WVWTP components (Tongliang and Dazu). In Changshou, a new landfill is
in operation since the first quarter of 2004 to accommodate the sludge produced by the existing
WWTP.
Sanitary Landfill Design - Tongliang & Dazu
Refuse is mechanically collected and transported in enclosed containers, which therefore avoids
sludge leakage and flying. Management on refuse collection and transport is also improved to
reduce noise impact. Bag filter is provided in refuse sorting shop to control dust emission.
The leachate and gas generated in landfill are guided out of landfill in a safe, reliable and
applicable way.
Sanitary landfill is provided with the combined anti-seeping measures in both vertical and
horizontal directions so as to prevent pollution on surface water and ground water from leaching.
For leachate treatment, the proven recycling backfill process is proposed, by which the final
treatment quantities and initial treatment concentration of filtrate can be reduced during practical
operation. There is a reinforced concrete structure of leachate adjusting basin located between

safe combustion and emission of waste gas containing firedamp are combined to make those
gases up to standards of environment impact concentration and site concentration. Carbon

environmental quality.
For sanitary landfill, the refuse dam, intercepting dam, various sub-dams, flood intercepting ditch

standards and codes, minimizing soil erosion and ensuring safe operation in sanitary landfill.
Improved equipment management and maintenance of combustion tower and leachate

safe protection interval can reduce adverse influence on social environment in neighboring
community as much as possible, and make it compliant with pollution control standards on
refuse burial.
Taiping sanitary Landfill - Tongliang
The stabilized sludge from the Tongliang Wastewater Treatment Plant will be disposed at a
planned sanitary landfill located northeast of Taiping Town, about 10km away from the centre of
Tongliang County. The disposal capacity of the landfill is 250tVd. Construction is planned to start
in August 2004, and is expected to be put into operation by the end of 2005. It will match the
implementation of the wastewater treatment plant to accommodate sludge produced as soon as
the plant operation starts.
Tonggu Landfill - Dazu
The dewatered and compacted sludge and screenings from Wastewater Treatment Plant of
Longshui Town will be disposed of at the sanitary landfill of Tonggu Village of Dazu County
located on the north side of road between Longgang Town and Sanqu Town, southwest of
Longgang Town. It is about 8km away from the county seat by road length. The disposal
capacity is 184tUd. Construction started on December 28, 2003, and ground leveling, supply of
water & power and approaching road have been finished. It is expected to be put into operation
by June 2005. It will match the construction and operation of wastewater treatment plant of
integrated environmental control of Laixi River Project.
Ximajiagou Landfill - Changshou
For Changshou, where there is an existing wastewater treatment plant, sewage sludge is
currently co-disposed with household refuse in an existing newly constructed sanitary landfill.
located on Ximajiagou, Yangjia Town, Changshou District, 10km away from Fenchen Town
(capital of Changshou District). The landfill was constructed in 2003 and was put into operation
in 2004, with a total investment of 75.76 million RMB. The landfill is designed to treat waste at
300Vtd and operate for 28 years, serving 7 towns (including Taohua area of Changshou District),
and 280,000 populations in the near future and 450,000 populations in 2030.

7.4.    ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ANALYSIS
7.4.1.  OVERFLOW AND ACCIDENTAL SPILLAGE
The occurrence of an overflow (during a rain event) or a major break-down in the operation of
the VVWTP may result in the temporary release of untreated wastewater in the river. An increase
in organic pollution downstream may thus be anticipated.
EA estimates the environment risks in case of these two kinds of emergency discharge where
sewage treatment is reduced to 50% and 0% (without any treatment) before sewage is
discharged into Bachuan River and Huaiyuan River, with the following results: when sewage
treatment is reduced to 50% due to failure, the BOD5, NH3-N and total P in the ground water
within 5 km from discharge point of effluent of sewage treatment plant for Huaiyuan River will be
1.86 times of the standard values. When sewage treatment is reduced to 0%, the COD, BOD5,
NH3-N and total P will be 2.70 times of the standard values.
Due to the rare possibility where two or even all of the three sewage treatment plants for Laixi
River fail at ttie same time, only one plant, which serves Longshui Town and is most closed
(approx. 5km) to Yutang Reservoir downstream, is considered for environmental risk due to
emergency discharge. The analysis shows that in case domestic sewage is only primary treated
(grid and settlement) in sewage treatment plant serving Longshui Town before discharge, the
maximum COD, BOD5, and NH3-N in the ground water in section of Huilongwang, Huaiyuan
River will be 1.60 times of the standard values.
To minimize risks, emergency power facility and spare pumps are considered in the design for
sewage treatment plant. Strict operation regulation and careful equipment maintenance must be
followed and performed so as to minimize or even eliminate any abnormal working status. The
related environmental authorities shall strength the policy instruction and supervision on sewage
treatment plant and help the latter minimize any possible occurrence of pollution accident so as
to reduce environmental risk.
7.4.2.  DEVELOPMENT PLANNING
This risk threatens the global objective of the project to improve the quality of the rivers and of
the Three Gorges Reservoir. Indeed, the present subprojects supported by the WB are only part
of a much larger program which concerns other major cities and as demonstrated with the far-
field water quality modeling, this river improvement can only be obtained if those other
municipalities manage their wastewaters.
Thus the planning risk is the delay or the cancellation of VvWTP in other PRD urban areas.
7.4.3.  THREAT FROM INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES
As the WWTP will receive part of industrial wastewater, there is still a risk that the release of
explosive or toxic products in the sewers affect the plant operation. However, strict regulations
do exist in Chongqina Municipa'lty related to the discharge of industrial effluents into the urban
sewers, and the authorities are implementing a strong policy for the enforcement of these
regulations and on the treatment of industrial effluents which should, in the near future, strongly
reduce the risk.

8.3.      MITIGATION PROGRAM
Mitigation requirements and measures identified during the Environmental Assessment studies
of the sub-projects mainly concern the following issues:
* The compensation for temporary or permanent land acquisition, with resettlement program
if involuntary displacement of persons,
* Mitigation for the loss of valuable ecological or cultural resources.
* Application of environmental good practices during construction activities by the
Contractors on all the construction sites and in their surroundings.

8.4.    MONITORING PROGRAMS
In order to ensure the strict and efficient implementation of the mitigations measures proposed,
including the respect of environmental obligations during the construction stage, a program of
monitoring activities will be required, which includes mainly 3 types of monitoring:
*   The general environmental and social monitoring of construction sites and activities,
*   The specific monitoring of water quality and water pollution control,
*   The specific monitoring of air quality and pollution control, and of noise.
Monitoring of land acquisition and resettlement is considered in RAP reports and will not be
discussed again as part of the present Consolidated EA Report.
8.4.1.  MONITORING OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES
This monitoring aims at ensuring compliance of Contractor activities with its contractual
commitments as well as with the environmental regulations and standards prevailing in PRC.
Monitoring should be carried out during the project construction stage.
8.4.2.  WATER QUALITY MONITORING
Objective of water quality monitoring is to ensure pollution control from construction activities is
efficient and that all activities are performed in compliance with applicable standards.
8.4.2.1. LOCATION CF SAMPLING SITES
Sampling sites will be established in critical points where the control of effluents from
construction activities can be easily implemented. This concerns for example major drainage
outlets from construction sites, from concrete batching plant (if any), from worker camps, from
spoil disposal areas, from machinery reparation yards or from petrol products storage areas.
8.4.2.2. PARAMETERS TO BE MEASURED
The most frequently observed pollution types from construction works are mainly suspended
solids due to earthworks, soda effluents from batching and concrete related activities, and
hydrocarbons from engine leakage and maintenance. Potential pollution from labor camps is
mainly of bacteriological nature and related to sanitation issues. The parameters to be followed
must be the best indicators of activities anticipated in the sites, which may clearly establish the
presence or not of a nuisance directly induced by the activities. The other types of parameters
concern those providing a more general information on the condition of the receiving river. The
parameters are:
*   At any discharge point from the construction sites: Temperature, pH, Electrical Conductivity,
Dissolved Oxygen (DO).
*   At the treated effluent disc,; arge point from labor camps (if any): Fecal Coliform, Ammonia,
Biological Oxygen Demand in 5 days (BOD5).
*   At the outlet of concrete production effluent (if any) and of earthworks: Total Suspended
Solids (TSS) and pH
*   At the outlet/drains draining construction activities and mechanical maintenance areas: pH,
TSS, oils.

8.4.3.    AIR QUALITY AND NOISE MONITORING
8.4.3.1.  PARAMETERS
Monitoring of air quality and noise will be carried out during construction and operation stages of
the project. Purpose of monitoring is to ensure that air pollution, dust and noise standards are
respected on the construction sites and that these nuisances are kept at the minimum
acceptable level for the surrounding residents.
During construction, monitoring sites will be identified around the concerned sites and nearby
sensitive spots located around.
During operation stage of the Longshui and Tongliang WWTP, appropriate parameters (H2S,
NH3, S-methanol and total bacteria) will be monitored by the Operator of the facility.
Noise will be monitored in each site located close to residential areas or when required where
suspicion of excessive noise exists. Noise levels will be monitored over periods of 24 hrs
duration inside the construction sites and around.
A special attention will be provided to noise leve&s . ionitoring during night time, around the
sewer network working sites and machinery, most being located in residential areas, and near
sensitive spots as schools and hospitals if any.

9.      PUBLIC CONSULTATION
9.1.    METHOD AND ORGANIZATION
Public involvement activities for the present CUEP 1 NC component have been respectively
organized by the units who prepared the EIA reports. Public involvement has been made
effective throughout the EIA process, including social economic surveys, interviews with local
authorities, public consultation and information disclosure, and public meetings.
The method of pubic consultation and public interview consists of questionnaire and hearings.
The questionnaire used and presented in Appendix 4 Table A4-1 was seeking from public
perception on project status, possible favorable and unfavorable impact and proposed
environmental protection measures so as to hear comments and suggestion from the public.
To facilitate the public to understand the proposed projects, the project proposal, feasibility study
report and investment of current environmental situation were fully presented on the bulletin
board in the civil administrative offices of related town halls, where special persons were
assigned to answer questions from visitors. To facilitate the pubic to exercise the rights to know
and to participate, each town publicized the proposed projects and information exhibition place,
and reception organization or person to the public through broadcast and closed-circuit TV in the
concerned village.
9.2.    ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT
In March, 2003, 60 copies of the questionnaire of integrated environmental control for Bachuan
River and Huaiyuan River were issued and 56 copies were sent back, of which 55 copies were
considered effective. On November 3rd, 2003, hearing of integrated environmental control for.
Bachuan River and Huaiyuan River was held in the office of Project Command, Tongliang
County. In July 2003, 100 copies of the questionnaire of integrated environmental control for
Laixi River were issued, and all copies were sent back and considered effective. On August 26th
2003, approx. 20 persons consisting of the people in effected area and to be resettled
participated the hearing of integrated environmental control for Laixi River. On November 3rd,
2003, hearing of integrated environmental control for Taohuaxi River was held in the office of
Changshou Infrastructure Development Co., Ltd., Changshou District. At the same time 60
copies of the questionnaires for public comments was distributed in Duzhou and Fengcheng
Towns and neighboring villages, and all of them returned as effective copies.
In August 2004, notice for availability of EA and RAP reports on web site is scheduled.
Accordingly, the distribution of the resettlement information booklet is revised to: January to
September 2004.
The results of the public involvement activities are presented in Appendix 4.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
10.     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.1. IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT
If all the areas concerned by the Project Components show good environmental conditions
regarding air and noise, all satisfying Level II standards, they also all show heavy water pollution
levels. On the average, COD in Huaiyuan River is 2.1 times the standard value, and BOD5 1.59
times, petroleum 74.4 times, NH3-H 5.82 times, and total P 4.72 times. In Laixi River COD is
2.55 times the standard value, petroleum 14.02 times, NH3-H 1.07 times, and total P 1.21 times.
In Taohuaxi River COD, BOD5, NH3-H, and total P are all 1.5 to 2 times the standard values.
petroleum 10 to 20 times the standard values. Bacteriological pollution (Coliform) in the three
rivers exceeds by 100% the standard, and in the worst case 1000 times the standard value.
CUEP wastewater Loan Savings components will strengthen cities environmental protection,
protect the Yangtze system water resources and water quality especially for the Three Gorges
Reservoir on the long term, reduce environmental pollution resulting from wastewater discharge,
protect surface water and underground water, improve people's quality of life and public heath.
Improvement of urban environmental quality boosts also city economic development though a
better attractiveness for investors and middle class residents, a raise in land and building value
along rehabilitated river sides and creeks. Reduction of pollution load to the river results also,
further downstream in water quality improvement with beneficial impacts on aquatic biodiversity,
fisheries and protection of water resources.
10.2.   MAJOR ANTICIPATED IMPACTS AND MEASURES
Sites anticipated for the Wastewater Treatment Plants are appropriately located. Land has been
acquired involving limited expropriation and demolition, which have been compensated. A
minimum distance of 100 m between Tongliang Plant and residential buildings is respected
Longshui WWTP is located in a rural area, with no anticipated nuisance for surrounding
population.
Main sewers will be implemented together with river embankment works. Most of the demolition
and resettlement requirements, which are significant, result from the river embankment
components closely associated to the wastewater components.
Phase 1 for Tongliang and Longshui WWTP will provide an additional treatment capacity of
60,000 m3 per day, resulting in a total annual river pollution abatement of about 3,100 t BOD5,
6,700 t CODcr, 3,800 t Suspended Solids, 620 t NH3-N and 80 t PO4 3P.
As a consequence of this positive pollution abatement, both WWTP will generate a total wet
waste quantity of about 108 t/day, including about 72 t/day of wet sludge at 20% solids ana
about 36 tVday of screen bar waste at 40% solids. This wet waste will be safely disposed in two
dedicated landfills presently under construction.
The project is not anticipated to involve detrimental impacts on the terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems. Sites dedicated to the facilities are already urbanized. Any road tree felled because
of the sewer laying works will be replanted at the end of the works.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT - NEW COMPONENTS
CONSOLIDATED EA FOR WASTEWATER COMPONENTS
The project is not anticipated to affect any known cultural spot, and definitely not at WVVTP sites.
However, excavations in the cities for the sewer network may reveal some buried remains of
historical value. Procedures will be set-up for construction.
A major impact during construction may result from the large volumes of earthworks, mainly
related to the river embankment works (total of about 3 million m3 excavation and 2.7 million m
fill), if not appropriately managed by the contractors: dust, mud, sediment discharge to river,
degradation of temporary spoil disposal sites).
At the time of the construction, and particularly for the sewer network components (and mainly
for the urban river embankments), several construction sites will be implemented over the cities
in densely inhabited areas. Several nuisances and risks for the public safety may result if
appropriate measures are not strictly enforced. For this purpose, the Environmental
Management Plan proposes to implement specific mitigation measures including:
*   The implementation of clear procedures for routine monitoring, reporting and addressing
non-compliances detected on the construction sites.
*   The implementation of procedures for public information, to deal with nuisances as road
traffic disturbance, water, electricity or gas temporary cut-off, temporary noise, and
including among classical information measures the creation of an Internet site dedicated to
the Project.

The public representatives hear the project overview, protective facilities and measures for ecological
environment introduced by construction and EIA units, review the feasibility study report and draft EIA
report, check the areas which the project covers and consult the related agency for possible impact and
compensation. lThey express their ideas below:
Taohuaxi River is troubled by serious pollution and many years experience of damaged river banks.

years. With consideration of road, communication and economic development zone construction in
Changshou District, this project is expected for uniform planning and staged implementation in order to
maximize the comprehensive benefit which the project contributes into the urbanization process. Also,
the project can improve further the location advantage and sustainable development of economy of
Changshou District.
The construction of dike and relocation shall be performed in such manner where the residents'and
school student can be protected with respect to access security.
Though their houses are expected for relocation, the representative of those residents express the
understanding of construction of sewage treatment plant nearby their existing houses. They expect to get
higher compensation and to enjoy at least the same living quality after resettlement. Due to the fact that it
is difficult for resettled persons to find suitable houses during the limited period, the construction units
prepare the reasonable time schedule of relocation based on construction progress so as to allow the

Abstract of hearing record of integrated environment control for Taohuaxi RiverL-I
The public representatives hear the project overview, protective facilities and measures for ecological
environment introduced by construction and EIA units, review the feasibility study report and draft EIA
report, check the areas which the project covers and consult the related agency for possible impact and
compensation. They express their ideas below:
Taohuaxi River is troubled by serious pollution and many years experience of damaged river banks.
Integrated environmental control project is a strong willing of people in Changshou District for many
years. With consideration of road, communication and economic development zone construction in
Changshou District, this project is expected for uniform planning and staged implementation in order to
maximize the comprehensive benefit which the project contributes into the urbanization process. Also,
the project can improve further the location advantage and sustainable development of economy of
Changshou District.
The construction of dike and relocation shall be performed in such manner where the residents and
school student can be protected with respect to access security.
Though their houses are expected for relocation, the representative of those residents express the
understanding of construction of sewage treatment plant nearby their existing houses. They expect to get

is difficult for resettled persons to find suitable houses during the limited period, the construction units

All participants believe that the construction of dike project is very important for development of
i economy, society, environment and living standards of Tongliang County. They hope that after the
completion of projects, the planning on both sides of river is in concordance with city planning so as to
allow new Taohua City to be worth of "Taohua' which literally means "peach blossom".
According to comments from the public involvement, it is very necessary to implement the
proposed project where the public support rate is over 90%. Also more than 95% of people
involved think the site and route selection of sewage treatment plants and sewage interception
pipelines are reasonable. Approx. more than 82% of people involved think the adverse impact is
acceptable in case of provision of precaution against pollution.
At the beginning of investigation on 55 persons who totally or basically support the construction
of integrated environmental control for Bachuan River and Huaiyuan River, there was 10
persons thinking unacceptable the adverse impact on them because their houses was near the
construction area and they worried about the impact from construction. Due to relocation issues,
other 8 persons believed that the project construction resulted in more unfavorable effects than
favorable ones. After they reviewed the feasibility study report and draft EIA report, and heard
the detailed introduction from EIA unit witn resp.ct to protective measures of environment during
construction & operation and effects thereof, and from construction unit with respect to
compensation and resettlement due to land occupation and house relocation, these 18 persons
were very satisfied with EIA and construction units, and expressed their idea below: both design
and construction not only cared the essential benefits of integrated environmental control
projects, but also paid attention to the people-oriented principle, especially the benefits of minor,
weak party who were affected and resettled due to this project. Their interests were protected
with respect to housing, living and production aspects. Therefore, the pubic uniformly supported
and agreed with the construction of the proposed projects.
According to the results of public hearing and questionnaire, the proposed project agency shall
pay attention to environmental protection and ecological improvement during construction
period, resettle and compensate the affected people in accordance with the related state
regulation. At the same time the project agency shall apply the people-oriented principle to help
resettled people resolve production and employment problems. In addition to prevention of
construction noise and dust pollution, the residents in affected area shall be provided with safe
access to avoid any unnecessary environmental dispute.
