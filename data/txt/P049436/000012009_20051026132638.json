This resettlement action plan\n            (RAP) is composed of a main summary report and six final\n            RAPs related to each project component in Chongqing, Fuling,\n            Wanzhou, and Nan Bin. The resettlement program will ensure\n            that the production levels, income-earning capacity, and\n            living standards of project affected persons (PAPs) can be\n            improved, or at least restored to the level prior to that\n            before implementation of the RAP. The following measures\n            will be taken to safeguard the entitlements of the affected\n            people: 1) Special care will be taken for vulnerable groups:\n            assistance in building and moving into resettlement areas\n            and new houses, and allocation of specific compensations. 2)\n            Compensation to the collective for cultivation losses and\n            land acquisition will mainly be used to increase the\n            productive capacity of the collective. 3) Assistance will be\n            provided to PAPs to select their new sites, build their new\n            houses, and adjust to their new environment. 4) The\n            implementation of both land acquisition and resettlement\n            will be monitored and evaluated by an independent monitoring\n            institute. Representatives of PAPs will participate in the\n            organization of the resettlement; and the institution\n            concerned will define appropriate procedures and provide\n            means to redress any grievances."}, "docdt": "2004-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
