1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Project Context at Appraisal

Project preparation took place against the background of the creation of the
Chongqing Municipality (CM) in 1997, China's the Western Region development
initiative, the major program in Chongqing for resettlement of persons displaced by
the construction of the Three Gorges project (TGP), and start of construction of the
TGP.

CM core urban area had a 1997 population of 3.1 million. Chongqing's economic
growth, in terms of population, industry and agricultural production was taking place
at the cost of increased pollution of air, water and land resources, and drinking water
supply. Chongqing ranked worst among 23 large Chinese cities in air quality in terms
of concentrations of sulphur dioxide and eighth for levels of total suspended
particulates (TSP). Chongqing was the largest source of organic water pollution in the
Yangtze River Basin upstream of the TGP. Increasing pollution discharges had
severely degraded the water quality in the major tributaries of the Yangtze River, i.e.,
the Jialing and Wu Rivers in Chongqing and Fuling, respectively. Upstream impacts
of the TGP on Chongqing were the increase in water depth, submergence of
environmental infrastructure, and alteration of the flow regime. Uncontrolled
pollution discharges from upstream cities increased the risk of eutrophication of the
TGP reservoir.

Inadequate investments in environmental infrastructure, weak financial, institutional
and management capacity, relatively high per capita water demand, and low tariffs
contributed to the deteriorating environmental conditions in Chongqing's rapidly
expanding urban centers, slowing the economic growth of its urban areas.

The above conditions, coupled with the Bank's long experience in water and
wastewater in China's eastern provinces, provided the rationale for Bank involvement
to support the new Municipality to improve its environmental infrastructure and assist
in the development of sustainable sector institutions.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The development objective was to provide a safe environmental setting for the
sustainable long-term economic growth of urban areas in CM.

The project was to support the CM implement its long-term urban environmental
improvement program to recover from past environmental degradation of its water
and land resources, provide an adequate supply of safe water to its growing urban


                                           1
population and economy, and maintain water quality at levels that are compatible with
the needs of the wider Yangtze River Basin.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The project objective and key indicators remained unchanged during the project
period.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

Original Beneficiaries. The main urban beneficiaries of the project at appraisal were
about 3.0 million, comprising 2.5 million in Chongqing City, 0.3 million in Wanzhou
and 0.2 million in Fuling. These populations were projected to reach about 3.3
million in 2010. Other beneficiaries included about 30,000 persons in Nanbin Town in
Shizu County, projected to reach about 57,000 by 2010.

Revised Beneficiaries. Revised beneficiaries at the end of the project amounted to
about 6.61 million, including both original cities and seven other towns added later in
the project, representing a 220% increase in the number of beneficiaries estimated at
appraisal.

1.5 Original Components

A detailed project description is available in the PAD Annex 2. A summary is
provided below.

·   Component 1. Chongqing City Wastewater and Chongqing Solid Waste
    Management (US$ 428.0 million): (a) Chongqing Wastewater Management
    (total cost US$ 369.8 million): about 35 km of secondary networks, 70 km of
    primary interceptors, pretreatment facilities, and two treatment plants of ultimate

                                            2
·   Component 6. Urban Management Information System (total cost US$ 3.9
    million): GIS-based urban mapping in various scales, topographic and utility
    mapping, wastewater and solid waste management information systems,
    hardware, software, software applications development, and training.

    Chongqing City.
·   Component 8. Institutional Strengthening and Training (total cost US$ 12.2
    million): capacity building for utility management, urban and environmental
    management, and construction supervision and construction management support.

Industrial Pollution Control Action Plan. Although not technically part of the
project, CM agreed at project appraisal to implementation an industrial pollution
control action plan (IPCAP). The IPCAP was designed to complement project
investments in municipal wastewater management.

1.6 Revised Components

(i) The 50,000 m3/d water treatment works and the 60,000 m3/d expansion planned
for Wanzhou were not constructed; instead a treatment plant of 100,000 m3/d
capacity was completed in 1999 before loan effectiveness, using national bonds
funding. The expansion of the existing treatment works was deleted for lack of need.

(ii) The planned water treatment plant in Nanbin was deleted because a water
treatment plant was constructed by another sector bureau in Nanbin. Lack of
coordination was cited.

(iii) New Works Included to Utilize Loan Savings. Eight new components in seven
county towns were added in 2005, following project restructuring at the mid-term
review, to utilize the loan savings, estimated at the time, of about US$72 million
(36% of loan amount), and to enhance achievement of the PDO. These included:

·   Tongliang (Bachuan town): wastewater collection network (23.0 km); and river
    embankment improvements (9.0 km);
·   Dazu (Longshui town): a wastewater treatment plant (15,000 m3/day capacity);
    wastewater collection network (23.0 km); and river embankment improvements
    (6.0 km);
·   Changshou (Taohua new urban area): wastewater collection network (36.0 km);
    and river embankment improvements (15.0 km);
·   Wulong (Xiangkou town): river embankments for urban flood protection (9.0 km),
    incorporating wastewater collection networks;
·   Bishan (Bicheng town): wastewater collection network (14.0 km); and river
    embankments (12.0 km);



                                          3
·   Bishan Water Supply (Bicheng town): rehabilitation of the existing raw water
    pumping station; transmission main (6 km) construction of a water treatment plant
    (35,000 m3/d capacity), a water supply network (36.0 km) and a booster pumping
    station;
·   Beibei Water Supply (Dongyang town): raw water pumping station; a water
    treatment plant (20,000 m3/d capacity); and water supply network (20.0 km);
·   Jiangjin Water Supply (Shuangfu town): water supply transmission mains (17.0
    km); two intermediate booster pumping stations; and water supply network (7.0
    km).

The above changes were significant in that the project focus shifted from the large
cities to small towns near the big cities, but the works remained consistent with the
PDO. During implementation of the additional works, it became evident that there
would be more loan savings of about US$26 million. The large loan savings accrued
due to low contract prices, relatively high cost estimates at project appraisal and
financing of urgent works using own funds. The high estimates appearing in the
appraisal did could not anticipate fierce competition by contractors, resulting in
significantly lower bid prices.

The legal agreements were amended four times to: (i) cancel US$3.7 million allocated
to the Yangtze siphon contract (November 2003); (ii) add eight subcomponents in
seven towns to utilize loan savings (January 2005); (iii) cancel about US$25.8 million
of the loan, extend the loan closing date to December 31, 2007, and increase the civil
works disbursement percentage to 100% (May 2006); and (iv) extend the loan closing
date to December 31, 2008 (November 2007). The loan closing was extended one
final time to March 31, 2009. Extension of the loan closing date by a total of 27
months was required to implement the works added to utilize loan savings.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Preparatory Studies. A water sector environment sector study was carried out by
international consultants to develop a master plan and priority environmental
investments in both CM and neighboring Sichuan Province. Project design was
comprehensive, and addressed protection of water resources, control of municipal and
industrial pollution, solid waste management, strengthening urban planning and
environmental monitoring, institutional reform, utility management, and
sustainability. The project design also included a pilot demonstration for built
cultural heritage conservation and management of a historic guildhall complex dating
back to the Qing Dynasty.

Detailed computer-based modeling studies of the Yangtze River near the proposed
outfalls were done to determine the treatment standard and assess the impact of the
                                           4
discharge of treated wastewater on downstream users. Model studies and detailed
geotechnical investigations were carried out for the 1.2 km long siphon across the
Yangtze River, which was a significant engineering challenge, comprising an 18
meter diameter tunnel inside which three 6-meter diameter pipes were to be installed.
Three primary interceptor pipes were designed to drain all of Chongqing's
wastewater, two of which combined to convey flows through the siphon to one of the
two treatment plants.

Risks and Mitigation Measures Identified at Appraisal. Risks identified at appraisal
were all considered moderate, and included: (a) the complementary pollution
reduction by industry and agriculture would be delayed; (b) environmental and social
changes would be brought about by the TGP; (c) wastewater companies may not
achieve real autonomy; (d) water, wastewater and solid waste services may not be
sustainable.

The risks identified at appraisal were appropriately assessed, and the mitigation plans
adequately addressed the risks through establishment of autonomous utility
companies, covenanted financial performance criteria, and implementation of an
industrial pollution control action plan. Despite lower water flows following
completion of the TGP, the water quality in the Yangtze River near Chongqing was
maintained at the specified level.

Other risks associated with weak cost estimating, and the accumulation of large loan
savings, were not identified. These risks materialized.

Quality at Entry. A quality at entry review (QER) of the project was not carried out
by the Quality Assessment Group (QAG). The underpinning for project formulation
was a comprehensive water sector study covering CM and Sichuan Province, master
plan updates, mathematical modeling of the Yangtze River pollution movements near
Chongqing, and model studies of the 18 meter diameter Yangtze siphon. Convincing
CM to construct two centralized wastewater treatment plants downstream of the city
instead of 20 small plants distributed within the city was a major achievement which
resulted in increased efficiency and savings for the Borrower. Integrated water
resource management was used as the basis for prioritizing project interventions.
Project design ensured creation of adequate capacity to intercept and treat all
wastewater generated in Chongqing for the planning period. Industrial pollution
control was also addressed, in parallel, through an action plan which CM agreed to
implement. Institutional reform was addressed through converting municipal
drainage departments to autonomous companies, introducing utility management
practices, including a wastewater user fee, and financial performance criteria that
strengthened the utility companies. The project aimed to improve construction
management practices through adoption of Fédération Internationale Des Ingénieurs-
Conseils (FIDIC) type contract management. Support was provided to strengthen the
capacity for environmental management. In a significant departure from tradition, the

                                           5
project also included a pilot demonstration in protection, conservation and
management of built cultural heritage.

Project design made a significant impact on wastewater management planning
through rationalization to achieve economies of scale, moving away from the
prevailing rigid and unrealistic requirements of master planning and treated
wastewater discharge standards that characterized domestic planning practices. In
addition, many discussions ensued on the applicable discharge standard for treated
wastewater. State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) guidelines required that
Class 1B discharge standard had to be achieved irrespective of cost and assimilative
capacity of the receiving water body. Significant cost savings accrued through
agreement to introduce treatment levels incrementally, i.e., preliminary treatment
initially, and secondary treatment in five to ten years following a period of
monitoring. Through simulation of pollution movement and dispersion (using
mathematical modeling), the task team was able to convince the client that
preliminary treatment, i.e., screening and grit removal, was adequate for discharge to
the Yangtze River with its large assimilative capacity, and that there would be no
adverse impacts on downstream users. However, as the central government mandated
that all treatment plants upstream of the TGP should be designed to Class 1A
discharge standard, the wastewater treatment plants were subsequently to meet this
requirement.

Lessons learned from past operations in China, such as the need for comprehensive
sector analysis, revision of master plans, sustainability of the sector, increased
reliance on user fees to meet operating costs, and improved construction management,
were incorporated in the project design. Weak aspects of quality at entry included
insufficient attention to cost estimates, and lack of firm commitment and delays that
led to cancellation of projects. Despite these shortcomings, quality at entry is
considered satisfactory.


2.2 Implementation

Pressure to Accelerate Construction. CM was urged by the central government to
accelerate wastewater treatment in Chongqing to reduce pollution reaching the TGP
reservoir. Senior leaders in the CM monitored project implementation through weekly
reviews, headed by the Mayor. They set accelerated completion targets, which
enabled completion of most elements of the Chongqing wastewater component in
about four years, without compromising final quality. However, the early completion
targets also induced rapid preparation and contract awards, before detailed designs
were completed to a technically satisfactory standard, which resulted in numerous
contractual problems discussed below. This led to frequent design changes after
award of contracts, and the resultant contract variations.



                                           6
Project Implementation Period. All the original components that were not deleted
were completed largely within the original loan closing date, and under budget. The
Fuling, and restructured Wanzhou and Nanbin components, were completed early, in
about 2004; the urban management information system was completed in 2009. The
subcomponents that were added to utilize the large loan savings were completed with
a little over a two-year extension of the loan closing date. However, the identification
agreement, and appraisal of these new components led to the extended project
implementation period.

Costs and Loan Savings. The original components were completed at a cost of about
71% of the appraisal cost estimate, and about US$ 26 million of the loan was canceled
in the end. Due to the higher attention to environmental issues associated with the
TGP, Chongqing received a large amount of national bonds funding for wastewater
and water supply projects, which resulted in the reduced use of loan proceeds, and
hence loan savings. Both the original components and additional works (using loan
savings) were completed at about 83% of the appraisal cost estimate. Loan savings
accrued primarily due to low bid prices, and to a lesser degree, due the construction of
some urgent works that had to be constructed along with new roads, or construction of
water treatment plants, such as in Wanzhou and Nanbin, that used national bonds
funds.

Exchange Rate Changes. Devaluation of the US Dollar, from Y 8.3 at appraisal to
Y6.8 by project close, required implementing agencies to mobilize additional
counterpart funds. This problem was acute for the resource-strapped small towns
which were included in the project in 2005, an issue that should have been reviewed
in greater detail at the time of project restructuring.

Procurement and Contract Administration. Project implementing agencies
experienced great difficulty adjusting to the projects' procurement and contract
management procedures that included: competitive bidding; contract award to the
lowest evaluated bidder; procedures for contract variations; assigning responsibility to
an independent engineer to act on behalf of the employer, etc. However,
incorporation of these managerial and construction practices is seen as a key benefit
of this project with long-term impacts.

Bid Prices and Contract Variations. Low bid prices (about 60% of appraisal cost
estimates), frequent design changes, and a major problem of contract variations
characterized implementation of the original components. Another factor was the
slump in the domestic construction industry at the time, which may have encouraged
contractors to bid low, and exploit weaknesses in contract documents to make up for
the low bids. By far, the most intractable problem was the very large contract
variations, especially in the Chongqing City wastewater component, where they
amounted to about US$ 28 million.



                                           7
Detailed Design Preparation. The most serious problems arose from weak detailed
designs that generated frequent design changes after contract award, and very
substantial contract variations. These were caused by: accelerated implementation
targets set by the CM; the poor performance in the preparation of detailed designs by
the design institutes; cursory field investigations; inaccurate geotechnical and
topographic data; and award of contracts before completion of detailed designs.

Design Review and Certification. The above problems led to the decision in 2004, to
engage international consultant services for design review and certification to improve
the quality of detailed designs, and reduce frequent design changes and contract
variations. Mitigation measures were agreed and implemented to reduce project
implementation risks midway in the project, and prior to implementation of the
additional works, and included: (a) appointment of a consultant for Design Review
and Certification Consultant to review designs, bid documents, etc. and certify
adequacy before invitation of bids; and (b) processing contract variations and issuance
of all variation orders only by the Resident Engineer, without which the Bank would
not consider them for disbursement. This intervention was effective, and was
appreciated by the PMO. The additional works were substantially completed with
minor changes.

Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Land acquisition and resettlement was conducted
satisfactorily in accordance with the resettlement action plans. However, project
implementation experienced delays, especially in the new components added to use
loan savings, due to land acquisition and resettlement problems.

Construction Supervision and Contract Management. A Resident Engineer (RE)
performed construction supervision and contract management services on behalf of
the Employer, using the FIDIC type contract management­ a first in any urban project
in China. The new system changed the existing, rather informal, contractual
arrangements to a more formal and legal process. As expected, the PIUs had difficulty
adjusting to the new system of complete delegation of powers to a RE. It took
persistent efforts by the RE and the Bank to get the PIUs to allow the RE to carry out
his duties without interference. Towards the middle of the project implementation,
systems began to work, and contract management and construction quality showed
improvement. This method of contract management has been adopted in the follow-on
Bank-supported Chongqing Small Cities Infrastructure Improvement project (Ln
4794).

Compliance with Financial Covenants. The utility company financial performance
covenants were in compliance, with the municipal governments meeting deficits in
operating expenses, consistent with the definition of the total revenue in the legal
agreements which provided for government support to meet shortfalls, termed `non-
operating income'. The requirement to prepare financial statements, to assess the need
for additional revenue mobilization, was not followed diligently by utility companies;

                                           8
they were prepared in the initial years when the project consultants were on board.
Financial projections were prepared subsequently by local consultants, but were not
shared with the Bank. Moreover, the new institutional structure made the original
financial statements irrelevant. It was not clear how CWGC develops the annual
status of its finances and projected treatment fees, although it was reported that
accounts were audited annually by the government auditors.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Detailed outputs and outcomes set out in the PAD for each component were
monitored closely by the Project Management Offices and the respective
Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPB). The data on performance indicators were
collected from implementing agencies and incorporated in the semi-annual progress
reports. In addition, Bank supervision teams carried out their own monitoring and
evaluations and reported the relevant issues in the implementation status reports
(ISR). The above M &E arrangements helped to identify and address issues of
implementation, and take corrective actions as necessary.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Social Safeguard. Resettlement activities were carried out satisfactorily. External
monitoring of safeguard implementation was completed in accordance with the legal
agreements. Annual safeguard compliance reports prepared by PIUs have been
submitted regularly. Resettlement action plans (RAP) were prepared and implemented
in conformity with Bank and Government policies, in consultation with the affected
people. Resettlement assessments show that implementation was completed
successfully and that livelihoods and standards of living of affected persons have
improved. Additional RAPs were prepared for the eight subcomponents added to
utilize loan savings. A total of 1,285 persons were displaced, 8,691.5 m2 of buildings
were demolished, and 73.4 ha of land were acquired permanently. See Annex 5 for
more details.

Environmental Safeguard. This project was assigned a Category A in project
preparation. An Environmental assessment (EA) and an environmental management
plan (EMP) were prepared according to national policies and regulations and the Bank
safeguard policies. In project implementation, it was noted that all environmental
issues were properly assessed in the EA and the proposed mitigation measures were
appropriately incorporated in the contracts for implementation. And the
environmental monitoring was carried out periodically according to the EMP. The
task team supervised the EMP implementation in a timely manner and found that the
EMP has been implemented satisfactorily. Additional EAs were prepared for the eight
sub-components added to utilize loan savings. Related environmental safeguard
documents were prepared and reviewed based on the Bank requirement and
procedures. These were complied with during implementation.


                                          9
Procurement. Procurement performance was generally satisfactory, except for the
problem of contract variations and prior approval from the Bank prior to exceeding
the 15% thresholds. In one instance, the Bank declined to finance the Yangtze siphon
contract due to CDC's insistence on using a large diameter (18 m) tunnel boring
machine (TBM) from a specified source, on the grounds of technology and lead time
to procure other machines. The loan amount of US$3.7 million allocated to this
contract was cancelled in agreement with the client. Despite this development, all
other requirements were complied with, and the work was supervised by the Chief
Resident Engineer. The most complex engineering work in the project, i.e., the
Yangtze River siphon was completed satisfactorily and in a record time.

Financial Management. Appropriate financial management arrangements were put in
place to ensure proper use and accounting of project funds. Project audit reports were
provided for the period from effectiveness to loan closing. The external auditors,
China National Audit Office, identified some internal control weaknesses in the
project audit reports. However, they were not deemed significant issues and financial
management was carried out satisfactorily throughout project implementation.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Normal operations have begun at all the water supply and wastewater treatment plants
of the project works. The treatment plants are operating satisfactorily, and are meeting
the designed discharge standard and the effluent quality standards. The facilities are
well managed and maintained with adequate budgets and trained staff is available to
operate and maintain the facilities. Municipal and County Governments provide
financial support to CWGC to meet any shortfalls in operating expenses, and have
assumed responsibility for debt service. Capacity utilization of treatment plants are:
80%-90% in Chongqing; 90% in Fuling; and 133% in Chongqing solid waste landfill.
CWGC has adopted an incentives program to encourage WCs to increase wastewater
collection and reduce operating costs.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Satisfactory

The project development objectives remained fully consistent with the national
government priorities for reducing pollution and improving water quality in the
country's major rivers, and specifically, to protect the TGP reservoir from the threat
of eutrophication, through reducing all pollution from upstream towns. The project is
also consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, with respect to

                                           10
safeguarding the environment and reducing infrastructure bottlenecks. The project
design addressed priority infrastructure needs and necessary institutional reforms, and
implementation arrangements were satisfactory and appropriate. The project
supported the Chongqing Municipality to implement the 11th Five Year Plan's
priority environmental infrastructure, and specifically, urgent investments in
wastewater collection and treatment.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

The project satisfactorily achieved the PDO through reducing pollution discharges to
water bodies, improving their water quality, ensuring the safety and reliability of
water sources the river systems, generally, and improving the quality of life in the
main urban cities. It can be concluded that the rapid development of Chongqing city,
Fuling and Wanzhou was facilitated by the project environmental improvements, and
the project contributed to the long-term economic growth of urban areas in Chongqing
Municipality. Further elaboration is provided below.

The direct project outcome was to reverse the deteriorating water quality from Class
III to Class II in the Yangtze River, and Class V to Class II in the Jialing and Wu
Rivers, through collection and treatment of municipal wastewater. Through improving
water quality in the Yangtze River, the project contributed to reducing the risk of
eutrophication in the TGP reservoir downstream, which is a continuing concern of the
central government. Wastewater treated in Chongqing reached 776,000 m3/d (from
70,000 m3/d before the project), with the treatment ratio, reported to be close to about
90%. The safety and reliability of CM's drinking water sources improved
significantly. Though not quantifiable, reduced pollution in the Jialing and Wu Rivers,
created a better living environment for residents of Chongqing City and Fuling. The
institutional reform achieved was limited, as the Chongqing Municipal Government
pursued an institutional model different to the one agreed.

Though technically unconnected to the project, the parallel CM-implemented
industrial control action plan, agreed at project appraisal, reduced industrial pollution
discharges to water bodies; about 179,300 tons of COD, the key parameter for
industrial wastewater, were removed in 2006.

Environmental conditions were further improved through the collection and disposal
of solid wastes in Chongqing's first sanitary landfill, and closure of seven open
dumps. The landfill is currently operating at 133% of its design capacity of 1,500
tons/day, thus, effectively reducing the design 15-year life of the landfill. Another
landfill of 1,000 tons/day capacity has since been constructed to meet the improved
collection of solid wastes in Chongqing City.



                                            11
While not directly supporting the PDO, the importance of preserving cultural heritage
assets was demonstrated through the conservation of the Qing Dynasty merchant's
guildhall site (Huguang Huiguan) financed under the project.

An outcome not originally planned, was the improvement of environmental
conditions in seven small county towns, using the accumulated loan savings. The
outcomes included improved water supply and wastewater management, and
protection against floods.

Utility Management. The project facilitated the corporatization of wastewater
services from government departments to autonomous companies, and the
introduction of a wastewater tariff, thereby encouraging a greater reliance in user
charges to meet operational expenses. Wastewater companies were able to meet all
operation and maintenance costs and a proportion of the debt service requirements at
project closure. A solid waste fee was introduced in Chongqing City to defray costs
of solid waste collection and disposal.

Institutional and Financial Reforms. Assumptions in the project legal agreements
that all wastewater tariff revenues would be passed over to the wastewater companies
to finance wastewater operations and new investments did not materialize.
Wastewater tariff revenues continued to be collected by the respective Finance
Bureaus, who provide budget allocations to wastewater companies (WC) to operate
and maintain assets. Budget provisions are cash based, and reflect the actual financial
responsibilities of the WC; and the budgets have no provision for depreciation.
Finance Bureaus managed debt service for WCs. Under this method of financing, it
was not possible to achieve the intended financial reforms, i.e., WCs cannot account
for the income from wastewater tariffs, they can only account for government budget
allocations they receive; and WCs cannot assume full responsibility for debt servicing
and associated risks. Financial autonomy of WCs was not fully achieved.

The CM adopted a modified reform model in 2000. Chongqing Drainage Company
(CDC) and Fuling Drainage Company (FDC), established as state-owned limited
liability companies at the project start, became subsidiary companies under the
Chongqing Water Group Co., Ltd. (CWGC), which has responsibility for water
supply and wastewater. CDC and FDC function as cost centers under CWGC,
responsible for implementing wastewater projects, and operating and maintaining the
assets constructed. The CWGC appoints the management and staff of the CDC and
FDC. CM assumed responsibility for debt, and paid CWGC a treatment fee for
wastewater treated. CDC and FDC were changed to treatment companies.
Substantively, this model does not represent much change because of: the lack of
incentives for utility companies to improve efficiency; and transparency in the
utilization of wastewater revenue, subsidy and treatment fee; and government
discretion on the utilization of wastewater revenues.



                                          12
Revenues in the financial statements of WCs represent the funds received from
CWGC, and do not cover depreciation of assets; they are only related to the volume of
wastewater treated. All assets created continue to remain on the balance sheets of the
WCs. Financial statements for 2006 and 2007 have been prepared and audited by
Chongqing Municipal Audit Office. Even under the new institutional model, the
respective Finance Bureaus continue to collect wastewater revenues, provide budgets
to the CWGC to distribute to WCs; and Finance Bureaus assume the responsibility for
debt service. WCs thus function as service providers reimbursed for the quantity of
wastewater treated. Project legal agreements were not amended to reflect the new
institutional arrangements.

Public Private Participation. With the support of the Bank team and two grants from
the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), CM received advice on
options for public private participation (PPP) in infrastructure provision, which
resulted in three PPP operations, i.e., Tangjiatuo WWTP (management contract),
Tongxing incinerator (BOT contract), and Tongxing medical waste (BOT contract).
The contract for the management of the Tangjiatuo wastewater treatment plant was
awarded in 2006, to the Chongqing Sino French Tangjiatuo Wastewater Treatment
Company, a company under a joint venture with the Sino French Water Investment
Co., Ltd. The private party (Suez Environment SAS) also acquired a share of the
CWGC, with two MIGA guarantees of US$ 72 million each for this operation. The
second phase outputs included improvements in policy and regulatory framework for
PPP, which recommended divestiture of government ownership of municipal service
providers to enable them function as truly independent market players, and separation
of the government roles as investor, policy maker and regulator.

Implementation of the Industrial Pollution Control Action Plan. By loan closure,
pollution prevention and control measures were completed in 600 enterprises and
1,397 industrial and mining enterprises were relocated to designated industrial parks.
The highly polluting Jialing Chemical Works, located along the Jialing River, was
relocated to Rongchang County. Industries that remained are required to adopt clean
production technology, and some of them have reached zero pollution discharges.
(See Annex 6 for details)

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Satisfactory

Economic Analysis. All planned physical outputs, except the Wanzhou and Nanbin
water treatment plants, were completed in the original project cities and in the towns
included in the project later. Thus, significant additional investments were made, all
within the original project cost estimate, and most of the anticipated economic
benefits identified at appraisal, and more, were achieved for a lower cost. Most
construction of assets was completed ahead of schedule and under budget, which


                                           13
boosted their rate of return. Alternative options were considered for each element of
an infrastructure item, e.g., per capita water demand, intakes, transmission and
alignment, phased capacity increase, wastewater treatment incrementally to meet
discharge standards, etc. Least cost options were selected by evaluating a number of
alternative options.

Significant economic benefits were realized through: improved environmental
conditions and urban regeneration, avoided flood damage, increased land values,
higher rentals for commercial and residential properties, and a robust economic
growth. It can be reasonably concluded that project investments supported creation of
an improved environmental setting that contributed to the rapid pace of economic
growth and urban development in Chongqing, Fuling and Wanzhou. The total
quantified benefits of the Huguang Huiguan Guildhall conservation have been
estimated at 13 times the investment (RMB 62.9 million; US$ 9.3 million) with a
reported economic internal rate of return (EIRR) oft 20.9 percent.2 Cost and benefit
analysis was not adopted for the wastewater components because of the difficulty of
quantifying benefits, and cost effectiveness analysis was adopted instead.

Financial Analysis. It was not possible to develop a true picture of the finances of
the drainage companies because CDC and FDC own only the assets created under the
project, as the collection networks remain with the drainage units that are financed
under separate government budgets; and CDC and FDC now operate as treatment
companies with the only revenue being the treatment fee based on the quantity of
wastewater treated. CM is responsible for debt service obligations. It is not clear
whether the treatment fee includes depreciation of assets owned by the companies.
Under this changed scenario, the original financial performance covenants or the
projected tariff have little relevance. Also it is not clear whether the revenue from the
treatment fee is adequate to meet the O&M expenditures of CDC and FDC. Adequate
information was not available to make any assessment.

In order to make some assessments, financial statements were reconstructed, as part of
the ICR preparation, to assess whether there is compliance with the covenanted
financial performance criteria. Tariff projections and financial statements prepared on
this basis are provided in Annex 4.

CDC is in compliance with the tariff projected for 2008. However, in order to
maintain the financial performance criteria, CDC would have to adjust its wastewater
tariff to RMB 1.30/m3 over the next five years. FDC did not meet the projected tariff
for 2008. FDC would have to increase the average wastewater tariff to RMB 3.27/m3
over the next five years. However, with a combined system that represents about 45%
of storm water in the sewer system, it would be reasonable for the Fuling Government

to bear the cost of storm water disposal. It is projected that the wastewater tariff could
then be reduced to RMB 1.81/m3 average over the next five years if the Fuling
Government will bear the cost of storm water disposal.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The rating is justified on the grounds of relevance of objectives, significant
achievements of outcomes in water quality improvements and reduction of pollution
discharges to water bodies, substantial institutional reforms, and efficiency
improvements that enabled completion, under budget, of most of the original
components and the additional works in seven towns. The otherwise highly
satisfactory outcomes were impacted by the financing of some works outside the
project, and the limited institutional and tariff reform.



3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

The relatively small but significant intervention in Bank support for cultural heritage
protection and management achieved a singular impact in raising awareness for
cultural heritage assets conservation and management, and spurring tourism and
economic development. The Government and Bank task teams displayed exceptional
leadership in guiding the design, and contributed to this success with a proactive task
team who procured financial support to provide internationally recognized specialists
from Italy to advise and guide the Yuzhong District Government (YDG) authorities of
the Chongqing Municipality.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not applicable

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Chongqing Municipality modified the projects' institutional model through
consolidating water supply and wastewater under a group holding company, and
converting the WCs to treatment companies that received payments based on the
quantity of wastewater treated, with the government assuming responsibility for debt
service obligations. The new institutional model represents recognition of a reality,
but is unlikely to produce substantive strengthening until reliance on tariffs for
operating expenditures increases substantially.




                                            15
The collaboration of the Government and the Bank to launch a pilot initiative to
protect built cultural heritage, was a departure from the traditional composition of
urban environment projects. It was also recognition of the role cultural heritage in
awareness raising, improving quality of life, and tourism as a vehicle for economic
growth.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Suez Environment SAS, a French company, acquired a minority stake in the CWGC,
and also entered into a contract to manage the Tangjiatuo wastewater treatment plant
in Chongqing. Two MIGA guarantees were provided to the French company.
Preceding this development, the task team assisted Chongqing to secure two PPIAF
grants, the first (US$ 354,000), to educate and inform officials about the opportunities
of PSP in the sector, and the second (US$ 199,250), to develop a regulatory
framework for public private partnerships. The Chongqing Solid Waste Company has
negotiated a contract with a British company for the sale of carbon credits, and is
awaiting central government approval of the draft contract.

Not applicable


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

The project outcomes are considered to be at low risk with the central and provincial
governments' efforts to improve wastewater treatment plant operation, management
efficiency, continuing investments in wastewater infrastructure, and the high priority
to protect water quality in the TGP. Potential risks to the development outcomes are
summarized below:

(i) All wastewater generated in Chongqing will not be intercepted. Connecting all
      wastewater generated to the collection system is still going on, and is targeted for
      completion by 2010, and this can be achieved without expanding the capacity of
      the interceptors;
(ii) Industries could discharge highly toxic wastewater accidentally or deliberately.
      Accidents or deliberate discharge of industrial wastewater is an ever present risk.
      Along with the enhanced capacity for monitoring, CM has put in place an
      emergency response plan to deal with accidents;
(iii) Chongqing Municipality may not provide financial support to meet operating
      expenses. The risk that the Municipality may not provide financial support to the
      wastewater sector is very small because of the heavy emphasis on maintaining a


                                            16
     satisfactory water quality in the Yangtze River. Thus far, CM has provided the
     funds, as necessary, to meet any shortfalls; and
(iv) Uncontrolled high rise developments could compromise the conservation efforts
     for the Huguang Huiguan Guildhall Complex. The Yuzhong District
     Government has already taken action to remove offending buildings, formulated
     development control regulations under the project, which are expected to be
     strictly enforced.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Highlights of project design and project preparation which were supported by the
Bank team are described below:

(i) preparation of a comprehensive two-province (Chongqing and Sichuan) water
      sector study, adopting the integrated river basin (i.e., Min and Tuo River Basins)
      approach for water resource management and determination of priority
      investments, that provided the firm underpinning for project preparation; and
      attention to the strategic impact on the Yangtze river system and water resources,
      by removing from the river large quantities of BOD/COD and municipal solid
      waste;
 (ii) the mobilization of over US$3 million grant funds, from Japan, France, Great
      Britain, Australia, Italy and Switzerland, for project preparation studies that also
      included update of the wastewater master plan, and mathematical modeling of
      pollution concentrations in the Yangtze River;
(iii) scale model studies for the 18-meter diameter bored tunnel, with three 6-meter
      diameter pipes inside it, that was to form the 1.3 km long siphon under the
      Yangtze River - a high point in the engineering challenge
(iv) planning for the interception of all wastewater generated in Chongqing City to
      2020, with a collection network and treatment capacity of 900,000 m3/d and
      additional pretreatment of 500,000 m3/d, up from a treatment capacity of 70,000
      m3/d before the project;
(v) inclusion of broader pollution issues including municipal and industrial
      wastewater pollution and solid waste management for Chongqing City in the
      project design, with an agreement with CM to implement a parallel industrial
      pollution control action plan;
(vi) agreement with Borrower to introduce institutional reforms, i.e., to establish
      autonomous companies for wastewater and solid waste management, adopt a


                                            17
      policy of increased reliance on user fees to assure sustainability of investments;
      and introduce user fees for wastewater and solid waste management;
(vii) adoption of measures to improve contract management practices through
      introduction of the FIDIC type contract management system for the first time in a
      Bank-financed project in China; and
(viii) formulation of a demonstration pilot for built cultural heritage asset protection
      and management- a first for a Bank-financed project in the urban sector and a
      significant departure from traditional projects; and mobilization of a large
      (Italian) grant to provide advice, guidance and supervision of reconstruction and
      rehabilitation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Given the nature and complexity of the project, the task team supervision effort was
intense and highly supportive of the efforts of the PMO and implementing units,
which helped develop a highly collaborative relationship between Chongqing
Municipality and the World Bank. This effort had the continuous support of Bank
management, including numerous visits by senior officials to Chongqing. Detailed
back-to-office reports were thorough and identified problems and issues and proposed
actions to resolve difficulties. At the same time, the Bank did not hesitate to take firm
action, when necessary, such as to address the continuing incidents of numerous
design changes, excessive contract variations, and non-observance of procedures on
contract variations, e.g., disapproved some pending contract variations, and suspended
considering contract variations until correct procedures were followed and agreement
was reached to engage an international consultant for review and certification of
detailed designs and bid documents. Another firm action taken by the Bank was the
prompt cancellation of the loan proceeds allocated to a contract when procurement
procedures were not followed.

Following restructuring of the project to utilize loan savings, the Bank deployed
additional resources for supervision because the existing weak capacity in the small
towns, which also resulted in project implementation delays and extension of the loan
closing date. Through these efforts, it was possible to complete implementation of the
loan-savings subcomponents with a three-month extension over the planned two-year
implementation period.

The Bank thus improved the quality of supervision through: introducing design
review and certification; closer control of contract variations, restructuring the project
to use loan savings to enhance achievement of the PDO; urging the employer to
support the implementation of FIDIC type contract management; and mobilizing
additional funding for innovative public-private participation (PPP) activities and for
highly specialized supervision of the cultural heritage component. The Chongqing

                                            18
authorities expressed their high appreciation of the support and guidance received
from the Bank throughout project implementation.

The task team was proactive in mobilizing funds to support the Borrower to improve
the monitoring of implementation of safeguards with a Japan (PHRD) grant (TF-
26651) of $324,500 to: establish an independent advisory committee to monitor
safeguards implementation; enhance public awareness and civil society participation;
and finance monitoring of the Yangtze siphon and operations of the Chongqing
wastewater system. The task team assisted CM through preparation of the terms of
reference and the proposal for PPIAF grant applications. The task team was
instrumental in encouraging Chongqing to improve efficiency in the delivery of
infrastructure services through (PPP) in infrastructure provision. Towards this end, the
Bank mobilized two tranches of grant funds from the PPIAF, which resulted in four
PPP contracts, and a regulatory framework for PPP operations.

The task team's efforts served to generate considerable interest in cultural heritage
protection, interpretation and presentation through the project's involvement in the
conservation of the Huguang Huiguan Guild Hall Complex. The high point of this
effort was making available to Chongqing best practice conservation expertise from
Italy through the cooperation and assistance of the Italian trust funds for cultural
development. More than US$1.0 million of Italian trust funds were mobilized to
support the Bank and Yuzhong District Government with design reviews, advice,
guidance and supervision of the rehabilitation and reconstruction work of the
Huguang Huiguan cultural heritage asset.

Environmental and Social Safeguards. Supervision of environmental and social
safeguards implementation was done entirely by specialists from the Beijing Office of
the World Bank, including the review of the new RAPs for the seven subcomponents
financed with loan savings. Bank supervision of implementation of environmental
and social safeguards was satisfactory.

Procurement. Supervision of procurement administration was carried out efficiently
by the specialists from the Beijing Office, who could read Chinese. The procurement
staff provided significant guidance and advice for limiting contract variations. The
Bank canceled US$3.7 million of the loan when CDC continued to insist on the
method of procurement of the large diameter (18 m) tunnel boring machine not
available in China; a procedure not acceptable to the Bank.

Financial Management. Appropriate financial management systems were put in
place at the project start, and the Bank provided the initial necessary training.
Monitoring and supervision were carried out satisfactorily by the Beijing Office
specialists. No problems were encountered during project implementation.




                                           19
Overall Assessment of the Quality of Supervision. Task teams undertook full
missions at least twice a year, and provided candid assessments of progress and
problems, and addressed issues as they arose. Closer day-to-day contact was
facilitated when task team leader moved to the Beijing office starting 2005. A QAG
quality of supervision assessment (QSA) carried out around 2005, rated the
performance as `satisfactory'.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall, Bank performance is judged satisfactory, notwithstanding the comments in
the Borrower's ICR (see Section 7 below for responses) on delays in Bank response
and procurement practices.

5.2 Borrower

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Performance of the Chongqing Municipal Government was satisfactory in many
respects. Specifically:

(i) the strong and sustained commitment to the project development objective, and
      the strong project management and coordination provided for the entire duration
      of the project by the Project Management Office, under the Chongqing Planning
      Commission. Both these agencies were very effective in taking decisive action in
      a timely manner with regard to contract supervision, quality control and
      mentoring the new rural counties on Bank implementation procedures through
      review of bid documents, bid evaluation reports and quality control;
(ii) monitoring of implementation by high-level CM officials on a weekly basis,
      which facilitated completion of the original components well within the original
      project period, despite the complex engineering works involved, even though the
      pressure to accelerate construction contributed to some of the design and contract
      variation problems;
(iii) strong client management and leadership, and the continuity of staff were
      significant contributors to achieving positive outcomes;

Agency
               Satisfactory. CDC collects and treats about 90% of wastewater from
               Chongqing City. CDC completed all the investments at about 73% of
Chongqing      appraisal cost, and within the original loan closing date. Under the new
Drainage       institutional arrangement, CDC functions as a service provider under a
Company        group company, responsible for wastewater treatment, for which it
(CDC)          receives a treatment fee based on the quantity of wastewater treated ­
               an arrangement not contemplated at appraisal. By project closure,
               CDC was in compliance with the financial performance covenants.

               RMB 0.50/m at project closure, against the projected tariff of RMB
               1.30/m3, reflecting a higher level of subsidy than Chongqing, and

               despite repeated reminders by the Bank. The current tariff structure
               does not even recover the cost of operation and naintenance. Similar to
               CDC, FDC is a service provider under the group company, and is also
               reimbursed based on quantity of wastewater treated, i.e., treatment fee.
               FDC was not able to comply with the project financial performance

6. Lessons Learned

(i) Professional Liability. Under current practice, the Employer has no recourse for
    negligence by service providers, i.e., design institutes and consultants. CDC
    incurred additional costs that can be rightfully assigned to weak designs,
    investigations, and construction supervision in the implementation of the drainage
    component. Similarly, the solid waste company incurred additional costs due to
    inaccurate geotechnical investigations for the landfill that were done by a
    specialized design institute. There is no mechanism or regulations for the clients to
    seek any form of compensation for professional negligence by the service
    providers. It may be opportune for the Government to consider introduction
    professional liability requirements along with clear accountability and professional
    insurance from domestic service providers.

(ii) The Evolving Institutional Model for the Wastewater Sector. The emerging
    Chinese institutional model for the water sector comprises a holding company
    owning all wastewater and water supply assets, and providing a treatment fee to the
    wastewater company as a service provider; hence the traditional covenants cannot
    be applied as the company has no revenues other than the treatment fee, and at
    times, no assets. The model has also been adopted in Beijing, Foshan, and Liaoning
    Province. The traditional wastewater utility institutional model used by the Bank,
    needs to be reviewed and modified in future projects in the light of this
    development. The financial performance covenants would have little relevance if
    this issue is not addressed.

(iii) Ingredients for a Successful Bank and Borrower Partnerships. Ingredients for
     successful projects are a continuing dialogue, understanding of policies and
     limitations of partners, making compromises where possible without imposing
     solutions, and taking tough stands and following through when necessary. Many
     of the above ingredients were found in this project, which accounts for the
     significant achievements, and subsequent collaborations between Chongqing
     Municipality and the Bank. Chongqing Municipality's vision for the future, and
     the willingness to implement sector reforms to improve the efficiency of service
     delivery were significant factors for the projects' success, i.e., introduction of
     wastewater and solid waste tariffs, formulating a new institutional model that
     includes performance-based payments for wastewater treatment, entering into
     public private partnerships,

(iv) Project Preparation and Implementation in Small Cities and Counties.
    Preparatory and implementation activities, including the preparation of feasibility
    reports, engineering designs, contract documents, and construction supervision all
    proved challenging when dealing with smaller and more remote PIUs. Design
    institutes in the more remote areas of CM have less experience in project

                                           23
   preparation and the PIUs have less experience with Bank and international
   standards. Therefore, these activities require more resources in terms of PMO,
   Bank, and external consultant's time.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing
Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower makes a candid assessment of the achievements, how the Bank was
instrumental in supporting institutional and financial reform in the utility services, and
the very practical problems faced during project implementation. The Borrower raises
a number of issues and problems faced during implementation. In the interests of
maintaining the constructive dialogue with this informed and engaged Borrower, the
Bank needs to address some of the issues that do not compromise Bank procedures,
some of which are discussed below.

(i) The Borrower cites the long time taken to review reports, disbursement claims for
contract variations. Comment: The Bank made significant efforts to introduce order
and discipline in the issue of variations orders because of the problems encountered:
unclear authority and procedures in the issue of variation orders; inadequate basis to
support cost estimates of the work ordered; exceeding the 15% threshold on contract
variations without advising the Bank; and incomplete documentation submission to
the Bank to enable timely review and approvals. The long time to process
disbursement claims for contract variations, largely result from the above problems.
However, there may be a need for the Bank in provide additional staff resources for
procurement administration.

(ii) The Borrower complains of the lack of flexibility to award contracts to capable
contractors because of the Bank requirement to award the contract to the lowest
evaluated bidder. Comment. This fundamental principle, incorporated in the Bank
procurement procedures, is the norm in many countries, but faced difficulties with the
client. The Borrower needs to be assisted to develop sound post qualification criteria
so that frivolous or unresponsive bids could be rejected. There is a need better
explain the Bank's vision of following larger objectives than those linked only to the
immediate investment.

(iii) The Borrower is faced with unscrupulous contractors who get the contracts and
then subcontract the works to local contractors without approval. Comment: The
Borrower needs to make the necessary investigations and audit of contractors to



                                            24
detect where such practices occur, and take necessary remedial action to improve
contracting practices.

(iv) The Borrower maintains that the rigid requirements of the Bank set ambitious
reform agendas for utility companies. Comment: The Bank's sector development
objective is to support development of efficient utility operations with full cost
recovery for revenue-earning services. While full cost recovery is required in the cost
recovery covenant, the legal agreements, as drafted, recognize that full cost recovery
will be achieved in a phased manner. This is reflected in the flexibility incorporated in
the definition of operating revenue, which allows for non-operating income, i.e.,
government support, which is expected to be reduced progressively to achieve full
cost recovery within a reasonable time.

   Annex 1: Detailed Performance Indicators and Results

                  CHINA: Chongqing Urban Environment Project

Water quality of Cuntan and Daxigou sections of the Yangtze River and Jialing River
improved progressively during 1998 to 2008. In accordance with requirements
stipulated by the State Environment Protection Bureau in 2003, nine parameters were
used to evaluate water quality in Rivers. The nine parameters are: Ph value, Dissolved
Oxygen, Permanganate Index, BOD5, Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3-N), Hg, Oil, Lead
and Volatile Phenol. The results of monitoring show that the water quality from
Cuntan section improved from Class III in 1998 to Class II in 2008, and the
permanganate index and BOD concentration by 10.6% and 42.0%, respectively. In the
Daxigou section, water quality improved from Class IV in 1998 to Class II in 2008,
and the permanganate index and BOD concentration reduced by 35.0% and 48.8%,
respectively. For ease of reference, environmental quality standards are provided in
the table below.

Load Reduction at Jiguanshi and Tangjiatuo Wastewater Treatment Plants

At the completion of CUEP wastewater management component ,municipal
wastewater from the central areas of Chongqing has been intercepted and conveyed to
newly built Jiguanshi and Tangjiatuo WWTPs, then discharged after preliminary
treatment, and its discharge standard reached Grade 1, standard B. The annual total
BOD load reduction increased from 1,304 tons in 1999 to 24,111 tons in 2008, and
the corresponding annual total COD load reduction increased from 2,690 tons to
57,195 tons. The construction of the second phase for secondary treatment of

Jiguanshi and Tangjiatuo was completed with Japanese funding, and at present, the
third phase (expansion of Jiguanshi WWTP 200,000m3/d, and Tangjiatuo WWTP
100,000m3/d) is under construction using local funds.

       Attachment to Annex 3: Conservation of the Huguang
                            Huiguan Guildhall Complex3
            (Environmental Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Component)

                      CHINA: Chongqing Urban Environment Project

Background. The Environmental Rehabilitation and Reconstruction component of
the CUEP comprised the conservation activities at the Huguang Huiguan. The
Complex is currently a Municipal Level Cultural Relic. This demonstration project
was a fine example of cooperation between national and international professional
experts and the World Bank for introduction of best practice in heritage conservation
and management. Funding for international technical assistance was provided by the
Italian Trust Fund for Culture and Development.

Like many cities in China, Chongqing faces a conflict between redevelopment of old
neighborhoods and conservation of cultural heritage. While the pace of economic
growth and development, and the high density development have helped to modernize
Chongqing, at the same time, it has resulted in the loss of the city's ancient heritage.

Chongqing has a history of over 3,000 years. Following a period of economic
depression and social instability in the mid-1600s, immigration and relocation of
people from other provinces was encouraged. These immigrants were traders,
craftsmen and businessmen, who settled down to engage in commercial and industrial
activities. Guilds (hui) were collective associations of people sharing common social
and economic interests, often the same trade or craft, or place of origin, and
developed at the end of the Ming dynasty (1366­1644). The guilds centered around
guildhalls (huiguan) which were multi-functional buildings where various social and
religious activities took place. The Complex is an important part of China's social,
economic and political history and its architecture is testimony to the great artistic
achievements of the Qing dynasty.

The complex is situated in the fast growing and modern Yuzhong District of
Chongqing, and covers about one hectare and comprises several guild halls that were
constructed and modified over the course of the Qing dynasty. While the buildings
have suffered from exposure to the weather, wars, and encroaching new construction,

the traditional roofs, structural elements, delicate carvings and gilded decoration, have
survived.

Objectives of Conservation and Reconstruction. The three broad objectives of the
conservation component are: cultural heritage preservation; economic development;
and social development. The Yuzhong District Government was responsible for
implementation including coordination, and the adaptation of various buildings and
areas for the new uses.

Conservation Concepts. The quality of the historic structures remains and the level
of the site's documentation indicated that the complex could be appropriately restored
and interpreted to provide Chongqing with an outstanding example of its traditional
architecture and a unique setting for entrepreneurial and cultural activities. Two
adjacent areas were identified for planning as the buffer zone and the traditional area,
with the buffer zone designated for commercial development, thus retaining its
narrow lanes and many traditional buildings, including at least one original 18th
century merchants' house. A number of mostly post-World War II multi-story
housing blocks and a secondary school have been imposed into the traditional fabric.
There were demolished and replaced with structures of a lower height and density.
This will complete the buffer zone around the complex, giving it a scale sympathetic
to the historic area and improved access for vehicles and pedestrians. The traditional
area has a few ancient buildings along with the historic urban fabric of twisting streets
and steep, stair-step lanes. The preservation of this network of traditional routes,
offers the opportunity to create a meaningful area for residents and visitors to enjoy
the traditional lifestyle, commerce, theaters, restaurants, and other educational and
tourist activities.

Conservation Design and Implementation. Implementation was carried out in
accordance with the heritage protection laws at the state, provincial and municipal
levels, and the ICOMOS China Charter. The conservation project's planning and
design were carried out in three phases: (a) survey of present conditions; (b) design
for conservation and adaptation of each historic building, including the addition of
missing parts; new construction designs and landscape interventions in open areas;
and (c) working drawings and working drawing details for consolidation and
replacement of wooden structures; consolidation of masonry; construction of new
masonry; roofing; flooring; paving; drainage system; restoration of wooden decorated
elements; and bid documents.

             Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

                 CHINA: Chongqing Urban Environment Project

Economic Analysis

Cost effectiveness analysis was adopted, at appraisal, for the wastewater components
because it was not possible to quantify benefits adequately. Although a cost benefit
analysis was not done for the cultural heritage component at appraisal, the consultants
that provided supervisory support during implementation computed the cost benefit
analysis, which is reproduced below.

The following least cost options were selected following evaluation a number of
alternative options, as described below: (a) construction of two large wastewater
treatment plants at the edge of the town, instead of 20 smaller plants distributed with
the built up area; (b) collection of all wastewater in large interceptors, planned for the
20-year planning requirement versus constructing a new wastewater collection
system; (c) construction of the optimum mix of wastewater interceptors using
underground pipes, tunnel sections and elevated box culverts; (d) modification of
interceptor alignments to minimize demolitions and land acquisitions; (e) retention of
existing wastewater treatment capacity in two plants until their useful life, versus
abandoning them prematurely; (f) decision to adopt preliminary treatment versus full
secondary treatment of wastewater, based on model studies on the assimilation
capacity of the Yangtze River; (g) decision to use the tunnel option to cross the
Yangtze River for the main interceptor versus construction an aqueduct or other
elevated transmission arrangement; (h) adoption of optimum pumping arrangements
to minimize operating costs; (i) location of water intakes upstream versus enhanced
and costly treatment in existing treatment plants; and (j) phasing of water supply
investments, rather than create excess capacity for longer-term requirements.

Most of the planned physical outputs were achieved in the capital city (Chongqing)
and other cities and towns. In addition, significant additional investments were made,
all within the original project cost estimate. Thus, all anticipated economic benefits
identified at appraisal, and in eight towns added during implementation, were
achieved for a lower cost, and largely on time.

Although quantitative data is not available, it can be inferred that the improvement of
the environmental conditions and cultural attraction created combined to create an
attractive setting for the growth of Chongqing Municipality. The outcomes that may
have contributed to the creation of significant economic benefits include: improved
environmental conditions and urban regeneration, increased land values, higher
rentals for commercial and residential properties, and generally increased economic
activity.

                                            39
The project impacts could be attributed, at least in part, to the rapid pace of economic
growth and urban development of Chongqing, Fuling and Wanzhou. Chongqing has
seen very significant economic and urban development since its formation, (and the
start of project preparation). To a large extent this growth could be attributed to the
Chinese government's Western Region development initiative that brought
investments in its wake, and the infrastructure improvements, partly, and the
beneficial impacts of the TGP. The project can justifiably claim some credit for this
growth.

Other economic benefits, not quantified, from the project include: (a) improved public
health in the project cities as a result of improved drinking water supply, solid waste
and wastewater management; (b) increased land values in the central area of
Chongqing, Fuling and Wanzhou; (c) economic revival and increased tourism income
from the conservation of the cultural heritage site (Huguang Huiguan); (c) permanent
and temporary job creation on which normal economic multipliers can be applied; and
(d) potential savings by industries now discharging through municipal sewers to
centralized wastewater treatment plants, rather than operating costly onsite treatment
facilities.

                             Direct Benefits of the Project

                The environment in Chongqing improved, almost all wastewater
Chongqing       intercepted and treated, and the water quality in the Yangtze river and
                Jialing rivers has improved. Seven dumping sites closed in an
                environmentally safe manner. Land will be restored to open space in
                the further development. Land values in surrounding areas have
                increased. The living standards of Chongqing people have been
                improved.
                Almost all wastewater intercepted and treated. The environment of
Fuling          Fuling improved. Water quality in the Wu River improved.
                The water supply to the city improved, and drinking water treatment
Wanzhou         costs have reduced.
                New industrial enterprises were set up after project completion.

Financial Analysis

Financial analysis contemplated at project appraisal was based on the institutional
model where the new utility companies would own all assets, operate and maintain
them, receive operating revenue from wastewater tariffs including non-operating
revenue as government transfers, and generate revenues adequate to meet the greater
of depreciation or debt service. International consultants provided under the project
assisted CDC and FDC prepare annual financial statements and projections for tariff
requirements in the initial years. The reforms introduced by CM in 2005, changed the
financial picture; CDC and FDC were converted to companies that were responsible
only to operate and maintain the treatment plants, for which they received a treatment
fee based on the quantity of wastewater treated. CM assumed the responsibility for
debt service. However, assets created under the project remained with the companies.
At the time of the ICR preparation, financial statements for CDC and FDC were not
available, nor was it possible to ascertain the composition of the treatment fee and its
adequacy to meet actual costs of O&M. It was reported, however, that financial
statements were prepared annually and audited by the designated auditors, but these
statements were not available for review.

As part of ICR preparation, financial projections for CDC and FDC were compiled to
assess whether current wastewater tariffs meet the requirements of full cost recovery,
and to prepare projections of required tariffs (see below). The financial projections
were made according to the covenants in the legal agreements, which require CDC
and FDC: (a) to generate total revenue adequate to meet total operating expenses, and
the amount by which debt service requirements exceeds the provision for
depreciation; and (b) not undertake any debt unless a reasonable forecast shows that
its estimated net revenues for each fiscal year is at least 1.3 times its estimated debt
service requirements.

The major conclusions of the financial projections are as follows:

Chongqing Municipal Drainage Company (CDC). CDC met the projected tariff
indicated in the PAD by 2008. However, CDC would need to adjust its wastewater
tariff from the current level to an average level of RMB1.30/m3 in the next five years.
CDC is able to undertake further debt for its operations and new investments since the
sum of depreciation and amortization will be about 3.1 times of the debt service
requirements.

Fuling Drainage Company (FDC). FDC did not meet the projected tariff indicated in
the PAD by 2008. However, FDC would need to adjust wastewater tariff from the
current level to an average level of RMB 3.27/m3 over the next five years. However,
Fuling has a combined system, comprising about 45% storm water that is paid out of
the wastewater tariff. If the Fuling Government were to provide a subsidy for storm

water, it would be possible to reduce the wastewater tariff to RMB 1.81/m3. Since the
sum of depreciation and amortization will be about 11 times of the debt service
requirements of FDC, it can undertake further debt for its operation and new
investments.

Projections of wastewater tariffs and financial projections for CDC and FDC are
provided below.

Financial Projection for Drainage Companies

The financial statements and CMDC and FDC are presented below. The following
assumptions were used to prepare the financial projections:

(i) the projections cover only CDC and FDC operations; the operation of the
Tangjiatuo treatment plant, managed by a private operator, is not included;
(ii) the older networks owned and operated by municipal drainage departments are not
included in the projections, as CDC and FDC have no access to that information;
(iii) projected tariffs for 2009-2011 are based on the unit cost of wastewater treated by
CDC and FDC; not the quantity of wastewater collected. If the quantity of wastewater
collected were to be larger than the quantity treated, the projected tariff could be
lower, and vice versa;
(iv) operating expenses are projected based on 2008 expenses, with a 2% increase
each year; and
(v) administrative expenses are projected based on 2008 expenses, with a 2% increase
each year.

                     CHINA: Chongqing Urban Environment Project

Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12)

Introduction

The Chongqing Urban Environment Project originally included five components. Eight
subprojects were added to utilize loan savings. Only OP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement
was triggered on social safeguards, and Resettlement Plans (RPs) for the original
components were prepared and appraised. Separate RPs were prepared for the additional
works, and appraised by the Bank midway during implementation. Implementation of the
original RPs was completed by the end of 2007, and implementation of RPs for the
additional works was completed by mid-2009.

A final resettlement completion report for both the original project and the additional
works was prepared by the PMO, and submitted to the Bank in August 2009, and form
the basis for this summary report.

Resettlement Impacts and Mitigation Measures

The actual resettlement impacts under the project are illustrated in the table below.
Resettlement impacts were much less than those estimated in the RPs, mainly because of
mitigation measures adopted during resettlement implementation. All the impacts, from
the original project and the additional works, have been identified, evaluated,
compensated, and addressed, with involvement from the local authorities and through
informed consultation with the affected persons.

Housing Restoration

About 2,051 households (Hhlds) in the original components and 97 Hhlds in the
additional works were fully compensated and relocated. All the compensation and
relocation were carried out in accordance with an agreement with each affected
household. Either collective restoration or individual restoration has been provided, along
with proper public facilities financed by local governments. Based on investigation of
households sampled randomly, the monitoring report concluded that all house
construction areas were improved to some extent, as illustrated in the table below:

Income Restoration

5.      In the implementation process of the relevant RPs, specific livelihood restoration
plans for each village/community were explored and approved by the PIUs and county
level governments in compliance with the RPs. The plans were mainly financed with
compensation for land acquisition, and supplementary funds provided by PIUs. The
implementation of the plans was supervised by the PIUs as well as Bank missions, and
also monitored by the resettlement monitors that were engaged. With the successful
implementation of the livelihood plans in the RPs, incomes of the affected households
have been restored. The variation in the average net income per capita is indicated in the
table below.

Enterprise Restoration

All the affected 21 enterprises in the original project and 16 enterprises in the additional
works have been fully compensated and resettled in accordance with agreements reached,
based on their commercial evaluation. With modifications in project design, the number
of affected enterprises in the original components was reduced significantly, from 79 to
21 during the period of project implementation.

Shop Restoration

About 96 shops in the original project and six shops in the additional works were
identified, and were fully compensated and resettled, in line with agreements reached
with each affected individual owner, based on commercial evaluation.

Conclusion

Resettlement has been completed in line with the agreed RPs, and all the affected
households have restored their housing. Housing is of better quality with more living
space, a better surrounding environment, and access to public facilities. The livelihood
restoration plans implemented have helped affected persons recover productive facilities
and/or enhance land production, so as to compensate for lost income from reduced
landholdings, and. in general, the livelihoods of the affected persons have been restored.
The affected enterprises, shops and public facilities have been fully compensated, and
have been restored.

Based on the evaluations of the two resettlement monitors, Chongqing Industrial and
Commercial University and Southwestern Communication University, as well as the
regular site visits and observations of Bank missions, it is concluded that resettlement
implementation in the project was satisfactory.

Annex 6. Implementation of the Pollution Control Action Plan
                   CHINA: Chongqing Urban Environment Project

CM implemented the agreed Industrial Pollution Control Plan in parallel with
implementation of the CUEP. The primary focus of CM strategy was to: increase
industrial pollution control and treatment; and strengthen environmental protection in the
TGP reservoir area to stabilize water quality and environmental security in the TGP. No
efforts were spared to reduce the risk of eutrophication in the TGP reservoir.

Chongqing Municipality made significant progress in reducing industrial pollution
through actively promoting clean technology, enhancing industrial wastewater treatment,
relocation or closure of industries, and enhanced monitoring and control. Pollution
control and reduction, improving water quality and protecting the sources of drinking
water, were given higher priority under the "Plan for Preventing and Treating Water
Pollution on the Upper Reach of the Yangtze River and in the Three Gorges Reservoir
Region". CM also adopted the Chongqing Clean Water Implementation Plan in 2005,
which set the following targets for industrial wastewater treatment: (a) discharge standard
to: 94% in 2005, 95% in 2006, 96% in 2007, and 98% by 2010; and (b) annual pollutant
reduction targets of: 48,700 tons of COD, 6,500 tons of NH3-N, and 400 tons of total
phosphorus by 2010.

Actions taken under the Plan have resulted in the reduction of emission of: industrial
COD from 118,900 tons in 2005, to 101,200 tons in 2008, representing a decrease of
11.89%; and industrial Ammonia Nitrogen (NH3-N) from 12,200 tons in 2005 to 8,300
tons in 2008, representing a decrease of 22%. In addition, the percentage of industrial
wastewater discharge reaching standard reached 93.5% in 2005. Data to indicate
achievement of the 2010 targets was not available.

Activities which have been implemented under the Chongqing Industrial Pollution
Control Program are as follows:

· Strengthen efforts to prevent and treat industrial pollution in the Three Gorges
  Reservoir Region. Environmental Regulations for Industrial Projects have been
  formulated, an evaluation system for the impact on environment relevant to the
  construction projects has been strictly enforced, and permission to establish new
  industries is done to prevent projects causing severe environmental impact from
  entering the TGP reservoir region.

· Control of Industrial Pollution. Industrial pollution has been controlled in an intensive
  way: potential environmental risks relevant to industrial projects have been averted;
  industrial structure and pattern have been optimized; and industrial enterprises have
  been guided to establish their factories in industrial parks. Pollution prevention and
  treatment in heavily polluting industries such as chemical, pharmaceutical, and printing
  and dyeing industries have been intensified. Clean production has been vigorously
  advanced. Compulsory audit of clean production has been carried out in 154 enterprises


                                            48
 including industries such as chemical and pharmaceuticals. Enterprises were
 encouraged to upgrade processes so as to control pollutants emission from the sources.

· Closure and Relocation of Industrial Activities. About 1,397 industrial and mining
  enterprises have been relocated under the TGP. A number of highly polluting and high-
  energy consuming enterprises have been closed down so as to create a favorable
  environment for economic development in the Three Gorges Region. Enterprises
  causing environmental pollution and posing potential threat in the main urban area will
  be relocated. Since 2002, 66 enterprises have been relocated for the sake of
  environmental protection realizing the goal of "making the relocated enterprises larger,
  stronger, better, free of pollution and hidden security danger". Between 2005 and 2008,
  Chongqing invested RMB 7.407 billion in industrial pollution prevention and control
  and has completed pollution control project for more than 600 enterprises.

· Strengthening Enforcement. Enforcement of environmental laws and regulations has
  been strengthened to crack down on various illegal acts. Pollution sources damaging
  water quality in the Yangtze River, the Jialing River, and the Wujiang River have been
  spotted and treated. Special measures have been taken to deal with pollution in a variety
  of industries such as paper-making, zinc galvanizing, electrolytic manganese, and
  strontium carbonate so as to ensure that the enterprises meet emission standards.

· Control of Marine Pollution. Pollution treatment for ships in the TGP region has been
  introduced. All newly-built ships have been equipped with wastewater treatment
  equipment. Pollution treatment has been carried out to old ships. Transportation ships
  with more than 30 HP capacity have been equipped with Oil-Water Separation and Oil
  Wastewater Storage Devices. Integrated biochemical treatment devices have been
  equipped on more than 600 ships.

· Enhanced Monitoring Capability. Capacity for monitoring and supervision of pollution
  sources has been enhanced. Seven automatic water quality monitoring stations have
  been built on the Yangtze River, the Jialing River, and the Wujiang River. Through the
  implementation of Chongqing Water Environment Monitoring Capability Building
  Project under CUEP, a number of monitoring equipment and water environment
  instrument have been procured so that Chongqing Environment Monitoring Center
  could be upgraded from Grade Three to Grade Two in terms of monitoring capability.
  The task of "building a monitoring center for the ecological environment in the Three
  Gorges Region" initiated by SEPA has been undertaken in a timely manner, and aquatic
  organisms monitoring system has been put in place, and is in its preliminary stages.
  Online monitoring of major pollution sources has been established, and 176 industries,
  including 107 water polluting industries have connected to the online monitoring
  system, all of which are connected with the network of Chongqing Environmental
  Protection Bureau.

· Enhanced Preparedness for Environmental Emergencies. Environmental Security
  Inspection has been carried out in a vigorous way. An emergency plan for Major and
  Devastating Environmental Pollution and Ecological Disaster and Emergency plan for
  Emergent Environmental Pollution Incidents in the Three Gorges Area have been


                                            49
 formulated. Early warning system for environmental pollution emergency has been
 fortified and a response system for emergencies and a pool of experts has been formed,
 and the capacity for environmental emergency management has been upgraded.
 Enterprises have been encouraged to set up well-established environment security
 preparedness and relevant institutions. A command center to deal with environmental
 emergency, with 12369 Center as its basis, has been established and the contingency
 plans to deal with environmental emergencies have been improved.

· Environmental Information Dissemination. Information technology has been adopted to
  strengthen environmental supervision. An online monitoring center for pollution
  sources covering the whole city has been established. CM basic database for
  environmental protection and geological information system (GIS) have been set up
  with the help of technical platform such as GIS, GPS, Internet. These data have been
  sent to the information center of Chongqing Environmental Protection Bureau. A
  leading team of environmental monitoring in Chongqing also makes use of these
  monitoring and supervision equipment to conduct environmental management and
  supervision and punish those enterprises violating laws pertinent to environment with
  the help of environmental supervision data.

· Environmental Regulations. Improved environmental laws and legal guarantees for
  environmental protection have been introduced, including local regulations, e.g.,
  Chongqing Water Pollution Prevention and Treatment Regulation in the Three Gorges
  Reservoir Region, and Chongqing Pollution Control and Management Methods for
  Drinking Water Protection Area. The newly revised Chongqing Environmental
  Protection Regulation has made fresh breakthroughs in terms of solving the problems
  such as "high cost for the enterprises which violate the law, low cost for those which
  abide by the law."

At present, the overall quality of the water environment in the Yangtze and Jialing
Rivers, and the TGP region is satisfactory, and the water sources are of acceptable
quality.

  Annex 8. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on
                        Draft ICR
                   CHINA: Chongqing Urban Environment Project

Original Objective. The project development objective is described in the main text of
the Bank ICR and the PAD (20153-CHA) dated May 22, 2000, and is not restated here.

Revised Objective. There has been no significant change in the main Project objectives
during implementation. The loan savings project has almost the same project objectives
as that of the main Project.

Original Components. Original components are described in the main text of the Bank
ICR and the PAD.

Project Changes
None of the original components were deleted. However, eight additional subcomponents
were added to utilize loan savings arising from lower contract prices, and advance
contracting using counterpart funds. These works were crucial to local economic
development, and could not be delayed. These contracts were implemented in advance by
using the local counterpart funds.

Project Delays

The original closing date of the loan was December 31, 2006. As the components of loan
savings implemented in 2005, the World Bank agreed the extension of loan closing date
to December 31, 2007. In November 27, 2007, the Bank agreed an extension for one
more year, namely to December 31, 2008. At last, the Bank agreed in December 16, 2008
the final loan closing date to be extended to March 31, 2009.

Quality at Entry

Project preparation of the physical investments at appraisal has been proved largely
satisfactory, as: (i) each sub-project addressed the most serious environmental problem;
(ii) the components were consistent with the strategy of the State, Municipality and the
World Bank; (iii) institutional reform was included to strengthen policy guidance and
supervision, and provide support for institutional development and company's financial
management; (iv) it included implementation of Government's and World Bank's
environmental protection and resettlement policies; (v) the feasibility studies and
engineering design for each project component, as well as for the overall project, proved
to be appropriate; and (vi) the procurement plan, as appraised, proved to be executable.

To assure of quality of preparation, a number of international consultants were engaged
for project preparation:




                                            54
(a) COWI Consultants (Denmark) and Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) participated in
    alternatives comparison and optimization during the project preparation, water
    quality modelling of Yangtze River and Jialing River, respectively.
(b) Ausino Consulting Company (Australia) and CREOD (Canada) participated in
    project preparation in the early project stage, including the water quality modeling of
    Yangtze River and Jialing River, project optimization, and the study on the strategy
    for urban wastewater treatment, etc.
(c) SOGREAH Consultants (France) participated in design review services.
(d) ERM Consultants (United Kingdom) reviewed and updated the Chongqing solid
    waste management master plan and a five-year implementation plan.
(e) ITV Consultants (Switzerland) was involved in the preparation of the GIS
    component for system design etc.

Project preparation for the institutional strengthening component laid good foundations
for the project by requiring tariff increases in advance of appraisal and the
implementation of joint billing of water and wastewater charges.


Achievement of Objective and Outputs
Outcome / Achievement of Objectives

(a) Project outcomes achieved were: (i) improvement of ambient water quality in rivers
    at risk, in particular the Jialing River, through reduced pollution loads from urban
    wastewater, municipal solid waste and industrial discharges; (ii) reduction in risk of
    water pollution-related diseases as a result of improved water supply and wastewater
    systems and reduced surface water pollution near drinking water intakes; (iii)
    expanded coverage of water distribution, wastewater collection and disposal, and
    solid waste services for the urban population of the cities of Chongqing, Fuling,
    Wanzhou and the town of Nanbin; (iv) strengthened financial and management
    autonomy enabling utilities to sustain and expand the provision of essential urban
    services for a growing population; and (v) support for institutional development to
    strengthen the long-term sustainability of the organizations and of the physical
    investments.

(b) Solid waste management was improved through construction of a sanitary landfill site
    with a capacity of 1500 tons/d in Changshengqiao; upgrading the waste collection and
    transfer system, and purchase of 215 various waste containers and 217 transport
    vehicles. Because of an excellent operation and management, Changshengqiao
    landfill was assessed as the Level 1 Harmless Landfill Site in 2007 by State Ministry
    of Construction. In March 2000, Chongqing Municipality introduced domestic solid
    waste fees with a tariff of RMB 3 Yuan/month/household. In August 2004 the solid
    waste tariff was increased to RMB 8 Yuan/month/household. To date, RMB 141.47
    million of solid waste disposal fees were collected to support the Changshengqiao
    landfill operations.

(c) Wastewater management was improved through construction two wastewater
    treatment plants with capacity of 300,000m3/d and 600,000m3/d, and a wastewater


                                            55
   pre-treatment plant of 500,000m3/d in Chongqing, and a pretreatment plant of
   190,000m3/d in Fuling. The total length of new trunk and secondary pipelines was
   196.36 km. COD removal by Chongqing drainage system reached 179,300 tons since
   recording of data in 2006, and the daily average COD removal was increased from
   the 58 tons/d in 2006 to 158 tons/d in 2008. This has contributed significantly to
   protecting water quality in urban area, and made a significant contribution to the
   water security of Three Gorges Reservoir.

(d) Water supply treatment and distribution was increased with the construction of one
    new water intake of 100,000 m3/d capacity in Wanzhou. Using loan savings, two
    additional treatment plants of capacity 30,000 m3/d and 35,000 m3/d in Beibei and
    Bishan, respectively, and a total of 70.56 km of water transmission and distribution
    networks, which provided safe water supply to about 150,000 residents of this water-
    deficient area.

(e) With the implementation of five river rehabilitation components, 35.97 km of
    embankments were constructed new, and others reinforced. The flood protection
    standard of the embankment was increased to a 20 year return, making a significant
    improvement of surrounding environment and protecting local residents from flood
    disaster. This work created a good foundation for local sustainable economic
    development.

Output by Component

There were eight engineering components and one Technical Assistance and Training
component in the original project. Another eight components were added to the project to
use accumulated loan savings, making a total of 17 components. Outputs from the
original components were substantially completed by the original loan closing date, with
minor changes in the scope, except for the Wanzhou and Nanbin water treatment works
were financed outside the project. All additional works constructed utilizing loan savings
were also completed by the revised loan revised loan closing date of March 31, 2009. The
outputs are described in Annex 3: (Outputs by Component) of the Bank ICR.

Economic Benefits

The economic justification of the project was established using a cost effectiveness
approach rather than by a detailed quantitative evaluation of benefits. The Project has
undoubtedly contributed to the Governments' development objective of continuing and
sustainable economic growth, and helped facilitate the policy of rural to urban economic
migration.

Financial Performance

The financial viability of the Project wastewater components was assessed based on the
ability of the wastewater tariff to generate sufficient revenues for the project companies
to meet their principal financial targets. These targets were a cost recovery ratio of at
least 1.0 and debt service coverage of at least 1.3, set on the assumption that all
wastewater charges revenues would be transferred to the companies. This financial


                                             56
reform was on the way, and therefore all three companies are technically compliant with
the related loan covenants. However, the municipal government is providing adequate
financial resources to ensure the full operation of the new WWTPs.

Institutional Development Impact

Institutional development under the project focused on Chongqing Drainage Company
Ltd., Chongqing Municipal Solid Waste Management Co., Ltd., Fuling Drainage
Company, Shizhu Water Supply Company and Wanzhou Water Supply Company. The
Project aimed to make these five utility companies develop independent business
operations, control their finances, improve operational efficiency, and establish proper
internal management system, after a period of transition.

International consultants were engaged to provide assistance to the institutional reform and
development.The consultants provided various consulting services to IAs, mainly: (i)
project management support in procurement, training and reporting; (ii) support of
institutional capacity-building for financial and human resources management; (iii)
support for realizing financial sustainability; and (iv) support for assets operation and
maintenance.

The project has promoted institutional reform of these utility companies, resulting in
strengthening of financial management and improvement in operational efficiency. However, for
various reasons, these companies currently have only very limited financial or managerial
autonomy. They still have a long way to go to become a truly independent commercial companies
with business autonomy and financial sustainability.

Procurement

All procurement under the project was undertaken in accordance with World Bank
Procurement Guidelines. All bid documents were subject to review by consultants and
approval by the World Bank. Extensive use was made of the World Bank "prior review"
procedure which operated successfully. The contracts of consulting services were
procured through procedure of "Quality and Cost Based Selection" (QCBS).

Poverty Alleviation and Social Impact

The Project was implemented between 2001 and 2009, and provided significantly
opportunities for temporary jobs, and hundreds permanent jobs in the newly constructed
large wastewater treatment plants.

The implementation of river rehabilitation projects in counties has significantly improved
the living conditions of local residents. The price of land along the rivers has increased
substantially. Many real estate companies emerged, making use of the benefits from the
Project. Commercial pedestrian streets were constructed on the both sides of rivers,
which feature catering restaurants, entertainment, leisure and sightseeing, which provided
a large number of employment opportunities.




                                                57
Increase in flood prevention capability of the embankment substantially reduced the
losses from flooding. The health risk and spread of disease caused by the flooding have
been effectively controlled. The Project played an important role in protecting public
health. Residents living along the river no longer need to worry about their homes being
flooded during storm season. Personal security and social stability were strengthened,
promoting the social harmony and stability.

Wastewater was intercepted and discharged after centralized treatment. This has
improved local environment and living conditions, reduced the risk of health problems
caused by water contamination. As a facilitator of sustainable economic development, the
Project will have continuing beneficial poverty alleviation and social impacts.

Environmental Impact

No significant environmental management issues arose during project construction, and
the environmental management plans, prepared to mitigate potential adverse
environmental impacts resulting from the Project activity, were implemented. The
Project is set to achieve the beneficial impacts that were identified in the Environmental
Assessment of the PAD.

Land Acquisition and Resettlement

All land acquisition and resettlement of affected persons were successfully dealt with in
accordance with the resettlement plans approved by the Bank. Only minor land
acquisition and resettlement delays occurred in individual component, but this did result
in some contract extensions.


Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
Factors outside the Control of Local Government or Implementing Agency

(a) The exchange rate of US$ with RMB was 1:8.3 at the time of appraisal, but started
    to drop from July 2005 as the PRC government started to implement new exchange
    rate policies. By January 2006 the RMB to US$ exchange rate had fallen to 1:8.07
    and by June 2008 to 1:6.90. This significantly reduced the real value of World Bank
    loan and increased the level of local funding required as most contracts were
    denominated in Chinese RMB. The need for unanticipated supplementary financing
    created difficulties for the IAs and caused some payment delays to contractors on
    contracts signed in currencies other than US$.

(b) Due to lack of the experience in World Bank project procedures and competitive
    bidding processes, the design institutes spent considerable time and effort preparing
    technical specifications and related technical documents.

(c) Market price escalation on major construction materials (such as, steel etc.) during
    2007 and 2008 caused problems for construction progress on some additional works


                                             58
    financed with loan savings, which had been bid on a fixed price basis before the
    inflation. The IAs lacked the capability to forecast macroeconomic trends and plan
    accordingly. This is one of the reasons why the loan closing date had to be
    extended.

(d) Implementation was conducted following procedures of the World Bank and FIDIC
    conditions. According to the FIDIC three parties are involved (Employer, Engineer
    and Contractor); however, a fourth party (the Design Institutes) was acting under the
    direction of the Employer, which complicated implementation. The DIs dealt with
    technical issues without much concern for costs and schedules.

(e) There was a lack of knowledge and practice of the FIDIC conditions which are by
    far different from the "traditional" contract management in China. This led to a
    number of contractual problems while negotiating the variation orders, and as a
    result, a number of these variations were not been disbursed from the World Bank
    loan.

(f) The selection of the Contractor as the Bidder submitting the lowest bid evaluation
    price is questionable, as most people, including bid evaluation experts, considered it
    as lowest price. It caused a lot of problems for contract management and
    implementation. For small contracts, less than RMB 10 million in value, IAs had to
    take extra care to ensure that the Contractor who is awarded the contract is actually
    implementing the works, rather than unauthorized local subcontractors ­ practice
    which is going on but difficult to prove.

Factors Generally Subject to Local Government Control

(a) As the economy in some project districts/counties developed very quickly and some
    contracts, in the project components were crucial to local development and should be
    implemented in time, also due to the long period from project appraisal to project
    implementation, these contracts which were to be financed from the World Bank
    loan had to be implemented first by using the domestic counterpart funds This is one
    of the reasons resulting in the loan savings.

(b) Along with the higher attention to the environment issues in Three Gorges reservoir
    area, the central government made available large amounts of national bonds funds
    to Chongqing for water supply and wastewater projects since 1999, and the reform
    of enterprises was under implementation from that time on. Therefore, some
    contracts were cancelled from the World Bank loan, which contributed to the large
    loan savings.

(c) According to the Loan agreement, the Chongqing Municipal Government had agreed
    to adjust utility tariffs in a timely manner to recover the costs of utility services.
    Even though the utility tariffs were introduced, and adjusted step-by-step to the
    levels approaching break-even point, the utility entities still needed government
    financial support to maintain operations.



                                            59
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control

(a) Most of the engineering design were based on sound engineering information, and
    were satisfactory. However, upon request of IAs and/or local government to speed
    up project implementation, some of engineering designs were prepared without
    detailed geological exploration information resulting in unnecessary and preventable
    variations during construction and delays in construction.
(b) IAs did not have sufficient engineering information, especially geological
    exploration data, before commencing engineering designs, which could have
    reduced unnecessary and preventable variations during construction, and avoided
    delay in construction.
(c) Design and implementation problems arose because engineering design was under
    the authority of the Employer rather than the Engineer.

(d) Project physical and financial contingencies in the appraisal cost estimates were too
    small to accommodate contingencies that arose due to geological conditions.

(e) Land acquisition and resettlement of CUEP were generally satisfactory, however, in
    a few cases, the slow progress in land acquisition and resettlement process resulted
    in a delay in project implementation.

(f) The use of government unit rate schedules resulted in high appraisal cost estimates
    in comparison to actual award prices, which also caused loan savings.

(g) The capacity and efficiency of PIAs to manage the subprojects was variable, which
    caused difficulties for the CPMO and PIAs to coordinate and communicate with the
    relevant agencies in a large and comprehensive project such as the CUEP. In
    addition, due to the long time period of implementation, project management teams
    and key personnel changed from time to time, causing difficulties in implementation.

Costs and Financing

Costs. Total project cost at the appraisal was US$ 535.90 million or RMB 4,447.97
million with a US$ to RMB exchange rate of 8.3, and US$ 506.80 million or RMB
4,206.9 million, excluding front-end fee and interest during construction.

The completion cost of CUEP including the additional works was RMB 3783.67 million,
comprising RMB 2901.01 million for the original components, RMB 640.06 million for
the additional works, RMB 161.85 million interest during construction, RMB 64.16
million commitment fees, and RMB 16.60 million of front-end fee. The total completion
cost of the Project accounts for 85.07 % of the estimated project cost at appraisal. If only
the main project being taken into consideration, the completion cost of the main project
(RMB 2901.01 million) only accounts for 65.22% of the estimated project cost at
appraisal. That was the main reason for including the additional works to use loan
savings.



                                             60
Financing. The necessary counterpart funds were provided through a mixture of state
bonds, the resources of the municipal governments and implementing agencies. The final
financing split was 37.4 % of World Bank Loan to 62.6 % of local funding, compared
with the 36.28 % of WB Loan to 63.72 % of local funding estimated at the appraisal.

Sustainability
Prospects for Sustainability. Overall, the Project is sustainable, even though there would
be some problems during the transition period, such as pricing of water supply and
wastewater treatment, and the collection, and transfer and use of tariff for wastewater
treatment. The sustainability of the Project needs to be viewed in terms of (a) whether an
appropriate institutional arrangement has been set up to provide for managerial autonomy
and sustainability; (b) the ability to operate and maintain the facilities; and (c) financial
sustainability. In our view the overall Project can be considered sustainable against these
criteria. The new WWTPs are being well operated and maintained, and municipal
government is providing sufficient budget to ensure these operations are fully financed.
However, current tariffs are not completely at a level that provides for financial
sustainability. The tariffs need to be gradually increased to a reasonable level while the
government subsidies for enterprises decreasing to maintain the financial sustainability of
utility companies.

Transition Arrangements to Regular Operations

The two municipal wastewater treatment plants have had a smooth trouble-free transition
to normal operations, with both the treatment capacity and effluent quality achieving
design requirements. Chongqing Drainage Company recruited experienced staff to
operate the newly built wastewater treatment facilities as the key operators. They were
provided additional training before deployment. Currently the WWTPs are under normal
operation, and achieve the State Discharge Standard Class One Category B. The
wastewater treatment ratio is above 95%, 100% of sewers are in good condition, 100% of
sewers are in free flowing state and 98% of equipment is well maintained. The target of
"Safe production and normal operation" was met.

Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank

The World Bank's performance during the phases of identification, preparation, appraisal
and implementation for the project is considered to be satisfactory. The diligence of
World Bank managers and staff was appreciated by all the implementing agencies. The
work of the World Bank Beijing Office was highly appreciated in terms of timely
instructions to CUEP on World Bank procedures, review, comments, and approval of bid
documents.

The project had four Task Managers from the World Bank, and all of them made valuable
contributions to the successful implementation of the project. However, the change in the




                                             61
Task Managers was a little too frequent, resulting in delayed actions from the Bank side
during implementation.

Borrower

(a) The national and municipal government's commitment to the project remained strong
and supportive during all phases of the project. The CPMO, City PMOs and PIAs
provided active management functions throughout the project. Each subproject entity
designated necessary resources to execute the subproject.

(b) The Government has assisted all the subproject entities to mobilize sufficient
counterpart funding, such as state bonds.

(c) Municipal governments in the project region have given the utmost support for
construction at all the subproject sites. Most of the construction sites have required
strong coordination for laying of pipelines in the busy city streets. Government support
was necessary for the successful implementation of the project-related land acquisition
and resettlement.

(d) Chongqing Municipal Government made great efforts towards initiating and adjusting
the wastewater tariffs. Rapid tariff increases have notable impacts on social and
economic situations; hence the Government will adjust tariffs gradually in a phased
manner.


Lessons Learned
Highlights and Lessons of the CUEP Project

The CUEP Project, which was been implemented over 9 years, made important
contributions to the acceleration of the urbanization process of Chongqing City, after it
became a municipality directly under the Central Government. The contribution not only
lies in the improvement in respect of urban infrastructure, but also in the promotion of the
institutional reform and enhancement of knowledge and skills concerned, the impact of
which was much more important and far-reaching.

(i) Advancing Institutional Reform of the Municipal Public Utility Industries

Prior to 2000, water supply, storm water drainage, and environmental sanitation were
provided by institutions attached to the Municipal Public Utility Bureau. User charges for
water supply, wastewater and solid waste services were much below actual costs, and
finances for O&M came from government budgets. A direct result of this arrangement
was that long-term investment funds were insufficient. Another consequence was low
efficiency in resource allocation, service operation and management. Since the
commencement CUEP, many policies and requirements of the World Bank have
contributed a great deal to promote institutional reform.



                                             62
In order to obtain financial support from the World Bank, Chongqing Municipal
Government agreed to detach environmental sanitation and storm water drainage from
government departments to the Water Drainage Group and Environment Sanitation
Group, which were both independently run SOEs, with the State-owned Assets
Supervision and Administration Commission performing the functions of the investor and
the Municipal Administration Commission serving as the supervision institution. In 2002,
Chongqing Municipal Government introduced the private sector into the water supply
service in the northern part of the main urban area, which was the first instance of
licensing private operators into the water supply business. Subsequently, CMG also
encouraged the Public-Private Participations (PPP's) in other public utilities sectors,
including solid waste treatment, wastewater treatment and medical waste treatment.
Though the establishment of the Chongqing Water Group by combining the water supply
and drainage businesses seemed uneventful, it in fact introduced market orientation to a
degree, because it also recognized market principles of financing, setting user charges,
resources integration, performance-oriented efficiencies, cost reductions, etc. By the end
of the project in 2008, the charges for sewage and solid waste treatment in Chongqing
had risen from zero to RMB 1.00/m3 and RMB 3/household to RMB 8/household,
respectively.

The CUEP also: deeply influenced the thinking, notion and behavioral patterns of three
stakeholders of the public services: gradually changed the public service providers into
market players who were able to make independent investment decisions and obtain
interest from commercial partners by improving the quality and efficiency of services;
raising awareness that the public has to pay a price for their use of resources and
generation of pollution, which functions as a pressure point on service providers to
improve the quality of services; changed the role of the government from a public service
provider into a regulator to pay more attention to quality, efficiency, and equity of public
services provision. The Bank-financed CSCP and the proposed CURIP are the logical
steps to reduce inequality in access to basic public services between rural and urban areas
in Municipality.

(ii) Knowledge Transfer and Skills Improvement

(a) Conservation and Protection of Cultural Heritage. The Bank organized consulting
    services for Huguang Huiguan conservation and protection was a fine example of
    skills transfer. Through active support and coordination, the World Bank obtained
    funds from the Italian Trust Fund for Cultural Heritage to provide expert professional
    services during 2000 to 2004, for the renovation and development of Huguang
    Huiguan. The support was provided by A. R. S. Progetti consultants, who assisted in
    the review and guidance for economic and financial assessment reports, land use
    planning proposals, protection and conservation, functional zoning, economic goals,
    tourism development plans and management of the center, etc. Even though loan
    proceeds were not used for physical works, Chongqing undoubtedly learned a great
    deal from the insight of these international experts. The international experts provided
    solid guidance on the basic international principles for cultural relics renovation, such
    as originality, reversibility, recognizability and sustainability, and patiently
    communicated with the Chinese experts to find feasible solutions. In the end, the


                                             63
   international and Chinese experts agreed a new plan, and even made considerable
   changes to the renovation that was under construction. Additionally, the views of
   Chinese experts differed from the internationally accepted concepts in respect of the
   protection and renovation of historic streets. After considering several opinions of A.
   R. S. Progetti experts, the dismantling and reconstruction plan of Dongshuimen Street
   was modified and rearranged. There were many more examples of such interventions
   that proved highly appropriate. In recognition of the efforts and contributions made in
   the Huguang Huiguan project, Chongqing City granted the Three Gorges Friendship
   Award for Foreign Experts 2004 to Dr. Barucco who was a key member of the
   international consultant team.

(b) Wastewater Infrastructure Planning in Chognqing City. Both domestic and foreign
    experts had serious reservations on the planned of distribution of 21 sewage treatment
    plants in the main city. Starting in 1997, the Chongqing PMO, the World Bank, and
    many other consulting companies considered several alternatives for rationalizing
    wastewater planning. These were analyzed in detail and narrowed down to a seven-
    treatment plant option for the planning horizon. This plan was finally adopted, and
    represented the minimum expense and environment impact were both minimum
    through the full operation period. The key to the economic comparison was that it not
    only considered direct investment and operating expenses of each plan, but also
    calculated their respective indirect costs, operating expenses, and the opportunity cost
    of the land they occupied. This was a major shift, as traditional urban planning of
    Chinese cities paid more attention to technical feasibility study rather than the
    analysis of economic efficiency. This approach to infrastructure investment planning
    was led and implemented by the World Bank, was a typical case in which economic
    assessment was conducted on the technical plans.

(c) Water Pricing Policy Research. At the start of the CUEP Project, Chongqing City
    confronted considerable pressures for raising funds; it recognized that properly
    organized institutions were necessary to attract investors who expected reasonable
    returns on their investments. Therefore, the CMG entrusted the Municipal
    Development Planning Commission and PMO to organize experts to undertake
    thematic research on water pricing policies. On the basis of this research, the
    Chongqing Municipal Government formulated a water price adjustment in 2001,
    when the drinking water price in the main urban area in Municipality was increased
    from RMB 1.2 /m3 to RMB 2.0/m3. Traditionally, when issuing public policy or law,
    the Chinese government considered more qualitative analysis than quantitative
    analysis on the policy returns and costs. However, the water price policy research of
    Chongqing made an important change giving greater weight to quantitative analysis.
    The research was cited by the World Bank on several occasions, and the former
    Ministry of Construction recognized as a unique case that had great significance on
    improving constitutional governance in China.

(d) Public Private Partnership in Infrastructure Service Provision. Chongqing benefited
    from two tranches of support from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
    (PPIAF), for study and research on the participation of the private sector in the
    municipal public utilities. The first phase research recommended three plans for


                                             64
   public private participation. Although the proposed plans were not fully adopted by
   Chongqing in the subsequent practice of ushering the private sector in the public
   utility industries, many analytical approaches of the research were adopted for the
   Tangjiatuo sewage treatment plant project (TOT), Tongxing garbage incineration
   power plant project (BOT) and Tongxing medical waste incineration plant project
   (BOT). The second phase research focused on the improvement of the policy and
   regulatory environment for the private sector to participate in the public utility sector
   in Chongqing. The research report pointed out that in the long run, the state-owned
   municipal public service providers could be divested of government ownership, and
   become independent market players in the real sense. Furthermore, it was also
   recognized that the functions of the government as the investor, policy maker and
   regulator should be separated, and the same policies should be applicable to both the
   state-owned enterprises and the participating private enterprises.

Conclusion. It is strongly recommended that the World Bank considers knowledge
transfer as an important component when planning future projects, such as CURIP, in
order to further facilitate reform and urbanization.

(iii) Problems and Proposals for Consideration by the World Bank

(a) The decrease of actual usable loan funds due to fluctuation of the US Dollar exchange
    rate that fell from 8.3:1 to 6.9:1, creating the need for additional counterpart funds,
    which presented serious problems for the small towns that included additional works
    from loan savings.

(b) The lengthy review and approval procedures of the World Bank are not suitable to
    deal with the rapid development of local economy. The large amount of strict and
    rigid procedures of the Bank is not sufficiently responsive to the changes in actual
    situations, which are even more conspicuous in the fast developing Chinese economy.
    Sometimes the local governments are faced with unprecedented pressures from both
    the central government and the public, and are consequently forced to resort to the
    domestic funds to implement some contracts that otherwise could use the World Bank
    loans. Therefore, it is proposed that the World Bank organize a thematic study on the
    reality of China's economic development, and the needs of local Chinese
    governments to review its examination and approval procedures and seek space for
    procedural improvement.

(c) The third problem is impracticalness and rigidity of some World Bank requirements
    or provisions. The World Bank set some conditions for the loan-receiving projects,
    such as the municipal public utility enterprises must be run independently, and the
    local government must raise the charges for sewage and solid waste treatment
    services so as to ensure financial sustainability of the projects, etc. Over the last
    decade after the real reform started, many municipal public services were actually
    still provided directly by the government. Besides, raising the service prices all at
    once to the level that enables the cost of services to be fully recuperated may deal a
    blow on the real economy. Therefore, the central and local government must be very
    careful in reform. It is proposed that the World Bank give sustained attention and


                                             65
   support to the reform of China, but in setting the reform goals of a particular project,
   it shall take a gradual approach and never attempt to address or solve all the problems
   at one blow.

(d) Fourthly, the riverside environment treatment project of Wulong County and the
    sewage management of the main city are very good contrasting cases, for the former
    encounters problems resulting from inadequate preliminary design while the latter
    obtains very good returns from good preliminary planning and assessment. It is
    proposed that the World Bank put more resources such as technical assistance into the
    preliminary stage of its projects in China that pertains to the goal of urban-rural
    integration in order to help the local governments optimize their projects.

(e) The last but not the least, there is inconsistency between the World Bank purchasing
    procedure and the national conditions of China. To our knowledge, bidding by
    "attaching" oneself to another entity is a common problem of the World Bank
    projects in China. Attaching means that an otherwise unqualified bidder bids for and
    obtain the contract of a construction project in the name of a qualified large-sized
    construction company (usually the former one is a unit of the latter). Another typical
    case is some contactors maliciously bid low price to obtain the engineering contract.
    Since these two types of bidders are not able to meet technical qualifications, there is
    a large amount of construction delay and design modifications.

The PMO does not have the flexibility to deal with or assist local governments that face
great pressure from various parties. In the end, the World Bank refuses to reimburse
expenditures, the local governments have to raise funds on their own to ensure timely
completion. However, it is hard for some state-level poverty county, such as above-
mentioned Wulong, to find domestic fund. In addition, when consulting the procurement
officers of the World Bank regarding whether it is allowed to raise the amount of
performance security in the event of an imbalanced quotation, and under what
circumstances could we disqualify a bidder out of a serious case of imbalanced quotation,
different World Bank officers reply with different answers.

In fact, the procurement procedures of the World Bank are not always applicable to
Chinese economy, whose conditions differ still greatly from those of an ideal market
environment. Therefore, it is proposed that the World Bank conduct an in-depth study
together with the Chinese government to improve actual purchasing practices and
realizing real fairness in the purchasing process. For example, it is proposed that judging
bidding behaviors on the basis of the 3-year average price and recognizing a variation of
20% or over from the average price as a maliciously low price or imbalanced quotation. It
is also proposed that demanding an amount of special performance security, but pay
double amount of interest for the special performance security after the bid winner fully
performs the contract.
