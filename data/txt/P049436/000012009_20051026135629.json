Project components include wastewater management\n            and municipal solid waste management; urban water supply;\n            water quality monitoring and management; and institutional\n            strengthening. Surface water may be polluted as a result of\n            leachate discharge at the landfill site. This will be\n            mitigated by minimizing the area exposed to air. Wastewater\n            produced by construction will be collected and performed\n            sedimentation on it before discharge. Air pollution produced\n            by gas and dust at the landfill site will be mitigated by\n            planting trees to isolate the site. Noise during\n            construction will be mitigated by logically arranging\n            construction time and selecting low noise equipment.\n            Destruction of vegetation during construction will be\n            mitigated by planting trees and preventing water and soil\n            runoff. The risk of altering traditional soil usage will be\n            reduced by reserving the upper layer of the landfill site.\n            Using refuse and sludge generated from the sewage plant as\n            fertilizer will be considered after an analysis of the\n            sludge composition. By arranging pipe projects into\n            subsections during construction, the risk of large scale\n            soil runoff from the discarded soil will be avoided."}, "docdt": "2004-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
