Some lessons\n            learned included: Under current practice, the employer has\n            no recourse for negligence by service providers. Chongqing\n            Drainage Company (CDC) incurred additional costs that can be\n            rightfully assigned to weak designs, investigations, and\n            construction supervision in the implementation of the\n            drainage component. Similarly, the solid waste company\n            incurred additional costs due to inaccurate geotechnical\n            investigations for the landfill that were done by a\n            specialized design institute. There is no mechanism or\n            regulations for the clients to seek any form of compensation\n            for professional negligence by the service providers. It may\n            be opportune for the Government to consider introduction\n            professional liability requirements along with clear\n            accountability and professional insurance from domestic\n            service providers. The emerging Chinese institutional model\n            for the water sector comprises a holding company owning all\n            wastewater and water supply assets, and providing a\n            treatment fee to the wastewater company as a service\n            provider; hence the traditional covenants cannot be applied\n            as the company has no revenues other than the treatment fee,\n            and at times, no assets. The model has also been adopted in\n            Beijing, Foshan, and Liaoning Province. The traditional\n            wastewater utility institutional model used by the Bank;\n            needs to be reviewed and modified in future projects in the\n            light of this development. The financial performance\n            covenants would have little relevance if this issue is not addressed."}, "docdt": "2010-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
