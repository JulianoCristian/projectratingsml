located\n            at El Dikheila (15 km west of Alexandria), will help meet\n            the needs of the domestic market for a stable supply of\n            rebar, a vital input for the construction industry, at\n            internationally competitive prices. It will substitute for\n            annual imports of around 750,000 tons of product, thus\n            saving valuable foreign exchange. By means of the project,\n            new technology and associated managerial/operational\n            know-how will be introduced into the sector, and through a\n            sector program the Government will formulate and execute\n            necessary policies to promote the continued efficient\n            development of the steel industry in Egypt. The project\n            comprises the construction and operation of an integrated\n            reinforcing bar plant and includes: (i) a natural gas-based\n            direct reduction plant; (ii) a steelmaking plant consisting\n            of four electric arc furnaces and three continuous billet\n            casters; (iii) a rolling mill plant comprising two rolling\n            mills and a common roll shop; and (iv) auxiliary and\n            administrative facilities, residential units and social infrastructure."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
