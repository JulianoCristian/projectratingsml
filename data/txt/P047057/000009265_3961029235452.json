"abstracts": {"cdata!": "The Rehabilitation Loan Project's\n            objective is to support the initial phase of the\n            government's new stabilization and reform program. The\n            program aims to stabilize the economy and promote the\n            development of the private sector by reducing fiscal\n            deficits, increasing administered prices, controlling credit\n            growth, privatizing, liquidating and restructuring state\n            enterprises and banking sector reform. The initial phase of\n            the loan supported program will have three inter-related\n            effects: a) removal of the adverse social consequences from\n            increased unemployment; b) reduction of the current\n            pressures on banks by politically powerful value-subtracting\n            state economic enterprises to finance their losses; and c)\n            it will allow the banking system, once rehabilitated, to\n            cater to the needs of the emergent private sector. The\n            financing provided by this loan will thus directly\n            facilitate the government's ability to mitigate the\n            social cost of the reform program. The loan will help\n            finance the initial cost of the program, which will entail\n            additional social safety net expenditures. The loan will be\n            disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness based on\n            the measures already taken by the government."}, "docdt": "1996-07-15T00:00:00Z"}
