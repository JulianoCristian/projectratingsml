                         The government has made significant progress in implementing the program supported by this development policy loan, which triggered the release of the second and last tranche of
                         the operations. Overall, the project has made good progress towards achieving its objectives and target outcomes. However, in some cases, the effects of the global financial crisis
                         limited potential gains. Almost all expected outcomes are on track for reaching its targeted values by the end of FY2011. The main exception is tax collection to GDP whose
                         performance has been affected by the recession in 2009 and slow economic recovery in 2010.
