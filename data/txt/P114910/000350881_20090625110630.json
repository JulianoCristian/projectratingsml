objectives of the Public Finance and\n            Social Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project are to:\n            (i) help El Salvador strengthen medium-tern fiscal\n            sustainability; (ii) support good governance and\n            transparency in the use of public resources; and (iii)\n            maintain steady improvements in social protection and\n            education. The current administration, in office since June\n            2004, has made good progress in moving forward its reform\n            agenda, but emerging challenges associated with present\n            global economic conditions compounded by the debt profile\n            could threaten gains or hinder continued progress. The\n            government's program for the period 2004-2009 was built\n            on three main pillars: (i) accelerating broad-based,\n            equitable economic growth and increase employment; (ii)\n            improving equity through building human capital and\n            expanding access to socioeconomic infrastructure, assets and\n            markets; and (iii) enhancing security and reducing\n            vulnerability. As a result of good performance, and despite\n            a difficult political situation, progress has been made in\n            each of these priority areas, with development targets being\n            exceeded in many instances. In the medium-term, however, the\n            country faces pressures on the fiscal front particularly in\n            2011 as a result of the unfavorable debt profile that year,\n            in turn affecting the country's ability to make\n            continued steady socio-economic progress in the medium-term."}, "docdt": "2008-12-10T00:00:00Z"}
