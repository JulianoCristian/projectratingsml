(DLP) Project for El Salvador. Conditions for\n            tranche release are specified in section two C of schedule\n            one of the loan agreement. The following report presents the\n            actions taken by the Government to meet the specific\n            conditions for release of the second tranche. On the basis\n            of full completion of five of the seven conditions and\n            partial completion with evidence of significant progress of\n            the partially waived conditions, this memorandum recommends\n            that the second tranche be released. The DPL was designed to\n            assist the government in addressing fiscal and public\n            finance management related issues and support continued\n            institutional and social sector reforms. The main objectives\n            of this operation were to: (i) help El Salvador strengthen\n            medium-term fiscal sustainability; (ii) support good\n            governance and transparency in the use of public resources;\n            and (iii) maintain steady improvements in social protection\n            and education. In order to achieve these objectives, the\n            public finance and social sector DPL supports actions aimed\n            at: (i) expanding fiscal space for priority spending and\n            improve targeting of public spending; (ii) improving public\n            expenditure management and fiscal transparency; and (iii)\n            expanding social protection programs, enhancing the quality\n            of primary education and expanding access to secondary education."}, "docdt": "2010-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
