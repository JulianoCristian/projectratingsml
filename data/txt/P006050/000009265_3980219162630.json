capacity of the Natural Resources and\n            Sustainable Development Secretariat (SRNyDS) to pilot,\n            demonstrate and coordinate the mainstreaming of innovative\n            pollution management instruments, through technical\n            assistance and selected investment activities to address\n            priority pollution problems; and b) for the SRNyDS to\n            internalize the lessons learned from the pilots and\n            strengthen its capacity to replicate the positive results.\n            The four main components consist of three pilot and one\n            national:  a) public-private partnerships for pollution\n            management - strengthening of SRNyDS's role in\n            pollution management, environmental management systems, and\n            ecoefficient practices and certification programs for\n            industry; b) Campana-Zarate integrated management of\n            environmental quality - technical assistance for municipal\n            environmental management, integrated pollution management\n            for a local river basin, and support for industry led\n            initiatives in pollution management; c) Gran Buenos Aires\n            (GBA) air quality and noise management - air quality and\n            noise monitoring network, motor vehicle emission laboratory\n            and certification center, GBA air quality management plan,\n            and strengthening of vehicle inspection and maintenance\n            program; and d) municipal and regional pollution management\n            - Puerto Madryn
