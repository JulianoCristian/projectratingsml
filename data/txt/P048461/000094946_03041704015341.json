The lessons learned indicate that a complex\n            adjustment project in terms of sector coverage and country\n            conditions can be successful despite a marginal quality at\n            entry assessment if the government commitment remains high\n            and is demonstrated through key policy actions. Supervision\n            of the project is flexible in terms of responsiveness to the\n            borrower's changing situation and intensive in terms of\n            monitoring and adherence to priority conditions. For initial\n            adjustment credits in private sector development, it is best\n            to set conditions for the first tranche release that do not\n            involve major actions that are likely to be controversial\n            delaying the start of the project. Establish a viable\n            implementation timeline for privatization adjustment\n            operations. Recognize the advantages of strategic\n            privatization and need for expert privatization assistance\n            early in the project preparation."}, "docdt": "2003-03-27T00:00:00Z"}
