Protection Project\n            supports the third phase of TRABAJAR (TRABAJAR III), a\n            social safety net program which through financing for small\n            infrastructure projects, provides employment to poor workers\n            and improves the living standards in poor communities. This\n            series of projects shares the objective of supporting\n            improvements in the TRABAJAR program, particularly in the\n            areas of targeting, quality of sub-projects, and\n            evaluation--aspects which have wide applicability to other\n            social programs in Argentina. There are 3 components. The\n            first consists of TRABAJAR sub-projects, which will be\n            presented by municipal and provincial governments, private\n            groups, and national organizations. The menu of projects\n            eligible for financing by TRABAJAR III includes minor\n            construction, repair, expansion, or remodeling for schools,\n            health facilities, basic sanitation facilities, small roads\n            and bridges, culverts and canals, community kitchens and\n            centers, tourist centers, low-cost housing, and community\n            services. The second component consists of project\n            management and supervision costs. The third component\n            evaluates and monitors the TRABAJAR program as well as other\n            employment programs operated by MTSS (Ministry of Employment\n            and Social Security)."}, "docdt": "1998-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
