particular. MHS objectives are to be\n            achieved through an increase in health coverage of the\n            population from the present 40 percent level to 60 percent\n            by the turn of the century, with better quality of services\n            provided. The project supports the same objectives as the\n            MHS, addressing urban/rural inequities, improvement of staff\n            training and institutional development. The project will\n            address the following areas: 1) resumption of and\n            improvement in the quality of health services provided; 2)\n            promotion and improvement of sector institutions, support\n            services and sub-national health management systems; and 3)\n            development of human resources capacity."}, "docdt": "1995-11-07T00:00:00Z"}
